In this paper, we propose a spheriform quantization method based on sub-region inherent dimension, which induces the quantified interval number and size in data-driven way. The method assumes that a quantified cluster of points can be contained in a lower intrinsic m-dimensional spheriform space of expected radius. These sample points in the spheriform can be obtained by adaptively selecting the neighborhood at initial observation based on sub-region inherent dimension. Experimental results and analysis on UCI real data sets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the accuracy of classification than traditional quantization methods by implementing C4.5 decision tree.

Anomaly detection is one such technique to detect abnormalities in many different domains including computer network intrusion, gene expression analysis, financial fraud detection and many more. In this paper, we develop a framework to discover interesting traffic flows, which seem legitimate but are targeted to disrupt normal computing environment, such as Denial of Service attack. We propose a framework for collective anomaly detection using x-means clustering, which is a variant of basic k-means algorithm. We validate our approach by comparing against existing techniques and benchmark performance. Our experimental results are based on widely accepted DARPA dataset for intrusion detection from MIT Lincoln Laboratory.

Summarization is such an important data analysis technique which can be broadly classified into two categories as semantic and syntactic methods. Syntactic methods consider a dataset as a sequence of bytes whereas semantic methods convert large dataset into a much smaller one yet maintaining low information loss. Clustering algorithms are widely used for semantic summarization such as basic k-means. Existing clustering based summarization techniques assume that a summary is represented using the cluster centroids. However, the centroids might not represent the actual data points in summary. In addition, many clustering algorithms, such as the most popular k-means algorithm requires the number of clusters as an input, which is not available for unsupervised summarization of unlabeled data. To address these issues, we propose a clustering based semantic sumtnarization using a combination of x-means and k-nzedoid clustering algorithms. Our experimental analysis shows that, the proposed algorithm outperforms k-means based summarization techniques.

For example, anticipated detection of company bankruptcy, for sure, will help both the investor interested in the company as their managers. The challenge of exploring the huge amount of data to consider in such analysis can benefit from adequate data mining tools. A comparative analysis of classification algorithms for this kind of application is presented in order to find a better predictive performance. The experiments were performed on data from publicly traded companies registered in the Sao Paulo Securities, Commodities and Futures Exchange (Bovespa) that appeared at least twice from 1996 to 2010. Moreover, some experiments were carried out with the set of candidate attributes, in this case financial ratios and ledger accounts that could better explain the target variable. The better results were found with a committee of classifiers using both financial ratios and ledger accounts, although, the ledger accounts alone presented a higher prediction power than financial ratios.

It is as basic as density estimation which has been the fundamental for most data modeling methods for a wide range of tasks such as classification, clustering and anomaly detection. This paper reviews the theoretical basis of Mass Estimation that can be employed to solve various tasks in data mining and different ways to estimates the mass of data points in different dimensions. The paper also talks about applications of mass estimation in various data mining tasks and their comparison with previously used density estimation technique. The paper reviews the Mass Estimation technique in detail and will be helpful to researchers working in this area, which is relatively new.

This form of data mining has to be distinguished from market basket analysis where the data comes from a single relational table. Although ILP addresses the problem of dealing with data from multiple relational tables, the fact remains that the efficiency of inferring rules in first order logic is significantly less than that of many-sorted logic. Further, many sorted logic is a closer reflection of the real world of objects that belong to sorts, in the presence of a sort hierarchy. We propose a new approach to ILP using many-sorted logic that is more computationally efficient than the approach based on unsorted first order logic.

There exist a trade-off between productivity in advertising and invasion of user's privacy in the existing approaches. Due to these privacy concerns, there were many law suits filed against the Beacon[1] advertising model used by Facebook resulting in its discontinuation. The new approaches need to address targeted audience while preserving the privacy in order to build appropriate revenue model for their operations. In this paper we propose an innovative model that leverage the trade-off. The model effectively interacts with user's linked data present in the web structured format, retrieve it and integrate data from marketing partners. Then it broadcasts the advertisement in social graph with flexible sentences For targeted advertising and privacy our model maintains interaction records among users in virtual containers for finding tie-strength[2] and also active friends 1 by Association Rules Mining [ARM] algorithm. We applied and validated our approach using a real data set obtained from 506 active social media users.

Various data stream models are being used for mining frequent itemsets. In a data stream model the data arrive at high speed such that the algorithms used for mining data streams must process them in strict constraint of time and space. Due to emphasis over recent data and its bounded memory requirement, sliding window model is a widely used model for mining frequent itemset over data stream. In this paper we proposed an algorithm named Variable-Moment for mining both frequent and closed frequent itemset over data stream. The algorithm is appropriate for noticing latest or new changes in the set of frequent itemset by making its window size variable, which is determined dynamically based on the extent of concept drift occurring within the arriving data stream. The size of window expands when there is no concept drift in the arriving data stream and size shrinks when there is a concept change. The relative support instead of absolute support is being used for making the concept of variable window effective. The algorithm uses an in-memory data structure to store frequent itemsets. Data structure gets updated whenever a batch of transaction is added or deleted from the sliding window to output exact frequent itemsets. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic data show that our algorithm excellently spots the concept changes and adapts itself to the new concept along data stream by adjusting window size.

Systematic study of the recorded information in process centric manner will help to understand the process in a better way. Process mining acts as enabling technology by facilitating process centric analysis of data, which other available data science like data mining etc. fails to provide. Process mining algorithms are able to provide excellent insights on the process which they analyze, but they fail to handle the change in the process. Concept drift is a phenomenon of change in the process while it is being analyzed and it is a non-stationary learning problem. As the process changes while it is being analyzed, end result of the analysis becomes obsolete. Process mining algorithms are static biased, they assume that process at the beginning of analysis period will remain as same at the end of analysis period. There is at most requirement to effectively deal with the change in process to conduct optimal analysis. The main focus of this paper is to identify different factors to be considered while designing the solution for the problem of concept drift and explain each of the identified factors briefly. As the phenomenon of concept drift is extensively under consideration for research in other scientific research disciplines, this article considers restricting the content strictly concerning to the context of process mining.

Previous methods for mining closed intervals assume that the dataset is available at the starting of the process, whereas in practice, the data in the dataset may change over time. This paper describes an algorithm, which provides efficient method for mining closed intervals by using a data-structure called CI-Tree (Closed Interval Tree) in dynamically changing datasets. If a new interval is added in the dataset the algorithm modifies the CI-Tree without looking at the dataset. The proposed method is tested with various real life and synthetic datasets.

These data streams are potentially huge in size and thus it is impossible to process many data mining techniques and approaches. Classification techniques fail to successfully process data streams because of two factors: their overwhelming volume and their distinctive feature known as concept drift. Concept drift is a term used to describe changes in the learned structure that occur over time. The occurance of concept drift leads to a drastic drop in classification accuracy. The recognition of concept drift in data streams has led to sliding-window approaches also different approaches to mining data streams with concept drift include instance selection methods, drift detection, ensemble classifiers, option trees and using Hoeffding boundaries to estimate classifier performance. This paper describes the various types of concept drifts that affect the data examples and discusses various approaches inorder to handle concept drift scenarios. The aim of this paper is to review and compare single classifier and ensemble approaches to data stream mining respectively.

Data was gathered from three student cohorts in the academic years 2010 through 2012. Students within the cohorts were sampled from a range of academic disciplines (n = 1074), and were diverse in their academic backgrounds and abilities. Metrics used included data that are typically available to colleges such as age, gender and prior academic performance. The study also considered psychometric indicators that can be assessed in the early stages after enrolment, specifically, personality, motivation and learning strategies. Six classification algorithms were considered. Model accuracy was assessed using cross validation and was compared to outcomes when models were applied to a subsequent academic year. It was found that mature students were more complex to model than younger students. Furthermore, 10-fold cross validation accurately estimated model performance when modeling younger students only, but over-estimated model accuracy when modeling mature students.

One of the important steps to building any geodemographic system is identifying the variables that will produce meaningful and application-relevant clusters. Unfortunately many of the commonly used methodologies for feature selection cannot be used on the census data and so were not available for clustering tasks. This resulted in a more objective-focused approach being taken when choosing variables. This paper outlines the reasons more commonly-used feature selection techniques could not be used, and then explains the alternative approaches and methodologies that were used to select variables to help build an Irish geodemographic model.

Hard disk and server failures are not frequent but are often very costly. Such failures can have a very adverse effect on the business of an organization. The ability to accurately predict an impending disk or server failure can add an essential functionality for designing a reliable, fault tolerant and continuously available storage system. This paper explains a novel approach to predict hardware failures using spectrum-kernel Parallel Support Vector Machine (Parallel SVM) method by analyzing the system events logged in the system log files. These log files not only records the events processed by the system but it also holds the messages as the system state changes. A single message in the system log file is insufficient for any prediction and such prediction is bound to be less accurate. The approach introduced in the paper uses a sequence or pattern of messages from the system log file using a Sliding Window of messages with window size of 5 message sequence to predict the likelihood of a failure. These Sliding Windows of message sequences acts as inputs to the Parallel SVM. The Parallel SVM further tags the messages to a failure or non-failure system. Data Mining techniques are used in extracting useful information from the raw dataset. A solutioning model is developed using the structured dataset and Machine Learning algorithms. This environment when implemented using actual system logs from Linux-based storage system have shown to predict a hardware failure with accuracy of 90-92 percent.

In this work, we have proposed some data preprocessing techniques such as filling the missing values, removing redundant samples, reduce the dimension, selecting most relevant features and finally, normalize the samples. After data preprocessing, we have simulated and tested the dataset by applying various data mining algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, K nearest neighbor, K-Mean and Fuzzy C-Mean Clustering which provides better result in less computational time.

But which one is better? In this paper we introduce a methodology for evaluating interestingness measures. This methodology relies on supervised classification. It allows us to avoid experts and artificial datasets in the evaluation process. We apply our methodology to evaluate promising measures for itemset selection, such as leverage and stability. We show that although there is no evident winner between them, stability has a slightly better performance.

Typically the games are for free and companies generate their revenue by selling in-game goods. We show creation of a users behaviour model, which are then used in a recommendation system increasing in-game goods purchases. We focus on learning techniques in a novel way, predicting the time of purchases rather than the most likely product to be purchased. The player model is based on in-game signals, such as players success, curiosity, social interactions etc. We had access to a Pool Live Tour game dataset made by Geewa. We report promising results in predicting the purchase events.

Co-locations, or sets of spatial events which are frequently observed together in close proximity, are particularly useful for discovering their spatial dependencies. Although a number of spatial co-location mining algorithms have been developed, the computation of co-location pattern discovery remains prohibitively expensive with large data size and dense neighborhoods. We propose to leverage the power of parallel processing, in particular, the MapReduce framework to achieve higher spatial mining processing efficiency. MapReduce-like systems have been proven to be an efficient framework for large-scale data processing on clusters of commodity machines, and for big data analysis for many applications. The proposed parallel co-location mining algorithm was developed on MapReduce. The experimental result of the developed algorithm shows scalability in computational performance.

Based on NoSQL (not only SQL), a patient-driven data architecture is suggested to enable the rapid storing and flexible expansion of data. Thus, the schema differences of various hospitals can be overcome, and the flexibility for field alterations and addition is ensured. The timeline mode can easily be used to generate a visual representation of patient records, providing physicians with a reference for patient consultation. The sharding-key is used for data partitioning to generate data on patients of various populations. Subsequently, data reformulation is conducted as a first step, producing additional temporal and spatial data, providing cloud computing methods based on queryMapReduce- shard, and enhancing the search performance of data mining. Target data can be rapidly searched and filtered, particularly when analyzing temporal events and interactive effects.

However, there are situations in which data are uncertain. Items in each transaction of these probabilistic databases of uncertain data are usually associated with existential probabilities, which express the likelihood of these items to be present in the transaction. When compared with mining from precise data, the search space for mining from uncertain data is much larger due to the presence of the existential probabilities. This problem is worsened as we are moving to the era of Big data. Furthermore, in many real-life applications, users may be interested in a tiny portion of this large search space for Big data mining. Without providing opportunities for users to express the interesting patterns to be mined, many existing data mining algorithms return numerous patterns-out of which only some are interesting. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that (i) allows users to express their interest in terms of constraints and (ii) uses the MapReduce model to mine uncertain Big data for frequent patterns that satisfy the user-specified constraints. By exploiting properties of the constraints, our algorithm greatly reduces the search space for Big data mining of uncertain data, and returns only those patterns that are interesting to the users for Big data analytics.

It is necessary to extract these knowledge from hydrological data set, which can provide more valuable hydrological information and be useful for future hydrological forecasting. Data mining based on time series is widely used currently. There are some techniques based on time series to extract anomaly. However, most of these techniques cannot suit big unstable data such as hydrological big data set. Some important problems are high fitting error after dimension reduction and low accuracy of mining results. In this work we propose a new idea to solve the problem of hydrological anomaly mining based on time series. The idea combines time series symbolization with distance measure. It proposes Feature Points Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (FP SAX) to improve the selection of feature points, and then measures the distance of strings by Symbol Distance based Dynamic Time Warping (SD DTW). Finally, the distance which we have got are sorted. A set of dedicated experiments are performed to validate our approach. The experimental data set is based on the water level data set obtained from Xiaomeikou gauge station in the Taihu Lake from 1956 to 2005. The results of experiments show that our approach has lower fitting error and higher accuracy.

The Bayesian Network (BN), as a directed probabilistic graph model, is providing intuitive knowledge presentation and accurate prediction for many mission critical areas. However, the current algorithms do not scale well for Big Data Bayesian network learning. This paper proposes a novel parallel BN learning algorithm called PENBays (Parallel ENsemble based Bayesian Networks Learning), which integrates the best BN learning algorithms MMHC, TPDA and REC. It has three phases: Data Preprocess (DP), Individual Ensemble Learning (IEL) and Central Ensemble Learning (CNL). Through these phases, PENBays effectively learns a BN rapidly from large datasets. Experiments reveal that PENBays learns BNs with better accuracy than base line learning algorithms like MMHC, TPDA and REC, showing promising application potential in the big data mining area.

This paper considers the shortcomings of traditional databases such as limited support for data types, low concurrent query performance and lack of horizontal scalability. And based on this, it proposes an Open Scalable Relational Data Model (OSRDM), which provides open support for varieties of data types and enables complete horizontal scalability on the basis of keeping and extending the relational descriptive power of traditional relational data models. It caters for the characteristics of big data such as volume, variety and velocity. Finally, the paper analyzes and evaluates OSRDM by comparing it with popular data models from two perspectives: functional features and performance indicators. The results show the superiority of OSRDM.

Designs of existing stream computing systems are mostly focusing on the scalability and availability issues. Other important issues which are essential to the actual cost and productivity, such as the fluctuating work load handling, the stream topology alternation efficiency and the computing topology overlapping, are not well studied. To address these issues in a live, production environment, a new stream processing architecture that is based on a scalability enhanced subscription model is proposed in this paper. We also present a system, called Vortex, that has been implemented using this new architecture. Vortex is a distributed stream computing system engineered to support flexible applications at Baidu. The new architecture enables Vortex to scale well for highly fluctuating workloads and perform on-demand stream topology alternations with minimal overheads. Furthermore, the dynamic message routing mechanism of Vortex allows one processing node to serve different stream topologies. This maximizes the computing resource utilization in the scenarios of topology overlapping. With all these features, Vortex is a powerful platform for both realtime data processing and Map-Reduce job acceleration. Finally, in this paper, we also discuss some applications at Baidu to demonstrate how Vortex can be deployed for various stream computing applications ranging from real-time analytics to the efficient large-scale data mining.

Trend analysis in the time series is the practice of collecting and attempting to spot patterns. Various data mining techniques such as clustering, classification, regression, etc. can be used to expose those trends. In this work, we developed a framework to analyze the time series data, which cluster time series according to their similarity. We also introduced a merging algorithm to represent each cluster using a representative series. Trends are detected in a series using Modified Mann-Kendall test.

Due to lack of information open and sharing, it is possible to approve similar or duplicated projects by different government departments. In some way, these similar projects are a waste of scientific resources. To avoid such a problem, this paper proposes a discriminant framework for detecting similar projects based on big data mining technologies, providing evidence-based decision making for government departments during the project approval process. Firstly, we construct a big data file associated with officially approved projects, including project titles, principal investigators, research organizations, keywords, and bibliographies of published scholar papers. Secondly, a discriminant framework is proposed to detect similar projects by mining information from the above big data file. Finally, we adopt the Hadoop architecture to speed up the data mining algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the framework, we implement a prototype system for similar projects detection.

Cloud computing can provide data mining results in the form of a Software As a Service (SAS). Both performance and quality of mining are fundamentals criteria for the use of a data mining application provided by a Cloud computing environment. In this paper, we propose a Cloud computing framework, which is responsible to distribute and schedule a Cluster-Based data mining application and its data set. The main goal of our proposed framework for scheduling of Big Data Mining (FSBD) is to decrease the overall execution time of the application with minimum loss in mining quality. We consider the Cluster-based data mining technique as a pilot application for our framework. The results show an important speedup with a minimum loss in quality of mining.

This paper describes a new data communication protocol (CloudJet) for long distance and large volume big data accessing operations to alleviate the large latencies encountered in sharing big data resources in the clouds. It encapsulates a dynamic multi-stream/multi-path engine at the socket level, which conforms to Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) and thereby can accelerate any POSIXcompatible applications across IP based networks. It was demonstrated that CloudJet accelerates typical big data applications such as very large database (VLDB), data mining, media streaming and office applications by up to tenfold in real-world tests.

The Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) have been employed over the past decades for content storage and management, but, the ever-growing heterogeneity in today's data calls for a new storage approach. Thus, the NoSQL database has emerged as the preferred storage facility nowadays since the facility supports unstructured data storage. This creates the need to explore efficient data mining techniques from such NoSQL systems since the available tools and frameworks which are designed for RDBMS are often not directly applicable. In this paper, we focused on topics and terms mining, based on clustering, in document-based NoSQL. This is achieved by adapting the architectural design of an analytics-as-a-service framework and the proposal of the Viterbi algorithm to enhance the accuracy of the terms classification in the system. The results from the pilot testing of our work show higher accuracy in comparison to some previously proposed techniques such as the parallel search.

This is one of the new challenges of machine learning data mining. Choosing a suitable metric that addresses the properties and domain characteristics of learning real-world data is critical for achieving a good result in most of machine learning and data mining algorithms. When the dataset is big and imbalanced, even with an accurate metric, it is extremely difficult to achieve good learning performance. This paper proposes an integrated method for learning large imbalanced datasets. In particular, a combination of metric learning algorithms and balancing techniques are experimented. Their performances are compared based on a set of evaluation metrics running on bootstrap datasets of different sizes. The best combination is then selected for learning the full imbalanced datasets. Experiments using the water pipeline datasets collected from various Australia regions in the past two decades show that our proposed method is both practical and effective.

We present novel parallel algorithms for the MapReduce platform, and an experimental evaluation using Hadoop MapReduce. Our algorithm is based on clustering the input graph into smaller sized subgraphs, followed by processing different subgraphs in parallel. Our algorithm uses two ideas that enable it to scale to large graphs: (1) the redundancy in work between different subgraph explorations is minimized through a careful pruning of the search space, and (2) the load on different reducers is balanced through the use of an appropriate total order among the vertices. Our evaluation shows that the algorithm scales to large graphs with millions of edges and tens of millions of maximal bicliques. To our knowledge, this is the first work on maximal biclique enumeration for graphs of this scale.

Statistical languages provide rich functionality and ease of use for data analysis and modeling and have a large user base. R[5] is one of the most widely used of these languages, but is limited to a single threaded execution model and problem sizes that fit in a single node. This paper describes highly parallel R system called RABID (R Analytics for BIg Data) that maintains R compatibility, leverages the MapReduce-like distributed Spark[22] and achieves high performance and scaling across clusters. Our experimental evaluation shows that RABID performs up to 5x faster than Hadoop and 20x faster than RHIPE on two data mining applications.

Especially in software engineering domain, it tends to be more difficult to retrieve the right program from projects that are written in different languages and not well-developed. Prior work solved this problem by extracting words from programs, which cannot fully exploit the information of source code. In this paper, we propose a novel program retrieval method by extracting the frequent patterns and analyzing their correlations with accompanying text information. The experimental results on large-scale and heterogeneous datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The inferred semantics of programs can significantly improve the accuracy of code artifact retrieval.

In the current work, ultra-high-frequency (UHF) signals are measured and used to represent each PD source. A new group of time-frequency features is proposed for partial discharge classification. First of all, adaptive optimal kernel (AOK) time-frequency representation is employed to acquire the joint time-frequency information of partial discharge UHF signals, which are characterized by AOK amplitude (AOKA) matrices. Then, A new group of features are extracted from AOKA based time-frequency matrices by non-negative matrix factorization aided principal component analysis (NMF-PCA) which is developed to solve the difficulties of PCA for feature extraction of AOKA matrices due to the high dimensionality. Finally, all the extracted features are used as input vectors of fuzzy k-nearest neighbor (FkNN) classifier to obtain the PD recognition results. 600 partial discharge UHF signals sampled from four typical artificial defect models in laboratory are adopted for algorithms testing. It is shown that the maximum classification accuracy of 94.33% is obtained, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed time-frequency features. Besides, the classification performance of the NMF-PCA features is superior to that of two-dimensional NMF (2DNMF) features. The obtained results in this work provide a solid basis for the data mining technique that can be used for PD pattern recognition based on UHF detection arrangements.

However, the existing algorithms for associative classification suffer from inefficiency: high misinformation rate and low detection rate, addressing this problem, a novel association rule is presented and successfully used in intrusion detection. Mining only the atomic association rules achieves fast intrusion detection classification. Using the strong atomic association rules, extracted under a high confidence threshold, multiple passes of partial classifications can classify the whole dataset. This algorithm uses a self-adaptive confidence threshold and a dynamic support threshold. The experiments were performed on a standard dataset of KDD cup99. The results show the proposed algorithm can systematically keep low condition of misuse rates, intrusion detecting rates improve to some extent.

To simplify this work, a BOW (Bag of Words) strategy, counting topic-related words as features, is comprehensively utilized to make a final decision. Indeed, texts can be categorized by expression styles rather than their themes. Brief biography is a typical text class which differs from others in its genre. In order to differentiate biographical data from other texts quickly and effectively, we constructed two knowledge bases and compared their performances, i. e. topic keyword (content) and simple linguistic features (form). The results showed that the latter form-based approach is superior to its former counterpart. A further discussion is elaborated at the end of this paper.

Predicting student withdrawal can help universities to retain students. The aim of this project is to produce a data mining tool for predicting undergraduate onsite student withdrawals at the Swinburne University of Technology. The tool combines statistical models for predicting course withdrawal with a user friendly software interface. Initial predictions were made at the beginning of each semester, using logistic regression and classification tree techniques based on enrolment data for commencing students and on both enrolment and progress data for continuing students. Next, evolving weekly hybrid predictions, based on online Blackboard engagement student data and the initial estimated probabilities of withdrawal, were obtained. Usage of Blackboard engagement data improved the accuracy of predictions, with areas under the ROC curves for commencing student models increasing from 0.837 to 0.882, and areas under the ROC increasing from 0.806 to 0.854 for continuing students. Additional validation on the second semester of 2013 data showed even better performance, which confirmed the robustness of the models produced. Future work on this project includes the development of software for automatically predicting the probability of student withdrawals.

The concept of Customer Lifetime Value helps companies to manage their acquisition and retention marketing activities based on appropriately discounted net contribution margin achieved per customer. There are six main approaches for Customer Lifetime Value Modeling which are based on advanced statistical, econometric and data mining algorithms. Authors describe profoundly three of these approaches (Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value models, probability models and persistence models) on theoretical basis and compare their results on real-world data from an online fashion retailer. Managerial implications of usage of different models are discussed. Companies need to decide what business goals are they trying to achieve with CLV analysis and predictions. Main decisions should be made on a level of detail (individual vs. aggregate) and a predicted variable (number of transactions, customer value or probability of being alive only). The article concludes specific use cases for various models: RFM serves great as an introductory tool to customer segmentation, Pareto/Negative Binominal Distribution predicts customer's probability of being alive and Vector Autoregressive Model interprets various relationships among customer acquisition metrics.

Among them, a study of Eom [1] has provided biblio-metric evidence that the decision support system has made meaningful progress over the past four and a half decades (1969-2004). The primary data for this study were gathered from a total of 498 citing articles in the BI area over the past eight years (2005-2012). This study uses author cocitation analysis (ACA). ACA is a technique of bibliometrics that applies quantitative methods to various media of communication such as books, journals, conference proceedings, and so on. Indeed, the results of this study showed the substantial changes in the intellectual structure of BI research. First, many research subspecialties appeared in the previous investigations up to 2004 have disappeared. They are individual differences/user interfaces, model management, and evaluation research during the period of 1969-2004. Second, through this research, we also noticed that the group support systems and foundation research are weakening in terms of the number of researchers and therefore the substantiality of these research topics are diminishing. On the other hand, the focus of business intelligence research is shifting to knowledge management and data mining.

Proposed method for dimensionality reduction based on framework in gene expression domain	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Dimensionality reduction; Framework; Attribute selection	CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION	The excessive use of attributes may affect the search for patterns and extraction of useful knowledge, because they harm the learning performance of algorithms in both speed and success rate. The use of dimensionality reduction methods is therefore an important alternative; however, these methods do not deal with the reduction of attributes in a specific area. This article presents a method based on framework concepts of domain for reducing attributes in a domain. The input method is a set of databases related to a domain, and the main process is the identification of common and variable attributes, plus the reduction of attributes in the original database. The proposed method was applied in the gene expression domain, using databases. The method can be used to analyze the most relevant attributes in a specific domain, granting greater confidence for models created for the application of a data mining task, thus, a previously known method in data mining. Attribute selection was also applied in the three databases for the comparison of the results. Analyses of the results using the criterion of cross-validation revealed that the employment of the methods resulted in the improvement of success rates compared to the databases containing the full range of attributes.

To investigate if the various factors influencing breeding habitats can be mapped from space, dengue indices, such as the container index, the house index and the Breteau index, were calculated from Ministry of Public health data collected three times annually in Phitsanulok, Thailand between 2009 and 2011. The most influential factors were found to be temperature, humidity, rainfall, population density, elevation and land cover. Models were worked out using parameters mostly derived from freely available satellite images and fuzzy logic software with parameter synchronisation and a predication algorithm based on data mining and the Decision Tree method. The models developed were found to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate additional parameters and sampling data that might improve prediction of favourable breeding hotspots. The algorithm applied can not only be used for the prediction of near real-time scenarios with respect to dengue, but can also be applied for monitoring other diseases influenced by environmental and climatic factors. The multi-criteria model presented is a cost-effective way of identifying outbreak hotspots and early warning systems lend themselves for development based on this strategy. The proposed approach demonstrates the successful utilisation of remotely sensed images to map mosquito breeding habitats.

In today's world, firms' Web data must be analyzed to gain competitive advantage in the topic sector. Web text mining (TM) is gaining a lot of importance because of being used increasingly in business applications for understanding and predicting valuable information. It plays a key role in organizing huge amount of web unstructured (textual) data and condensing it into valuable knowledge. Customer complaints give businesses valuable information about how they need to improve. This paper addresses a Web TM application to extract useful, interesting and hidden knowledge to implement heating systems firms' in competition. Top seven heating systems firms are analyzed about customers' complaints in Turkey. Data are collected from a complaint Website with RapidMiner Web Mining Tool. Then data is transformed to a collection of documents by generating a document for each record. Every complaint is transformed to a document. These documents which are collected for one years' time between 2012 december and 2013 october are analyzed with TM techniques. Summarization, tokenization, stemming, and filtering are also used. In addition, the similarities of firms about the subject are determined. Not only have we analyzed the customers in the sector but also the firms about the complaints.

KDD is the process of analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing them into new information. It uses various types of algorithms, including statistical and machine learning. KDD starts with understanding data. Then data preprocessing techniques are used because quality decisions must be based on quality data. The data mining modeling phase is used to extract more meaningful knowledge from a given data set. Decision trees (DTs) are one of the most powerful and popular approaches in data mining. Their effective structure helps us to make the best decisions on the basis of existing information. DTs also predict future and possible decisions. Analyzing data on violence against women is a very important subject. There are still a lot of women who are subjected to violence, even in this, the 21st century. Violence against women is not only hysical; emotional violence also negatively affects health. Emotional violence inflected by a partner includes the following: being insulted or made to feel bad about oneself; being humiliated in front of others; being intimidated or frightened on purpose; being threatened directly, or indirectly through a threat to someone the respondent cares about. Although violence against women, especially by men, is an important issue, presently there are too few original studies on this topic. Women who experience emotional violence are at increased risk of injury and death, as well as a range of physical, emotional, and social problems. As women play an important role in bringing up healthy individuals to be part of a healty community, violence against women is also a problem for society. This research aims to extract meaningful knowledge from the emotional violence against women data set. The data cover 12795 women in the 15-59 age group of in Turkey. The data were obtained from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT)' s Web site. As a result of the data obtained from the analysis suggestions can be submitted for women exposed to emotional violence. The paper explores the use of different preprocessing and data mining techniques (anomaly detection analysis, data reduction, data cleaning, DT etc.). In order to support the prevention of violence against women, a DT model is generated. Modeling is performed with C4.5, which is one of the popular DT modeling algorithms and an extension of the earlier well known ID3 algorithm to find useful patterns. The cross-validation method involves partitioning the examples randomly into n folds. Ten fold normal cross-validation accuracy evaluation is used. Consequently, a DT is generated. The resulting DT model can be used for future decisions. The relationships of the input variables with target variables are found. The results show that the proposed method has a substantially good performance.

It is an important subject in software testing research that has led to the development of several tools and approaches over the decades. This paper presented a systematic mapping study to get an overview about the current studies of distinct techniques for generation of test cases automatically. The techniques presented in this paper are random-based methods, search-based methods and data mining-based methods. Each technique is explored briefly to give the basic idea behind it. In general, the paper's objective is to give an up-to-date introduction and short review of the research in generation of test cases automatically. Systematic mapping study is the process of finding and collecting as much literature as possible, provides a structure of the type of research reports and the results that have been published by categorizing them depending on specific search questions to provide a background for further research. This study was based on a comprehensive set of 85 papers published in conference and journals between 2002 and 2013 obtained after using multistage selection criteria in the field of automatic test cases generation. The results from our systematic mapping study include information about the researches techniques used to generate test cases automatically and types of coverage within a specific period that can help researchers in this field through providing an overview of the current researches in this area. Furthermore, it may serve as a first step towards a great explanation of the topic with the help of systematic literature review.

One of the most popular techniques in data clustering is K-means, which is a simple, fast and efficient method that has been applied successfully in many fields. However, K-means has its own drawbacks like highly dependence on the initial solution and can easily trapped into local optima. In this paper, we investigate the behaviour of the newly created meta-heuristic optimisation algorithm called Biogeography-Based Optimisation (BBO) for data clustering with different initial solution generation mechanisms (random initial solution, sequential diversification initial solution, heuristic initial solution) that is based on the idea of migration of species between different habitats. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, six UCI Machine Learning Repository data sets were used. The performance of the BBO algorithm was compared with well-known data-clustering algorithms that available in the literature, the experimental results showed that the BBO algorithm was able to obtain comparable results.

Woody canopy cover (i.e. the percentage area occupied by woody canopy or CC) is a key parameter of the woody component. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is effective at assessing the woody component, because of its capacity to image within-canopy properties of the vegetation while offering an all-weather capacity to map relatively large extents of the woody component. This study compared the modelling accuracies of woody canopy cover (CC), in South African Savannahs, through the assessment of a set of modelling approaches (Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, REPTree decision tree, Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest) with the use of X-band (TerraSAR-X), C-band (RADARSAT-2) and L-band (ALOS PALSAR) datasets. This study illustrated that the ANN, REPTree and RF non-parametric modelling algorithms were the most ideal with high CC prediction accuracies throughout the different scenarios. Results also illustrated that the acquisition of L-band data be prioritized due to the high accuracies achieved by the L-band dataset alone in comparison to the individual shorter wavelengths. The study provides promising results for developing regional savannah woody cover maps using limited LiDAR training data and SAR images.

In the geospatial domain, Sensor Web technologies can provide real-time or near real-time geospatial data to support timely decision-making. Scientific workflows have been identified as a key approach to support Big Data analytics for scientists. In the human-as-sensor aspect, the social content, as a special kind of sensor data, could be mined and fused in a Sensor Event Service (SE S), allowing social data to be used inside a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). This paper investigates an infrastructural approach on how social and scientific data could work together in an interoperable service environment.

However, for knowledge discovery in large remote sensing databases can be use clustering techniques in multivariate time series. The clustering technique on three-dimensional time series of NDVI, albedo and surface temperature from AVHRR/NOAA satellite images was used, in this study, to map the variability of land use. This approach was suitable to accomplish the temporal analysis of land use. Additionally, this technique can be used to identify and analyze dynamics of land use and cover being useful to support researches in agriculture, even considering low spatial resolution satellite images. The possibility of extracting time series from satellite images, analyzing them through data mining techniques, such as clustering, and visualizing results in geospatial way is an important advance and support to agricultural monitoring tasks.

Due to the exponential behavior of sequences number with specialization, Sequential Data Mining techniques need to be applied. The spatial aspect of the data was taken into account by the introduction of connectivity measures that characterize the pixels tendency to form objects. The conjunction of corresponding Connectivity Constraints (CC) with the Support Constraint (SC) leads to the extraction of Grouped Frequent Sequential Patterns (GFSP), a concept with proved capability for preliminary description and localization of terrestrial events.

However, due to practical considerations robotic vision experiments are typically limited to a single robot and a few (laboratory) environments. We propose crowdsourcing as a methodology for gathering large and varied robotic data sets. We evaluate the methodology by performing the first crowdsourcing experiment involving actual robots. In particular, we have made a space-game called 'Astro Drone' for a toy quad rotor, the Parrot AR drone. Nine months after the game's release, there are 14, 628 downloads and 840 contributions, consisting of visual features and drone state estimates. Data mining shows the methodology's potential, providing insights such as the relation between the number of visual features and obstacle distances.

Classification is also a major issue in data mining. The classification difficulties in medical area often classify medical dataset based on the outcomes of medical analysis or report of medical action by the medical practitioner. In this study, a prediction model is proposed for the classification of cancer based on gene expression profiles. Feature selection also plays a vital role in cancer classification. Feature selection techniques can be used to extract the marker genes to improve classification accuracy efficiently by removing the unwanted noisy and redundant genes. The proposed study discusses the bijective-soft-set-based classification method for gene expression data of three different cancers, which are breast cancer, lung cancer, and leukemia cancer. The proposed algorithm is also compared with fuzzy-soft-set-based classification algorithms, fuzzy KNN, and k-nearest neighbor approach. Comparative analysis of the proposed approach shows good accuracy over other methods.	[Kumar, S. Udhaya; Inbarani, H. Hannah; Kumar, S.

In this study we evaluate the performance of two text-based features that have not been used in that context, namely (a) a variation of the bigram feature, utilizing grammatical dependencies and (b) discourse connectives. By treating helpfulness prediction as a binary classification task we show that both features contain valuable information but however they should be used with caution due to the restrictive experimental setup. The study serves as a ground for future work regarding the usefulness of the proposed features in review helpfulness prediction.

Today's Knowledge Discovery Support Systems can contain several hundred operators. A major challenge is to assist the user in designing workflows which are not only valid but also - ideally - optimize some performance measure associated with the user goal. In this paper we present such a system. The system relies on a meta-mining module which analyses past data mining experiments and extracts meta-mining models which associate dataset characteristics with workflow descriptors in view of workflow performance optimization. The meta-mining model is used within a data mining workflow planner, to guide the planner during the workflow planning. We learn the meta-mining models using a similarity learning approach, and extract the workflow descriptors by mining the workflows for generalized relational patterns accounting also for domain knowledge provided by a data mining ontology. We evaluate the quality of the data mining workflows that the system produces on a collection of real world datasets coming from biology and show that it produces workflows that are significantly better than alternative methods that can only do workflow selection and not planning.

However, there is an important step in the creation of classification models, which does not pay sufficient attention accurate definition of risky company state, to which we want to avoid. Researchers often use different terms like bankruptcy, distress or failure and differences between these terms definitions lead to a lack of comparability in research outputs. The aim of the present paper is to identify the impact of selected definitions to the results of the classification models constructed using logistic regression and neural networks for the selected data set of small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the Slovak dynamic economic environment and to provide an overview of the definitions of the risky enterprise with different levels of difficulty.

Data Mining is defined as the process of analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing it into useful information. It is also used for extracting the useful and potential information from the cloud. Most institutions and organizations have their own libraries and computer Servers, retrieving the data available in the above consortia is a difficult task. To overcome this, the resources can be shared using Data Mining and Cloud computing technology. Thus the end users would have access to all information.

ERMiner: Sequential Rule Mining Using Equivalence Classes	ADVANCES IN INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS XIII	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA)	OCT 30-NOV 01, 2014	Leuven, BELGIUM		Fac Club	sequential rule mining; vertical database format; equivalence classes; sparse count matrix		Sequential rule mining is an important data mining task with wide applications. The current state-of-the-art algorithm (RuleGrowth) for this task relies on a pattern-growth approach to discover sequential rules. A drawback of this approach is that it repeatedly performs a costly database projection operation, which deteriorates performance for datasets containing dense or long sequences. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing an algorithm named ERMiner (Equivalence class based sequential Rule Miner) for mining sequential rules. It relies on the novel idea of searching using equivalence classes of rules having the same antecedent or consequent. Furthermore, it includes a data structure named SCM (Sparse Count Matrix) to prune the search space. An extensive experimental study with five real-life datasets shows that ERMiner is up to five times faster than RuleGrowth but consumes more memory.

We had, among others things, to list all the existing botanical ontologies and relate terms in BioKET with terms in these ontologies. We demonstrate the usefulness of such a resource by applying FIST, a combined biclustering and conceptual association rule extraction method on a dataset extracted from BioKET to analyze the risk status of plants endemic to Laos. Besides, BioKET may be interfaced with other resources, like GeoCAT, to provide a powerful analysis tool for biodiversity data.	[Inthasone, Somsack; Pasquier, Nicolas; Tettamanzi, Andrea G.

As is the case with many algorithms in data mining, Krimp is not designed to cope with real-valued data, and it is not able to handle such data natively. Inspired by KRIMP'S success at using the MDL Principle in itemset mining, we develop REALKRIMP: an MDL-based KRIMP-inspired mining scheme that seeks exceptionally high-density patterns in a real-valued dataset. We review how to extend the underlying Kraft inequality, which relates probabilities to codelengths, to real-valued data. Based on this extension we introduce the REALKRIMP algorithm: an efficient method to find hyperintervals that compress the real-valued dataset, without the need for pre-algorithm data discretization.

Previous research has shown that an ensemble as a whole is often more accurate than any of the single classifiers in the ensemble. Boosting-BAN classifier is considered stronger than Boosting-MultiTAN on noise-free data. However, there are strong empirical indications that Boosting-MultiTAN is much more robust than Boosting-BAN in noisy settings. For this reason, in this paper we built an ensemble using a voting methodology of Boosting-BAN and Boosting-MultiTAN ensembles with 10 sub-classifiers in each one.

When the public policies contain massive amounts of network contents, the components in the public policies will become complex. The diversity of the data features will cause obvious differences in data attribute which will lead low efficiency in searching some specific contents in public policy formulation and cause some difficulties in the search. In order to avoid the defects, this paper proposes a data mining method based on parallel Apriori algorithm which can complete the specific network contents search in public policy formulation. The experiment illustrates the application of the algorithm can optimize the contents search in public policy formulation and effectively increase the efficiency of searching some specific contents in the public policy formulation.

Previous studies on class-imbalance learning mainly focused on relatively small or moderate class-imbalance. In this paper we conduct an empirical study to explore the difference between learning with small or moderate class-imbalance and learning with severe class-imbalance. The experimental results show that: (1) Traditional methods cannot handle severe class-imbalance effectively. (2) AUC, G-mean and F-measure can be very inconsistent for severe class-imbalance, which seldom appears when class-imbalance is moderate. And G-mean is not appropriate for severe class-imbalance learning because it is not sensitive to the change of imbalance ratio. (3) When AUC and G-mean are evaluation metrics, EasyEnsemble is the best method, followed by BalanceCascade and under-sampling. (4) A little under-full balance is better for under-sampling to handle severe class-imbalance. And it is important to handle false positives when design methods for severe class-imbalance.

In crowded areas, group incidents will result in disorder of flow information, nonlinear and catastrophe of flow density and motion direction. The traditional evacuation route guidance only selects evacuation route for orderly, smooth flow density variations, in which nonlinearity and mutation of the flow information cannot be reflected. Therefore, once the Group incidents occurred, the stability of the model will be destroyed. To solve the problem, the paper proposes an emergency evacuation method based on path collision probability estimation model. Simulation results show that this algorithm can improve the speed of evacuation.

Accordingly, predicting the burned area of forest fires is also a challenging task. In this work, five attributes(i.e. forest fuel moisture content, forest fuel inflammability, forest fuel load, slope and burning time) are selected as input to predict burned area of forest fires occurred in the area of Guangzhou City in China. Next, using Data Mining (DM) technique, an SVM (Support Vector Machine) model was built and applied to deal with this type of a regression task, predicting burned area. Results showed that the selection of input attributes was reasonable, and the proposed SVM model was suitable for prediction of burned area, with higher precision, better generalization. This work provided a new way to deal with predictions for burned area of forest fires.

Methylation of CpG sites associated with genes can affect the expression of these genes. DNA methylation can be measured with Illumina microarrays. In this paper, formal concept analysis (FCA) is used as data mining tool to visualize the DNA methylation status among breast cancer tumor subtypes, by building formal concepts which represent each subtypes as a set of significant methylated genes, then the formal context is built which leads to construct a concept lattice. The concept lattice is the hierarchical order of the set of all concepts. This lattice visualizes the status of hypermethylated or hypomethylated genes among subtypes.

The major advantage of FLS is the use of human interpretable linguistic terms and rules. In order to capture the uncertainty inherent to linguistic terms, Fuzzy Membership Functions (MF) are used. Therefore, membership functions are essential for improving the understandability of fuzzy systems. Optimizing FLS for improved accuracy in terms of classification or control can reduce the understandability of fuzzy MFs. Expert knowledge can be used to derive MFs, but it has been shown that this might not be optimal, and acquiring expert knowledge is not trivial. Therefore, this paper presents a data driven method using statistical methods to generate membership functions that describe the data while maintaining the understandability. The presented method calculates key points such as membership function centers, intersections and slopes using data driven statistical methods. Furthermore, the presented method utilizes several understandability metrics to adjust the generated MFs. The presented method was tested on several benchmark datasets and a real-world dataset and was shown to be able to generate MFs that describe the dataset, while maintaining high levels of understandability.

Though users have a wide range of choices, they need to find their favorite items from a huge amount of information. Thus, a variety of recommendation systems are currently in use. "Accuracy" is the most important index in these recommendation systems. However, not only "Accuracy" but also "Serendipity" is said to be needed in terms of user satisfaction recent years. In this paper, we introduce a recommendation method of collaborative filtering based on association analysis which is one of the data mining techniques. We aim to improve Serendipity keeping Accuracy high by using the evaluation information that are rated differently from a target user. In addition, we show that Accuracy and Serendipity can be adaptable by a parameter in the proposed method. This paper compares the proposed method with a conventional method in terms of the performance of Accuracy and Serendipity.

Fuzzy c-means is one of the most well-known and used methods, however, the number of clusters need to be defined in advance. This paper proposes a clustering approach based on Particle Swarm Optimization. This approach automatically determines the optimal number of clusters using a threshold vector that is added to the particle. The algorithm starts by partitioning the data set randomly within a preset maximum number of clusters in order to overcome the fuzzy c-means shortcoming of the predefined cluster count. A reconstruction criterion is applied to evaluate the performance of the clustering results of the proposed algorithm. The experiments conducted show that the proposed algorithm can automatically find the optimal number of clusters.

The two main inputs of MV are expected return rate and the variance of expected return rate. The expected return rate is an esti-mated value which is often decided by experts. Various uncertainty of stock price brings difficulties to predict return rate even for experts. MV model has its tendency to maximize the influence of errors in the input assumptions. Some scholars used fuzzy intervals to describe the return rate. However, there were still some variables decided by experts. This paper proposes a classification method to find the latent relationship between the interval return rate and the trading data of a stock and predict the interval of return rate without consulting any expert. Then this paper constructs the portfolio model based on minimax rule with interval numbers. The evaluation results show that the proposed method is reliable.

Phase Angles as Predictors of Network Dynamic Security Limits and Further Implications	2014 IEEE PES GENERAL MEETING - CONFERENCE & EXPOSITION	IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting PESGM		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE PES General Meeting	JUL 27-31, 2014	National Harbor, MD	IEEE		Dynamic Security Assessment (DSA); Data mining; System reliability; Synchrophasor; Dynamic Security Monitoring; Random Forest (RF); Phasor measurement unit (PMU); Wide-Area Situational Awareness (WASA)		In the United States, the number of Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) will increase from 166 networked devices in 2010 to 1043 in 2014. According to the Department of Energy, they are being installed in order to "evaluate and visualize reliability margin (which describes how close the system is to the edge of its stability boundary)." However, there is still a lot of debate in academia and industry around the usefulness of phase angles as unambiguous predictors of dynamic stability. In this paper, using 4-year of actual data from Hydro-Quebec EMS, it is shown that phase angles enable satisfactory predictions of power transfer and dynamic security margins across critical interface using random forest models, with both explanation level and R-squares accuracy exceeding 99%. A generalized linear model (GLM) is next implemented to predict phase angles from day-ahead to hour-ahead time frames, using historical phase angles values and load forecast. Combining GLM based angles forecast with random forest mapping of phase angles to power transfers result in a new data-driven approach for dynamic security monitoring	[Kaci, A.; Dessaint, L. -A.] ETS, Montreal, PQ, Canada	Kaci, A (reprint author), ETS, Montreal, PQ, Canada.	anissa.kaci.1@ens.etsmtl.ca; kamwa.innocent@ireq.ca; louis.dessaint@etsmtl.ca; guillon.sebastien@hydro.qc.ca						13	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1944-9925		978-1-4799-6415-4	IEEE POW ENER SOC GE			2014												5	Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Energy & Fuels; Engineering	BC0TU	WOS:000349551502118

The energy control centres have the responsibility of maintaining the grid parameters mainly frequency and voltage at each bus in a given network configuration. The usage of SCADA data has been of value till date in making the decision, but in real time, the delay and skewed data sometimes results in imprecise decisions. The new generation synchrophasor technology with PMUs has been visualized by the power utilities of great help in observability of grid parameters variations. However, the integration of PMUs signalling with energy control centres for identifying the events and related automated control decisions have not be adequately addressed. This paper identifies the concept of PMU signal prioritization based on the data mining algorithm and proposes a methodology based on signal selection criterion for initiating the control decision by energy control centres to ensure smooth system operation in real time in the event of some parametric changes such as system loading or change in power injection. The algorithm may be embedded with data concentrators in parallel processing mode with each PMU signal and corresponding output will assist the Grid operational strategy in real time without manual intervention.

The aim at an efficient use of renewable based generation in places where it exceeds the local needs is one of the main reasons. A reference case of this evolution is the European Electricity Market, where countries are connected, and several regional markets were created, each one grouping several countries, and supporting transactions of huge amounts of electrical energy. The continuous transformations electricity markets have been experiencing over the years create the need to use simulation platforms to support operators, regulators, and involved players for understanding and dealing with this complex environment. This paper focuses on demonstrating the advantage that real electricity markets data has for the creation of realistic simulation scenarios, which allow the study of the impacts and implications that electricity markets transformations will bring to the participant countries. A case study using MASCEM (Multi-Agent System for Competitive Electricity Markets) is presented, with a scenario based on real data, simulating the European Electricity Market environment, and comparing its performance when using several different market mechanisms.

As part of the ongoing smart grid transformation, smart meters have been widely installed producing massive amount of data and information yet unexplored. One of the critical needs for distribution system operations and planning applications is enhanced modeling of the load, in particular, its dependence on the voltage. Under the typical smart meter recording resolution (15-minutes), the load's P-V and Q-V properties are buried in the spontaneous load changes caused by random customer behaviors. To overcome this, the concept of load condition is introduced and data mining techniques such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and K-subspace are implemented. The proposed model is tested on a large database for the Georgia Tech campus, and the results demonstrate that the new model captures the time-variant property of the load on the building level without additional investment.

In PPDM systems data is available amongst multiple parties collaborating to achieve cumulative mining accuracy. The vertically partitioned data available with the parties involved cannot provide accurate mining results when compared to the collaborative mining results. To overcome the privacy issue in data disclosure this paper describes a Key Distribution-Less Privacy Preserving Data Mining (KDLPPDM) system in which the publication of local association rules generated by the parties is published. The association rules are securely combined to form the combined rule set using the Commutative RSA algorithm. The combined rule sets established are used to classify or mine the data. The results discussed in this paper compare the accuracy of the rules generated using the C4. 5 based KDLPPDM system and the CS. 0 based KDLPPDM system using receiver operating characteristics curves (ROC).

Association rules can be used for data classification as they provide a comprehensible and intuitive way to categorize data. The effectiveness of a rule is typically measured using supportconfidence framework. This paper studies several other objective measures of the worthiness of a rule and tries to determine their suitability for classification of data. The impact of these different measures with respect to accuracy of rules and size of rules is analyzed by combining them with a novel soft computing based rule mining method. Section I introduces the task of association rule mining and the soft computing method. Section II provides a review of literature pertaining to rule mining techniques. Section III discusses computation of several interestingness measures. Section IV provides description of proposed algorithm and conducted experiment. Section V discusses results.

The proposed method chooses base tweets, which is close to the current user's tweet, and then predict destination using the next set of tweets of base tweet. The base tweets are selected based on not only location closeness but also similarity of tweet content. We evaluate the proposed method by the error range of the distance between predicted destination and golden answer. We used three months of Twitter data with location information (almost 40 mil.) as the test set tweets. The experimental result demonstrates that the prediction accuracy of the proposed method is superior to the baseline, which only consider the location similarity.

HAZ data, which tend to have greater scatter due to microstructural variation in the HAZ, are separated into " high scatter" and " low scatter" categories to assess the effect of scatter on TTS trends. In general, the TTS behavior of the HAZ is comparable to the non-HAZ. However, the forging HAZ TTS diverges from the non-HAZ TTS as a function of copper content. This trend is also observed in the plate HAZ when looking at plate HAZ datasets with copper content and PWHT times less than forging copper content (<= 0.16 wt. %) and PWHT time (<= 20 h). Additionally, TTS of weld and HAZ materials increases with increased PWHT time. These trends are not well captured by modern embrittlement trend curves. For all but one heat evaluated herein, the irradiated transition temperatures of the HAZ are lower than those of the non- HAZ from the same heat in the same irradiated condition.

Rough set reduction and correlation-based methods have gradually contribute towards improving attribute reduction techniques. Many researchers have proven that the rough set reduction method is effective in reducing redundant attributes without information loss. Correlation-based methods evaluate attribute as a subset reduce irrelevant instead of individual attribute. In this paper, we propose a new method (RSCBA) of combing correlation-based methods and rough set to reduce irrelevant and redundant attributes in a more effective way.

This paper explores the high cross-network externalities which were created by the Internet business model in competition of two-sided markets. These externalities were rooted in the competition strategy of cross-market between networks. On this basis, Internet companies create new rules of financial market competition by value creation through customer data mining and Internet-based thinking.

When students enroll in a course, a teacher usually does not know their knowledge and skills. The teacher is faced with a difficult situation how to estimate the students. The knowledge about students' performance can be used for assigning students to seminar groups with respect to their skills needed for the course. The reliable prediction would also help teachers to identify weak students in order to help them to achieve better grades. The main aim of this research is to clarify relationship between students' behavior and their performance at the beginning of the term when there are no data about students' attitude and motivation towards the course. We inspect different data mining techniques how to recognize weak and good students and how to validate designed methods. We also aim to develop a model of students' performance indicators. Results can be beneficially used by teachers to enhance the teaching process. The model will be utilized in the university information system accessible to teachers and the faculty management. The first part of the paper describes the university information system with the focus on the data stored in its database. The paper also contains the description of the preprocessing stage and feature selection algorithms in order to reveal the most significant attributes. The next section introduces the experiments that aim to identify students' performance. The experiments are based on a combination of data mining methods and social network analysis and are evaluated on the historical data originated from the information system. The final section concludes the paper with comparing the designed methods and emphasizing the best fitting approaches. We also describe the prediction model and discuss the results in detail.

Due to the fact that games are interactive non-linear learning environments, there are different ways to play. This way it is possible that users do not interact with the educational game, features of the game or the treatment as intended, or that they interact differently according to their different player behavior. If not considered, this is a thread for intervention integrity in studies on game-based learning. With examples from current research we underline this statement. In addition to the main research questions of each study, we consider examination of the following questions as highly relevant: 1. Are there subgroups of players regarding player behavior? 2. Do all these subgroups interact with the educational game/the treatment as intended? 3. Are there different effects of the game/the treatment depending on player behavior? Describing the advantages and drawbacks of methods for monitoring and analyzing player behavior, we suggest log files and data mining methods as appropriate tools for the examination of player behavior. In a study on an educational adventure game, we examine the method and the benefits in more detail. In our study the cluster analysis of the log files indicates that it is suitable to distinguish between two different subgroups of players who show two patterns of player behavior -intensive object exploration in Cluster 1 and intensive interaction with non-player characters (NPCs) in Cluster 2. We consider that taking player behavior into account enables the researcher to get an insight into underlying mechanisms which might result, for example, in different learning outcomes. Furthermore, the inclusion of player behavior into analysis is a precondition for tailored instruction.

Collective intelligence, which emerges in the activities of online communities, is a new quality of civil engagement that grants more effective decisions and compliance with societal needs. Various social technologies created possibilities for society members to communicate despite the limitations of the physical world but they have brought high prospects for sophisticated crimes and other violations of rights and obligations of users, administrators and states as regulatory bodies. This article connects several independent fields of research: analytics, social technologies, civil engagement, collective intelligence and cyber security in order to reveal the main threats of using social technologies during the process of engaging society into socially responsible activities. The sources of data are growing and data mining could be used in variety of ways. Analytics allow to combine different observations in order to see new patterns. Risks related to personal data processing in the virtual community networks are discussed together with analysis of related EU legal regulations on personal data protection. The authors stress importance of personal data protection in online networks and legal problems that arise in networked society. As a result, the main trends were identified in the context of online community projects in Lithuania based on quantitative public opinion survey conducted in 2013.

In this project, we are discovering patterns an experimental tool called Rough Set Graphic User Interface (RSGUI). Several algorithms are available in RSGUI, each of which is based in Rough Set theory. Our objective is to find short meaningful predictive rules. First we find a minimum set of attributes that fully characterize the data. Some of the rules generated from this minimum set of attributes were obvious and therefore uninteresting. Others were surprising and therefore interesting. RSGUI allows fine-tuning of rules making it possible to analyze information about the rules and compare the rules resulting from different algorithms. Usual measures of strength of the rule, such as length of the rule, certainty and coverage were considered. In addition, a measure of interestingness of the rules has been developed based on questionnaires administered to human subjects.

This paper proposes a multivariate approach for the discrimination of Normal and Intra Uterine Growth Restricted (IUGR) fetuses based on a small set of parameters computed on the FHR signal. We collected FHR recordings in a population of 120 fetuses (60 normals and 60 IUGRs) at approximately the same gestational week through a standard CTG non-stress test. A set of 8 linear and non-linear indices were selected and computed on each recording, on the basis of their "stand-alone" discriminative properties, demonstrated in previous studies. By using the Orange (R) data mining suite we checked various multivariate discrimination models. The results show that a Logistic Regression performed on a limited set of only 4 parameters can reach 92.5% accuracy in the correct identification of fetuses, with 93% sensitivity and 91.5% specificity.

Similarly, the demands of getting more explicit information from the data sets in an efficient way are also growing quickly, which makes the well performed algorithms of data mining valuable. Data sets generated by real-world process such as biological data sets and social networks, whose information consists of objects and relations, could be modeled as graphs. On these graphs, several algorithms can be implemented to discover interesting features. Quasi-Clique is one of them and will show up in this paper. We call a densely connected sub-graph Quasi-Clique in a given graph, which represents a group of highly related objects in the data sets. In this paper, we focus on efficient quasi-clique detection algorithm design and introduce some pre-detection strategies that improve the efficiency of existing algorithms. We give theoretical and empirical analysis to demonstrate the improvement in efficiency and capability of the proposed algorithm, called iQC.

The key problem is how to find useful hidden patterns for better business applications in the retail sector. For the solution of these problems, The Apriori algorithm is one of the most popular data mining approach for finding frequent item sets from a transaction dataset and derive association rules. Rules are the discovered knowledge from the data base. Finding frequent item set (item sets with frequency larger than or equal to a user specified minimum support) is not trivial because of its combinatorial explosion. Once frequent item sets are obtained, it is straightforward to generate association rules with confidence larger than or equal to a user specified minimum confidence. The paper illustrating apriori algorithm on simulated database and finds the association rules on different confidence value.

The models were based on actual customer purchasing data from a large department store for the period 2007-09. A weak-form evaluation method, consisting of qualitative interviews of experts from the department store, was used. The questions focused on information quality according to the DeLone and McLean framework and were derived from the Doll and Torkzadeh model, i. e., they covered content, accuracy, format, and ease of use aspects. Seven experts from the case company took part in the evaluation process. Before the actual interview, the experts were asked to fill out a questionnaire regarding their background and current access to timely sales information, i. e., how often and how useful the information was that they were receiving at the moment. Later, during an interview, the evaluator discussed the questionnaire with each respondent. Then, the experts were presented with information on their customers' buying behavior based on the results from the two models, i. e., the MBA-and the segmentation model. After each presentation, the experts were asked to respond to fifteen statements and four open-ended questions. All in all, the information gained through the MBA-and segmentation analyses was rated highly (4-5/max 5) by the experts. The experts considered the information gained with help of these models to be valuable and useful for decision making and for making strategic planning for the future. This implies that the models could be of valuable use for managers working within CRM, e. g., planning marketing campaigns, product range planning, service development, planning of store layouts, operative and strategic planning, and for further developing loyalty programs.

Data Mining and Complex Network Algorithms for Traffic Accident Analysis	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							KERNEL DENSITY-ESTIMATION; METHODOLOGICAL ALTERNATIVES; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; INJURY SEVERITY; CRASHES; IDENTIFICATION; LOCATIONS	The field of traffic accident analysis has long been dominated by traditional statistical analysis. With the recent advances in data collection, storage, and archival methods, the size of accident data sets has grown significantly. This result in turn has motivated research on applying data mining and complex network analysis algorithms to traffic accident analysis; the data mining and complex network analysis algorithms are designed specifically to handle data sets with large dimensions. This paper explores the potential for using two such methods namely, a modularity-optimizing community detection algorithm and the association rule learning algorithm to identify important accident characteristics. As a case study, the algorithms were applied to an accident data set compiled for Interstate 190 in the Buffalo Niagara, New York, metropolitan area. Specifically, the community detection algorithm was used to cluster the data to reduce the inherent heterogeneity, and then the association rule learning algorithm was applied to each cluster to discern meaningful patterns within each, related particularly to high accident frequency locations (hot spots) and incident clearance time. To demonstrate the benefits of clustering, the association rule algorithm was also applied to the whole data set (before clustering) and the results were compared with those discovered from the clusters. The study results indicated that (a) the community detection algorithm was quite effective in identifying clusters with discernible characteristics, (b) clustering helped unveil relationships and accident causative factors that remained hidden when the analysis was performed on the whole data set, and (c) the association rule learning algorithm yielded useful insight into accident hot spots and incident clearance time along I-190.

It consists in searching for types of spatial objects that are frequently located together in a spatial neighborhood. With the advent of data gathering techniques, huge volumes of spatial data are being collected. To cope with processing of such datasets a GPU accelerated version of the collocation pattern mining algorithm has been proposed recently [3]. However, the method assumes that a supporting structure that contains information about neighborhoods (called iCPI-tree) is given in advance. In this paper we present a GPU-based version of iCPI-tree generation algorithm for the collocation pattern discovery problem. In an experimental evaluation we compare our GPU implementation with a parallel implementation of iCPI-tree generation method for CPU. Collected results show that proposed solution is multiple times faster than the CPU version of the algorithm.

In the past few years, several spectral clustering algorithms were proposed to cluster arbitrarily shaped data in various real applications including image processing and web analysis. However, most of these algorithms were based on k-means, which is a randomized algorithm and makes the algorithm easy to fall into local optimal solutions. Hierarchical method could handle the local optimum well because it organizes data into different groups at different levels. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering algorithm called spectral clustering algorithm based on hierarchical clustering (SCHC), which combines the advantages of hierarchical clustering and spectral clustering algorithms to avoid the local optimum issues. The experiments on both synthetic data sets and real data sets show that SCHC outperforms other six popular clustering algorithms. The method is simple but is shown to be efficient in clustering both convex shaped data and arbitrarily shaped data.

The main advantage of genetic algorithm combining operation tree is to optimize appropriate types of function and their associated coefficients simultaneously. In the case study, this genetic algorithm combining operation tree described above is used to construct the relationship between the in-situ data of Sea surface salinity of Taiwan Strait and the data of spectral parameters, seven bands, of MODIS/Terra sensor. The results show that the genetic algorithm combining operation tree model has better performance than traditional linear regression method.

In this regard, associative memory concepts open a new pathway for accessing data in a highly distributed environment that will facilitate a parallel-distributed computational model to automatically adapt to the dynamic data environment for optimized performance. With this in mind, this paper targets a new type of data processing approach that will efficiently partition and distribute data for clouds, providing a parallel data access scheme that enables data storage and retrieval by association where data records are treated as patterns; hence, finding overarching relationships among distributed data sets becomes easier for a variety of pattern recognition and data-mining applications. The ability to partition data optimally and automatically will allow elastic scaling of system resources and remove one of the main obstacles in provisioning data centric software-as-a-service in clouds.

Models from data mining are created to compute indicators regarding their status and activity (habits, abnormalities). Models can also help generate feedbacks and recommendations for patients as well as for remote formal and informal care givers. Essential features are that the models can be easily updated whenever new information is available and that data generated from the models can be readily accessible as well as sensed data. This paper addresses the challenge of conveniently incorporating in a Ubiquitous Health Telemonitoring System the creation, the use, and the updating of data mining models.

One of the most significant task in link prediction is to design the proximity measure to calculate the similarities of the nodes in the network. The potential structure of the networks in the link prediction problem can be learned from the network data. In this paper, we propose a data-dependent proximity measure under the low-rank assumption in the social network and many other complex networks, then design a scalable matrix estimation algorithm to figure out the proximity measure. According to our experiment results, the proposed proximity measure can get competitive performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods and can be scalable for complex network link prediction.

However, howto set E to satisfy privacy is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a tactic, named LPB (Limiting Privacy Breaches), to set the privacy parameter intuitively. LPB ensures that, if the prior belief about individual is bounded by some threshold, the posterior belief, after given the published randomized result, is no more than another threshold.

First, the cell ID and timestamp of cellular network signals (e. g., handovers) which are generated by MS are recorded. Data mining technique is used to analyze the data for determining the road segment which is driven by MS user. The experiment results show the average accuracy of proposed method which is 93% is better than naive Bayes classification, decision tree, support vector machine, and backpropagation neural network.

For government bodies, data warehouse provides a means by enabling policy making to be formulated much easier based on available data such as survey-based services data. In this paper we present a survey-based service data with the design and implementation of a Data Warehouse framework for data mining and business intelligence reporting. In the design of the data warehouse, we developed a multidimensional Data Model for the creation of multiple data marts and design of an ETL process for populating the data marts from the data source. The development of multiple data marts will enable easier report generation by identifying common dimension amongst the data marts. The cross-join capabilities of the data marts through common dimensions, demonstrate the ability to easily drill across the data marts for cross data analysis and reporting. In addition, we also have incorporate data quality checking on the data source as well as data detection rules to filter out unmatched data schema and data range from being stored in the data warehouse for analysis.

Since overload traffic is a major problem that delays data transmission in network system and causes some data loss, this research demonstrates an approach to predict network traffic on data transmission in the network system by using association rule discovery which is one of the data mining techniques. Durations of semester and vacation were employed to support prediction. In addition, amount of incoming and outgoing data volume, durations and sizes of routing path were applied to create a model of network traffic prediction on data transmission in network system. The results of this study pointed out that association rule discovery could predict network traffic during semester and vacation for the following day. This could be useful factor for network routing selection and could improve highest performance of data transmission in network system.

This involves hours' of power outages in the area covered by this study, namely, the Southern Electrical Grid of Libya (SEGL). This paper discusses the results of a pattern extraction process using the k-means clustering algorithm to predict load shedding for this scenario. The data consist of all loads shed in 40 electrical power stations in southern Libya for a two-year period from 2009 through 2010. An experiment was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the k-means clustering algorithm in grouping (clustering) the data as a means to predict future load shedding in the SEGL. Each cluster was generated five times to create five different cluster sizes (1, 2, 5, 7 and 10) with different seed values. The pattern extracted provided information on all attributes. The obtained results showed that the generated clusters are fit to be used for the future load shedding schedule problem in the SEGL.

This paper presents a data mining approach which incorporates clustering Java classes, as well as classifying extracted clusters, in order to assess internal software quality. We use Java classes as entities and static metrics as attributes for data mining. We identify outliers and apply K- means clustering in order to establish clusters of classes. Outliers indicate potentially fault prone classes, whilst clusters are examined so that we can establish common characteristics. Subsequently, we apply C4.5 to build classification trees for identifying metrics which determine cluster membership. We evaluate the proposed approach with two well known open source software systems, Jedit and Apache Geronimo. Results have consolidated key findings from previous work and indicated that combining clustering with classification produces better results than stand alone clustering.

This wealth of data is an invaluable asset to researchers as they can utilize it in order to generate conclusions and identify hidden patterns and trends by using big data analytics techniques. The purpose of this study is a threefold analysis of the data that are related to the participation of students in the online forums of their University. In one hand the content of the messages posted in these fora can be efficiently analyzed by text mining techniques. On the other hand, the network of students interacting through a forum can be adequately processed through social network analysis techniques. Still, the combined knowledge attained from both of the aforementioned techniques, can provide educators with practical and valuable information for the evaluation of the learning process, especially in a distance learning environment. The study was conducted by using real data originating from the online forums of the Hellenic Open University (HOU). The analysis of the data has been accomplished by using the R and the Weka tools, in order to analyze the structure and the content of the exchanged messages in these fora as well as to model the interaction of the students in the discussion threads.

In this paper, we propose an improved algorithm for mining class association rules by using the difference between two Obidsets (d2O). Firstly, the d2O concept is developed. After that, a strategy for reducing the storage space and fast computing d2O is also derived. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than CAR-Miner.

A large number of stocks in the military inventory do not specify their consumption and usage rates per platform (e.g., ship). As a result, the demand of many critical military stocks may be under or over estimated leading to undesired operational impacts. To address this, we propose an approach to improve the platform-based military demand modelling process by deriving the demand of items with no usage models from the demands of correlated items with known per-platform usage rates. We adopt a data mining approach using sequence rule mining to automatically determine demand correlations by assessing frequently co-occurring usage patterns. Our experiments using our approach in a military operational planning system indicate a considerable reduction in the prediction errors across several categories of military supplies.

Risk Mapping of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis via a Fuzzy C Means-based Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System	1ST ISPRS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GEOSPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	1st ISPRS International Conference on Geospatial Information Research	NOV 15-17, 2014	Tehran, IRAN	ISPRS		Cutaneous Leishmaniasis; Data Mining; Fuzz C Means Clustering; Neuro-Fuzzy Systems		Finding pathogenic factors and how they are spread in the environment has become a global demand, recently. Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) created by Leishmania is a special parasitic disease which can be passed on to human through phlebotomus of vector-born. Studies show that economic situation, cultural issues, as well as environmental and ecological conditions can affect the prevalence of this disease. In this study, Data Mining is utilized in order to predict CL prevalence rate and obtain a risk map. This case is based on effective environmental parameters on CL and a Neuro-Fuzzy system was also used. Learning capacity of Neuro-Fuzzy systems in neural network on one hand and reasoning power of fuzzy systems on the other, make it very efficient to use. In this research, in order to predict CL prevalence rate, an adaptive Neuro-fuzzy inference system with fuzzy inference structure of fuzzy C Means clustering was applied to determine the initial membership functions. Regarding to high incidence of CL in Ilam province, counties of Ilam, Mehran, and Dehloran have been examined and evaluated. The CL prevalence rate was predicted in 2012 by providing effective environmental map and topography properties including temperature, moisture, annual, rainfall, vegetation and elevation. Results indicate that the model precision with fuzzy C Means clustering structure rises acceptable RMSE values of both training and checking data and support our analyses. Using the proposed data mining technology, the pattern of disease spatial distribution and vulnerable areas become identifiable and the map can be used by experts and decision makers of public health as a useful tool in management and optimal decision-making.

Using this feature in web-based social networks and considering location information shared by users as a bridge connecting the users' network to location information layer leads to the formation of Geo-Social Networks. The availability of large amounts of geographical and social data on these networks provides rich sources of information that can be utilized for studying human behavior through data analysis in a spatial-temporal-social context. This paper attempts to investigate the behavior of around 1150 users of Foursquare network by making use of their check-ins.

Interpretation of the aerial photos taken shortly after bombardments has been proven to be useful for finding the duds. Unfortunately, the reliability of this method is limited by some factors. The chance of finding a dud on an aerial photo depends strongly on the photography system, the size of the bomb and the landcover. On the other hand, exploded bombs are considerably better detectable on aerial photos and confidently represent the extent and density of a bombardment. Considering an empirical quota of unfused bombs, the expected number of duds can be calculated by the number of exploded bombs. This can help to have a better calculation of cost-risk ratio and to classify the areas for clearance. This article is about a method for calculation of a per parcel probability of dud bombs according to the distribution and density of exploded bombs. No similar work has been reported in this field by other authors.

The experiments with large publication data set show that Hybrid Graph Model outperforms some baseline approaches on several recommendation metrics.

While there exists multiple studies that analyze the factors that can help diagnose or predict AD, this is the first study that considers only non-image data, while using a multitude of techniques from machine learning and data mining. The applied methods include classification tree analysis, cluster analysis, data visualization, and classification analysis. All the analysis, except classification analysis, resulted in insights that eventually lead to the construction of a risk table for AD. The study contributes to the literature not only with new insights, but also by demonstrating a framework for analysis of such data. The insights obtained in this study can be used by individuals and health professionals to assess possible risks, and take preventive measures.

Such data is called spatiotemporal data and paths left by moving-objects are called trajectories. Recently, researchers have been targeting those trajectories for extracting interesting and useful knowledge by means of pattern analysis and data mining. But, it is difficult to analyse huge datasets of trajectories without summarizing them and visualizing them for the knowledge seeker and for the decision makers. Therefore, this research paper focuses on utilizing visual techniques and data mining analysis of trajectory patterns in order to help extract patterns and knowledge in an interactive approach. The research study proposes a research framework which integrates multiple data analysis and visualization techniques in a coherent architecture in support of interactive trajectory pattern visualization for the decision makers. An application case-study of the techniques is conducted on an airport's baggage movement data within the Baggage Handling System (BHS). The results indicate the feasibility of the approach and its methods in visually analysing trajectory patterns in an interactive approach which can support the decision maker.

The problem we tackle is implementing singular value decomposition (SVD)-a popular method for low rank approximation-in large fully distributed P2P systems in a robust and scalable manner. We assume that the matrix to be approximated is stored in a large network where each node knows one row of the matrix (personal attributes, documents, media ratings, etc). In our P2P model, we do not allow this personal information to leave the node, yet we want the nodes to collaboratively compute the SVD. Methods applied in large scale distributed systems such as synchronized parallel gradient search or distributed iterative methods are not preferable in our system model due to their requirements of synchronized rounds or their inherent issues with load balancing. Our approach overcomes these limitations with the help of a distributed stochastic gradient search in which the personal part of the decomposition remains local, and the global part (e.g., movie features) converges at all nodes to the correct value. We present a theoretical derivation of our algorithm, as well as a thorough experimental evaluation of real and synthetic data as well. We demonstrate that the convergence speed of our method is competitive while not relying on synchronization and being robust to extreme failure scenarios.

It is applied in many fields: machine learning, pattern recognition, data mining, compression,...,etc. In this paper, we introduce this technique into approximation reasoning. Before the introduction, we construct a theoretical framework of such approximation first. This approximation is based on reasoning of incomplete information in which there exists no algorithm such that the intersection between arbitrary target sets and partitioned clusters is decidable, while there exist some algorithms for the decidability of the subset operation between them. Then, under this framework, we utilize PCA to implement such approximation reasoning. PCA is mainly applied to partitioning a universe repeatedly until all the partitioned sets are singular or indecomposable. Then we collect all the partitioned clusters as the granular knowledge and then use this knowledge to approximate the target set.

The objective is to distribute the processing operations to a group of agents, a process by which to obtain efficiency and productivity that is lacking of knowledge-based systems previously implemented. This technology has established itself in recent years as a reliable option for the development of complex distributed software systems that operate in dynamic and open environments. The concept of intelligent agent, is considered in the literature as an interdisciplinary element belonging to both computer science and artificial intelligence. Certainly is that this technology has a crucial contribution in various fields: planning tasks, data mining, production planning, supply chain logistics, electronic commerce. By using these intelligent agents, it can perform tasks at a company more quickly and without human intervention, and getting the necessary information in real time (delivery terms, return the product, service, credit, dealer reputation, privacy, etc.). In this paper, I intend to develop the applicability of using intelligent agents in the electronic commerce. In this regard, I will first present a brief history and some definitions of software agents, such as autonomous and intelligent agents, several classifications and areas of application after which I proceed with to a presentation on the general applicability of agents in e-commerce.

Thereupon, the knowledge regarding hybrid rocket system has been being gained through the forepart of the conceptual design using design informatics. In the present study, the practical problem defined by using three objective functions and seven design variables for aurora observation is treated so as to contribute the real world using evolutionary computation and data mining for the field of aerospace engineering. The primary objective of the design in the present study is that the down range and the duration time in the lower thermosphere are sufficiently obtained for the aurora scientific observation, whereas the initial gross weight is held down. Investigated solid fuels are five, while liquid oxidizer is considered as liquid oxygen. The condition of single-time ignition is assumed in flight sequence in order to quantitatively investigate the ascendancy of multi-time ignition. A hybrid evolutionary computation between the differential evolution and the genetic algorithm is employed for the multidisciplinary design optimization. A self-organizing map is used for the data mining technique in order to extract global design information. Consequently, the design information regarding the tradeoffs among the objective functions, the behaviors of the design variables in the design space to become the nondominated solutions, and the implication of the design variables for the objective functions have been obtained in order to quantitatively differentiate the advantage of hybrid rocket engine in view of the five fuels. Moreover, the next assignments were also revealed.

The methodology using multi-objective design optimization and data mining, which is called MODE (Multi-Objective Design Exploration), is helpful to find out design knowledge. In this study, we show that the design knowledge found by MODE is fruitful for decision making at a conceptual design stage of real world example i.e. contour design of a fuel efficient tire. Our procedure of MODE consists of nonlinear FEA (Finite Element Analysis) to predict tire performance, evolutional computation to get desirable solutions including Pareto solution, and data mining to find out design knowledge. SOM (Self-Organizing Map) and decision tree are used to obtain appropriate design variables and their threshold. In this study, SOM with MLS (Moving Least Square) filter is proposed to obtain the structured smooth data of design variables in an objective function space. We can overlook the whole causation with the objective functions and the design variables using this map. On the other hand, the decision tree gives a rule to get the aimed performance balance. In order to demonstrate the validity of the knowledge, we produced prototype tires. The experimental results of them guaranteed the validity and the effectiveness of the knowledge and MODE. Furthermore, the latest fuel efficient tire, which was designed based on the obtained knowledge, was released in July 2013.

Past cyber-attacks had simple purposes of leaking personal information by attacking the PC or destroying the system. However, the goal of recent hacking attacks has changed from leaking information and destruction of services to attacking large-scale systems such as critical infrastructures and state agencies. In the other words, existing defence technologies to counter these attacks are based on pattern matching methods which are very limited. Because of this fact, in the event of new and previously unknown attacks, detection rate becomes very low and false negative increases. To defend against these unknown attacks, which cannot be detected with existing technology, we propose a new model based on big data analysis techniques that can extract information from a variety of sources to detect future attacks. We expect our model to be the basis of the future Advanced Persistent Threat( APT) detection and prevention system implementations.

Previously, we had limited traffic in Battlefield networks and small number of known private servers with their contents and security concerns. The users of secured server interacted with limited number of servers which were known in advance. Today, the Battlefield networking, surveillance traffic, content servers and hybrid information have increased dynamically. The present Battlefield architecture is handling only data streams of bits between-end-to-end system for content of Battlefield services and its objects. The modern battlefield techniques and architecture is constantly evolving. Therefore, we need more resources to effectively visualize the pattern of the battlefield objects and situations. This paper presents a novel architecture model for interaction between battlefield entities based on content model for search. Where the basic object of battlefield is use as content irrespective of its location to be used for higher interaction between entities.

Decision tree C4.5/J48, ID3 and ADTree algorithm, the classification algorithms in data mining which are commonly used in many areas can also be implemented to generate the classification rules. In our experiment with 128 training records, we found an overall accuracy of C4.5/J48 algorithm was 90.625%, ID3 algorithm and ADTree were 96.875%. Moreover, we extend the classification rule by applying a semantic-based approach for creating a classification tree ontology. The ontology represent about the classification rules that used to enable machines to interpret and identify learner factors in process of prediction. We also explain how ontological representation plays a role in classifying students to predictive target class. The inference layer of classification tree ontology is based on SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language), making a clarify separation of the program component and connected explicit modules. One of the major advantages of the proposed approach is that identifying success factors will give students an awareness of essential features for successful completion of their graduate studies.

Generally, drivers have many errors to handle, and the functions called in the normal execution paths and error handling paths are in pairs, which are named as paired functions. However, some developers do not handle the errors completely as they forget about or are unaware of releasing the acquired resources, thus memory leaks and other potential problems can be easily introduced. Therefore, it is highly valuable to automatically extract paired functions for these problems and detect violations for the programmers. This paper proposes an efficient tool named PF-Miner, which can automatically extract paired functions and detect violations between normal execution paths and error handling paths from the source code of C program with the data mining and statistical methods. We have evaluated PF-Miner on different versions of Android kernel 2.6.39 and 3.10.0, and 81 bugs reported by PF-Miner in 2.6.39 have been fixed before the latest version 3.10.0. PF-Miner only needs about 150 seconds to analyze the source code of 3.10.0, and 983 violations have been detected from 546 paired functions that have been extracted. We have reported the top 51 violations as potential bugs to the developers, and 15 bugs have been confirmed.

Previous studies show that a configuration bug could cause huge financial losses in a software system. The importance of configuration bugs has attracted various research studies, e.g., to detect, diagnose, and fix configuration bugs. Given a bug report, an approach that can identify whether the bug is a configuration bug could help developers reduce debugging effort. We refer to this problem as configuration bug reports prediction. To address this problem, we develop a new automated framework that applies text mining technologies on the naturallanguage description of bug reports to train a statistical model on historical bug reports with known labels (i.e., configuration or non-configuration), and the statistical model is then used to predict a label for a new bug report. Developers could apply our model to automatically predict labels of bug reports to improve their productivity. Our tool first applies feature selection techniques (e.g., information gain and Chi-square) to preprocess the textual information in bug reports, and then applies various text mining techniques (e.g., naive Bayes, SVM, naive Bayes multinomial) to build statistical models. We evaluate our solution on 5 bug report datasets including accumulo, activemq, camel, flume, and wicket. We show that naive Bayes multinomial with information gain achieves the best performance. On average across the 5 projects, its accuracy, configuration F-measure and non-configuration F-measure are 0.811, 0.450, and 0.880, respectively. We also compare our solution with the method proposed by Arshad et al.. The results show that our proposed approach that uses naive Bayes multinomial with information gain on average improves accuracy, configuration F-measure and non-configuration F-measure scores of Arshad et al.'s method by 8.34%, 103.7%, and 4.24%, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that combines static and dynamic program analysis to audit buffer overflows. Using simple rules, test data are generated to automatically confirm some of the vulnerabilities through dynamic analysis and the remaining cases are predicted by mining static code attributes. Confirmed cases can be directly fixed without further verification whereas predicted cases need to be manually reviewed to confirm existence of vulnerabilities. Since our approach combines the strengths of static and dynamic analyses, it results in an overall accuracy improvement. In our evaluation of approach using the standard benchmark suite, our classifiers achieved a recall over 92% and precision greater than 81%. The dynamic analysis component confirmed 51% of known vulnerabilities along with reporting 2 new bugs, thereby reducing by half, otherwise needed manual auditing effort.

This paper proposes a novel QoE evaluation strategy for HAS video service based on the specific features of HAS and data-mining technology. Via capturing the media description files of HAS and the request information of clients, the QoE can be monitored in real time for operators. The evaluation algorithm for the proposed strategy is trained and tested based on the data sets collected from subjective test results. The test results suggest that the predicted Mean Opinion Score (pMOS) measured by our evaluation algorithm has high correlation with the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) measured by the subjective test, and meanwhile the evaluation strategy is easy to implement for operators.

Since software maintainability is an important attribute of software quality, accurate prediction of it can help to improve overall software quality. This paper utilizes data mining of some new predictor metrics apart from traditionally used software metrics for predicting maintainability of software systems. The prediction models are constructed using static code metric datasets of four different open source software (OSS): Lucene, JHotdraw, JEdit, and JTreeview. Lucene contain 385 classes and is of 135241 lines of code (LOC) OSS, JHotdraw contain 159 classes and is of 21802 LOC OSS, JEdit contain 275 classes and is of 104053 LOC OSS and JTreeview contain 60 classes and is of 11988 LOC OSS. The metrics were collected using two different metrics extraction tools Chidamber and Kemerer Java metric (CKJM) tool and IntelliJ IDEA. Naive Bayes, Bayes Network, Logistic, MultiLayerPerceptron and Random Forest classifiers are used to identify the software modules that are difficult to maintain. Random forest models are found to be most useful in software maintainability prediction by data mining of software code metrics as random forest models have higher recall, precision and Area under curve (AUC) of ROC curve.

Although many data classification techniques and methods are nowadays available, educational data classification is full of challenges emergent in an academic credit system. One of the challenges often encountered in educational data classification is data incompleteness to early identify in-trouble students. Hence, we aim at a robust approach for this inevitable challenging problem. Different from the existing works on incomplete data handling, our work explores the semantics of incomplete data in the education domain on the application side and the two-phase characteristics of the classification task on the technical side. As a result from an empirical study on real educational data sets with different percentages of incomplete data, it is found that the robust approaches with incomplete data handling based on their semantics in relation to class information can enhance the effectiveness of educational data classifiers.

Boosting, an ensemble-based learning algorithm, has shown to improve the performance of classifiers in many situations. In this paper, we describe a new approach that is a modified version of boosting. In the ModBoost method, the sample training set is produced from the given dataset by sampling with replacement. The model is generated from the sample training set and is evaluated for error on the dataset instead of the training set. Misclassified tuples are given a higher weight and subsequently, in the next iterations the misclassified tuples are given first preferences and resampling is done for the rest of the training set. The total weights of the different classes in the new training set are rebalanced. The ModBoost method is evaluated, in terms of the F-measures, Precision, Recall and overall accuracy against large and moderately imbalanced bank marketing data set using Naive Bayesian as a base classifier. The results are promising and show that the ModBoost method compares well in comparison with AdaBoost and bagging algorithm. Our results prove empirically that ModBoost is an attractive alternative for improving the classification performance. We also provide suggestions for future research.

Organizations, now a days are in the marathon of equipping the whole system in a cloud form. The attackers evaluating data for a long time to extract the valued information to perform data mining based attacks on the cloud. In the recent architectures the data is sited in a single or distributed cloud provider. It gives the opportunity to the cloud providers and attackers to unauthorized access from cloud and also gives the chance to analyze the client data for a long time to extract the sensitive information, which is responsible for the privacy violation of clients. This paper proposes an approach that firstly maintains the confidentiality, integrity, and authentication for the stored data in cloud. Secondly, it presents distributed storage cloud architecture, which includes the description of trusted computing work group (TCG) and trusted platform module (TPM). It provides hardware authentication for trustworthy computing platform and also uses Kerberos authentication to avoid software attacks. This proposed approach establishes file locality by clustering the related data based on their physical distance and effective matching with client applications. It supports efficient clustering and reduces communication cost in large-scale cloud computing applications.

In this context, a web-based software system for storing research documents and research results has been designed and implemented. Important features of this software are its ability to store competencies and competency profiles, represent them in a graphical manner, and link them to courses and didactic approaches. The repository and its data model are supposed to form the basis for in-depth analyses of influences on the teaching and learning of software engineering for example by using data-mining methods. In the future, the software should actively support lecturers and educational scientists in their work on improving software engineering education.

In this field, dynamic weighted sequential pattern mining is applied to a computing environment that changes according to the time, and it can be applied to a variety of environments applying changes of dynamic weight. In this paper, we propose a new sequence data mining method to discover frequent sequential patterns by applying the dynamic weight. This method reduces the number of candidate patterns by using the dynamic weight according to the relative time sequence. This method reduces the memory usage and processing time more than applying the existing methods dramatically. We show the importance of dynamic weighted mining through the comparison of existing weighted pattern mining techniques.

The use of Data Mining (DM) can contribute to overcome these limitations in order to identify relevant data on patient's management and providing important information for managers to support their decisions. Throughout this study, were induced DM models capable to make predictions in a real environment using real data. For this, was adopted the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology. Three distinct techniques were considered: Decision Trees (DT), Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform classification tasks. This work explored the possibility to predict the number of patient discharges using only the number of discharges veirifed in the past. The models developed are able to predict the number of patient discharges per week with acuity values ranging from approximate to 82.69% to approximate to 94.23%. The use of these models can improve the efficiency of the administration of hospital beds. An accurate forecasting of discharges allows a better estimate of the beds available for the coming weeks.

In computer science bio-inspired optimization has different applications in different domains such as software engineering, networks, data mining, and many others. One of the main tasks in data mining is clustering, namely k-means clustering. Distance metrics are at the heart of all data mining tasks. In this paper we present a new method which applies differential evolution, one of the main bio-inspired optimization algorithms, on a time series k-means clustering task to set the weights of the distance metrics used in a combination that is used to cluster the time series. The weights are obtained by applying an optimization process that gives optimal clustering quality. We show through extensive experiments how this optimized combination outperforms all the other stand-alone distance metrics, all by keeping the same low complexity of the distance metrics used in the combination.

Information technology plays an indispensable role in promoting the industry. We utilized a web crawler to obtain online tourists' demographics and comments. This study adopts a new perspective in analyzing tourists' profiles where both quantitative (data mining) and qualitative analysis methods were performed on the data collected from one of the most frequently visited travel websites. Results from both data analysis methods that supported each other were used to build a more definite model. In this study, results show there were different groups of tourist with each group having diverse preferences. For instance, local visitors of Legoland were not satisfied with some drawbacks such as the food price whereas, international visitors praised for their enjoyable experiences spent with families. Findings from this study are useful for tourism organizations in Malaysia. Additionally, the research method using both quantitative (data mining) and qualitative methods in this study is found unique and rare in social studies.

Most of existing methods presented for detecting communities, only consider the network's graph without bringing the topics into account. In this article a new method has been discussed which uses ontology and by applying clustering algorithms regarding the topics, clusters the network. After that, by utilization of link analysis, detects communities in each cluster. Results show that this method has a better precision in detecting communities and keeping relevant communications around one topic inside a community.

As a possible solution, in this paper the modified GA is adopted to minimize the number of features in the extracted rules. "Guided Elitism" strategy is used to create elitism in the population, based on information extracted from good individuals of previous generations. The main advantage of this data structure is that it maintains partial information of good solutions, which may otherwise be lost in the selection process. Five well-known benchmark problems are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed GEGA system; Results shows comparatively high accuracy and generally lower computational time.

The managers of the organizations usually attempt to promote the personnel's efficiency as well as realizing the organizational goals in the best way they can through the creation of motivation among the personnel. The increase of resources has been one of the most basic goals in the incentive pay to the personnel is considered as a useful procedure in order to increase the motivation of bank personnel. Using data mining techniques in this paper, impact of incentive pays to personnel in an Iranian bank is analyzed on enhancing attraction of resources.

Clustering is an important data mining task that refers to the process of categorizing data objects into cohesive groups called clusters. There are many clustering approaches proposed in the literature with different quality/complexity tradeoffs. It is well known that no clustering method can sufficiently handle all types of cluster structures and properties (e.g. shape, size, overlapping, and density). The idea of combining different clustering results (cluster ensemble or clustering aggregation) emerged as an approach to overcome the weakness of single algorithms and further improve their performances. In this paper, a novel consensus function based on the theory of gravity is presented which is called "Gravitational Ensemble Clustering (GEC)". The proposed method combines "weak" clustering algorithms such as the K-means algorithm using gravitational clustering concepts. The proposed method is capable of the identification of true underlying clusters with arbitrary shapes, sizes and densities. Computational experiments were conducted to test the performance of the GEC approach using artificial and benchmark datasets. Undertaken experimental results illustrate the versatility and robustness of the proposed method, as compared to individual clusterings produced by well known clustering algorithms, and compared to other ensemble combination methods.

BeeMiner differs from the original ABC because it uses an information-theoretic heuristic function (IHF) to guide the bees to search across the most promising areas of the search space. We compare the performance of BeeMiner with those of J48, JRip, and PART on nine benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The results show that BeeMiner is competitive with J48, JRip, and PART in terms of the predictive accuracy.

The use of machine learning and data mining techniques has revolutionized the whole process of breast cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis. Breast tumors are divided in to two types; malignant and benign. In this paper we propose how to distinguish the type of breast cancer by creating a Fuzzy system (FS). To detect the type of breast censer we use a chaotic hierarchical cluster-based multispecies particle swarm optimization (CHCMSPSO) to optimization a FS indeed. The objective of this paper is to learn Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) type fuzzy rules with high accuracy. In addition to this, we will introduce chaos into the HCMSPSO in order to further enhance its global search ability. In the paper, eleven chaotic maps are used in the intelligent diagnosis system. The accuracy rate of distinguishing between benign and malignant censer is above 90 percent. However, among the chaotic maps, the Sinusoidal chaotic map provides us with the accuracy rate 99 percent because it coordinates with the problems conditions. This simulation is performed on UCI-Breast Censer data-base.

This type of complex and heterogeneous semantic data has created new challenges in the area of data mining research. Association Rule Mining is one of the most common data mining techniques which can be defined as extracting the interesting relation among large amount of transactions. Since this technique is more concerned about data representation, we can say it is the most challenging data mining technique to be applied on semantic web data. Moreover, the Semantic Web technologies offer solutions to capture and efficiently use the domain knowledge. So, in this paper, we propose a novel method to provide a way to address these challenges and enable processing huge volumes of semantic data, perform association rule discovery, store these new semantic rules using semantic richness of the concepts that exist in ontology and apply semantic technologies during all phases of mining process.

To solve these problems, an improved Apriori algorithm based on compression matrix is proposed. The improvement ideas of this algorithm are as follows: (1) reducing the times of scanning matrix set during compressing by adding two arrays to record the counts of 1 in the row and column; (2) minimizing the scale of matrix and improving space utilization by deleting the itemsets which cannot be connected and the infrequent itemsets in compressing matrix; (3) decreasing the errors of the mining result by changing the condition of deleting the unnecessary transaction column;(4) reducing the cycling number of algorithm by changing the stopping condition of program. Instance analysis and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can accurately and efficiently mines all frequent itemsets in transaction database, and improves the efficiency of mining association rules.

It consists of discovering sets of items generating high profit in a transaction database. Several efficient algorithms have been proposed for this task. But few can handle items with negative unit profits despite that such items occurs in many real-life transaction databases. Mining HUIs in a database where items have positive and negative unit profits is a very computationally expensive task. To address this issue, we present an efficient algorithm named FHN (Faster High-Utility itemset miner with Negative unit profits).

In previous studies, a user predefined gap constraint is considered in frequent closed sequential pattern mining as a parameter. However, it is difficult for users, who are lacking sufficient priori knowledge, to set suitable gap constraints. Furthermore, different gap constraints may lead to different results, and some useful patterns may be missed if the gap constraint is chosen inappropriately. To deal with this, we present a novel problem of mining frequent closed sequential patterns with non-user-defined gap constraints. In addition, we propose an efficient algorithm to find the frequent closed sequential patterns with the most suitable gap constraints. Our empirical study on protein data sets demonstrates that our algorithm is effective and efficient.

Many researchers in data mining have analysed these types of data, aiming to find interesting patterns. This paper addresses the problem of identifying and displaying tweet profiles by analysing multiple types of data: spatial, temporal, social and content. The data mining process that extracts the patterns is composed by the manipulation of the dissimilarity matrices for each type of data, which are fed to a clustering algorithm to obtain the desired patterns. This paper studies appropriate distance functions for the different types of data, the normalization and combination methods available for different dimensions and the existing clustering algorithms. The visualization platform is designed for a dynamic and intuitive usage, aimed at revealing the extracted profiles in an understandable and interactive manner. In order to accomplish this, various visualization patterns were studied and widgets were chosen to better represent the information. The use of the project is illustrated with data from the Portuguese twittosphere.

It aims to obtain a high performance classifier by labeling as little data as possible from large amount of unlabeled samples, which means sampling strategy is the core issue. Existing approaches either tend to ignore information in unlabeled data and are prone to querying outliers or noise samples, or calculate large amounts of non-informative samples leading to significant computation cost. In order to solve above problems, this paper proposed a serial active learning framework. It first measures uncertainty of unlabeled samples and selects the most uncertain sample set. From which, it further generates the most representative sample set based on the mutual information criterion. Finally, the framework selects the most informative sample from the most representative sample set based on expected error reduction strategy. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that our approach outperforms Random Sampling and the state of the art adaptive active learning method.

Decision tree is one of the most widely used classification models designed for structured data. Unstructured data such as text need to be converted to structured format before being analyzed using decision tree model. In this paper, we discuss how to construct decision trees for datasets containing unstructured data. For that purpose, a decision tree construction algorithm called CUST was proposed, which can directly tackle unstructured data. CUST introduces the use of splitting criteria formed by unstructured attribute values, and reduces the number of scans on datasets by designing appropriate data structures. Experiments on real-world datasets show that CUST improves the efficiency of building classifiers for unstructured data and performs as well as, if not better than existing solutions in classification accuracy.

The annotations of multi-label instances are typically more difficult and time consuming, since they are simultaneously associated with multiple labels. Therefore, active learning, which reduces the labeling cost by actively querying the labels of the most valuable data, becomes particularly important for multi-label learning. Study reveals that methods querying instance-label pairs are more effective than those query instances, since for each sample, only some effective labels need to be annotated while others can be inferred by exploring the label correlations. However, with the high dimensionality of label space, the instance-label pair selective algorithm will be affected since the computational cost of training a multi-label model may be strongly affected by the number of labels. In this paper we propose an approach that combines instance sampling with optimal label subset selection, which can effectively improve the classification model performance and substantially reduce the annotation cost. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach to state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets.

However, most of these techniques require fully labeled training sets, which is a challenging requirement to meet. In order to address this problem, we investigate widely used Positive and Unlabeled (PU) learning algorithms including PU information gain and a newly developed PU Gini index combining with popular parallel computing framework - Random Forest (RF), thereby enabling parallel data mining to learn from only positive and unlabeled samples. The proposed framework, termed PURF (Positive Unlabeled Random Forest), is able to learn from positive and unlabeled instances and achieve comparable classifcation performance with RF trained by fully labeled data through parallel computing according to experiments on both synthetic and real-world UCI datasets. PURF is a promising framework that facilitates PU learning in parallel data mining and is anticipated to be useful framework in many real-world parallel computing applications with huge amounts of unlabeled data.

It involves the techniques of statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition etc. In the age of big data, a huge amount of text data has been accumulated. At present, the most effective text processing way is classifying them before mining. Therefore, it has attracted great interests of scholars and researchers, and many constructive results have been achieved. But along with the increasing of training samples, the shortages of techniques and limits of their application have appeared gradually. In this paper, we propose a new strategy for classifying documents based on Huffman tree. Firstly, we find out all the candidate classifications by generating a Huffman tree, and then we design a quality measure to select the final classification. Our experiment results show that the proposed algorithm is effective and feasible.

These channels are being used as a rich data source for monitoring different real world events such as natural disasters and disease outbreaks, to name a few. However, depending on the event being investigated, this monitoring may be severely affected by data scarcity and noise, allowing just coarse grain analysis in terms of time and space, which lack the specificity necessary for supporting actions at the local level. In this context, we present a methodology to handle data scarcity and noise while monitoring real world events using social media data in a fine grain. We apply our methodology to dengue-related data from Brazil, and show how it could improve significantly the performance of event monitoring at a local scale almost doubling the correlation observed in some cases.

Data mining offers very powerful tools that can be used to analyze data in urban environments. Our research uses the UrbanContext roles model to identify the states of the individuals within urban environments. Then, it applies supervised classification data mining techniques to the results obtained, and uses decision trees in order to facilitate the analysis of the individuals' behavior.

For example, business analysts need to know the current solutions used for attracting customers in order to decide on the most appropriate marketing strategy. Meanwhile, a respectable number of organizations today exploit their online presence to boost their profits. Particularly, they utilize Content Management Systems (CMS) as the core system to support their Web Applications (WAs) thanks to their efficiency for managing digital content. In this context, having the ability to discover commonly reusable patterns can be a valuable tool in the domain-specific development process. To this end, we propose a model-driven approach for modeling WAs developed using the Joomla! CMS utilizing reverse engineering (RE) and clustering techniques. When applied to a large number of applications, it enables hypertext architects to identify patterns and discover design solutions for WAs frameworks per topic.

To this end, we extract volumes of multiple brain structures from preoperative images of a retrospective cohort of seventy-five TLE patients with surgical outcome of Engel class I. Then, we apply data mining techniques such as feature extraction, feature selection, and machine learning classifiers. Exploiting volumes of various structures and two machine learning classifiers, we examine contributions of brain structures and classifiers to the lateralization of TLE patients. Our experiments, using volumes of hippocampus and amygdala, show correct lateralization rates of 86.7% to 93.3% for decision tree and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. This reflects 6.7% to 10.6% improvement in accuracy relative to using hippocampus volume alone. Also, using volumes of hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus, we reach correct lateralization rate of 96.0% for SVM. Rules extracted from decision tree indicate that for intermediate hippocampus volumes, amygdala enlargement may determine side of epileptogenic focus. In conclusion, classification of the selected brain structures using the proposed classifiers improve decision-making of surgical resection in TLE and may reduce the need for implantation of intracranial monitoring electrodes.

Instead of taking the traditional complex physical model based approach, this paper proposes a data-driven method, leading to an effective early event detection approach for the smart grid. Our contributions are: (1) introducing the early event detection problem, (2) providing a novel method for power systems data analysis (PowerScope), i.e. finding hidden power flow features which are mutually independent, (3) proposing a learning approach for early event detection and identification based on PowerScope. Although a machine learning approach is adopted, our approach does account for physical constraints to enhance performance. By using the proposed early event detection method, we are able to obtain an event detector with high accuracy but much smaller detection time when comparing to physical model based approach. Such result shows the potential for sustainable grid services through real-time data analysis and control.

The fast growing infrastructure of wind turbines can be seen as large sensor system that screens the wind energy at a high temporal and spatial resolution. The resulting data-bases consist of huge amounts of wind energy time series data that can be used for prediction, controlling, and planning purposes. In this work, we describe WindML, a Python-based framework for wind energy related machine learning approaches. The main objective of WindML is the continuous development of tools that address important challenges induced by the growing wind energy information infrastructures. Various examples that demonstrate typical use cases are introduced and related research questions are discussed. The different modules of WindML reach from standard machine learning algorithms to advanced techniques for handling missing data and monitoring high-dimensional time series.

We focus on particular variants of the well-known ID3 algorithm allowing a high level of security and performance at the same time. Our approach is basically to design special-purpose secure multiparty computations, hence privacy will be guaranteed as long as the honest parties form a sufficiently large quorum. Our main ID3 protocol will ensure that the entire database of transactions remains secret except for the information leaked from the decision tree output by the protocol. We instantiate the underlying ID3 algorithm such that the performance of the protocol is enhanced considerably, while at the same time limiting the information leakage from the decision tree. Concretely, we apply a threshold for the number of transactions below which the decision tree will consist of a single leaf-limiting information leakage. We base the choice of the "best" predicting attribute for the root of a decision tree on the Gini index rather than the well-known information gain based on Shannon entropy, and we develop a particularly efficient protocol for securely finding the attribute of highest Gini index. Moreover, we present advanced secure ID3 protocols, which generate the decision tree as a secret output, and which allow secure lookup of predictions (even hiding the transaction for which the prediction is made). In all cases, the resulting decision trees are of the same quality as commonly obtained for the ID3 algorithm. We have implemented our protocols in Python using VIFF, where the underlying protocols are based on Shamir secret sharing. Due to a judicious use of secret indexing and masking techniques, we are able to code the protocols in a recursive manner without any loss of efficiency. To demonstrate practical feasibility we apply the secure ID3 protocols to an automated health care system of a real-life rehabilitation organization.

PSI, which allows two parties to find the intersection of their sets without revealing them to each other, has numerous applications including to privacy-preserving data mining, location-based services and genomic computations. Unfortunately, the most efficient constructions only scale to sets containing a few thousand elements-even in the semi-honest model and over a LAN. In this work, we design PSI protocols in the server-aided setting, where the parties have access to a single untrusted server that makes its computational resources available as a service. We show that by exploiting the server-aided model and by carefully optimizing and parallelizing our implementations, PSI is feasible for billion-element sets even while communicating over the Internet. As far as we know, ours is the first attempt to scale PSI to billion-element sets which represents an increase of five orders of magnitude over previous work. Our protocols are secure in several adversarial models including against a semi-honest, covert and malicious server; and address a range of security and privacy concerns including fairness and the leakage of the intersection size. Our protocols also yield efficient server-aided private equality-testing (PET) with stronger security guarantees than prior work.

Various clustering techniques have been reported, but the effectiveness of most techniques relies on the initial value of k clusters. Such an approach may not be suitable as we may not have prior knowledge on the collection of documents. To date, there are various swarm based clustering techniques proposed to address such problem, including this paper that explores the adaptation of Firefly Algorithm (FA) in document clustering. We extend the work on Gravitation Firefly Algorithm (GFA) by introducing a relocate mechanism that relocates assigned documents, if necessary. The newly proposed clustering algorithm, known as GFA_(R), is then tested on a benchmark dataset obtained from the 20Newsgroups. Experimental results on external and relative quality metrics for the GFA_(R) is compared against the one obtained using the standard GFA and Bisect K-means. It is learned that by extending GFA to becoming GFA_(R), a better quality clustering is obtained.

Mobile malware specifically targeting Android has surged and grown in tandem with the rising popularity of the platform [3, 5, 4, 6]. In response, the honus is on defenders to increase the difficulty of malware development to curb its rampant growth, and to devise effective detection mechanisms specifically targeting Android malware in order to better protect the end-users. In this paper, we address the following question: do malicious applications on Android request predictably different permissions than legitimate applications? Based on analysis of 2950 samples of benign and malicious Android applications, we propose a novel Android malware detection technique called Permission-based Malware Detection Systems (PMDS). In PMDS, we view requested permissions as behavioral markers and build a machine learning classifier on those markers to automatically identify for unseen applications potentially harmful behavior based on the combination of permissions they require. By design, PMDS has the potential to detect previously unknown, and zero-day or next-generation malware. If attackers adapt and request for fewer permissions, PMDS will have impeded the simple strategies by which malware developers currently abuse their victims. Experimental results show that PMDS detects more than 92-94% of previously unseen malware with a false positives rate of 1.52-3.93%.

There are however some issues associated with the ontologies adopted by these approaches, such as: 1) their crafting is not a cheap process, being time consuming and calling for specialist expertise; 2) they may not represent accurately the viewpoint of the targeted user community; 3) they tend to provide rather static models, which fail to keep track of evolving user perspectives. To address these issues, we propose Klink UM, an approach for extracting emergent semantics from user feedbacks, with the aim of tailoring the ontology to the users and improving the recommendations accuracy. Klink UM uses statistical and machine learning techniques for finding hierarchical and similarity relationships between keywords associated with rated items and can be used for: 1) building a conceptual taxonomy from scratch, 2) enriching and correcting an existing ontology, 3) providing a numerical estimate of the intensity of semantic relationships according to the users. The evaluation shows that Klink UM performs well with respect to handcrafted ontologies and can significantly increase the accuracy of suggestions in content-based recommender systems.

These communities are important to enable topic-centred analyses of the dynamics of the research world. In this paper we present an innovative algorithm, called Research Communities Map Builder (RCMB), which is able to automatically link diachronic topic-based communities over subsequent time intervals to identify significant events. These include topic shifts within a research community; the appearance and fading of a community; communities splitting, merging, spawning other communities; and others. The output of our algorithm is a map of research communities, annotated with the detected events, which provides a concise visual representation of the dynamics of a research area. In contrast with existing approaches, RCMB enables a much more fine-grained understanding of the evolution of research communities, with respect to both the granularity of the events and the granularity of the topics. This improved understanding can, for example, inform the research strategies of funders and researchers alike. We illustrate our approach with two case studies, highlighting the main communities and events that characterized the World Wide Web and Semantic Web areas in the 2000 - 2010 decade.

Both manual and automatic strategies trying to overcome those problems have to deal with technical issues such as time costs and computational complexity. This work is an attempt to address the quantity and quality issues through using a Neural Network model for predicting the quality of Linked Data rules. Our motivation comes from our previous work, in which we obtained large sets of atomic rules through an inductive logic inspired process traversing Linked Data. Assuming a limited amount of resources, and therefore the impossibility of trying every possible combination to obtain a better rule representing a subset of items, the major issue becomes detecting the combinations that will produce the best rule in the shortest time. Therefore, we propose to use a Neural Network to learn directly from the rules how to recognise a promising aggregation. Our experiments show that including a Neural Network-based prediction model in a rule aggregation process significantly reduces the amount of resources (time and space) required to produce high-quality rules.

An initial pool of molecules considered as sets of individual data becomes spatially separated according to the presence or absence of specific attributes like weight index or chemical groups and labels. In this connection, molecules with similar properties form a spot or blot. Finally, each blot can be visualised or analysed revealing a corresponding score index or count from the number of accumulated molecules. The entire variety of blots which emerge over time provides crucial and condensed information about the molecular system under study. Inspired by the idea to obtain significant data reduction while keeping the essential characteristics of the molecular system as output, we introduce blotting membrane systems as a modelling framework open for numerous applications in data mining. By means of three dedicated case studies, we demonstrate its descriptive capability from an explorative point of view. Our case studies address particle-based numerical integration, which suggests a model for the synchronised 17-year life cycle of Magicicadas. Furthermore, we exemplify electrophoresis as a way to carry out a variant of bucket sort.

Despite the relevance of this task, there is still lacking an integrative view of existing contributions. Additionally, there is no agreement on how to deal with the differences of physiological responses across individuals, and on how to learn from flexible sequential behavior and subtle but meaningful spontaneous variations of the signals. In this work, we rely on empirical evidence to define seven principles for a robust mining physiological signals to recognize and characterize affective states. These principles compose a coherent and complete roadmap for the development of new methods for the analysis of physiological signals. In particular, these principles address the current over-emphasis on feature-based models by including critical generative views derived from different streams of research, including multivariate data analysis and temporal data mining. Additionally, we explore how to use background knowledge related with the experimental setting and psychophysiological profiles from users to shape the learning of emotion-centered models. A methodology that integrates these principles is proposed and validated using signals collected during human-to-human and human-to-robot affective interactions.

However, data generated in network environments, such as machine logs and retail transactions, tends to be big, sparse and uncertain due to the influence of random factors including unavoidable network latency, unfaithful collection and unreliable transmission, etc. Therefore, most available PFI mining algorithms are not adequately effective on dealing with uncertain data which is greatly big and extremely sparse. To address this issue, we propose a novel tree structure, ApproxFP-Tree and a parallelized ApproxFP algorithm based on the MapReduce platform aiming to mine all PFIs in big, sparse and uncertain data efficiently. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic databases are illustrated and analyzed to show that our approach is significantly efficient than the state-of-the-art algorithms.

WMD sets different weights to different segments of the time series according to their information content, where these weights are determined using PSO. We showed how SAX in conjunction with WMD can give better results in times series classification than the original SAX which uses MINDIST. In this paper we revisit this problem and propose optimizing WMD by using a hybrid of PSO and another bio-inspired optimization method which is Bacterial Foraging (BF); an effective bio-inspired optimization algorithm in solving difficult optimization problems. We show experimentally how by using this hybrid to set the weights of WMD we can obtain better classification results than those obtained when using PSO to set these weights.

Recent data suggest that the number of fatalities from traffic crashes is in excess of 1.25 million people each year with non-fatal injuries affecting a further 20-50 million people. It is predicted that by 2030 road traffic accidents will have progressed to be the 5th leading cause of death and that the number of people who will die annually from traffic accidents will have doubled from current levels. Therefore, methods to reduce accident severity are of great interest to traffic agencies and the public at large. Road accident fatality rate depends on many factors and it is a very challenging task to investigate the dependencies between the attributes because of the many environmental and road accident factors. Any missing data in the database could obscure the discovery of important factors and lead to invalid conclusions. In order to make the traffic accident datasets useful for analysis, it should be preprocessed properly. In this paper, we present a novel method based on sampling of distributions obtained from correlation measures for the imputation of missing values to improve the quality of the traffic accident data. We evaluated our algorithm using two publicly available traffic accident databases of United States (explore.data.gov, data.opencolorado.org). Our results indicate that the proposed method performs significantly better than the three existing algorithms.

Data mining techniques can be used to derive patterns of repeating behavior from logs of past interactions between service consumers and providers. Consumers may use these patterns to detect anomalous provider behavior, while providers may seek to adapt their behavior in ways that cannot be detected by the consumer. A challenge is deriving a behavioral model that is a sufficiently precise representation of the consumer-provider interactions. Behavioral norms, which model these patterns of behavior, are used to explore these issues in a on-line photograph sharing style service.

This study investigates such differences in the case of online social networking. We find a general tendency towards gender homophily, more marked for women, however users having a large circle of friends tend to have more connections with users of the opposite gender. We also inspect the temporal sequences of adding new friends and find that females are much more likely to connect with other females as their initial friends. Through studying triangle motifs broken down by gender we detect a marked tendency of users to gender segregation, i.e. to form single gender groups; this phenomenon is more accentuated for male users.

These studies have been conducted primarily using qualitative evaluation methods, and as such are limited in terms of the geographic area they cover, the number of respondents they reach out to, and the temporal frequency with which they can be repeated. As cities are rapidly growing and evolving complex entities, complementary approaches that afford social scientists the ability to evaluate urban crime theories at scale are required. In this paper, we propose a new method whereby we mine telecommunication data and open crime data to quantitatively observe these theories. More precisely, we analyse footfall counts as recorded by telecommunication data, and extract metrics that act as proxies of urban crime theories. Using correlation analysis between such proxies and crime activity derived from open crime data records, we can reveal to what extent different theories of urban crime hold, and where. We apply this approach to the metropolitan area of London, UK and find significant correlations between crime and metrics derived from theories by Jacobs (e.g., population diversity) and by Felson and Clarke (e.g., ratio of young people). We conclude the paper with a discussion of the implications of this work on social science research practices.

This study aims at investigating the mechanical parameters that govern the harp plucking action as well as the gestural strategies set up by harpists to control a musical performance. Two specific experimental procedures have been designed to accurately describe the harpist motion in realistic playing contexts. They consist in filming the plucking action and the harpists gestures using a high-speed camera and a motion capture system, respectively. Simultaneously, acoustical measurements are performed to relate the kinematic investigation to sound features. Results describe the musical gesture characteristics. Mechanical parameters governing the finger/string interaction are highlighted and their influence on the produced sound are discussed.

We address the particular problem of finding performances of compositions for piano, which is different from often-studied problems of Query-by-Humming and Music Fingerprinting. Our MidiFind system is designed to search a million MIDI files with high precision and recall. By using a hybrid search strategy, it runs more than 1000 times faster than naive competitors, and by using a combination of bag-of-words and enhanced Levenshtein distance methods for similarity, our system achieves a precision of 99.5% and recall of 89.8%.

Unfortunately, current WSN monitoring solutions have several limitations, such as being tailored for specific applications, requiring dedicated or specific hardware, consuming precious energy and/or processing resources, or relying on manual or offline intervention. In this paper we propose an approach to anomaly detection in WSNs that addresses these limitations. The approach is based on two very simple metrics, a logging tool, and a data-mining algorithm, thus leading to the following key characteristics: very low resource consumption, application independency, very good potential for multi-WSN monitoring, and automation and simplification of the detection process. The proposed approach was validated by implementation, which showed that it is quite effective in detecting several typical anomalies.

Market segmentation is an important tool to define marketing strategies which is driving to the business goals. This study proposed a data mining technique for tourist segmentation including (1) two step clustering and (2) classification of international travelers in Thailand. Two step clustering method, in the first step Self-Organizing Map (SOM) used for determining the appropriate group's number of tourists. The performance of K-Means was the best among three candidate clustering algorithms: K-Means, FCM and SOM. They were evaluated by using Silhouette, Root Mean Square Standard Deviation (RMSSTD) and R Square (RS). Then, K-Means used for partitioning tourist data in the second step. The statistical analysis in each segment was performed. The experimental results indicated that two step clustering method provided 9 natural segments. The second stage, the tourist classification by Multi layer Perceptron (MLP) indicated the highest precision as 97.43%. Tourism industry can use the result of this study for guiding to the marketing plans or promotion campaigns.

These applications are characterized by unpredictable memory accesses and generally are memory bandwidth bound, but also presents large amounts of inherent dynamic parallelism because they can potentially spawn concurrent activities for each one of the element they are exploring. Hybrid architectures, which integrate general purpose processors with reconfigurable devices, appears promising target platforms for accelerating irregular applications. These systems often connect to distributed and multi-ported memories, potentially enabling parallel memory operations. However, these memory architectures introduce several challenges, such as the necessity to manage concurrency and synchronization to avoid structural conflicts on shared memory locations and to guarantee consistency. In this paper we present an adaptive Memory Interface Controller (MIC) that addresses these issues. The MIC is a general and customizable solution that can target several different memory structures, and is suitable for High Level Synthesis frameworks. It implements a dynamic arbitration scheme, which avoids conflicts on memory resources at runtime, and supports atomic memory operations, commonly exploited for synchronization directives in parallel programming paradigms. The MIC simultaneously maps multiple accesses to different memory ports, allowing fine grained parallelism exploitation and ensuring correctness also in the presence of irregular and statically unpredictable memory access patterns. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach on a typical irregular kernel, graph Breadth First Search (BFS), exploring different design alternatives.

This is especially critical for embedded systems powered by Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC), where ever demanding applications have to run smoothly on numerous cores, each with modest power budget. The reasons for the lack of scalability of parallel applications are numerous, and it can be time consuming for a developer to pinpoint the correct one. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic method which detects the instructions of the code which lead to a lack of scalability. The method is based on data mining techniques exploiting low level execution traces produced by MPSoC simulators. Our experiments show the accuracy of the proposed technique on five different kinds of applications, and how the information reported can be exploited by application developers.

This is a type of cancer disease arising from human breast tissue cells, usually from the lobules or the inner lining of the milk ducts that provide the ducts with milk. A recent medical survey reveals that throughout the world breast cancer occurs in 22.9% of all cancers in women and it also causes 13.7% of cancer deaths in them. Breast cancer, being very harmful to all women, may cause loss of breasts or may even cost their life. Diagnosis of breast cancer disease is an important area of data mining research. In our work, different classification techniques are applied on the benchmark Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from the UCI machine language repository for detection of breast cancer. Principal component analysis (PCA) technique has been used to reduce the dimension of the dataset. Our objectives is to diagnose and analyze breast cancer disease with the help of two well-known classifiers, namely, MLP using Backpropagation NN (MLP BPN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and, thereafter assess their performance in terms of different performance measures like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-Measure, Kappa statistic etc.	[Ghosh, Soumadip; Mondal, Sujoy; Ghosh, Bhaskar] Acad Technol, Hooghly, W Bengal, India	Ghosh, S (reprint author), Acad Technol, Hooghly, W Bengal, India.	soumadip.ghosh@aot.edu.in; sujoy.mondal@aot.edu.in						16	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-1-4799-3893-3				2014							87	90				4	Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Information Systems; Energy & Fuels	Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Energy & Fuels	BC7WO	WOS:000355253900017

The developed system acquires EMG signals from the sub-vocal region and suitable features are extracted using time-frequency transform such as Wavelet Transform. Once the features are extracted, the final classification is carried out using ensemble decision trees called Random Forests (RF). Giving the randomness in the ensemble of decision trees (DT) stacked inside the RF model, this technique can provide at the recall stage, not only the early assessment of classification, but also a probability outcome which quantifies the confidence level of the decision. The performance accuracy is found to be more than 90% when two features were considered compared to 75% with five features. Thus there is a trade-off between the input features versus the classification accuracy. Thus, the proposed data mining based technique will be highly suitable for developing EMG signal acquisition system used for bio-medical instrumentation.

The maps' topological structure and their morphology was extracted using ad hoc bots we developed and several statistics have been computed using typical graph algorithms. The process resulted in datasets containing information about all the relevant positions in the maps (the nodes in the game navigation mesh used in the Unreal game engine) and their role in the game (i.e., whether they are navigation points, ammo pickups, weapon pickups, or powerup pickups). We have applied four data mining algorithms to the data to characterize both (i) the maps' type (Duel and Team Deathmatch) based on the feature of the nodes they contain and (ii) the node types (ammo, weapon, powerup, or navigation) based on their features. Our results suggest that the maps' type can be characterized in terms of the nodes they contain but it is difficult to characterize the role of nodes based solely on their features.

The ability of a game development company to analyze and derive insights from behavioral telemetry is crucial to the success of these games which rely on in-game purchases and in-game advertising to generate revenue, and for the company to remain competitive in a global marketplace. The ability to model, understand and predict future player behavior has a crucial value, allowing developers to obtain data-driven insights to inform design, development and marketing strategies. One of the key challenges is modeling and predicting player churn. This paper presents the first cross-game study of churn prediction in Free-to-Play games. Churn in games is discussed and thoroughly defined as a formal problem, aligning with industry standards. Furthermore, a range of features which are generic to games are defined and evaluated for their usefulness in predicting player churn, e.g. playtime, session length and session intervals. Using these behavioral features, combined with the individual retention model for each game in the dataset used, we develop a broadly applicable churn prediction model, which does not rely on game-design specific features. The presented classifiers are applied on a dataset covering five free-to-play games resulting in high accuracy churn prediction.

Therefore, we need a kind of recommendation system to select the most preferable contents. Although there have been many personalization techniques proposed, there are few works on the recommendation of personal game contents. In this paper, we attempt to propose to use machine learning based on game contents with user's explicit preference (like or dislike). Especially, we incorporate game domain knowledge on the design of features for learning. As a test bed, we select a famous real-time strategy game, StarCraft, because there are many game replays played by professional players. To generate training samples, each participant is invited to review replays and express his/her preference. Using the data, machine learning algorithms build a set of models to predict preference on new replays. For five participants, we labeled two hundred StarCraft replays. The exploratory study on the selection of the features and classification algorithms show the importance of the careful selection of them. The experimental results show that the proposed recommendation system can predict the users' preference with an accuracy of 79% when we select appropriate models and features.

J	Ghane, K			IEEE	Ghane, Kamran			A Model and System for Applying Lean Six Sigma to Agile Software Development Using Hybrid Simulation	2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE (ITMC)	IEEE International Technology Management Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Technology Management Conference (ITMC)	JUN 12-15, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE				Software quality control and quality assurance have close ties with predictability, speed/time, and cost of software development. Process improvement has essential impact on these factors that drive the quality of software project outcomes. While stochastic design and process improvement methodologies based on the Lean Six Sigma can greatly help with process design and improvement, software development processes are substantially different from the processes in the other disciplines such as manufacturing or service operations that produce same/similar product/services. It's not feasible to quantify software processes in a discrete manner that is required by the Six Sigma methodologies. The discrete simulation that is used in operations such as car manufacturing relies on the fact that system activities change state at discrete time points. However this cannot be applied to software development as the activities are not repetitive and they have time estimates at best. The continuous simulation approach lacks the discrete simulation advantage of identifying inefficiencies and improving the processes along the line. Then the discrete simulation has the shortcoming of detecting consequences of improvements late in the process. The model and system introduced in this paper applies Six Sigma methodologies to software processes using hybrid simulation. It uses the relatively detailed empirical data - which the lean software development and agile methodologies produce - to simulate future activities. Such predictions are used as the baseline measurement data to assess the actual results of the continuous improvement activities. The Monte Carlo simulation is used to eliminate dependency on assumption of a specific distribution function for software development activities. The System also includes a framework for collecting process data and creating the empirical knowledge base that optimizes simulation, analytics and data mining. The System collects empirical data on process actors and uses them in simulation to provide estimations that incorporate the human factor that has substantial role in software processes. Over time the System effectively uses machine learning to improve estimation and in some cases to recommend actions to improve performance. The resulted data can be used not only for process improvement but also for evaluating impacts of factors such as outsourcing, geographical base cost, and time zone difference on the process quality.

Effective Asset Management For Hospitals with RFID	2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE (ITMC)	IEEE International Technology Management Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Technology Management Conference (ITMC)	JUN 12-15, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE		Asset Management; Healthcare Industry; Neural Network Analysis; Neural Network Forecasting; Radio Frequency Indetification	INVENTORY	The healthcare sector has been confronted with a growing necessity to reduce operational cost. Many hospitals have been focusing their efforts in optimizing their inventory management procedures through the incorporation of technological solutions such as tracking devices and data mining to come up with an ideal inventory model. Demand forecasting is an integral part of inventory management and hospitals are no exception. Time series forecasting methods are widely used in traditional approaches. Limited studies integrated asset tracking technology and neural network analysis to facilitate demand forecast. This paper proves that neural network forecasting has a key edge over traditional time series forecasting methods. It also evaluates the improvements in the efficiency of the inventory management of infusion pumps at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) due to the integration of radio frequency identification (RFID) tagging and neural network forecasting to the current work flow process to allow it to capture and manipulate the data relating to the movement and usage of the infusion pumps. Projected ward and the total in-patient usage data were compared using error analysis algorithms such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute deviation (MAD) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The potential benefits of the proposed system, contribution of current study and recommendations for future research are also mentioned at the end of this paper.	[Lee, C. K.

An IDS can be a piece of installed software or a physical appliance that monitors network traffic in order to detect unwanted activity and events such as illegal and malicious traffic, traffic that violates security policy, and traffic that violates acceptable use policies. However, Intrusion detection systems face a number of challenges. One of the important challenges is that, the input data to be classified is in a high dimension feature space. In this paper, we are trying to present MSPSO-DT intrusion detection system. Where, Multi Swam Particle Swarm Optimization (MSPSO) is used as a feature selection algorithm to maximize the C4.5 Decision Tree classifier detection accuracy and minimize the timing speed. To evaluate the performance of the presented MSPSO-DT IDS we are trying to use several experiments on NSL-KDD benchmarked network intrusion detection dataset.

The healthcare insurance is one of the cost-effective solutions to control the out-of-pocket expenditure in the sector. Nevertheless, the existing information asymmetries in the field of healthcare insurance bewilder the potential client in selecting the right policy. They are more dependent on the business agents for information and the chances of being exploited become high due to the imbalance in the information. This paper proposes an information system that makes use of semantic web techniques to minimize the information asymmetry in Indian healthcare insurance market. The emerging concepts of semantic data mining encourage the cooperative way of existence and reduced chances of exploitation of the client or patient.	[Sreekanth, V.

One of the crucial aim is to develop technological advances in civil applications and unmanned systems, in a more "designed to cost" and "electric" way. According to the above-mentioned vision, "occurrence and impact of human error is significantly reduced through new designs, training processes, technologies that support decision-making". In addition, CTNA is starting to move in this direction, in order to develop innovative technologies for unmanned airplanes. This paper proposes a technological architecture for innovation on UAS (Unmanned Air Systems) piloting systems. The design of a UAS adopting a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) platform as repository for data-mining and decision support system is discussed; the vision is to manage the autonomous capabilities of the vehicle, based both on previously simulated scenario and on real-time calculation, to adapt the behavior of the vehicle on the real operational scenario. A further step could be the collaborative evaluation of the real operational scenario trough the integration of autonomous vehicles that interact and exchange own real behavior data. To manage this big amount of data, it is necessary to grant access to design data, through the access to the above-mentioned PLM platform. The advantages of this methodology is implicit in the point of view from which we approach the PLM data repository: the Product Data Record, that gathers data coming from all the phases of the life cycle of UAS, enables an on-time centralized data management. It allows companies to operate on a single, synchronized source for all product data, improving integrity and reliability and decreasing time and cost.

As a consequence, we also do not know how brain processes are affected by nerve cell deaths in neurodegenerative diseases (ND). We can register symptoms of ND such as motor and/or mental disorders (dementias) and even provide symptomatic relief, though the structural effects of these are in most cases not yet understood. Fortunately, with early diagnosis there are often many years of disease progression with symptoms that, when they are precisely monitored, may result in improved therapies. In the case of Parkinson's disease, measurements of eye movements can be diagnostic. In order to better understand their relationship to the underlying disease process, we have performed measurements of reflexive eye movements in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We have compared our measurements and algorithmic diagnoses with experts' diagnoses. The purpose of our work was to find universal rules, using rough set theory, to classify how condition attributes predict the neurologist's diagnosis. Prediction of individual UPDRS values only from reflexive saccade (RS) latencies was not possible. But for n = 10 patients, the patient's age, latency, amplitude, and duration of RS gave a global accuracy in individual patients' UPRDS predictions of about 80%, based on cross-validation. This demonstrates that broadening the spectrum of physical measurements and applying data mining and machine learning (ML) can lead to a powerful biomarker for symptom progression in Parkinson's.

This data also has information related to specific individual. Information related to specific individual needs to be protected, so that it may not harm the privacy. Moreover sensitive information related to organization also needs to be protected. Data is released from various organizations as it is demanded by researchers and data mining companies to develop newer and better methods for finding patterns and trends. Any organization who wished to release data has two goals, one is to release the data as close as possible to the original form and second to protect the privacy of individuals and sensitive information from being released. K-anonymity has been used as successful technique in this regard. This method provides a guarantee that released data is at least k-anonymous. Various methods have been suggested to achieve k-anonymity for the given dataset. I categories these methods into four main domains based on the principle these are based and methods they are applying to achieve k-anonymous data. These methods have their respective advantages and disadvantages relating to loss of information, feasibility in real world and suitability to the number of tuples in the dataset.

As a result, routing data becomes more challenging. Ultimately routing protocols for such networks face the challenges of random topology change, nature of the link (symmetric or asymmetric) and power requirement during data transmission. Under such circumstances both, proactive as well as reactive routing are usually inefficient. We consider, zone routing protocol (ZRP) that adds the qualities of the proactive (IARP) and reactive (IERP) protocols. In ZRP, an updated topological map of zone centered on each node, is maintained. Immediate routes are available inside each zone. In order to communicate outside a zone, a route discovery mechanism is employed. The local routing information of the zones helps in this route discovery procedure. In MANET security is always an issue. It is possible that a node can turn malicious and hamper the normal flow of packets in the MANET. In order to overcome such issue we have used a clustering technique to separate the nodes having intrusive behavior from normal behavior. We call this technique as effective k-means clustering which has been motivated from k-means. We propose to implement Intrusion Detection System on each node of the MANET which is using ZRP for packet flow. Then we will use effective k-means to separate the malicious nodes from the network. Thus, our Ad-Hoc network will be free from any malicious activity and normal flow of packets will be possible.

In the past era the software users have to purchase the software with licence. But now a days clouds provide these softwares on pay and use basis to use it. This pay and use service brought more comfort to the users. Through this paper, we propose 'A Novel Cloud based and Cyclic Approach for Supervised Learning ', in the area of Data Mining. Because the data warehouses are utilizing the virtualized Iaas cloud service. i.e., the data warehouses are stored in the clouds and utilizing services of cloud. We concentrated more on classification problem in the area of data mining, because the global business scenario is entirely changed. According to these changes the need of classification become essential in all areas. Particularly to the data, which is stored in the virtual data warehouses. In the cloud hosted data warehouses the current test data set will become as training data set after some period of time. In our proposed approach we introduced the postmortem technique on the classification model to know the facts, how good the model is induced to classify the data set from the training data set. To provoke a high-quality and an efficient classification model, the model must go through the post-mortem operation to know the reality of the classification. The test data set must go through the pre-processing operation to make the data set pure and clean. This process must be done in routine.	[Babu, D.

A feasible way to address this problem is to sanitize the database to conceal sensitive information. In this paper, we focus on privacy preserving in association rule mining. In light of the tradeoff within the side effects accompanying the hiding process, we tackle this problem from a point view of multi-objective optimization. A novel association rule hiding approach was proposed based on evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithm. The binary encoding scheme was adopted in the EMO algorithm. Three side effects, including sensitive rules not hidden, nonsensitive lost rules and spurious rules were formulated as objectives to be minimized. The NSGA II algorithm, a well established EMO algorithm, was utilized to find a suitable subset of transactions to modify by removing items so that the three side effects are minimized. Experiment results were reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

However, as most of these prediction techniques need geographic pattern matching of users' trajectory data, it is possible that the techniques cannot work in a place where the user has never been before. In this paper, we propose an approach based on transportation mode and behavior semantic features to predict the next location of the users' movement. First, we identify the users' transportation mode to get sequential data of the users' motion mode. Then, we get the semantic meaning as behavior semantic features from the places where users have stopped and visited for a while. We determine the relationship between the transportation mode and behavior semantic features to predict the next location based on the Hidden Markov model. We use real world data for our experiment to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Recently, it has been attracting a lot of attention, especially in the fields of bioinformatics and spatio-temporal trajectory mining. Observing that many sequence data are born with uncertainties and huge sequence data are increasingly generated and accumulated, this paper aims to discover the hidden features from a large amount of uncertain sequence data. Specifically, Probabilistic Suffix Tree (PST) is an implementation of Variable-length Markov Chain (VMM) that has been widely applied in sequence data mining. However, the conventional PST construction algorithm is not for the mining of uncertain data and cannot bear the computing of huge data. Thus, to mine a large amount of sequence data with uncertainties, this paper proposes the uPST(M) (+)(R) algorithm on the Hadoop platform to fully utilize the computing power and storage capacity of cloud computing. The proposed uPST(M R)(+) algorithm constructs a PST in a progressive, multi-layered, and iterative manner so as to avoid excessive learning patterns and balance the overhead of distributed computing. In addition, to prevent the drag on overall performance owing to multiple scanning of the entire sequence data, we trade space for time by using a NodeArray data structure to store the intermediate statistical results to reduce disk I/O. To verify the performance of uPST(M R)(+), we conduct several experiments. The experimental results show that uPST(M R)(+) outperforms the naive approach significantly and show good scalability and stability. Also, although using NodeArray costs a little extra memory, the execution time is significantly lowered.

Such a system has great importance in applications to sport, marketing and education. In the last case, we are interested to improve state of the art in student evaluation by predicting whether a student will answer the next question correctly. This prediction will help student to get right orientation which learning area should to be given greater attention. Note that the available data are given in the form of list, but not in the traditional form of matrix. Consequently, standard factorization technique is not applicable here. However, stochastic gradient methods work well with the lists of data, where the most of relations are missing, and maybe required to be predicted. In this paper we consider optimization of the most important regulation parameters, such as numbers of factors, learning and regularization rates, numbers of global iterations. Our study is based on the Grockit and Chess data, which were used online during popular data mining contests on the platform Kaggle.

In this paper, we present a novel interestingness measure, and corresponding data mining and visualization approach, which aids the investigation and understanding of students' learning behaviors. The presented approach identifies sequential patterns of activity that distinguish groups of students (e.g., groups that received different feedback during extended, complex learning activities) by differences in both total behavior pattern usage and evolution of pattern usage over time. We demonstrate the utility of this technique through application to student learning activity data from a recent experiment with the Betty's Brain learning environment and four different feedback and learning scaffolding conditions.

Different methods have been proposed to deal with label imperfection, including robust algorithms by avoid overfitting, filtering mechanism to remove noises and correction mechanism to revise noises. In this paper, we propose an approach based on knowledge graph to perceive and correct the label errors in training data. Experiments on a medical Q&A data set reveal that our knowledge graph based approach can be effective on promoting classification performance and data quality. The results as well show our approach can work in a relatively high noise level and be applied in other data mining tasks demanding deep understanding.

There are various basic operations to manipulate families of sets over ZDDs such as union, intersection, and difference. They can be efficiently computed without decompressing ZDDs. Among them, there are many important unary operations such as computing the ZDD for all extremal sets ( maximal sets or minimal sets) from an input ZDD. Unary operations are useful in various fields such as constraint programming, data mining, and artificial intelligence. Therefore, they must be efficiently computed. In this paper, we propose a general framework for parallel unary operations on ZDDs.

In the purpose of the development of Profile Analyzer System, we are more likely aimed at analyzing individual insights such as personal behavior, habits, personality, etc. among the mass social network data. In this paper, we introduce how we realize PAS in the usage of social network data sources and represent the corresponding analysis framework as the technique basis of this system. The profile characteristics is also visualized with a set of analyzed dataset in practice.

As a result, the world is faced with unprecedented challenges and opportunities on managing the ever-growing data. These challenges are prevalent in time series for obvious reasons. Clearly, there is an urgent need for efficient solutions to mine large-scale time series databases. One of such data mining tasks is periodicity mining. Efficient and effective periodicity mining techniques in big data would be useful in cases such as finding animal migration patterns, analysis of stock market data for periodicity, and outlier detection in electrocardiogram (ECG), analyses of periodic disease outbreak etc. This work utilizes the notion of time series motifs for approximate period detection. Specifically, we present a novel and simple method to detect periods on time series data based on recurrent patterns. Our approach is effective, noise-resilient, and efficient. Experimental results show that our approach is superior compared to a popularly used period detection technique with respect to accuracy while requiring much less time and space.

High-quality health data mining results rely on having access to high-quality patient information. Yet, releasing patient-specific medical reports may potentially reveal sensitive information of individual patients. In this paper, we study the problem of anonymizing medical reports and present a solution to anonymize a collection of medical reports while preserving the information utility of the medical reports for the purpose of cluster analysis. Experimental results on a collection of real-life medical reports suggest that our proposed approach can effectively preserve both information utility and privacy protection in medical reports.

To protect these networks, intrusion detection systems are used. Signature-based intrusion detection cannot find previously unknown attacks, which is why anomaly detection is needed. However, many new systems are slow and complicated. We propose a log anomaly detection framework which aims to facilitate quick anomaly detection and also provide visualizations of the network traffic structure. The system preprocesses network logs into a numerical data matrix, reduces the dimensionality of this matrix using random projection and uses Mahalanobis distance to find outliers and calculate an anomaly score for each data point. Log lines that are too different are flagged as anomalies. The system is tested with real-world network data, and actual intrusion attempts are found. In addition, visualizations are created to represent the structure of the network data. We also perform computational time evaluation to ensure the performance is feasible. The system is fast, finds real intrusion attempts and does not need clean training data.

With heterogeneous accesses and huge traffic volumes, several pattern identification techniques have been brought into the research community. Data Mining is one of the analyses which many IDSs have adopted as an attack recognition scheme. Thus, in this paper, the classification methodology including attribute and data selections was drawn based on the well-known classification schemes, i.e., Decision Tree, Ripper Rule, Neural Networks, Naive Bayes, k-Nearest-Neighbour, and Support Vector Machine, for intrusion detection analysis using both KDD CUP dataset and recent HTTP BOTNET attacks. Performance of the evaluation was measured using recent Weka tools with a standard cross-validation and confusion matrix.

This paper proposes the new discretization algorithm called Class Attribute Interval Average (CAIA). The algorithm uses 2D-quanta matrix table to calculate each of class individual interval's average and merge the best adjacent intervals to form the new interval. The experimental design uses four-UCI data sets (Iris, Breast Cancer, Heart Diseases, Glass) and four-classification algorithms (J48, RBF, MLP, NB). The comparisons of experimental result with the other six discretization algorithms (EW, EF, ChiMerge, IEM, CAIM, CACC) show that the proposed CAIA has the best mean rank for both of the accuracy and the number of intervals.

As the volume of data grows significantly, data clustering becomes computationally prohibitive and resource demanding, and sometimes it is necessary to outsource these tasks to third party experts who specialize in data clustering. The goal of this work is to develop techniques that find common ground among experts' opinions on data clustering, which may be biased due to the features or algorithms used in clustering. Our work differs from the large body of existing approaches to consensus clustering, as we do not require all data objects be grouped into clusters. Rather, our work is motivated by real-world applications that demand high confidence in how data objects - if they are selected - are grouped together. We formulate the problem rigorously and show that it is NP-complete. We further develop a lightweight technique based on finding a maximum independent set in a 3-uniform hypergraph to select data objects that do not form conflicts among experts' opinions. We apply our proposed method to a real-world malware dataset with hundreds of thousands of instances to find malware clusters based on how multiple major AV (Anti-Virus) software classify these samples. Our work offers a new direction for consensus clustering by striking a balance between the clustering quality and the amount of data objects chosen to be clustered.

Various approaches to this problem have been proposed with high time complexity. To save computational cost, some algorithms try to shrink a data set size to a smaller amount of representative data examples. However, their user-defined shrinking ratios may significantly affect the clustering performance. In this paper, we present CLASP an effective and efficient algorithm for mining arbitrary shaped clusters. It automatically shrinks the size of a data set while effectively preserving the shape information of clusters in the data set with representative data examples. Then, it adjusts the positions of these representative data examples to enhance their intrinsic relationship and make the cluster structures more clear and distinct for clustering. Finally, it performs agglomerative clustering to identify the cluster structures with the help of a mutual k-nearest neighbors-based similarity metric called P-k. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data sets are conducted, and the results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

However, many utilities today have no grid data analytic system, or have grid data analytic systems that are operated in an off-line manner. As a result, today data analytics systems are mostly offline analysis tools and cannot properly and effectively handle impending contingencies such as load surf, sudden voltage drops, etc. Motivated by this need, we have been building an online grid data analytic system, DMAS (Data Mining and Analytics System). In this paper, we describe lessons learned from the DMAS implementation using a set of real utility data. The discussion is focused on trade-offs between diverse implementation choices when faced with the objective of fast processing of a sequence of time series utility data, its correlation with other relevant AMI and SCADA data, and report or alarm generation. Further, we show performance results measured over the real data collected from more than 100k meters, with a grid topology comprising of distribution transformers, feeders, and substations, along with weather data, customer demographic data, and billing data.

Various existing data mining techniques often through mining frequent itemsets to derive association rules and access to relevant knowledge, but with the rapid arrival of the era of big data, Traditional data mining algorithms have been unable to meet large data's analysis needs. In view of this, this paper proposes an adaptation to the big data mining parallel algorithms-MRPrePost. MRPrePost is a parallel algorithm based on Hadoop platform, which improves PrePost by way of adding a prefix pattern, and on this basis into the parallel design ideas, making MRPrePost algorithm can adapt to mining large data's association rules. Experiments show that MRPrePost algorithm is more superior than PrePost and PFP in terms of performance, and the stability and scalability of algorithms are better.

Through the study of the value contributed by symptoms to syndrome diagnosis of Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB), that is diagnosis weight, constructing symptom-syndrome scale of CHB, and realizing quantitative diagnosis from symptom to syndrome. Methods. Collecting the information from four diagnostic methods and diagnostic information of patients who were confirmed of Chronic Hepatitis B from November 2009 to April 2010 from 3 hospitals, the researchers construct a clinical record data base of Chronic Hepatitis B, which is used as the dataset for machine learning. Then association rule mining algorithm is adopted to analyze the data automatically. The confidence of the association rule between symptom and syndrome is taken as the weight of symptom contributed to syndrome diagnosis. All the weights of association rule are collected as symptom-diagnostic scale. Then a test data set is used to evaluate the accuracy of the diagnostic scale. Results. (1) Damp-Heat in the Liver and Gallbladder, Yin Deficiency of Liver and Kidney, Liver Qi Stagnation and Spleen Deficiency are three major syndromes of CHB. (2) Spider nevus, white tongue, moderate pulse and soft pulse are of decisive significance to the diagnosis of Liver Qi Stagnation and Spleen Deficiency. Scaly dry skin, heavy sensation in the limbs and body and short pulse have decisive significance to the diagnosis of Yin Deficiency of Liver and Kidney. Three symptoms are of decisive significance to the diagnosis of Damp-Heat in the Liver and Gallbladder, which are spotted tongue, withered tongue and long pulse. (3) 327 rules are achieved. 91 symptoms can be found in three syndromes of the patients. 9 symptoms can be found in the syndromes of Damp-Heat in the Liver and Gallbladder, Yin Deficiency of Liver and Kidney. 8 symptoms can be seen in Damp-Heat in the Liver and Gallbladder, Liver Qi Stagnation and Spleen Deficiency. 3 symptoms are seen in Yin Deficiency of Liver and Kidney, Liver Qi Stagnation and Spleen Deficiency. The value that every symptom contributes to the syndrome can be regarded as the differential diagnostic evidence of different syndromes. 60 cases are taken as test data set to evaluate the diagnostic scale and the accuracy reaches 83.3%. Conclusion. The diagnostic scale has a good predictive ability. Quantitative diagnosis from symptoms to syndromes can be realized by the confidence of the association rule between symptom and syndrome. The application of this method in other diseases' differentiation is up to be studied.

The reduction of incompatible equivalence relation has different alignment problem. Because the recursive algorithm is implemented in traversing the discernibility matrix, the reduction efficiency is low. According to the massive incompatible decision data, two kinds of relative attribute reduction algorithms are proposed. An incompatible decision algorithm based on equivalence class is used for relative attribute reduction of massive data. An improved information function of discernibility matrix is defined for simplifying the condition matrix in rule. Column attribute is increased for realizing the core conversion of relative attribute. Finally, the relative discernibility matrix is established to simplify the logic operation process. Experiment and simulation results show that this method can reduce the recursive computation. The easy attributes are increased, and the complex incompatible massive decision data are transformed into simple compatible decision data, and the data mining performance is improved as result.

It combines two different data mining techniques to retrieve semantically related images: clustering and association rules mining algorithm. The semantic association rules mining is constructed at the offline phase where the association rules are discovered between the text semantic clusters and the visual clusters of the images to use it later at the online phase. The experiment was conducted on more than 54,500 images of ImageCLEF 2011 Wikipedia collection. It was compared to an online image retrieving system called MMRetrieval and to the proposed system but without using association rules. The obtained results show that the proposed method achieved the best precision score among different query categories.

As the data is growing day by day, there has to be certain mechanism that could analyze such large volume of data. Data mining is a way of extracting the hidden predictive information from those data warehouses without revealing their sensitive information. Privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) is the recent research area that deals with the problem of hiding the sensitive information while analyzing data. Association Rule Hiding is one of the techniques of PPDM to hide association rules generated by Association Rule Generation Algorithms.

However the classical Apriori algorithm is used to mine a frequent pattern which is based on Support-Confidence criteria. But it does not mine significant frequent patterns from the transactional database if Quantity, Profit and weight attributes are there. So, this paper introduces a new approach which extracts significant frequent patterns by considering quantity attributes and by applying Q-factor and S-factor to the transactional database. Q-ratio is the ratio of quantity of particular items throughout all transaction to the total quantity of all items of all transaction and S-factor is the product of Q-ratio of particular items and the frequency of particular items throughout all transaction.

Clustering is a very popular technique in data mining and is a significant methodology that is performed based on the principle of diminishing the intra-cluster dissimilarities and in turn increases the inter-cluster dissimilarity. The segregation of a large database is a challenging and time consuming task. For this purpose, an approach called data labeling through sampling technique is used. Using this approach segregating large databases not only gets easier but also it increases the efficiency of clustering technique. Initially a sample data is retrieved from a large database for clustering and the residual unsampled data points are compared with the clustered data from which the similar data points are clustered and the dissimilar one are considered as outliers based on various data labeling techniques. These data labeling techniques are easier to apply in the numerical domains, whereas in the categorical domains this is a complicated task as the distance among data points are incalculable. Further the proposed methodology gives a data labeling technique based on the changes in the intra-cluster and inter-cluster dissimilarities after including unlabelled data point into existing cluster for categorical data using cluster entropy in rough set theory. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is an efficient and high quality clustering algorithm compared to that of the previous ones.	[Reddy, H. Venkateswara; Kumar, B.

Traffic signal control is recognized as one of effective ways to alleviate these problems. However, it is still hard to automatically choose appropriate traffic signal timing plans for different traffic conditions due to the dynamics and uncertainty of transportation systems. In this paper, we propose a latent factor model based traffic signal timing plan recommendation method to address this problem. In the proposed method, we model the abstract traffic states as the "users" in recommendation systems, and timing plans as the "items". And there are many explicit or implicit factors in the interactions between "users" and "items". The latent factor model is successfully used to deal with uncertain factors which cannot be modeled accurately in math. The novel method adopted the model-free adaptive idea to solve the problem of modeling from the perspective of data mining and machine learning framework. And, the proposed method is tested by using simulation data generated by a microscopic traffic simulator called Paramics. The results are compared to the baseline Webster method. The results indicate that the proposed latent factor model based recommendation method outperforms the Webster method on reducing the delay.

Authoring system is a subject that can be considered as complex as it integrates the use of scripting language like Action Script in Flash, Active Server Pages (ASP) and Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). The normal problem that resides when it comes to programming is handling error as it is not an easy task and for those who are new, might find this very troublesome. Handling the error requires proper planning and skills in analyzing problem which students usually lack at. Reflection in learning is really helpful in helping students learn the Authoring System subject effectively as they are encourage to share ideas, experiences and perspective actively on the emerging issues of Action Script topic especially in discussing the concepts and errors. With the need for reflection in developing the required skills in learning Authoring System, how then do we ensure and measure the quality in student reflection journals and its contact in assessing the subject content and students' performance in learning? Quality is defined as " processes or outcomes" [1]. In the context of this research study, quality is determined by assessing the progression of reflective processes based on the interventions given. As an educator, we need to be aware on how new technologies act as the engagers and facilitators in the reflection purposes. Blog is one of the emerging technologies that can offer such pedagogical benefits as reflective tools and social affordances across disciplines provided that one can read and make comments that lead to meaningful discussion for common interests and individual differences [2]. Although blogging enable deep reflection in each individual blogs, somehow it failed to encourage peer feedback to each other blogs and collaboration among students to support reflective thinking as expected [3]. This problem exists probably due to the minimum used of blog technical features and also the absence of activities and guidelines to elevate collaborative reflection process to take place [4]. Students' familiarity with the blog technology cannot guarantee them with the skills to use it efficiently in educational setting. They still need further expose and training on how technologies can be used beyond the technological sake [4]. Besides the use of blogs, the design of the activities should not simply indicate the progress towards the solution of the problem if to allow reflective thinking to occur. The use of case-based learning can support reflective thinking among students in learning computer-based subject. However, the implementation of case-based learning requires the presence of an instructor to guide students to solve the subject matter at hand. Instructors are therefore encouraged to regulate students thinking by integrating the metacognitive strategies in learning necessary for academic success and students should also be granted with the opportunity in using this strategy to boost the likely for students to reflect on their task and therefore contributed to their experience as a community of learners. Unfortunately, many students failed to directly engage in metacognitive thinking unless they are shown ways to do so through prudently designed instructional activities. Thus, it is vital to embed metacognitive support in the design of learning environment especially when dealing with computer education subject which involves lots of technical aspects. This study believes that the integrations of several approaches as mentioned above can granted a green light in nurturing and achieving good quality in students' reflection. In this study, the quality is heavily relied on the use of feedback either from the instructors to students or among students themselves. Most of studies regarding the reflection done before only focusing on rating students' reflection journals all alone without considering other factors that may impacting certain levels of reflection. Therefore, this study is intended to identify the impact of provision of feedback in determining the quality of students' reflection and predicting the students' performance in learning Authoring System subject. This study will employ a quantitative research design which involves the use of pre-experimental design of one group pretest-posttest type. It will be conducted in one whole semester and will involve postgraduate students who registered for Authoring System subject. Three research instruments will be used in this study: questionnaires, performance test, and student's reflection in blogs. 1. Questionnaire:-There will be two questionnaires administered in this research study. The first questionnaire is about students' perceptions regarding the educational benefits of reflection through blogging while the second questionnaire is about the students' perceptions regarding the provision of feedback both from the peers and instructors. Both questionnaires are self-developed by the researchers and will be analyzed using the Rasch Model analysis technique which is run using Winsteps software. By using Rasch Model, the findings will be more interesting and meaningful as from the students' psychometrics, researchers are able to dig into detail about the real relations between students and the measureable items. 2. Performance test:-The performance test is consists of several questions on Authoring System which cover the topic on Flash and Dreamweaver. It will be administered at the last session of the semester and is graded based on the answer scheme. The performance score will later be used in data mining analysis technique through Weka software in order to predict student's performance based on the pattern of reflection among students in learning the aforementioned subject. 3. Observations and analysis of students' reflections in blogs:-Throughout the semester, student's blogs will be monitored in order to observe their activities and to encourage them to do the reflection critically. Apart from the weekly reflections, several minicases activities will be posted in the instructor's blog and students are required to make critical reflections on each mini case. The minicase is designed to help students to apply concepts and suitable for practical in lab settings [5]. The cases will be created based on real-life practices and also from the problems encountered by the students while completing the class activities. Students' postings in the blogs will be analyzed via content analysis technique. The qualitative postings from the blogs which originally in the form of text will be coded using the four levels of reflective thinking framework by [6] and this action will transformed the qualitative data into quantitative data in terms of the frequency of occurrence. In order to measure the quality of reflection, the following analyses will be taken into account [7]: 1. Overall frequency of posting given by instructors and students. 2. Nature of posting by instructors and students (answers, questions, or mix of both). 3. Timing of the posting (during or end of forum). 4. How the postings style evolve from one level of reflective thinking to another as a result of provision of feedback by instructors and students. The general outcome of doing reflection is learning. However, this study is expected to achieve more than that. The upshot of this study will determine the quality in students' reflection and also the dominant level of reflective thinking. The outcome will further validate similar studies which previously conducted concerning the reflective thinking skills with the integration of technology, pedagogical aspects of learning for active involvement and how the students' psychometrics from the developed questionnaires can addressed the crucial information about the way students gain information and learning.

This data prefetching algorithm (DM-PAS) proposes a hybrid storage system that consists of Solid State Drives (SSD), conventional Hard Disk Drives (HDD) and Tape Drives (TD). The algorithm was originally developed to meet the growing demand of high speed data fetching in the large cloud systems. Inspired by enormous download requests to the EROS (Earth Resources Observation and Science) center of the U.S. Geological Survey, the purpose of the developed algorithm was to achieve high I/O performance and reliability and tested in a real world hybrid storage system. However, as energy efficiency in the computing system context is becoming crucial day by day, energy aware algorithms offers a distinct appeal to the data center administrators. Simulations were performed to evaluate the efficacy of the tested energy-conserving strategy DM-PAS. Simulations demonstrate that utilization of DM-PAS results in reduced energy consumption of hybrid storage systems in a dynamic environment as compared with the same storage systems without using DM-PAS.

PCA allows modeling correlations between independent variables (weather, calendar) and energy consumption at different time scales (hourly, daily, weekly monthly). Multiway principal component analysis (MPCA) is used to model time dependencies of variables as it is commonly done in batch process monitoring. This approach allows defining simple statistic indices T2 and SPE to be used in monitoring charts. These indices are used to detect abnormal behaviours at selected time scales. After detection, contribution analysis is performed to isolate variables responsible of such misbehaviour. Exploitation of such models, obtained during normal operating conditions, can be used to detect both faults in sensors and misbehaviours in consumption patterns with respect to independent variables. The paper presents the methodology and illustrates it in a case study focused on academic buildings situated in the Campus of the University of Girona. (C) 2014 The Authors.

It is the task of finding subsets of data that are sharing the same type of attributes. Text Clustering becomes one of the most critical and important solutions in data mining to discover knowledge from fast grow up web data and log files. There are many challenges, algorithms needs to be tailored specific for each domain and scale well with growing data sets. Another interesting aspect is the design of the system. A complex set components need to interact well together. This article proposes an elegant way of clustering university educations based on their text attributes. The solution is integrated directly into a Spring Web Application. A comprehensive architecture is proposed, providing the frameworks needed.

It can be adapted to capture frequently occurring local structures in images. The frequency of occurrence of these structures can be used to characterize texture. In order to mine the frequency patterns of texture, each image can be considered as one transaction. If image data mining drills down to pixel level, each pixel or its neighborhood can be taken as transaction too, and data mining was processed in all the transactions. In textural image, the frequent patterns are texture cells in fact. Because of different size of texture cells, multi-levels and multi-resolution data mining can be accomplished. One texture image has many texture cells so that the texture combined association rule can represent the texture feature; and segmentation can be accomplished based on texture combined association rules, image. The experimental results demonstrated that the combined association rules can represent both regular and random texture perfectly. Many experiments testify that 3 degrading ranks and 3x3 mask or 4 degrading ranks and 2x2 mask can mine the combined association rules which can represent the image texture perfectly. Simulation results using images consisting of man made and natural textures showed that combined association rule features performed well compared to other widely used texture features.

Previously, data stored in data warehouses follow some schema and standardization which leads to efficient data mining. However, the Big Data epoch has witnessed the rise of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data; a trend that motivated enterprises to employ the NoSQL data storages to accommodate the high-dimensional data. Unfortunately, the existing data mining techniques which are designed for schema-oriented storages are non-applicable to the unstructured data style. Thus, the AaaS though still in its infancy, is gaining widespread attention for its ability to provide novel ways and opportunities to mine the heterogeneous data. In this paper, we discuss our AaaS tool that performs terms and topics extraction and organization from unstructured data sources such as NoSQL databases, textual contents (e.g., websites), and structured sources (e.g. SQL).

With sensors deployed under the sea, the data of flow velocity are obtained via wireless communications. Based on the real historical data collected from Qinhuangdao port, which is one of the most important ports in the North China, the rules is attempted to be revealed with the data mining methods. By cluster analysis on the historical data, we classifies the days into P-days and F-days. In different kinds of days, the characteristics of the flow velocity under the water are different. It is a novel analysis of the data for the sea route monitoring. Although it is only a preliminary exploration in this field, the result is helpful to the safety and efficiently scheduling of the sea routes.

Such data are often accompanied with uncertainty due to the limitations of data collection equipment. Outlier detection on uncertain static data is a challenging research problem in data mining Moreover, the continuous arrival of data makes it more challenging. Hence, in this paper, the problem of outlier detection on uncertain time series data streams is studied. In particular, we propose a continuous distance-based outlier detection approach on a set of uncertain objects' states that are originated synchronously from a group of data sources (e.g., sensors in WSN). A set of objects' states at a timestamp is called a state set. Generally, the duration between two consecutive timestamps is very short and the state of all the objects may not change much in this duration. Therefore, we propose an incremental approach of outlier detection, which makes use of the results obtained from the previous state set to efficiently detect outliers in the current state set. In addition, an approximate incremental outlier detection approach is proposed to further reduce the cost of incremental outlier detection. Finally, an extensive empirical study on synthetic and real datasets is presented, which shows the efficiency of the proposed approaches.

But nowadays, we are facing a challenge of handling massive data in a proper and timely manner so as to extract useful information (knowledge) from streaming data. Such massive streaming data cannot be stored in our limited storage and due to its continuous flow we need to process it in single pass. Various algorithms have been provided in order to perform the single pass extraction of knowledge from streaming data; however, no single data mining algorithm can be used applicably for all the problems because of the different kinds of real data sets or synthetic data sets. This paper discusses various streaming data mining techniques and compares the algorithms taking into consideration some evaluation measures in an attempt to find the optimal solution for the generated synthetic data set.

Out of all biological signals, electro-oculogram promises to be the most appropriate residual ability which could be extracted to generate different characters for daily life communication. The precise change of corneo-retinal potential based on intension to speak/ write the words due to the change in orientation of the eye ball could be sensed and processed in real time to generate speech signals or messages to communicate. The electro-oculography (EOG) sensor and amplifier unit were designed to capture the eyeballs movement and resulted signals were processed to display messages. This paper illustrates the novel instrumentation; signal processing and data mining approaches for design of EOG based assistive devices.

It is a predictive modelling task which is defined as building a model for the target variable as a function of the explanatory variables. There are many well established techniques for classification, while decision tree is a very important and popular technique from the machine learning domain. Decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs and utility. C4.5 is a well known decision tree algorithm used for classifying datasets. The C4.5 algorithm is Quinlan's extension of his own ID3 algorithm for decision tree classification. It induces decision trees and generates rules from datasets, which could contain categorical and/or numerical attributes. The rules could he used to predict categorical values of attributes from new records. C4.5 performs well in classifying the dataset as well as in generating useful rules. In this paper, a web based software for rule generation and decision tree induction using C4.5 algorithm has been discussed. The visualization in the form of tree structure enhances the understanding of the generated rules. The software contains the feature to impute the missing values in data. The input data can both he categorical and numerical in nature. The software can import TXT, XLS and CSV data file formats. Enhanced waterfall model has been used for the software development process. This software will he useful for academicians, researchers and students working in the area of data mining, agriculture and other fields where huge amount of data is generated.

First, we propose a regularized version of the hierarchical cluster analysis for categorical data with a large number of categories. It exploits a regularized version of various test statistics of homogeneity in contingency tables as the measure of distance between two clusters. Further, our aim is cluster analysis of continuous data with a large number of variables. Various regularization techniques tailor-made for high-dimensional data have been proposed, which have however turned out to suffer from a high sensitivity to the presence of outlying measurements in the data. As a robust solution, we recommend to combine two newly proposed methods, namely a regularized version of robust principal component analysis and a regularized Mahalanobis distance, which is based on an asymptotically optimal regularization of the covariance matrix. We bring arguments in favor of the newly proposed methods.

Within this paper, we discuss the development of a method for determining actionable information. We have integrated open source information linking to human sentiment and manipulated other user selectable interlinking relative probabilities for events based upon current knowledge. Probabilistic predictions are critical in practice on many decision making applications because optimizing the user experience requires being able to compute the expected utilities of mutually exclusive pieces of content. Hierarchy game theory for decision making is valuable where two or more agents seek their own goals, possibilities of conflicts, competition and cooperation. The quality of the knowledge extracted from the information available is restricted by complexity of the model. Hierarchy game theory framework enables complex modeling of data in probabilistic modeling. However, applicability to big data is complicated by the difficulties of inference in complex probabilistic models, and by computational constraints. We focus on applying probabilistic models to evaluating emergency response activities. We specifically evaluate adversarial competition to help decide and plan how much to give in our emergency response example to capture the position of highest donor nation using mixed probabilities from game theory. Our contribution in this paper is to combine linear programming, hierarchical game theory with uncertainty modeling as a tool in order to plan for activities based on open source intelligence.

While data storage has followed the schema-dictated approach for decades, the recent nature of digital content, which is widely unstructured, creates the need to adopt different storage techniques. Thus, the NoSQL database systems have been proposed to accommodate most of the content being generated today. One of such NoSQL databases that have received significant enterprise adoption is the document-append style storage. The emerging concern and challenge however is that, research and tools that can aid data mining processes from such NoSQL databases is generally lacking. Even though document-append style storages allow data accessibility as Web services and over URL/I, building a corresponding data mining tool deviates from the underlying techniques governing web crawlers. Also, existing data mining tools that have been designed for schema-based storages (e.g., RDBMS) are misfits. Hence, our goal in this work is to design a unique data analytics tool that enables knowledge discovery through information retrieval from document-append style storage. The tool is algorithmically built on the inference-based Apriori, which aids us to achieve optimization of the search duration. Preliminary test results of the proposed tool also show high accuracy in comparison to other approaches that were previously proposed.

Most of the existing researches for this problem are based on the assumption that the tasks involved are independent. However, in practical scenarios, the QoS of some candidate services have correlations with other services, which makes the corresponding tasks be correlated with each other. This leads the QoS used to determine the binding relationship between tasks and concrete services to be inaccurate, so the reselected composite service is not the optimal one in the real executing environment for these existing reselection methods. To address this problem, this paper considers task correlations for runtime rebinding. Firstly, the QoS dependencies among services are extracted from the log repository through the APRIORI data mining method. Then, the acquired QoS dependencies are mapped to the tasks correlations by the defined mapping rules. Finally, the reselection process is implemented by making the tasks which have related relationships as a task unit, and the related services of each task unit as its candidate service set. The effectiveness of this approach, in terms of time and quality, is demonstrated via experiments.

Often adaptation and ranking (used interchangeably) of discovered Web services is carried out using functional and non-functional information of Web Services. Existing approaches are either found to be only focusing on semantic modeling and representation only, or using data mining and machine learning based approaches on unstructured and raw data to perform discovery and ranking. We propose an approach to allow semantically formalized representation of logs during Web Service execution and then use such logs to perform ranking and adaptation of discovered Web Services. We have built Semantic FP-Tree based technique to perform association rule learning on functional and non-functional characteristics of Web Services. The process of automated execution of Web Services is improved in two steps, i.e., (1) we provide semantically formalized logs that maintain well-structured and formalized information about past interactions of Services Consumers and Web Services, (2) we perform an extended association rule mining on semantically formalized logs to find out any possible correlation in functional and non-functional characteristics of Web Services during past execution which is then used in automated ranking and adaptation of Web Services.

As the scheduling capability of the Real Time Operating System (RTOS) determines its efficiency and performance when dealing with real-time critical tasks, use of more than one processing units speeds up the task processing. This paper presents an algorithm called ParaRMS, which is a Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) algorithm in parallel on multi-core architecture and has been scheduled on a multi-core system. This improves the scalability and responsiveness of the Rate monotonic scheduling algorithm which will also help scheduling the dynamic tasks effectively and offers good CPU utilization for given task set.

With increasing use of online services and attacks on these services, the importance of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for detection of DoS/DDoS attacks has also grown. Detection accuracy & CPU utilization of Data mining based IDS is directly proportional to the quality of training dataset used to train it. Various preprocessing methods like normalization, discretization, fuzzification are used by researchers to improve the quality of training dataset. This paper evaluates the effect of various data preprocessing methods on the detection accuracy of DoS/DDoS attack detection IDS and proves that numeric to binary preprocessing method performs better compared to other methods. Experimental results obtained using KDD 99 dataset are provided to support the efficiency of proposed combination.

It is to get correlations, trends, patterns, anomalies from the databases which can help to build exact future decisions. No one can assure that the decision will lead to good quality results. It only helps experts to understand the data and show the way to good decisions. An objective is to make rules from given multiple sources of customer database transaction. It needs increasingly deepening knowledge mining process for finding refined knowledge from data. Earlier work is on mining association rules at one level. Though mining association rules at various levels is necessary. Finding of interesting association relationship among large amount of data will helpful to decision building, marketing, & business managing. For generating frequent item set we are using Apriori Algorithm in multiple levels so called Multilevel Relationship algorithm (MRA). MRA works in first two stages. In third stage of MRA uses Bayesian probability to find out the dependency & relationship among different shops, pattern of sales & generates the rule for learning.

Association rule mining is a data mining process used widely in traditional databases to find the positive association rules. Association rules are created by analyzing data for frequent patterns and by using the criteria support and confidence to identify the most important relationships. However, there are some other challenging rule mining topics like negative association rule mining. In this research, a rule mining approach has been proposed that provides efficient and secure solution using positive and negative association rule computation on Asynchronous Java Script and XML (AJAX) data. By using AJAX, we get the search result in the form of semantic data. Whenever data search from database is intended, the next possible word of the search will be made available.

Yet the most important reason was a specific character of logic education. As a result, the eLogika system is a web application that provides didactic material for courses on mathematical logic. Its main goal is an automatic test generation and computer-aided test evaluation based on a large database of logic tasks. The system makes it possible to adjust the level of particular tests according to students' knowledge level. To this end we developed a feedback module that makes use of statistics and data mining methods. The system can generate a large number of training as well as exam test variants for each common thematic topic. At the same time it provides effective semi-automatic methods of test rating and evaluation. In the paper we describe particular modules of eLogika with the focus on the modules of data mining and statistics.

However, almost current data analytics and data mining method cannot apply to Big data environment, because the big data environment is opened assumption and we have to consider new methods for opened assumption. That is, we have to design a new data-driven axes creation model for correlation measurement method. Our proposed model creates axes for correlation measurement on Big data analytics. Specifically, this model infers in the Bayesian network and measures correlation in the coordinate axes. Therefore, this model maps the Bayesian network into measure correlation mutually.

Data mining is the traditional way to convert data into knowledge. In visual analytics, humans are integrated into the process as there is continuous interaction between the analyst and the analysis software. Data mining methods can be utilized also in visual analytics where the priority is given to the visualization of the information and to dimension reduction. However, the provided data is not always enough. There is a large amount of background contextual information, which should be included into the automated process. This paper describes a context-sensitive approach, in which we utilize visual analytics by studying all phases in the process according to our "sensing, processing and actuation" framework. Experimental studies show that our framework can be very useful in the process of analyzing causes for and relations between variable changes with laboratory-scale power plant data.

In this chapter we present a few algorithms for data mining compound prediction and their applications to different materials discovery problems. In particular, the patterns or correlations governing phase stability for experimental or computational inorganic compound databases are statistically learned and used to build probabilistic or regression models to identify novel compounds and their crystal structures. The stability of those compound candidates is then assessed using ab initio techniques. Finally, we report a few cases where data mining driven computational predictions were experimentally confirmed through inorganic synthesis.

In our approach, we consider the lithologic correlation task as formally equivalent to the task of DNA sequence alignment, in the domain of Bioinformatics. This allows us to use well-known sequence alignment algorithms for dealing with this task. Moreover, our approach uses a domain ontology for representing the knowledge about the domain objects. This ensures an agreement regarding the formal vocabulary used for describing the geological objects, allowing us to deal with the data collected by different geologists in a homogeneous way. Finally, we also use clustering techniques for finding groups of geological objects that are sufficiently similar for being correlated by the sequence alignment algorithms.

However, few attempts have been made to apply automated attribute weighting to categorical data clustering. Most of the existing approaches computes the weights based on the frequency of the mode category or according to the average distance of data objects from the mode of a cluster. In this paper, we adopt a different approach, investigating how to use the correlation among categorical attributes for measuring their relevancies in clustering tasks. As a result, we propose a correlation-based attribute weighting approach for categorical attributes.

However, most of the proposed approaches are designed for dealing only with numeric data. In this paper, our focus is on soft subspace clustering for categorical data. In soft subspace clustering, the attribute weighting approach plays a crucial role. Due to this, we propose an entropy-based approach for measuring the relevance of each categorical attribute in each cluster. Besides that, we propose the EBK-modes (entropy-based k-modes); an extension of the basic k-modes that uses our approach for attribute weighting. We performed experiments on five real-world datasets, comparing the performance of our algorithms with four state-of-the-art algorithms, using three well-known evaluation metrics: accuracy, f-measure and adjusted Rand index. According to the experiments, the EBK-modes outperforms the algorithms that were considered in the evaluation, regarding the considered metrics.

Consequently, researchers in Artificial Intelligence (and Multi-Agent Systems in particular) have been actively seeking methods for optimizing the performance of these networks. A promising yet challenging optimization direction is multi-agent learning: allowing agents to adapt their behavior through interaction with one another. However, understanding the dynamics of an adaptive agent network is complicated due to the large number of system parameters, the concurrency by which the system parameters change, and the delay in the effect/consequence of parameter changes. All these factors make it hard to understand why an adaptive network of agents performed well at some time and poorly at another. In this paper we present a software tool that enables researchers in the multi-agent systems field to visualize and analyze the evolution of adaptive networks. The proposed software customizes and implements techniques from data mining and social network analysis research and augment these techniques in order to analyze local agent behaviors. We use our tool to analyze two domains. In both domains we are able to report and explain interesting observations using our tool.

To address this problem, we propose to analyse feedback automatically using sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is domain dependent and although it has been applied to the educational domain before, it has not been previously used for real-time feedback. To find the best model for automatic analysis we look at four aspects: preprocessing, features, machine learning techniques and the use of the neutral class. We found that the highest result for the four aspects is Support Vector Machines (SVM) with the highest level of preprocessing, unigrams and no neutral class, which gave a 95 percent accuracy.

The paper provides a generic framework based on constraint programming to discover sequence patterns defined by constraints on local patterns (e.g., gap, regular expressions) or constraints on patterns involving combination of local patterns such as relevant subgroups and top-k patterns. This framework enables the user to mine in a declarative way both kinds of patterns. The solving step is done by exploiting the machinery of Constraint Programming. For complex patterns involving combination of local patterns, we improve the mining step by using dynamic CSP.

Set-valued data are the generalized models of single-valued data. Some mutual information-based feature selection algorithms have been extensively studied, but less effort has been made to investigate the feature selection issue with the mutual information analysis in set-valued data. Just owing to these, mutual information is firstly introduced in the set-valued data in this paper. Unlike the traditional computations, the mutual information is estimated on the unmarked objects. Correspondingly, a feature selection algorithm based on mutual information is developed, which is implemented in a dwindling universe to quicken the feature selection process. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the experimental results on different data sets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in set-valued data.

The solution of the ILP points out the transactions that need to be sanitized in order to achieve the hiding of the sensitive frequent itemsets, while the impact on other non-sensitive itemsets is minimized. We present a novel heuristic approach to calculate the coefficients of the objective function of the ILP, while at the same time we minimize the side effects introduced by the hiding process. We also propose a sanitization algorithm that performs the hiding on the selected transactions. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on real datasets and we compare the results of the newly proposed method with those of other state of the art approaches.

While there is an abundance of research on digital watermarking for image data, there is far less research on digital watermarking for vector map data, a data format used to store complex information in Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Recently, data mining methods have been used in the process of watermarking vector data. In this paper, we argue that the security of the watermarked vector maps can be increased by employing more suitable data mining methods. In particular, in this paper, we advocate the use of k-medoids partition clustering and compare its deployment with a previous watermarking scheme in which k-means partition clustering is used. The experimental results show that it outperforms the approach based on k-means according to a set of evaluation metrics.

GPS devices offer new opportunities for short-term traffic prediction, especially in arterial road networks where traditional fixed-location sensors are sparse or expensive to install. However, GPS data is often sparse both temporally and spatially. On its own, it is often insufficient for real-time traffic prediction. We consider the fusion of two types of data for the purpose of dynamic traffic prediction: GPS data that is provided as point speeds, rather than trajectories, as well as traffic data that is available from previous tracking. Inspired by the observation that a driver often has its own route selection behavior, we define a mobility pattern as a consecutive series of road segment/link selections that exhibit frequent appearance along all the itineraries of the vehicle. We predict the traffic flow using a hybrid method based on Variable-order Markov Model and adding on top of it the average speed of all the vehicles passing through each road segment. Our solution comes with a highly scalable traffic simulator application that can be used to predict, manage and optimize car traffic in cities. The prediction accuracy is estimated according to various criteria.

This collection method affects the freshness of the data and creates latency in predicting movement patterns. In addition, due to the great amount of packets being sent and received, the sensor nodes' energy is quickly exhausted. Although this data collection method might result in a higher accuracy rate for prediction, it does not extend the lifetime of the sensor network. In this paper, a distributed method is proposed in using the network structure of convex polygons. These polygons are cooperated to find the trajectories of an object and then these trajectories are used to predict objects' movement. The proposed method, based on Trajectory-tree Construction, should reduce both the storage space of collected trajectories and the time spent on trajectory prediction analysis. Simulations show that the proposed method can reduce the energy consumption of the nodes and can extend the lifetime of the network in efficient.

An important direction in this area is to construct a model to predict how long a player could be engaged with a game. This paper introduces a pure data driven method to foresee whether a player will quit the game given their previous activity within the game, by constructing decision trees from historical gameplay data of previous players. The method will be assessed on two popular commercial online games: I Am Playr and Lyroke. The former is a football game while the latter is a music game. The results indicate that the decision tree built by our method is valuable to predict the players' disengagement and that its human-readable form allow us to search out further reasons about what in-game events made them quit.

The author shall analyze this aspect, stressing that heterogeneous computerization objectively depends on the financial resources available for this activity. While computerization is a priority in such countries, it is not seen as an immediate necessity, which is why designers should identify methods and techniques to embed existing software components, particularly to meet management informing requirements. This study presents a conceptual model of integration in this context. The author outlines means of data integration and application into modern concepts of concentrated long-distance processing of IT components (cloud processing). The implementation of the integration concept proposed may result in significant financial savings for companies equipped with heterogeneous IT systems and software components. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Moreover, this domain has advanced to such lengths that most organizations possess already a standard suite of such applications. This paper introduces an eLeaming solution that is focused on exposing specialized and personalized content describing the usage of telemedicine services across widely spread geographical areas. The proposed eLeaming solution mainly consists of interactive dashboards that present in a simple, intuitive and highly visual manner the results of some complex CDR (Call Detail Records) analyses. Therefore, the system is fed by an analytical platform, whose architectural design will be further described in this paper, together with an argumentation why the proposed data modelling approach and techniques are optimal and are ready to respond to the pursued areas of interest. Overall, the aim of the eLearning solution is to help decision makers to better perceive their business from a global and analytical point of view and to understand behaviours in terms of telemedicine usage trends. This paper focuses on a line of research that has not been yet pursued, but that could impact the optimization of telemedicine services offering. In a nutshell, exposing the analysis of terabytes of CDRs through specific data-mining techniques in a clear and simplified manner supports learning about business facts and trends. Moreover, the assimilation of this type of knowledge is vital in enabling informed decisions about the optimization of provisioning telemedicine services in conformity with their actual usage. In addition, we envision an analogy to traditional Learning Analytics tools centred on personalized data visualization.

This is because the amount of information is rapidly growing and people often need it available at a click's distance. The plentiful information can be seen as a true blessing, but it can also be a real hassle through the uncategorized information leaving the user without any articulate knowledge about the searched subject. Data mining can be seen as the solution for this kind of problem, being used already in various research areas such as medicine, business, market research with immense chunks of provided data. Simply put, data mining techniques can be used to "mine" knowledge from e-learning systems by analyzing information and detecting patterns of teachers and students and, maybe the most important one, knowing and learning the students' assimilation process and learn pattern, information that can't be seen easily with the naked eye. The results can be then applied so that the learning process is more effective, by adding functionalities such as personalized learning process, feedback for professors of the didactic contents or intrusion detection tools. Data mining classification algorithms can be used, ultimately, to predict and class or students (student success, grades). Also, students can be grouped and predict or analyze their response to different teaching techniques. The objective of this study is to improve the performance of one algorithm of data mining classification using another one, having in mind their strengths and weaknesses. The test of their performance was made with the same training sets for all algorithms, firstly testing the "clean" algorithms, taken separately and then the combination of the algorithms. The algorithms used in the study are decision-trees and one instance-based algorithm, k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors). I used the C4.5 decision trees implementation (both pruned and unpruned tree) and 1-NAT and 3-NN algorithms for the instance-based one. We will see in the study whether the combined algorithm performed better than the solitary algorithms and what combination of algorithms outperforms the others.

We have got radical ways to accumulate and store these facts as meaningful information. A database is an organized collection of facts and information stored in the form of data. A good organization has to maintain lots and lots of data. There are ultimate tools which can collect and store the huge data in its proper format in the main repository but still the users doesn't get benefited from it up to its full potential. Retrieving meaningful information from such repositories requires an extensive knowledge of database languages like SQL. However, not everybody is able to write the complex SQL queries to extract the needful information. This intricate problem can be solved to a great extent by providing a Natural Language Interface to the users using which they can query a database in their own language. In this paper, we propose a Database Intelligent Querying System (DBIQS) which portrays completely automatic, simple, fast and reliable way to query a database.

Lifecycle models, development methodologies and tools have been extensively used for the same but the prime concern remains is the software defects that hinders our desire for good quality software. A lot of research work has been done on defect reduction, defect identification and defect prediction to solve this problem. This research work focus on defect prediction, a fairly new filed to work on. Artificial intelligence and data mining are the most popular methods researchers have been using recently. This research aims to use the Twin Support Vector Machine (TSVM) for predicting the number of defects in a new version of software product. This model gives a nearly perfect efficiency which compared to other models is far better. Twin Support Vector Machine based software defects prediction model using Gaussian kernel function obtains better performance as compare to earlier proposed approaches of software defect prediction. By predicting the defects in the new version, we thereby attempt to take a step to solve the problem of maintaining the high software quality. This proposed model directly shows its impact on the testing phase of the software product by simply plummeting the overall cost and efforts put in.

A feasible way to address this problem is to sanitize the database to conceal the sensitive information. In this paper, we focus on privacy preserving in association rule mining. In light of the tradeoff between hiding sensitive rules and disclosing non-sensitive ones during hiding process, we tackle this problem from a point view of multi-objective optimization. A novel association rule hiding approach was proposed based on evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithm. It adopted the model of hiding sensitive rules by deleting some items in database. Three side effects, including sensitive rules not hidden, non-sensitive lost rules and spurious rules were formulated as objectives to be minimized. The EMO algorithm was utilized to find a suitable subset of transactions to modify so that the three side effects can be minimized. Experiment results were reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Unsupervised Clustering and Multi-Optima Evolutionary Search	2014 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION (CEC)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	JUL 06-11, 2014	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE		Data Mining; Clustering; Differential Evolution; Particle Swarm Optimization; Global Optimization	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; LOCAL MINIMA; ALGORITHM; CONVERGENCE	This paper pursues a course of investigation of an approach to combine Evolutionary Computation and Data Mining for the location and computation of multiple local and global optima of an objective function. To accomplish this task we exploit the spatial concentration of the population members around the optima of the objective function. Such concentration regions are determined by applying clustering algorithms on the actual positions of the members of the population. Subsequently, the evolutionary search is confined in the interior of the regions discovered. To enable the simultaneous discovery of more than one global and local optima, we propose the use of clustering algorithms that also provide intuitive approximations for the number of clusters. Furthermore, the proposed scheme has often the potential of accelerating the convergence speed of the Evolutionary Algorithm, without the need for extra function evaluations.

Control-flow Discovery from Event Streams	2014 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION (CEC)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	JUL 06-11, 2014	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE			PROCESS MODELS; CONFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; LOGS	Process Mining represents an important research field that connects Business Process Modeling and Data Mining. One of the most prominent task of Process Mining is the discovery of a control-flow starting from event logs. This paper focuses on the important problem of control-flow discovery starting from a stream of event data. We propose to adapt Heuristics Miner, one of the most effective control-flow discovery algorithms, to the treatment of streams of event data. Two adaptations, based on Lossy Counting and Lossy Counting with Budget, as well as a sliding window based version of Heuristics Miner, are proposed and experimentally compared against both artificial and real streams. Experimental results show the effectiveness of control-flow discovery algorithms for streams on artificial and real datasets.

A Clustering-Based Approach for Exploring Sequences of Compiler Optimizations	2014 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION (CEC)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	JUL 06-11, 2014	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE			COMPILATION SEQUENCES	In this paper we present a clustering-based selection approach for reducing the number of compilation passes used in search space during the exploration of optimizations aiming at increasing the performance of a given function and/or code fragment. The basic idea is to identify similarities among functions and to use the passes previously explored each time a new function is being compiled. This subset of compiler optimizations is then used by a Design Space Exploration (DSE) process. The identification of similarities is obtained by a data mining method which is applied to a symbolic code representation that translates the main structures of the source code to a sequence of symbols based on transformation rules. Experiments were performed for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The selection of compiler optimization sequences considering a set. of 49 compilation passes and targeting a Xilinx Nlicrofilaze processor was performed aiming at latency improvements for 41 functions from Texas Instruments benchmarks. The results reveal that the passes selection based on our clustering method achieves a significant gain on execution time over the full search space still achieving important performance speedups.

Basically, clustering identifies similar data in a dataset and groups them in sets named clusters. The high number of clustering practical applications has made it a fertile research topic with several approaches. One recent method that is gaining popularity in the research community is Spectral Clustering (SC). It is a clustering method that builds a similarity graph and applies spectral analysis to preserve the data continuity in the cluster. This work presents a new algorithm inspired by SC algorithm, the Co-Evolutionary Multi-Objective Genetic Graph-based Clustering (CEMOG) algorithm, which is based on the Multi-Objective Genetic Graph-based Clustering (MOGGC) algorithm and extends it by introducing an adaptative number of clusters. CEMOG takes an island-model approach where each island keeps a population of candidate solutions for k(i) clusters. Individuals in the islands can migrate to encourage genetic diversity and the propagation of individuals around promising search regions. This new approach shows its competitive performance, compared to several classical clustering algorithms (EM, SC and K-means), through a set of experiments involving synthetic and real datasets.

One of the current application areas is outlier detection that has not been fully explored yet but has enormous potential. Web bots are an example of outliers, which can be found in the web usage analysis process. Web bot requests are different from a genuine web user as web bots crawl large numbers of pages in a very short time. If web bots remains undetected they can skew the analysis process which can result in incorrect patterns that can cause wrong decisions. In this paper we use one of the popular Swarm Intelligence (SI) based techniques called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to detect web bots among genuine user requests. We use our Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based clustering algorithm, Hierarchical Particle Swarm Optimization based clustering (HPSO-clustering) to cluster the web-usage data and detect the abnormal behaviour caused by the web bots. We present the results of detection which shows that our proposed approach is capable of detecting such abnormal behaviour. We then compare the characteristics of the detected web bots with genuine web-users using cross validation.

Classification and characterization of cancer treatment strategies are essential in the current medical era. Gene mutations and their altered expressions is the base of cancer development. Analyzing these gene mutations and gene expression data for the phenotypic classification of lung cancer is proposed in this paper. Genomic and proteomic data sets (Biomarkers) of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and its two major subtypes, Squamous Cell Cancer (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (ADC) were analyzed in this study. The biomarkers included in genomic and proteomic data sets are microRNAs, genes and their proteins. An integrated classification decision tree induction algorithm is applied on these biomarkers of NSCLC cancers for making predictions. Knowledge derived by the proposed algorithm has high classification accuracy with the ability to predict the cancer type. Cross-validation technique is applied that further enhances the classification accuracy of J48 algorithm. Thus our contribution includes the construction of decision tree using J48 weka tool for lung cancer subtypes and predict the lung cancer type for unknown class. Secondly we have compared the outputs obtained using J48 algorithm with improved decision tree (J48). Through the construction of decision tree, totally top ten classification rules are obtained using the apriori algorithm (weka tool) for predicting lung cancer. The average correction classification accuracy is nearly 99.7%, but many of the rules which are of user interest are pruned. The classification rules obtained by improved decision tree are dependent on user decision that helps to derive unlimited rules based on selection of attribute values. The improved decision tree has shown a good improvement over J48 algorithm. The findings are considered as helpful reference rules in diagnosis and drug development of SCC and ADC cancers. The accurate differential diagnosis of lung cancer by the knowledge of biomarkers could reduce the pain of histopathological examination of the patients.	[Dass, M.

Combining text-mining analyses with other data mining techniques we have collected and analyzed data on various gene and protein characters to identify, classify and reveal existing associations between characters that may favor or hinder the rate at which proteins evolve. The use of latent constructs as an integrative procedure aimed to explain from a system perspective the relationships and the strength of these genome-wide characters allowed us to find that, at least for our data set, expression and structural constructs synthesize more the information in comparison to functional constructs. Overall, this work presents an integrative methodology intended to make the most of the available genomic data and describes an alternative framework to size the strength and links between determinants of protein evolution.

Information fused from sensors and data mining analysis has recently attracted the attention of the research community for real-world applications. In this sense, the deployment of an Intelligent Offshore Oil Industry Environment will help to figure out a risky scenario based on the events occurred in the past related to anomalies and the profile of the current employee (role, location, etc.). In this paper we propose an information fusion model for an intelligent oil environment in which employees are alerted about possible risk situations while their are moving around their working place. The layered architecture, implements a reasoning engine capable of intelligently filtering the context profile of the employee (role, location) for the feature selection of an inter-transaction mining process. Depending on the employee contextual information he will receive intelligent alerts based on the prediction model that use his role and his current location. This model provides the big picture about risk analysis for that employee at that place in that moment.

Knowledge is increasingly obtained outside the company. Social networks have taken the lead because they allow the exchange of information in real time. The aim of this study is to determine if the exchange of knowledge in the professional social network LinkedIn group for Java affects the overall knowledge gain for professional work, depending on the socio-demographic characteristics of respondents, regional affiliation and professional requirements, further motivation and frequency of use of the network and the way they perceive the amount of their knowledge. Design/methodology/approach-Research is performed as follows: the survey was designed and performed on LinkedIn, the biggest global professional network, among participants of Java programming language professionals. We collected N=448 valid questionnaires from the respondents from India 37.7%, 30.9% from North America, 18.6% from Europe and other regions (12.8%), that properly represent the whole population of these group members. Data analysis (descriptive statistics) and data mining was performed. Data mining models by applying knowledge trees and linear regression were made and gave more insight into patterns. Originality/value-This research represents the most comprehensive research of knowledge sharing in professional social networks, because others have focused only on particular subgroups of variables covered here. We have conducted research, for the first time, on the gains obtained by knowledge sharing between professionals, while additional value is provided by identification of the most important factors in this process. Research provides an insight into how global processes of knowledge sharing work in theprofessional social network, how processes are affected by the socio-demographic data. Research has given an answer to the question of who has the highest benefit from this process. Practical implications-Technical skills and culture of knowledge sharing of Java technology groups on the LinkedIn social networks is a pioneering process that will be developed for other professionals in future decades. The participants' region had very little influence on the benefits gained, so these networks contribute to globalization. Gains are influenced by the intensity of use and the quality of knowledge, giving directions to the social networks service providers. Satisfaction with certain services on this professional network, compared with the satisfaction with other (non-professional) social networks is lower, which indicates the potential of this domain and need for development and research.

A continuous education and training system enables an organization to build new knowledge and competencies among its members. To have an efficient and effective education and training plan that not only meet the need of individual employees but also improve organizational competencies is an important task for human resource management. Data mining has been used to discover the hidden patterns of data from a large-scale data warehouse. After further analyses, these data patterns may be transformed into intelligent knowledge as to support various decision makings. By using data mining, this study is aimed to explore the competency gap of the individual employees, and build the training needs predicting models. These models can assist human resource department to have an education and training plan that reduce the competency gap of the individual employees and also raise organizational knowledge asset and competencies as a whole. Design/Methodology/Approach - The total amount of 638 example collected from Taiwan municipalities government 360-degree competency appraisal were used. These data were analyzed by SPSS to obtain statistic results. Data mining was used to explore the relationship among these data. Based on these results, the training needs predicting models were constructed. Originality / Value - The results show that (1) the 360-degree competency appraisal model can be used to find out the competency gap and competency status. (2) the results of SPSS and data mining can be used to construct the training needs predicting models with accuracy above 70%. (3) the staff education and training plan can be obtained based on the training needs predicting models. Practical Implications - The paper provided the reference of using data mining on the knowledge and competency management.

Enormous wealth has been made by personal data mining, while the concern about personal security has increased as well. Moreover, big data makes the traditional principle and core technology of personal data protection, both "notification & permission" and "anonymous", fail. In order to figure out the problem about the protection of personal data in big data era, this paper adopts bibliometric analysis as methodology; demonstrate various views on three main topics: what is personal data, whether it should be protected, and how to protect it if there is necessity. Finally, polycentric governance theory is applied to help explaining these questions.

Primary tumor disease is a major health problem in today's time. This paper aims at analyzing various data mining techniques for primary tumor prediction. The observations reveal that the hybrid approach of any three classifiers using Vote ensemble technique on resampled dataset has outperformed over all other single data mining classifiers. The study considers total 19 attributes by adding 'small-intestine' an attribute in the original primary tumor dataset. By addition of 'small-intestine' attribute, ensemble Vote classifier achieves high accuracy of 94.01% even when the data set contains missing values. Evaluations and results are carried out with 10-fold cross validation using Weka 3-6-10.

Hashing technique uses hash function to reduce the size of candidate item set. Direct Hashing & Pruning (DHP), Perfect Hashing & Pruning (PHP) are the basic hashing algorithms. Many algorithms have been also proposed by researchers. All algorithms have their own pros and cons. DHP algorithm suffer from collision and require more database scans to count the frequency of collided item sets. PHP algorithm eliminates collision problem but this algorithm increases the size of hash table which requires large amount of memory space and uses complex hash function. The main objective of this paper is to reduce the number of collision, database scans to count the frequency of collided item sets and to make sure that the size of hash table does not increase. A new algorithm Transaction Hashing and Pruning (THP) is proposed in this paper. THP arranges the item sets into vertical format and after finding out the bucket number of candidate-k item sets, and hashes the transaction id (TID) of that the candidate item set into that bucket. THP algorithm overcomes the item set collision problem of DHP algorithm and large hash table problem of PHP algorithm. Experimental results are also shown in the paper.

It is the only phase which ensures the reliability on the software. Generally 40-50% of the software development cost is spent on this phase. Though many automatic testing tools are present, but still most research is required in this field to reduce cost and time allotted for this phase. Test Oracle is a process which ensures that expected Oracle is obtained for the given input which increase automation process. In search - based test generation techniques test inputs are generated in a large amount. To generate expected output for each and every test input is quite a difficult and time taking job. Test - Oracle is a mechanism that can determine the expected or predicted output for each given test input. In this paper, two approaches are discussed for generation of expected outputs with the help of artificial neural network and data mining approach i.e. decision tree.

Commercial trains are equipped with state-of-the-art onboard intelligent sensors monitoring various subsystems all over the train such as tilt, traction, signalling, pantograph, doors, etc. These sensors provide real-time flow of data, called floating train data, consisting of georeferenced events, along with their spatial and temporal coordinates. Once ordered with respect to time, these events can be considered as long temporal sequences which can be mined for valuable information. The aim is to implement these information into an on-line analysis process of the incoming event stream in order to predict the occurrence of infrequent target events, i.e. severe failures requiring immediate corrective maintenance actions. In this article, we tackle the above mentioned data mining task. We propose a methodology based on pattern recognition methods in order to predict rare tilt and traction failures in sequences using past events that are less critical. The results obtained on real datasets collected from a fleet of trains highlight the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

As a result, various data-mining techniques are being used to extract useful traffic patterns. The research presented in this article focuses on the detection of disruptive traffic events such as congestion. In most transportation studies, traffic parameters are typically modeled as time series. However, these techniques fail to incorporate the spatial dependencies between different traffic variables. In this work, the traffic quantities such as speeds are considered as the signals defined at the vertices of a network line graph. Furthermore, the graph wavelet operators are applied to the spatial signals to generate the wavelet coefficients at different wavelet scales. By analyzing these wavelet coefficients, useful information such as origin, propagation, and the span of traffic congestion are inferred. For analysis, we consider two major expressways in Singapore. The analysis shows that the abrupt changes in the speed can be captured by using the wavelet coefficients at the higher scales. On the other hand, the high magnitude coefficients at the lower wavelet scales reflect the smooth flow of the traffic across the network.

Students describe their learning attitudes, tendencies and behaviors by writing their comments freely after each lesson. The main difficulty of this research is to predict students' performance by separately using two class data in each lesson. Although students learn the same subject, there exist differences between the comments in the two classes. The proposed methods basically employ latent semantic analysis (LSA) and two types of machine learning technique: SVM (support vector machine) and ANN (artificial neural network) for predicting students' final results in four grades of S, A, B and C. Moreover, an overlap method was proposed to improve the accuracy prediction results, the method allows to accept two grades for one mark to get the correct relation between LSA results and students' grades. The proposed methods achieve 50.7% and 48.7% prediction accuracy of students' grades by SVM and ANN, respectively. To this end, the results of this study reported models of students' academic performance predictors that are valuable sources of understanding students' behavior and giving feedback to them so that we can improve their learning activities.

We formalize a model for expressing the rule for predicting temperature and soil wetness from the latest environmental data of farmhouse. We show that the rule can be generated by the machine learning algorithm ID3. We research the confidence of each prediction by comparing data obtained from the experiment of cultivating farm products using a greenhouse. Based on the result, we research for finding environmental factors which are needed to create the hypothesis for the prediction of the environment transformation.

Proper sampling and feature selection contributes to reducing the size of the dataset while obtaining satisfactory results in model building. Theoretically, therefore, it is interesting to investigate whether a given dataset possesses a critical feature dimension, or the minimum number of features that is required for a given learning machine to achieve "satisfactory" performance. (Likewise, the critical sampling size problem concerns whether, for a given dataset, there is a minimum number of data points that must be included in any sample for a learning machine to achieve satisfactory performance.) Here the specific meaning of "satisfactory" performance is to be defined by the user. This paper addresses the complexity of both problems in one general theoretical setting and shows that they have the same complexity and are highly intractable. Next, an empirical method is applied in an attempt to find the approximate critical feature dimension of datasets. It is demonstrated that, under generally reasonable assumptions pertaining to feature ranking algorithms, the critical feature dimension are successfully discovered by the empirical method for a number of datasets of various sizes. The results are encouraging in achieving significant feature size reduction and point to a promising way in dealing with big data. The significance of the existence of crucial dimension in datasets is also explained.

In this paper, we try to find the most significant lifestyle risk factors associated with overweight and obesity among high school students in the US. Lifestyle survey data from the 2011 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) was used with the students' body weight statuses, overweight or obesity, considered as two target variables. Both logistic regression models and decision tree models were created for each target variable. Both the logistic regression and decision tree method show that frequently doing physical activity and having breakfast everyday were protective factors against being overweight or obese. Smoking and drinking sugar-sweeten beverage frequently were found to be associated with an increased risk to be obese.

SGLDM; FAST; FCBF		In pattern recognition and in image processing, feature extraction is a special type of dimensionality reduction. In data mining, Attribute subset selection or feature subset selection is normally helps for data reduction by removing unrelated and redundant dimensions. Given a set of image data features are extracted. From the extracted features, feature subset selection finds the subset of features that are most relevant to data mining task. The efficiency and effectiveness of the feature selection algorithm is evaluated. While the efficiency concerns the time required to find a subset of features, the effectiveness is related to the proportion of the selected features. Based on these criteria, we have used Spatial Gray Level Difference Method (SGLDM) feature extraction algorithm and Correlation based Feature Selection (CFS). Projected Classification algorithm (PROCLASS) is going to be proposed for brain image data. Experiments are going to do compare these plug-in algorithms with FAST, FCBF feature selection algorithms.

K-Means is one of the most popular data mining algorithms for being simple, scalable and easily modifiable to a variety of contexts and application domains. The major issue of traditional K-Means algorithm is that its performance depends on the initialization of centroid and requires the number of clusters to be specified in advance. Many evolutionary based clustering algorithms have been developed in recent years for selecting optimum initial centroid to optimize clustering results. Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is a population-based memetic-evolution-motivated meta-heuristic algorithm that mimics the capability of swarm. The K-Means algorithm typically uses Euclidean or squared Euclidean distance to measure the distortion between a data object and its cluster centroid. The Euclidean and squared Euclidean distances are usually computed from raw data and not from standardized data. Normalization is one of the important preprocessing steps, to transform values of all attributes. Effective data clustering can only occur if an equally effective technique for normalizing the data is applied. This paper proposes an effective partitional clustering algorithm which is developed by integrating the merits of Particle Swarm Optimization and normalization with traditional K-Means clustering algorithms. Experiments are conducted on real dataset to prove the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.	[Prabha, K. Arun] Vellalar Coll Women, Dept Comp Technol, Erode, Tamil Nadu, India; [Visalakshi, N.

The data set used in the experiments contains information recorded during the IVF treatment. In the research paper defined the supportive information to the medical practioner for knowing the success rate of patient before starting the Artificial Insemination (11). In the IVF, the doctors and patients may don't know the way of predicting the success rate of the treatment (9). The success rate may help the patients to be getting ready for the treatment physically and psychologically (8). In data mining has many tools for data reduction and prediction (5). Rough Set Theory (RST) used for the data cleaning and reduction (13). It presents the influential parameters of the IVF treatment as an output. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) gets the output of the RST as an input and built a network for the input and produce desired output. So the processes checked the result of patient and compare the desired and actual output (6). This experiment is a way of study which is related to the representativeness of the sample and irrelevant features. Out of around 250 million individuals estimated to be attempting parenthood at any given time, 13 to 19 million couples are likely to be infertile. So the couples prefer the IVF treatment compared with other methods of treatment (5). In India the board of medical council announced the duration of infertility. If a woman was not conceived after his marriage within 6 months they caused infertility [ 14]. So they must start the initial fertility treatment. Most of them prefer the In-Vitro fertilization compare with other fertility treatments (3). A survey of fertility treatment showed 1 in 20 of all pregnancies conceived by the IVF treatment. But the patients suffer from the negative imagination and they don't know the success level of the treatment (1). It is very essential to analyze the data set and reduce or clean the unwanted data that increases the prediction accuracy in a proper manner (15). The parameters with high impact factor can be selected by applying the proper reduct algorithm which removes the parameters that has a lesser role in determining the success rate of particular patients and help the Gynecologists to recommend them for specific treatment of IVF, IUI or ICSI (1).

Data mining is widely applied in the database research area in order to extract frequent correlations of values from both structured and semi structured datasets. Although various methods have been proposed for mining XML documents, the research field is still immature compared to traditional data mining. Association rule mining is an appropriate technique for extracting knowledge from these XML datasets. The classical model of association rules mining is based on support and confidence measure. The goal is to experimentally evaluate association rule mining approaches in the context of XML databases. In this work, an approach is proposed to mine XML documents using Tree-based Association Rules. Result of this approach is in the form of rules which contains structure and content information of XML documents; such rules can be stored in XML format to be queried later on. The mined knowledge is fairly accurate, intentional knowledge used to provide quick answers to queries.

The multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques are noteworthy to judge different alternatives on various criteria. In this paper, a simplified MCDM technique is applied to make a judgement on different alternatives (classifiers) among multiple criteria in financial risk datasets. For this purpose, the paired t-test statistical significance test and significant win-loss tables are used to determine the performance scores for each classifier. Then, the weights are determined using an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and finally simplified MCDM weighted sum model is applied to rank the classifiers. In addition, the efficiency of this simplified MCDM method is compared with other top MCDM methods such as TOPSIS, PROMETHEE and VIKOR to evaluate if there are any discrepancies in ranking. Analysis has been done for the three financial risk datasets from the UCI machine learning repository and surprisingly this simplified approach and the other top MCDM methods produce consistent rankings. Logistic regression and Bayesnet are ranked as the top two classifiers for financial risk datasets by this simplified approach and the other top MCDM methods. The simplified MCDM model can be applied to rank the classifiers which use simplified backgrounds in making right decisions among multiple criteria.

J	Adamczyk, M			IEEE	Adamczyk, Mateusz			Parallel Feature Selection Algorithm based on Rough Sets and Particle Swarm Optimization	FEDERATED CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS, 2014	ACSIS-Annals of Computer Science and Information Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)	SEP 07-10, 2014	Warsaw, POLAND			Feature Selection; Rough Sets; Particle Swarm Optimization; Parallel Asynchronous Particle Swarm Optimization	INFORMATION	The aim of this paper is to propose a new method of solving feature selection problem. Foundations of presented algorithm lie in the theory of rough sets. Feature selection methods based on rough sets have been used with success in many data mining problems, but their weakness is their computational complexity. In order to overcome the above-mentioned problem, researches used diverse approximation techniques. This paper presents a new approach to approximation of reducts. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a stochastic meta-heuristic similar to genetic algorithms. The idea is to see each potential solution as a particle with certain velocity flying through the problem space. The PSO finds optimal solutions by interactions of individuals in population. The main advantage of the PSO over genetic algorithms, is that PSO does not require complex operators such as crossover or mutation. It only uses simple mathematical operators to update position and velocity of each particle, which makes PSO computationally inexpensive in terms of both memory and runtime. The presented feature selection algorithm treats each feature subset as separate particle. Optimal subset, in terms of selected measure, is discovered as particles fly within the problem space. In order to speed up calculations and balance usage of hardware resources (processors, memory), parallel asynchronous version of PSO is applied. It is based on scheduling calculations of complex fitness function on slave processors, while the main one is responsible for updating particles data and checking algorithm's convergence. Applied approach scales well and provides balanced usage of given resources even if it is not feasible to use the same computational power of every processor, for instance when used resources are not homogeneous. Proposed method was tested on selected set of data sets from the UCI repository and results were compared to some of the classical algorithms.

The goal was to create an ensemble of Naive Bayes classifiers that could predict incidents involving firefighters, rescuers, children, or civilians. To this end, we first created a single Naive Bayes classifier and then partitioned the set of attributes used in that classifier. The attribute subsets were used to create new Naive Bayes classifiers that would form an ensemble, which generally performs better than both the single classifier and ensemble obtained by searching over all attributes considered when creating the single classifier. The application of our approach yielded a solution that ranked third in the competition.

Generating features from text often leads to many thousands of sparse features rarely taking non-zero values. In this work we propose a very fast and robust feature selection method that is optimised with the Naive Bayes classifier. The method takes advantage of the sparse feature representation and uses diversified backward-forward greedy search to arrive with the highly competitive solution at the minimum processing time. It promotes the paradigm of shifting the complexity of predictive systems away from the model algorithm, but towards careful data preprocessing and filtering that allows to accomplish predictive big data tasks on a single processor despite billions of data examples nominally exposed for processing. This method was applied to the AAIA Data Mining Competition 2014 concerned with predicting human injuries as a result of fire incidents based on nearly 12000 risk factors extracted from thousands of fire incident reports and scored the second place with the predictive accuracy of 96%.

The competition challenge was a feature selection problem for a set of three classifiers, each of them in a form of ensemble of naive Bayes classifiers. The method described in this paper uses a genetic algorithm approach to identify an optimal set of variables used by the classifiers. The optimal set of variables is found through a three-stage procedure that involves different settings for the genetic algorithm. The first step leads to reduction of attribute set under consideration from 11,582 to 200 attributes. The following two steps focus on finding an optimal solution by first exploring the solution space and then refining the best solution found in an earlier step.

Transactional databases are insufficient to analyze current shopping trends and as such we should consider Dynamic Datasets that updates transactions in an adhoc basis. Algorithms such as Apriori require more time to generate huge set of rules. Discovering interesting rules from the generated rules is difficult. Works that are reported until now in reducing number of rules are either time consuming or does not consider the interestingness of the user and does not focus on analysis of rules. This paper presents a case study on grocery data that uses SSFPOA semantic measure to reduce number of generated patterns, clusters the similar patterns and visualizes these clusters for easy analysis. Six graphs namely NCGraph, NSGraph, LCGraph, LSGraph, NEGraph and HGraph are proposed in VizSFP for visualizing frequent patterns. Clusters that are formed by SSFPOA are validated using clustering validating indices.

Discovering the temporal characteristics of trajectories is essential for understanding the dynamics of partial moving patterns. This paper presents an analysis approach to exploring temporal features of moving objects. The method first extracted representative routes from original trajectories, and then calculated the dominant time span of each line segment of the traveling routes, and finally visualized the routes on the map for subsequent analysis. Ocean eddies which are frequently observed in the South China Sea (SCS) were selected as a case study to test the utility of this approach. The time heterogeneity of the identified moving paths revealed potential seasonal movements of eddies, which demonstrated the ability of this analysis method to discover dynamic patterns from trajectories.

In this paper, we propose a modeling and compression technique that consists of two phases: (i) mapping networks to hypergraphs by exploiting inherent or structural semantic features; and (ii) partitioning the resulting hypergraph such that similar nodes are grouped into a number of possibly disconnected parts. The partitioned hypergraph is then processed in order to yield more structural redundancy to increase compression. We provide empirical results that compare the proposed method to random and natural orderings of select real networks using an information-theoretic measure. When modeling networks using hypergraphs as proposed here, the potential for compactness and compression increases, as observed in our experimental evaluation. This benefits a variety of domains in a variety of ways, such as social networks, biological systems, and the need to represent these as compactly as possible for faster execution of queries. We also address questions for eventual investigation.
