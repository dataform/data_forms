The proposed control chart uses as its monitoring statistic a hybrid novelty score, calculated based on the distance to local observations as well as on the distance to the convex hull constructed by its neighbors. The control limits of the proposed control chart were established based on a bootstrap method. A rigorous simulation study was conducted to examine the properties of the proposed control chart under various scenarios and compare it with existing multivariate control charts in terms of average run length (ARL) performance. The simulation results showed that the proposed control chart outperformed both the parametric and nonparametric Hotelling's T-2 control charts, especially in nonnormal situations. Moreover, experimental results with real semiconductor data demonstrated the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed control chart. To increase the capability to detect small mean shift, we propose an exponentially weighted hybrid novelty score control chart. Simulation results indicated that exponentially weighted hybrid score charts outperformed the hybrid novelty score based control charts.

J	Martin-Barragan, B; Lillo, R; Romo, J				Martin-Barragan, Belen; Lillo, Rosa; Romo, Juan			Interpretable support vector machines for functional data	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Data mining; Interpretability; Classification; Linear programming; Regularization methods; Functional data analysis	RULE EXTRACTION; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; SELECTION; LASSO	Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is known to be a powerful nonparametric classification technique even for high-dimensional data. Although predictive ability is important, obtaining an easy-to-interpret classifier is also crucial in many applications. Linear SVM provides a classifier based on a linear score. In the case of functional data, the coefficient function that defines such linear score usually has many irregular oscillations, making it difficult to interpret. This paper presents a new method, called Interpretable Support Vector Machines for Functional Data, that provides an interpretable classifier with high predictive power. Interpretability might be understood in different ways. The proposed method is flexible enough to cope with different notions of interpretability chosen by the user, thus the obtained coefficient function can be sparse, linear-wise, smooth, etc. The usefulness of the proposed method is shown in real applications getting interpretable classifiers with comparable, sometimes better, predictive ability versus classical SVM.

J	Huang, W; Yang, J; Yan, L				Huang, Wei; Yang, Jun; Yan, Li			Multi-objective design optimization of the transverse gaseous jet in supersonic flows	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article						Aerospace propulsion system; Transverse slot injection; Multi-objective design optimization; Variance analysis; Extreme difference analysis; Supersonic flow	STRESS TURBULENCE MODEL; INCIDENT SHOCK-WAVE; CROSS-FLOW; GENETIC ALGORITHM; EDDY SIMULATION; INJECTION; COMBUSTION; PREDICTION; ENGINE	The mixing process between the injectant and the supersonic crossflow is one of the important issues for the design of the scramjet engine, and the efficiency mixing has a great impact on the improvement of the combustion efficiency. A hovering vortex is formed between the separation region and the barrel shock wave, and this may be induced by the large negative density gradient. The separation region provides a good mixing area for the injectant and the subsonic boundary layer. In the current study, the transverse injection flow field with a freestream Mach number of 3.5 has been optimized by the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II) coupled with the Kriging surrogate model; and the variance analysis method and the extreme difference analysis method have been employed to evaluate the values of the objective functions. The obtained results show that the jet-to-crossflow pressure ratio is the most important design variable for the transverse injection flow field, and the injectant molecular weight and the slot width should be considered for the mixing process between the injectant and the supersonic crossflow. There exists an optimal penetration height for the mixing efficiency, and its value is about 14.3 mm in the range considered in the current study. The larger penetration height provides a larger total pressure loss, and there must be a tradeoff between these two objection functions. In addition, this study demonstrates that the multi-objective design optimization method with the data mining technique can be used efficiently to explore the relationship between the design variables and the objective functions.

The model was derived from our CPU serial implementation, named GAME (Genetic Algorithm Model Experiment). It was successfully tested and validated on the detection of candidate Globular Clusters in deep, wide-field, single band HST images. The GPU version of GAME will be made available to the community by integrating it into the web application DAMEWARE (DAta Mining Web Application REsource, http://dame.d.sf.unina.it/beta_info.html), a public data mining service specialized on massive astrophysical data. Since genetic algorithms are inherently parallel, the GPGPU computing paradigm leads to a speedup of a factor of 200x in the training phase with respect to the CPU based version.

This has motivated software engineering researchers to develop tools and techniques to allow developers to reap the benefits of these billions of lines of source code. However, collecting and analyzing such a large quantity of source code presents a number of challenges. Although the current generation of open source code search engines provides access to the source code in an aggregated repository, they generally fail to take advantage of the rich structural information contained in the code they index. This makes them significantly less useful than Sourcerer for building state-ofthe-art software engineering tools, as these tools often require access to both the structural and textual information available in source code. We have developed Sourcerer, an infrastructure for large-scale collection and analysis of open source code. By taking full advantage of the structural information extracted from source code in its repository, Sourcerer provides a foundation upon which state-ofthe-art search engines and related tools can easily be built. We describe the Sourcerer infrastructure, present the applications that we have built on top of it, and discuss how existing tools could benefit from using Sourcerer. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, some people may not notice or have no idea about the symptom of depression and arrhythmia. More research input is needed to diagnose severity of depression and arrhythmia at an early stage. To help users examine their physical fitness and mental health condition before outpatient service, we apply data mining strategy to discover association rules from responded questionnaire, including geriatric depression, BAI, ASRM, and PSQI. To obtain informative analytical results, multitudes of simulations are performed on 25,000 data stored in our database. We also propose an effective heartbeat monitoring ECG real-time detection system for homecare service, which uses the ECG sensors and a wireless sensor network technology to detect the subject's heartbeats and their variations. In addition, the MIT-BIH database is used to analyze arrhythmia. A fuzzy model is proposed to discriminate between normal heartbeats and arrhythmia. Experimental results show that an average accuracy of 95.42% is achieved by the proposed system. This evidence verifies that the hybrid intelligent model is effective in medical related applications.

Using meta-regression data mining to improve predictions of performance based on heart rate dynamics for Australian football	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Feature selection; Regression; Meta regression; Data mining; Heart rate dynamics; Australian football	RATE-VARIABILITY; MATCH PERFORMANCE; EXERCISE; RESPONSES; FITNESS	This work investigates the effectiveness of using computer-based machine learning regression algorithms and meta-regression methods to predict performance data for Australian football players based on parameters collected during daily physiological tests. Three experiments are described. The first uses all available data with a variety of regression techniques. The second uses a subset of features selected from the available data using the Random Forest method. The third used meta-regression with the selected feature subset. Our experiments demonstrate that feature selection and meta-regression methods improve the accuracy of predictions for match performance of Australian football players based on daily data of medical tests, compared to regression methods alone. Meta-regression methods and feature selection were able to obtain performance prediction outcomes with significant correlation coefficients. The best results were obtained by the additive regression based on isotonic regression for a set of most influential features selected by Random Forest. This model was able to predict athlete performance data with a correlation coefficient of 0.86 (p <0.05). Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Aircraft taxi time prediction: Comparisons and insights	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Data mining; Fuzzy rule-based system; Regression; Airport ground movement; Decision support system	LONDON-HEATHROW-AIRPORT; SUPPORT; SETS	The predicted growth in air transportation and the ambitious goal of the European Commission to have on-time performance of flights within 1 min makes efficient and predictable ground operations at airports indispensable. Accurately predicting taxi times of arrivals and departures serves as an important key task for runway sequencing, gate assignment and ground movement itself. This research tests different statistical regression approaches and also various regression methods which fall into the realm of soft computing to more accurately predict taxi times. Historic data from two major European airports is utilised for cross-validation. Detailed comparisons show that a TSK fuzzy rule-based system outperformed the other approaches in terms of prediction accuracy. Insights from this approach are then presented, focusing on the analysis of taxi-in times, which is rarely discussed in literature. The aim of this research is to unleash the power of soft computing methods, in particular fuzzy rule-based systems, for taxi time prediction problems. Moreover, we aim to show that, although these methods have only been recently applied to airport problems, they present promising and potential features for such problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

An alternative modeling approach using relational learning algorithms is developed to incorporate social network effects within a customer churn prediction setting, in order to handle large scale networks, a time dependent class label, and a skewed class distribution. An innovative approach to incorporate non-Markovian network effects within relational classifiers and a novel parallel modeling setup to combine a relational and non-relational classification model are introduced. The results of two real life case studies on large scale telcodata sets are presented, containing both networked (call detail records) and non-networked (customer related) information about millions of subscribers. A significant impact of social network effects, includingn on Markovian effects, on the performance of a customer churn prediction model is found, and the parallel model setup is shown to boost the profits generated by a retention campaign.

J	Schlechtingen, M; Santos, IF				Schlechtingen, Meik; Santos, Ilmar Ferreira			Wind turbine condition monitoring based on SCADA data using normal behavior models. Part 2: Application examples	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						ANFIS models; Condition monitoring; Wind turbine; SCADA data; Normal behavior models		This paper is part two of a two part series. The originality of part one was the proposal of a novelty approach for wind turbine supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data mining for condition monitoring purposes. The novelty concerned the usage of adaptive neuro-fuzzy interference system (ANFIS) models in this context and the application of a proposed procedure to a wide range of different SCADA signals. The applicability of the set up ANFIS models for anomaly detection was proven by the achieved performance of the models. In combination with the fuzzy interference system (FIS) proposed the prediction errors provide information about the condition of the monitored components. Part two presents application examples illustrating the efficiency of the proposed method. The work is based on continuously measured wind turbine SCADA data from 18 modern type pitch regulated wind turbines of the 2 MW class covering a period of 35 months. Several real life faults and issues in this data are analyzed and evaluated by the condition monitoring system (CMS) and the results presented. It is shown that SCADA data contain crucial information for wind turbine operators worth extracting. Using full signal reconstruction (FSRC) adaptive neuro-fuzzy interference system (ANFIS) normal behavior models (NBM) in combination with fuzzy logic (FL) a setup is developed for data mining of this information. A high degree of automation can be achieved. It is shown that FL rules established with a fault at one turbine can be applied to diagnose similar faults at other turbines automatically via the CMS proposed.

This study introduces a novel approach for exploring and comparing temporal trends within different in-patient subgroups, which is based on associated rule mining using Apriori algorithm and linear model-based recursive partitioning. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality was used to evaluate the proposed approach. This study presents a novel approach where visual analytics on big data is used for trend discovery in form of a regression tree with scatter plots in the leaves of the tree. The trend lines are used for directly comparing linear trends within a specified time frame. Our results demonstrate the existence of opposite trends in relation to age and sex based subgroups that would be impossible to discover using traditional trend-tracking techniques. Such an approach can be employed regarding decision support applications for policy makers when organizing campaigns or by hospital management for observing trends that cannot be directly discovered using traditional analytical techniques.

In this regard, a new feature selection algorithm is presented based on a rough hypercuboid approach. It selects a set of features from a data set by maximizing the relevance, dependency, and significance of the selected features. By introducing the concept of the hypercuboid equivalence partition matrix, a novel representation of degree of dependency of sample categories on features is proposed to measure the relevance, dependency, and significance of features in approximation spaces. The equivalence partition matrix also offers an efficient way to calculate many more quantitative measures to describe the inexactness of approximate classification. Several quantitative indices are introduced based on the rough hypercuboid approach for evaluating the performance of the proposed method. The superiority of the proposed method over other feature selection methods, in terms of computational complexity and classification accuracy, is established extensively on various real-life data sets of different sizes and dimensions.

With the fast development of networking, data storage, and the data collection capacity, Big Data are now rapidly expanding in all science and engineering domains, including physical, biological and biomedical sciences. This paper presents a HACE theorem that characterizes the features of the Big Data revolution, and proposes a Big Data processing model, from the data mining perspective. This data-driven model involves demand-driven aggregation of information sources, mining and analysis, user interest modeling, and security and privacy considerations.

J	Park, Y; Ghosh, J				Park, Yubin; Ghosh, Joydeep			Ensembles of alpha-Trees for Imbalanced Classification Problems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; decision trees; imbalanced data sets; lift; ensemble classification	CLASSIFIERS	This paper introduces two kinds of decision tree ensembles for imbalanced classification problems, extensively utilizing properties of alpha-divergence. First, a novel splitting criterion based on alpha-divergence is shown to generalize several well-known splitting criteria such as those used in C4.5 and CART. When the alpha-divergence splitting criterion is applied to imbalanced data, one can obtain decision trees that tend to be less correlated (alpha-diversification) by varying the value of alpha. This increased diversity in an ensemble of such trees improves AUROC values across a range of minority class priors. The second ensemble uses the same alpha trees as base classifiers, but uses a lift-aware stopping criterion during tree growth. The resultant ensemble produces a set of interpretable rules that provide higher lift values for a given coverage, a property that is much desirable in applications such as direct marketing. Experimental results across many class-imbalanced data sets, including BRFSS, and MIMIC data sets from the medical community and several sets from UCI and KEEL are provided to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed ensembles over a wide range of data distributions and of class imbalance.

J	Albanese, A; Pal, SK; Petrosino, A				Albanese, Alessia; Pal, Sankar K.; Petrosino, Alfredo			Rough Sets, Kernel Set, and Spatiotemporal Outlier Detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Spatiotemporal data; outlier detection; spatiotemporal uncertainty management; rough set and granular computing	DIMENSIONAL DATA SETS; LOCAL OUTLIERS; ALGORITHM; DEPTH	Nowadays, the high availability of data gathered from wireless sensor networks and telecommunication systems has drawn the attention of researchers on the problem of extracting knowledge from spatiotemporal data. Detecting outliers which are grossly different from or inconsistent with the remaining spatiotemporal data set is a major challenge in real-world knowledge discovery and data mining applications. In this paper, we deal with the outlier detection problem in spatiotemporal data and describe a rough set approach that finds the top outliers in an unlabeled spatiotemporal data set. The proposed method, called Rough Outlier Set Extraction (ROSE), relies on a rough set theoretic representation of the outlier set using the rough set approximations, i.e., lower and upper approximations. We have also introduced a new set, named Kernel Set, that is a subset of the original data set, which is able to describe the original data set both in terms of data structure and of obtained results. Experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate the superiority of ROSE, both in terms of some quantitative indices and outliers detected, over those obtained by various rough fuzzy clustering algorithms and by the state-of-the-art outlier detection methods. It is also demonstrated that the kernel set is able to detect the same outliers set but with less computational time.

J	Zhu, L; Cao, LB; Yang, J; Lei, JS				Zhu, Lin; Cao, Longbing; Yang, Jie; Lei, Jingsheng			Evolving soft subspace clustering	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Subspace clustering; Data stream clustering; Online clustering; Scalable clustering	GENE-EXPRESSION; K-MEANS; VECTOR QUANTIZATION; PREDICTION; CONVERGENCE; ALGORITHMS; CANCER	A key challenge to most conventional clustering algorithms in handling many real world problems is that, data points in different clusters are often correlated with different subsets of features. To address this problem, subspace clustering has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In practical data mining applications, data points may arrive in continuous streams with chunks of samples being collected at different time points. In addition, huge amounts of data often cannot be kept in the main memory due to memory restriction. Accordingly, a range of evolving clustering algorithms has been proposed, however, traditional evolving clustering methods cannot be effectively applied to large-scale high dimensional data and data streams. In this study, we extend the online learning strategy and scalable clustering technique to soft subspace clustering to form evolving soft subspace clustering. We propose two online soft subspace clustering algorithms, OFWSC and OEWSC, and two streaming soft subspace clustering algorithms, SSSC_F and SSSC_E. The proposed evolving soft subspace clustering leverages on the effectiveness of online learning scheme and scalable clustering methods for streaming data by revealing the important local subspace characteristics of high dimensional data. Substantial experimental results on both artificial and real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed methods are generally effective in evolving clustering and achieve superior performance over existing soft subspace clustering techniques.

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between serum folate and homocysteine levels and the degree of cortical-subcortical and hippocampal atrophy in a first relatively preliminary sample of the Treviso Dementia (TREDEM) study using a potent data mining method. Methods: Physiological data, biochemical parameters, clinical assessment data, brain atrophy severity assessed with CT scans, and neuropsycological and disability data were assessed in a group of 232 outpatients (93 men and 139 women, aged 40.2-100 years) enrolled in the TREDEM study carried out in Treviso (Italy). A semantic connectivity map obtained through the Auto-CM system, a fourth generation artificial neural network (ANN), was used to offer some insight regarding the complex biological connections between the studied variables and the degree of brain atrophy. Results: Close associations between low serum folate levels and severe cortical-subcortical atrophy along with severe hippocampal atrophy measured by the width of the temporal horns of lateral ventricles were found. We also showed an association between high homocysteine levels and severe cortical-subcortical and hippocampal atrophy. Conclusion: The role of folate, which is inversely associated with the severity of brain atrophy, was confirmed. Our results also confirm the association between high homocysteine levels and severe cortical-subcortical and hippocampal atrophy. Auto-CM ANN is able to highlight associations sometimes visible only in longitudinal studies through intelligent data mining of a cross-sectional study.

On May 12, 2008, an earthquake of magnitude 7.9 on the Richter scale occurred in the Wenchuan area of Sichuan province in China. This event, together with subsequent aftershocks, caused many avalanches, landslides, debris flows, collapses, and quake lakes and induced numerous unstable slopes. This work proposes a methodology that uses a data mining approach and geographic information systems to predict these mass movements based on their association with the main and aftershock epicenters, geologic faults, riverbeds, and topography. A dataset comprising 3,883 mass movements is analyzed, and some models to predict the location of these mass movements are developed. These predictive models could be used by the Chinese authorities as an important tool for identifying risk areas and rescuing survivors during similar events in the future.

Antibodies and Fc fusion proteins can be efficiently purified from the majority of other complex components in harvested cell culture fluid (HCCF). Protein A chromatography is also capable of removing modest levels of viruses and is often validated for viral clearance. Historical data mining of Genentech and FDA/CDER databases systematically evaluated the removal of model viruses by Protein A chromatography. First, we found that for each model virus, removal by Protein A chromatography varies significantly across mAbs, while remains consistent within a specific mAb product, even across the acceptable ranges of the process parameters. In addition, our analysis revealed a correlation between retrovirus and parvovirus removal, with retrovirus data generally possessing a greater clearance factor. Finally, we describe a multivariate approach used to evaluate process parameter impacts on viral clearance, based on the levels of retrovirus-like particles (RVLP) present among process characterization study samples. It was shown that RVLP removal by Protein A is robust, that is, parameter effects were not observed across the ranges tested. Robustness of RVLP removal by Protein A also correlates with that for other model viruses such as X-MuLV, MMV, and SV40. The data supports that evaluating RVLP removal using process characterization study samples can establish multivariate acceptable ranges for virus removal by the protein A step for QbD. By measuring RVLP instead of a model retrovirus, it may alleviate some of the technical and economic challenges associated with performing large, design-of-experiment (DoE)type virus spiking studies. This approach could also serve to provide useful insight when designing strategies to ensure viral safety in the manufacturing of a biopharmaceutical product. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2014;111: 95-103.

Diverse methods such as multivariate statistics, time series analysis, and neural networks have been used for modeling and analysis of water quality indicators. Although these methods are useful to explore the main body of knowledge related to the water pollution problem, they are less effective for considering inherent uncertainties and vagueness in water pollution data. In this study, a variable consistency dominance-based rough set approach (VC-DRSA) was used to explore the underlying knowledge related to data for total dissolved solids (TDSs) in the Latyan Watershed, north of Tehran, Iran. Environmental parameters for the period of 2002-2007, including precipitation, river water temperature, runoff measured at 22 monitoring sites, and two products of the MODIS sensor (16-day NDVI and land surface temperature) were the explanatory variables. VC-DRSA was used in data mining analysis to explore the most effective and reliable rules for relating TDS data to the explanatory variables. Rule validation results show that the extracted rules were very effective and straightforward for examining the important relationships between the environmental parameters and TDS data. Application of the moving average filter in the TDS data led to decreased noise and a considerable reduction in the width of the boundary region between the lower and upper approximations.

J	Eichinger, F; Pankratius, V; Bohm, K				Eichinger, Frank; Pankratius, Victor; Boehm, Klemens			Data mining for defects in multicore applications: an entropy-based call-graph technique	CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE			English	Article						parallel computing; software defect localization; multithreaded programs; dynamic call graphs; data mining	LOCALIZATION; PROGRAMS	Multicore computers are ubiquitous. Expert developers as well as developers with little experience in parallelism are now asked to create multithreaded software to exploit parallelism in mainstream shared-memory hardware. However, finding and fixing parallel programming errors is a complex and arduous task. Programmers thus rely on tools such as race detectors that typically focus on reporting errors due to incorrect usage of synchronization constructs or due to missing synchronization. This arsenal of debugging techniques, however, is incomplete. This article presents a new perspective and addresses a largely unexplored direction of defect localization where a wrong usage of nonparallel programming constructs might cause wrong parallel application behavior. In particular, we make a contribution by showing how to use data-mining techniques to locate defects in multithreaded shared-memory programs. Our technique analyzes execution anomalies in a condensed representation of the dynamic call graphs of a multithreaded object-oriented application and identifies methods that contain a defect. Compared with race detectors that concentrate on finding incorrect synchronization, our method is able to reveal a wider range of defects that affect the control flow of a parallel program. Results from controlled experiments show that our data-mining approach finds not only race conditions in different types of multicore applications but also other errors that cause incorrect parallel program behavior. Data-mining techniques offer a fruitful new ground for parallel program debugging, and we also discuss long-term directions for this interesting field. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We aimed to develop and evaluate trigger' algorithms to electronically flag medical records of patients with potential delays in prostate and colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis. Methods We mined retrospective data from two large integrated health systems with comprehensive electronic health records (EHR) to iteratively develop triggers. Data mining algorithms identified all patient records with specific demographics and a lack of appropriate and timely follow-up actions on four diagnostic clues that were newly documented in the EHR: abnormal prostate-specific antigen (PSA), positive faecal occult blood test (FOBT), iron-deficiency anaemia (IDA), and haematochezia. Triggers subsequently excluded patients not needing follow-up (eg, terminal illness) or who had already received appropriate and timely care. Each of the four final triggers was applied to a test cohort, and chart reviews of randomly selected records identified by the triggers were used to calculate positive predictive values (PPV). Results The PSA trigger was applied to records of 292587 patients seen between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2009, and the CRC triggers were applied to 291773 patients seen between 1 March 2009 and 28 February 2010. Overall, 1564 trigger positive patients were identified (426 PSA, 355 FOBT, 610 IDA and 173 haematochezia). Record reviews revealed PPVs of 70.2%, 66.7%, 67.5%, and 58.3% for the PSA, FOBT, IDA and haematochezia triggers, respectively. Use of all four triggers at the study sites could detect an estimated 1048 instances of delayed or missed follow-up of abnormal findings annually and 47 high-grade cancers. Conclusions EHR-based triggers can be used successfully to flag patient records lacking follow-up of abnormal clinical findings suspicious for cancer.

Methods A case/non-case analysis was performed on the reports entered in the FDA_AERS from 2004 to 2010: Cases were reports with at least one event included in the MedDRA system organ classes Cardiac disorder' or Vascular disorders', whereas non-cases were all the remaining reports. Co-reported cardiovascular drugs were used as a proxy of cardiovascular risk and the adjusted reporting odds ratio (adj.ROR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was calculated. Disproportionality signals were defined as adj.ROR value >1. Adverse events were considered unexpected if not mentioned on the relevant label. Results Among 2,131,688 reports, 7808 concerned triptans. Cases were 2593 among triptans and 665,940 for all other drugs. Unexpected disproportionality signals were found in the following high-level terms of the MedDRA hierarchy: Cerebrovascular and spinal necrosis and vascular insufficiency' (103 triptan cases), Aneurysms and dissections non-site specific' (15), Pregnancy-associated hypertension' (10), Reproductive system necrosis and vascular insufficiency' (3). Discussion Our analysis revealed three main groups of unexpected associations between triptans and serious vascular events: ischaemic cerebrovascular events, aneurysms and artery dissections, and pregnancy-related vascular events. A case-by-case assessment is needed to confirm or disprove their plausibility and large-scale analytical studies should be planned for risk rate estimation. In the meantime, clinicians should pay special attention to migraine diagnosis and vascular risk assessment before prescribing a triptan, also promptly reporting any unexpected event to pharmacovigilance systems.

J	Marksberry, P; Church, J; Schmidt, M				Marksberry, Phillip; Church, Joshua; Schmidt, Michael			The Employee Suggestion System: A New Approach Using Latent Semantic Analysis	HUMAN FACTORS AND ERGONOMICS IN MANUFACTURING & SERVICE INDUSTRIES			English	Article						Suggestion system; Latent semantic analysis (LSA); Employee motivation; Lean manu-facturing; Toyota Production System (TPS)	HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; CAUSAL; TIME	Employee suggestion systems are often used as a way to improve participation from members of the organization to help solve problems that cannot be solved through traditional organizational practices. In the government sector, employee involvement programs are the most difficult to implement mainly because management regularly changes with new administration and these changes bring about many short-term management practices and systems. Toyota's approach to employee suggestion programs has been widely benchmarked and studied, yet there is little research to show that these practices can be applied or are successful in the public sector. This work uses a statistical data-mining technique to compare which types of human resource management practices are prevalent in employee suggestion programs at Toyota and a target government organization. This work shows that Toyota emphasizes organization-centered factors to stimulate employee participation in solving small problems that relate to an employee's job. On the contrary, government organizations tend to emphasize employee factors that make conditions right for employees to make larger improvements in their jobs that lead to improvements outside their work areas. Findings suggest that Toyota's approach to employee suggestion programs is not a way to weaken management's obligation to perform problem solving, but instead is another medium to highlight problems that do not require management's intervention. These new insights and others provide an increased understanding of employee suggestion programs in the public sector that are unique to manufacturing. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Drought is a natural, temporary, and iterative phenomenon that is caused by shortage in rainfall, which affects people's health and well-being adversely as well as impacting the society's economy and politics with far-reaching consequences. Information on intensity, duration, and spatial coverage of drought can help decision makers to reduce the vulnerability of the drought-affected areas, and therefore, lessen the risks associated with drought episodes. One of the major challenges of modeling drought (and short-term forecasting) in Iran is unavailability of long-term meteorological data for many parts of the country. Satellite-based remote sensing data-that are freely available-give information on vegetation conditions and land cover. In this paper, we constructed artificial neural network to model (and forecast) drought conditions based on satellite imagery. To this end, standardized precipitation index (SPI) was used as a measure of drought severity. A number of features including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation condition index (VCI), and temperature condition index (TCI) were extracted from NOAA-AVHRR images. The model received these features as input and outputted the SPI value (or drought condition). Applying the model to the data of stations for which the precipitation data were available, we showed that it could forecast the drought condition with an accuracy of up to 90 percent. Furthermore, TCI was found to be the best marker of drought conditions among satellite-based features. We also found multilayer perceptron better than radial basis function networks and support vector machines forecasting drought conditions.

It is inefficient when they deal with a large number of malware. Meanwhile, the limitation of unknown malware detection often is found in them too. By the research on software structure, it has been found that the control flow of software can be divided into many basic blocks by the interior cross-references, and a feature-selection approach based on this phenomenon is proposed. It can extract opcode sequences from the disassembled program, and translate them into features by vector space model. The algorithms of data mining are employed to find the classify rules from the software features, and then the rules can be applied to the malware detection. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can achieve the 97.0% malware detection accuracy and 3.2% false positive rate with the Random Forest classifier. Furthermore, as high as 94.5% overall accuracy can be achieved when only 5% experimental data are used as training data.

We applied four different machine-learning algorithms, namely the Multi Layer Perceptron, trained, respectively, with the Conjugate Gradient, the Scaled Conjugate Gradient, the Quasi Newton learning rules and the Support Vector Machines, to tackle the problem of the classification of emission line galaxies in different classes, mainly AGNs versus non-AGNs, obtained using optical photometry in place of the diagnostics based on line intensity ratios which are classically used in the literature. Using the same photometric features, we discuss also the behaviour of the classifiers on finer AGN classification tasks, namely Seyfert I versus Seyfert II, and Seyfert versus LINER. Furthermore, we describe the algorithms employed, the samples of spectroscopically classified galaxies used to train the algorithms, the procedure followed to select the photometric parameters and the performances of our methods in terms of multiple statistical indicators. The results of the experiments show that the application of self-adaptive data mining algorithms trained on spectroscopic data sets and applied to carefully chosen photometric parameters represents a viable alternative to the classical methods that employ time-consuming spectroscopic observations.

The primary goal is to ensure efficient use of resources, services of computer systems, and networks to provide timely services to the end users using mobile agent with decentralized processing and control in distributed resources so as to minimize the network traffic and speed up management tasks in distributed environment, provide more scalability, and to provide more flexibility in the development and maintenance of the applications. The problem with the traditional techniques is, when the number of visited nodes grows, the mobile agent size also increases and making migration harder. One possible solution to this problem is to visit a fixed number of nodes, return to the agent home or send all data to it (reducing the mobile agent size), and start the task again on the remaining nodes. The initial size of a mobile agent also affects agent performance, since the larger the size, the more difficult the migration.	[Kavitha, S.; Kumar, K.

Primary focus in distributed systems is that mobile agents have a number of key features that allow them to reduce the network load and overcome network latency. Mobile agents offer a more uniform approach to handling code and data in a distributed system. They can encapsulate protocols, and they can work remotely, even asynchronously and disconnected from a network. It improves the latency and bandwidth of client-server applications and reducing vulnerability to network disconnection. This paper presents an analysis of the various applications of mobile agents and some of the benefits and challenges of this new technology.	[Kumar, K.

J	Carinena, P				Carinena, Purificacion			Fuzzy temporal association rules: combining temporal and quantitative data to increase rule expressiveness	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article							MINING SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS	Data mining for association rules aims to discover interesting relationships among sets of items in a database. Very often these databases include some kind of temporal information, the most common being a temporal label indicating transaction date. Within the field of association rule mining temporal information has been used to obtain sequential association rules, periodic or cyclic association rules, calendric association rules, or event-driven association rules. The temporal component is also relevant when analyzing how association rules evolve if datasets are evaluated on different time-slices. On the other hand, in traditional association rules item attributes were usually Boolean, but many attributes in current databases are quantitative in nature. Fuzzy temporal association rules arise from the use of fuzzy sets to describe quantitative temporal and/or not temporal attributes of items in a database, and/or to introduce fuzzy temporal specifications for the rules a user is interested in; the use of fuzzy sets allows a linguistic interpretation of the rules and also provides means to handle the uncertainty present in attribute measurements. Depending on the rule pattern the final user is interested in, different methods for fuzzy temporal association rule mining can be found in the literature, with mining algorithms adapted to the rule model being used.

J	Kawakami, J				Kawakami, Junko			Visualization and Analysis of Drug Information on Adverse Reactions Using Data Mining Method, and Its Clinical Application	YAKUGAKU ZASSHI-JOURNAL OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN			Japanese	Review						visualization of drug information; adverse reaction; self-organizing map; antibiotics; antihypertensive drug; diabetes drug	NEURAL-NETWORKS; BAYESIAN-TYPE; DIAGNOSIS	Sources of drug information such as package inserts (PIs) and interview forms (IFs) and existing drug information databases provide primarily document-based and numerical information. For this reason, it is not easy to obtain a complete picture of the information concerning many drugs with similar effects or to understand differences among drugs. The visualization of drug information may help provide a large amount of information in a short period, relieve the burden on medical workers, facilitate a comprehensive understanding and comparison of drugs, and contribute to improvements in patients' QOL. At our department, we are developing an approach to convert information on side effects obtained from PIs of many drugs with similar effects into visual maps reflecting the data structure through competitive learning using the self-organizing map (SOM) technique of Kohonen, which is a powerful method for pattern recognition, to facilitate the grasping of all available information and differences among drugs, to anticipate the appearance of side effects; we are also evaluating the possibility of its clinical application. In this paper, this approach is described by taking the examples of antibiotics, antihypertensive drugs, and diabetes drugs.

In the meantime, several analogs have been brought onto the market indicating a growing interest in this drug class. So far, only scarce analytical data were available on the detectability of tryptamines in human biosamples. Therefore, the aim of the presented study was the development and full validation of a method for their detection in human urine and plasma and their quantification in human plasma. The liquid chromatography-linear ion trap mass spectrometry method presented covered 37 tryptamines as well as five beta-carbolines, ibogaine, and yohimbine. Compounds were analyzed after protein precipitation of urine or fast liquid-liquid extraction of plasma using an LXQ linear ion trap coupled to an Accela ultra ultra high-performance liquid chromatography system. Data mining was performed via information-dependent acquisition or targeted product ion scan mode with positive electrospray ionization. The assay was selective for all tested substances with limits of detection in urine between 10 and 100 ng/mL and in plasma between 1 and 100 ng/mL. A validated quantification in plasma according to international recommendation could be demonstrated for 33 out of 44 analytes.

Diet and lifestyle factors and risk of subtypes of esophageal and gastric cancers: classification tree analysis	ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Esophageal adenocarcinoma; Gastric cardia adenocarcinoma; Diet; Gastroesophageal reflux disease; Classification tree; CART	GASTROESOPHAGEAL-REFLUX DISEASE; SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA; UNITED-STATES; SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; BARRETTS-ESOPHAGUS; RISING INCIDENCE; BODY-MASS; CARDIA; ADENOCARCINOMA; PATTERNS	Purpose: Although risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus (EA), gastric cardia (GC), and other (noncardia) gastric (OG) sites have been identified, little is known about interactions among risk factors. We sought to examine interactions of diet, other lifestyle, and medical factors with risks of subtypes of esophageal and gastric cancers. Methods: We used classification tree analysis to analyze data from a population-based case-control study (1095 cases, 687 controls) conducted in Connecticut, New Jersey, and western Washington State. Results: Frequency of reported gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms was the most important risk stratification factor for EA, GC, and OG, with dietary factors (EA, OG), smoking (EA, GC), wine intake (GC, OG), age (OG), and income (OG) appearing to modify the risk of these cancer sites. For esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, smoking was the most important risk stratification factor, with gastroesophageal reflux disease, income, race, noncitrus fruit, and energy intakes further modifying risk. Conclusion: Various combinations of risk factors appear to interact to affect risk of each cancer subtype. Replication of these data mining analyses are required before suggesting causal pathways; however, the classification tree results are useful in partitioning risk and mapping multilevel interactions among risk variables.

A well-established tool for extracting the intrinsically low-dimensional structure from such data is principal component analysis (PCA). Due to the inherent limitations of this linear method, its extensions to extraction of nonlinear structures have attracted increasing research interest in recent years. Assuming a generative model for noisy data, we develop a probabilistic approach for separating the data-generating nonlinear functions from noise. We demonstrate that ridges of the marginal density induced by the model are viable estimators for the generating functions. For projecting a given point onto a ridge of its estimated marginal density, we develop a generalized trust region Newton method and prove its convergence to a ridge point. Accuracy of the model and computational efficiency of the projection method are assessed via numerical experiments where we utilize Gaussian kernels for nonparametric estimation of the underlying densities of the test datasets.

This paper presents SGEMS-UQ a plugin for the SGEMS platform, that is used to perform distance-based uncertainty analysis on geostatistical simulations, and the resulting forward transfer function responses used in subsurface modeling and engineering. A versatile XML-derived dialect is defined for communicating with external programs that reduces the need for ad-hoc linking of codes, and a relational database system is implemented to automate many of the steps in data mining the spatial and forward model parameters. Through a graphical user interface, one can map a set of realizations and forward transfer function responses into a multidimensional scaling (MDS) space where visualization utilities, and clustering techniques are available. Once mapped in the MDS space, the user can explore linkage between simulation parameters and forward transfer function responses using a module based on a SQL database. Consideration is given to the use of software engineering paradigms and design patterns to produce a code-base that is manageable, efficient, and extensible for future applications, while being scalable to work with large datasets. Finally, we illustrate the versatility of the code-base on an application of modeling uncertainty in reservoir forecasts for an oil reservoir in the West Coast of Africa. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We are specifically concerned with situations where the full data cannot be practically obtained due to physical limitations such as low bandwidth, limited memory, storage, or computing power. Motivated by the recent compressed sensing (CS) theory, we suggest a framework wherein random projection can be used to obtained compressed data, addressing the scalability challenge. Our theoretical contribution shows that the spectral property of the CS data is approximately preserved under a such a projection and thus the performance of spectral-based methods for anomaly detection is almost equivalent to the case in which the raw data is completely available. Our second contribution is the construction of the framework to use this result and detect anomalies in the compressed data directly, thus circumventing the problems of data acquisition in large sensor networks. We have conducted extensive experiments to detect anomalies in network and surveillance applications on large datasets, including the benchmark PETS 2007 and 83 GB of real footage from three public train stations. Our results show that our proposed method is scalable, and importantly, its performance is comparable to conventional methods for anomaly detection when the complete data is available.

We study the novel problem of finding the smallest set of patterns that explains most about the data in terms of a global p value. The resulting set of patterns, such as frequent patterns or clusterings, is the smallest set that statistically explains the data. We show that the newly formulated problem is, in its general form, NP-hard and there exists no efficient algorithm with finite approximation ratio. However, we show that in a special case a solution can be computed efficiently with a provable approximation ratio. We find that a greedy algorithm gives good results on real data and that, using our approach, we can formulate and solve many known data-mining tasks. We demonstrate our method on several data mining tasks. We conclude that our framework is able to identify in various settings a small set of patterns that statistically explains the data and to formulate data mining problems in the terms of statistical significance.

In large scale forest and landscape monitoring projects for instance, appropriate data mining techniques that can summarize the overall status of landscapes are necessary for planning and implementing follow-up management strategies. We consider a vegetation data set consisting of species data from more than 120 mires spread across Switzerland with a total of 20,134 plots on 2658 vascular and non-vascular plant species. Using species indicator values as proxy for site conditions, we propose some simple strategies for data mining involving multidimensional scaling and nonparametric probability density function estimation, both of which are known in the classical statistical literature. We show how commonly known techniques can be adapted in a novel and effective approach for the specific purpose of analyzing plant species occurrence in the plots to identify site conditions that influence species configurations and species diversity, thus providing important information concerning aspects of large scale vegetation structure. Our results indicate high variations among the mires with respect to site conditions that affect species assemblage and species diversity. While species indicator values continue to be popular as well as subject of much debate and research in the ecological community, our experience shows that careful methods of analysis at large landscape scales can reveal some powerful results, which can be taken up as the starting point for the next level of investigation.

Existing algorithms for El mining require a lot of time and memory. This paper proposes an effective algorithm, called mining erasable itemsets (MEI), which uses the divide-and-conquer strategy and the difference pidset (dPidset) concept for mining EIs fully. Some theorems for efficiently computing itemset information to reduce mining time up and memory usage are also derived. Experimental results show that MEI outperforms existing approaches in terms of both the mining time and memory usage. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is capable of mining EIs with higher thresholds than those obtained using existing approaches. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the optimization model, data-driven approaches are used to model the wind-power generation process based on industrial data. A new constraint is developed for governing the data-driven wind-power generation model based on physics and statistical process control theory. Since the wind-power model is nonparametric, computational intelligence algorithms are utilized to solve the optimization model.

Here we describe anomaly detection with data mined Bayesian Networks, learning them from real world Automated Identification System (AIS) data, and from supplementary data, producing both dynamic and static Bayesian network models. We find that the learned networks are quite easy to examine and verify despite incorporating a large number of variables. We also demonstrate that combining dynamic and static modelling approaches improves the coverage of the overall model and thereby anomaly detection performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Various topologies with different properties have been proposed so far and each one is suitable for specific applications. Pyramid interconnection networks have potentially powerful architecture for many applications such as image processing, visualization, and data mining. The major advantage of pyramids which is important for image processing systems is hierarchical abstracting and transferring the data toward the apex node, just like the human being vision system, which reach to an object from an image. There are rapidly growing applications in which the multidimensional datasets should be processed simultaneously. For such a system, we need a symmetric and expandable interconnection network to process data from different directions and forward them toward the apex. In this paper, a new type of pyramid interconnection network called Non-Flat Surface Level (NFSL) pyramid is proposed. NFSL pyramid interconnection networks constructed by L-level A-lateral-base pyramids that are named basic-pyramids. So, the apex node is surrounded by the level-one surfaces of NFSL that are the first nearest level of nodes to apex in the basic pyramids. Two topologies which are called NFSL-T and NFSL-Q originated from Trilateral-base and Quadrilateral-base basic-pyramids are studied to exemplify the proposed structure. To evaluate the proposed architecture, the most important properties of the networks are determined and compared with those of the standard pyramid networks and its variants.

The algorithm learns Bayesian network Augmented Naive-Bayes (BAN) classifiers, where the class node is the parent of all the nodes representing the input variables. However, this assumes the existence of a dependency relationship between the class variable and all the input variables, and this relationship is a type of "causal" (rather than "effect") relationship, which restricts the flexibility of the algorithm to learn. In this paper, we propose ABC-Miner+, an extension to the ABC-Miner algorithm which is able to learn more flexible Bayesian network classifier structures, where it is not necessary to have a (direct) dependency relationship between the class variable and each of the input variables, and the dependency between the class and the input variables varies from "causal" to "effect" relationships. The produced model is the Markov blanket of the class variable. Empirical evaluations on UCI benchmark datasets show that our extended ABC-Miner+ outperforms its previous version in terms of predictive accuracy, model size and computational time.

Mining mouse behavior for patterns predicting psychiatric drug classification	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Animal model; Behavioral phenotyping; SEE; Open field; Spatial behavior	OPIOID-RECEPTOR-AGONIST; PSYCHOTIC DEPRESSION; DISCOVERY; DISORDERS; MECHANISMS; SALVINORIN; MODEL; RATS; MICE	In psychiatric drug discovery, a critical step is predicting the psychopharmacological effect and therapeutic potential of novel (or repurposed) compounds early in the development process. This process is hampered by the need to utilize multiple disorder-specific and labor-intensive behavioral assays. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of a single high-throughput behavioral assay to classify psychiatric drugs into multiple psychopharmacological classes. Using Pattern Array, a procedure for data mining exploratory behavior in mice, we mined similar to 100,000 complex movement patterns for those that best predict psychopharmacological class and dose. The best patterns were integrated into a classification model that assigns psychopharmacological compounds to one of six clinically relevant classes-antipsychotic, antidepressant, opioids, psychotomimetic, psychomotor stimulant, and alpha-adrenergic. Surprisingly, only a small number of well-chosen behaviors were required for successful class prediction. One of them, a behavior termed "universal drug detector", was dose-dependently decreased by drugs from all classes, thus providing a sensitive index of psychopharmacological activity. In independent validation in a blind fashion, simulating the process of in vivo pre-clinical drug screening, the classification model correctly classified nine out of 11 "unknown" compounds. Interestingly, even "misclassifications" match known alternate therapeutic indications, illustrating drug "repurposing" potential. Unlike standard animal models, the discovered classification model can be systematically updated to improve its predictive power and add therapeutic classes and subclasses with each additional diversification of the database. Our study demonstrates the power of data mining approaches for behavior analysis, using multiple measures in parallel for drug screening and behavioral phenotyping.

However, the statistical signal detection methods for longitudinal data, as the data accrue in time, are called active surveillance methods. A review of the most commonly used passive surveillance statistical methods and the relationships among them is presented with unified notations. These methods are applied to the 2006-2012 FAERS data; the number of drug signals of disproportionate rates (SDRs) detected by each of these methods with the common SDRs from all of these methods, for the adverse event myocardial infarction, are given. Finally, there is a brief discussion on the recently developed active surveillance methods.

In this paper, we adapt an uncertain data clustering algorithm called fast density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (FDBSCAN) to multicore systems in order to have fast processing. The new algorithm, which we call multicore FDBSCAN (M-FDBSCAN), splits the data domain into c rectangular regions, where c is the number of cores in the system. The FDBSCAN algorithm is then applied to each rectangular region simultaneously. After the clustering operation is completed, semiclusters that occur during splitting are detected and merged to construct the final clusters. M-FDBSCAN is tested for correctness and performance. The experiments show that there is a significant performance increase due to M-FDBSCAN, which is not just due to multicore usage.

Effects of resampling method and adaptation on clustering ensemble efficacy	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						Clustering ensembles; Consensus functions; Distributed data mining; Bootstrap; Subsampling; Adaptive clustering		Clustering ensembles combine multiple partitions of data into a single clustering solution of better quality. Inspired by the success of supervised bagging and boosting algorithms, we propose non-adaptive and adaptive resampling schemes for the integration of multiple independent and dependent clusterings. We investigate the effectiveness of bagging techniques, comparing the efficacy of sampling with and without replacement, in conjunction with several consensus algorithms. In our adaptive approach, individual partitions in the ensemble are sequentially generated by clustering specially selected subsamples of the given dataset. The sampling probability for each data point dynamically depends on the consistency of its previous assignments in the ensemble. New subsamples are then drawn to increasingly focus on the problematic regions of the input feature space. A measure of data point clustering consistency is therefore defined to guide this adaptation. Experimental results show improved stability and accuracy for clustering structures obtained via bootstrapping, subsampling, and adaptive techniques. A meaningful consensus partition for an entire set of data points emerges from multiple clusterings of bootstraps and subsamples. Subsamples of small size can reduce computational cost and measurement complexity for many unsupervised data mining tasks with distributed sources of data. This empirical study also compares the performance of adaptive and non-adaptive clustering ensembles using different consensus functions on a number of datasets. By focusing attention on the data points with the least consistent clustering assignments, whether one can better approximate the inter-cluster boundaries or can at least create diversity in boundaries and this results in improving clustering accuracy and convergence speed as a function of the number of partitions in the ensemble. The comparison of adaptive and non-adaptive approaches is a new avenue for research, and this study helps to pave the way for the useful application of distributed data mining methods.

It allows fair comparison of different data mining models in terms of the accuracy of the prediction. To illustrate the concept, a decision tree (DT) method is used as an example of a data mining technique. It is implemented in a 16-machine, 68-bus test power system. Generator rotor angles and speeds provided by PMUs during post-fault condition are chosen as predictors. The performance of the DT based prediction method is tested using a wide variety of disturbances with probabilistically modeled locations, durations, types of fault and the system loading levels. The accuracy of prediction is approximately 98.5% immediately following the fault clearance and can increase to almost 100% if the prediction is made 2.5 s after the fault clearance.

In real-world applications, costs, including money, time and other resources, are required to acquire the features. In some cases, there is a test cost constraint due to limited resources. We shall deliberately select an informative and cheap feature subset for classification. This paper proposes the feature selection with test cost constraint problem for this issue. The new problem has a simple form while described as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). Backtracking is a general algorithm for CSP, and it is efficient in solving the new problem on medium-sized data. As the backtracking algorithm is not scalable to large datasets, a heuristic algorithm is also developed. Experimental results show that the heuristic algorithm can find the optimal solution in most cases. We also redefine some existing feature selection problems in rough sets, especially in decision-theoretic rough sets, from the viewpoint of CSP. These new definitions provide insight to some new research directions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Probabilistic (or parameterized) approximations, studied mostly in variable precision rough set theory, were originally defined using equivalence relations. Recently, probabilistic approximations were defined for arbitrary binary relations. Such approximations have an immediate application to data mining from incomplete data because incomplete data sets are characterized by a characteristic relation which is reflexive but not necessarily symmetric or transitive. In contrast, complete data sets are described by indiscernibility which is an equivalence relation. The main objective of this paper was to compare experimentally, for the first time, two generalizations of probabilistic approximations: global and local. Additionally, we explored the problem how many distinct probabilistic approximations may be defined for a given data set. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study, multiple heterogeneous predictors of AD were combined using a supervised learning method called Disease State Index (DSI). The behavior of DSI values over time was examined to study disease progression quantitatively in a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cohort. The DSI method was applied to longitudinal data from 140 MCI cases that progressed to AD and 149 MCI cases that did not progress to AD during the follow-up. The data included neuropsychological tests, brain volumes from magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid samples, and apolipoprotein E from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Linear regression of the longitudinal DSI values (including the DSI value at the point of MCI to AD conversion) was performed for each subject having at least three DSI values available (147 non-converters, 126 converters). Converters had five times higher slopes and almost three times higher intercepts than non-converters. Two subgroups were found in the group of non-converters: one group with stable DSI values over time and another group with clearly increasing DSI values suggesting possible progression to AD in the future. The regression parameters differentiated between the converters and the non-converters with classification accuracy of 76.9% for the slopes and 74.6% for the intercepts. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that quantifying longitudinal patient data using the DSI method provides valid information for follow-up of disease progression and support for decision making.

InfoQ is different from data quality and analysis quality, but is dependent on these components and on the relationship between them. We survey statistical methods for increasing InfoQ at the study design and post-data-collection stages, and we consider them relatively to what we define as InfoQ. We propose eight dimensions that help to assess InfoQ: data resolution, data structure, data integration, temporal relevance, generalizability, chronology of data and goal, construct operationalization and communication. We demonstrate the concept of InfoQ, its components (what it is) and assessment (how it is achieved) through three case-studies in on-line auctions research. We suggest that formalizing the concept of InfoQ can help to increase the value of statistical analysis, and data mining both methodologically and practically, thus contributing to a general theory of applied statistics.

J	Wu, X; Wen, XY; Li, J; Yao, L				Wu, Xia; Wen, Xuyun; Li, Juan; Yao, Li			A new dynamic Bayesian network approach for determining effective connectivity from fMRI data	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	19th International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP)	NOV 11-15, 2012	Doha, QATAR			Data mining; Gaussian dynamic Bayesian network; Dynamic Bayesian network (DBN); Effective connectivity; Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)	MONKEY RETROSPLENIAL CORTEX; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK	Two techniques based on the Bayesian network (BN), Gaussian Bayesian network and discrete dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), have recently been used to determine the effective connectivity from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in an exploratory manner and to provide a new method for exploring the interactions among brain regions. However, Gaussian BN ignores the temporal relationships of interactions among brain regions, while discrete DBN loses a great deal of information by discretizing the data. To overcome these limitations, the current study proposes a new BN method based on Gaussian assumptions, termed Gaussian DBN, to capture the temporal characteristics of connectivity with less associated loss of information. A set of synthetic data were generated to measure the robustness of this method to noise, and the results were compared with discrete DBN. In addition, real fMRI data obtained from twelve normal subjects in the resting state was used to further demonstrate and validate the effectiveness of the Gaussian DBN method. The results demonstrated that the Gaussian DBN was more robust than discrete DBN and an improvement over BN.

Therefore, semi-supervised learning algorithms such as Tri-training have attracted much attention. However, mislabeling the unlabeled data during the learning process is an inevitable problem and harms the performance improvement of the hypothesis. To solve this problem, a novel human cognitive paradigm is constructed for semi-supervised learning in this paper. In detail, based on local distribution of feature space, the majority voting scheme is substituted by an estimation of the probability of sample to belong to a certain class as an efficient strategy for data editing. It considers the form of the underlying probability distribution in the neighborhood of a point to identify and remove the mislabeled data. Validation of the proposed method is performed with extensive experiments. Results demonstrate that compared with Tri-training method, our method can more effectively and stably exploit unlabeled data to enhance the learning performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

Association between use of benzodiazepines and risk of fractures: a meta-analysis	OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Benzodiazepine; Bone fractures; Meta-analysis; Osteoporosis	ELIMINATION HALF-LIFE; BONE-MINERAL DENSITY; HIP FRACTURE; OLDER-PEOPLE; PSYCHOTROPIC-DRUGS; PUBLICATION BIAS; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; POPULATION; MEDICATIONS; MIDAZOLAM	Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are some of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world. It has been shown that BZD use could be associated with increased fracture risk. However, studies on the use of BZDs and fracture risk have yielded inconsistent results. Results from the present meta-analysis show that BZD use is associated with a moderate and clinically significant increase in the risk of fractures. The relationship between the use of BZDs and fracture risk has been neither well identified nor summarized. This meta-analysis reports on the use of BZDs, especially short-acting BZDs, and their correlation with a moderate and clinically significant increase in fracture risk. This analysis will provide evidence for clinicians to consider fracture risk when prescribing BZDs among the elderly population. This study was conducted to determine whether people who take BZDs are at an increased fracture risk. A systematic search of studies published through January 2013 was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, OVID, and ScienceDirect. Case-control and cohort studies that assessed the relationship between BZD use and the risk of fractures were identified. Literature searches, study selections, methodological assessments, and data mining were independently conducted by two reviewers. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. STATA 12.0 software was used for the meta-analysis. Random effects models were used for pooled analysis due to heterogeneity among the studies. There were 25 studies, including 19 case-control studies and 6 cohort studies, that met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the results of the meta-analysis indicated that BZD use was associated with a significantly increased fracture risk (relative risk (RR) = 1.25; 95 % confidence intervals (CI), 1.17-1.34; p < 0.001). Increased fracture risk associated with BZD use was observed in participants aged a parts per thousand yen65 years old (RR = 1.26; 95 % CI, 1.15-1.38; p < 0.001). When only hip fractures were included as the outcome measure, the RR increased to 1.35. However, subgroup meta-analyses showed that there was no significant association between BZD use and fracture risk in Eastern countries (RR = 1.27; 95 % CI, 0.76-2.14; p = 0.362) as well as between long-acting BZD use and risk of fractures (RR = 1.21; 95 % CI, 0.95-1.54; p = 0.12). After accounting for publication bias, we observed that the overall association between BZD use and fracture risk to be slightly weaker (RR = 1.21; 95 % CI, 1.13-1.30) but still significant. The results of this meta-analysis demonstrate that the use of BZD, especially short-acting BZD, is associated with a moderate and clinically significant increase in fracture risk. However, large prospective studies that minimize selection bias are necessary to determine a more accurate fracture risk associated with BZD use.	[Xing, D.; Ma, X.

Nine patients with chronic heart failure underwent at regular intervals, two electronic questionnaires to evaluate depression (STAI-short form) and anxiety (STAY-6). Individual semantic maps were developed by Auto Contractive Map, a new data mining tool based on an artificial neural networks acting on the small data set formed by questionnaires items applied serially along time. The clinical psychologist involved in the clinical evaluation of the cases was asked to score the consistency between the information emerging from the graph depicting the structure of the main relationships among items and the clinical picture resulting from the psychological colloquium. All cases reported overall judgments of a good consistency suggesting that the mathematical architecture of the system is able to capture in the dynamics of items value variations through time the underlying construct of the patient psychological status. This technology is promising in remote monitoring of patients' psychological condition in different settings with the possibility to implement personalized psychological interventions.

Therefore, in the last decade the use of machine learning has spread rapidly throughout computer science and beyond. This approach, supported on advanced statistics analysis, is usually known as Data Mining (DM) and has been applied successfully in different knowledge domains. In the present study, we show that DM can make a great contribution in solving complex problems in civil engineering, namely in the field of geotechnical engineering. Particularly, the high learning capabilities of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) algorithm, characterized by it flexibility and non-linear capabilities, were applied in the prediction of the Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) of Jet Grouting (JG) samples directly extracted from JG columns, usually known as soilcrete. JG technology is a soft-soil improvement method worldwide applied, extremely versatile and economically attractive when compared with other methods. However, even after many years of experience still lacks of accurate methods for JG columns design. Accordingly, in the present paper a novel approach (based on SVM algorithm) for UCS prediction of soilcrete mixtures is proposed supported on 472 results collected from different geotechnical works. Furthermore, a global sensitivity analysis is applied in order to explain and extract understandable knowledge from the proposed model. Such analysis allows one to identify the key variables in UCS prediction and to measure its effect. Finally, a tentative step toward a development of UCS prediction based on laboratory studies is presented and discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

At the landscape scale, SOC spatial variability is strongly affected by natural and anthropogenic processes and linear anthropogenic elements (such hedges or ditches). This study aims at mapping SOC stocks distribution in the A-horizons for a depth up to 105 cm, at a high spatial resolution, for an area of 10 km(2) in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape (North-Western France). We used a data mining tool, Cubist, to build rule-based predictive models and predict SOC content and soil bulk density (BD) from a calibration dataset at 8 standard layers (0 to 7.5 cm, 7.5 to 15 cm, 15 to 30 cm, 30 to 45 cm, 45 to 60 cm, 60 to 75 cm, 75 to 90 cm and 90 to 105 cm). For the models calibration, 70 sampling locations were selected within the whole study area using the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling method. Two independent validation datasets were used to assess the performance of the predictive models: (i) at landscape scale, 49 sampling locations were selected using stratified random sampling based on a 300-m square grid; (ii) at hedge vicinity, 112 sampling locations were selected along transects perpendicular to 14 purposively chosen hedges. Undisturbed samples were collected at fixed depths and analysed for BD and SOC content at each sampling location and continuous soil profiles were reconstructed using equal-area splines. Predictive environmental data consisted in attributes derived from a light detection and ranging digital elevation model (LiDAR DEM), geological variables, land use data and a predictive map of A-horizon thickness. Considering the two validation datasets (at landscape scale and hedge vicinity), root mean square errors (RMSE) of the predictions, computed for all the standard soil layers (up to a depth of 105 cm), were respectively 7.74 and 5.02 g kg(-1) for SOC content, and 0.15 and 021 g cm(-3) for BD. Best predictions were obtained for layers between 15 and 60 cm of depth. The SOC stocks were calculated over a depth of 105 cm by combining the prediction of SOC content and BD. The final maps show that the carbon stocks in the soil below 30 cm accounted for 33% of the total SOC stocks on average. The whole method produced consistent results between the two predicted soil properties. The final SOC stocks maps provide continuous data along soil profile up to 105 cm, which may be critical information for supporting carbon policy and management decisions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Disaggregation of component soil series on an Ohio County soil survey map using possibilistic decision trees	GEODERMA			English	Article						SSURGO; Soil survey; Disaggregation; Data mining; Decision trees; Possibility theory	KNOWLEDGE	Data mining from existing County soil surveys can improve the utility of maps for research, management and decision making. Aggregated soil series information in soil survey map units can be disaggregated by following a possibilistic decision tree approach to provide maps at the soil series level. The "overall map unit composition percentage" available in the soil survey tabular data can be treated as a possibility distribution of the prevalence of different soil series within all occurrences of the map unit in the survey area. A case study was conducted in Monroe County in southeastern Ohio. Three different learning approaches including C4.5 derision trees, nonspecificity based possibilistic decision trees and clustering based possibilistic decision trees were applied to the existent County survey, and the efficiency of predicting soils at the series level was assessed using an independent soil series point data set. The results showed an improvement in prediction accuracy by following the clustered possibilistic decision tree approach. The maps were useful in identifying the locations of component soil series within map unit associations, consociations, and complexes. Data mining from existent soil survey maps using the component information available in the tabular data can serve as a guide for disaggregating soil map units to create soil series maps, identifying misplacement of polygon boundaries, identifying presence of inclusions, and correcting mislabeled polygons, when updating soil surveys.

Semi-automated disaggregation of conventional soil maps using knowledge driven data mining and classification trees	GEODERMA			English	Article						Polygon disaggregation; Spatial disaggregation; Soil-landscape models; Classification trees; Uncertainty; Variable importance	DIGITAL ELEVATION MODELS; FUZZY-LOGIC; SPATIAL PREDICTION; ORGANIC-CARBON; INFORMATION; LANDSCAPE; UNCERTAINTY; ATTRIBUTES; INFERENCE; SYSTEM	Disaggregation of conventional soil surveys has been identified as a potential source for much of the next generation of model-ready digital soil spatial data. This process aims to apportion vector soil surveys into raster (gridded) representations of the component soils that are often aggregated together in map unit designs. Most soil surveys are published with some description of the soil landscape relationships that distinguish component soils within map units. We used these descriptions found in the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database of Webster and Pocahontas Counties in West Virginia, USA, to build a set of representative training areas for all soil components by using 1-arc second digital elevation data and derived geomorphic indices. These training areas were then used in classification tree ensembles with a more extensive environmental database to transform the original SSURGO map into a gridded soil series map. We created underlying prediction frequency surfaces from the models that can be used for creating continuous representations of soil class and property distributions. Disaggregation models matched training sets in 71%-74% of pixels and matched components in original SSURGO map units in 56%-65% of the study area. We evaluated both the original SSURGO data and our models using 87 independent pedons not used in model building. Validation pedons matched components in SSURGO map units at 39% of sites, but in map units that only included one named component (as opposed to multiple soils that could be matched to validation pedons) only 27% of the sites matched. Disaggregation predictions matched validation pedon classes 22-24% of the time using nearest neighbor spatial matches, and these rates increased to 39-44% for correct predictions within a 60-meter radius of the pedon. To characterize uncertainty, we compared relative ensemble prediction frequency (probability) of final hardened model classes at validation sites. Sites with correct predictions had generally higher prediction frequencies; which lead us to use them to create an uncertainty model. Uncertainty was calculated by determining the rate of correct predictions at validation sites within different intervals of prediction frequencies using nearest neighbor validation results. We were able to discern four uncertainty classes with values of 7%, 18%, 20% and 43%, which we called "ground truth probabilities". We present the methods to create these models as a specific example of how disaggregation techniques may be used to aid in updating national soil survey inventories. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

As a result pedogenesis and the spatial distribution of soil properties are both influenced by features emerging at multiple scales. To account for this effect in a predictive model, descriptors of the geomorphic signature are required at multiple scales. In this study, we present a new hyper-scale terrain analysis approach, referred to as Contextual Statistical Mapping (ConStat), which is based on statistical neighborhood measures derived for growing sparse circular neighborhoods. The statistical measures tested comprise basic descriptors such as the minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, and skewness, as well as statistical terrain attributes and directional components. We propose a data mining framework to determine the relevant statistical measures at the relevant scales to analyze and interpret the influence of these statistical measures and to map the geomorphic structures influencing soil formation and the regions where a statistical measure shows influence. We introduce ConStat on two landscape-scale DSM examples with different soil genesis regimes where the ConStat terrain features serve as proxies for multi-scale variations of climate and parent material conditions. The results show that ConStat provides high predictive power. The cross-validated R-2 values range from 0.63 for predicting topsoil clay content in the Piracicaba area (Brazil) to 0.68 for topsoil silt content in the Rhine-Hesse area (Germany). The results obtained from data mining analysis allow for interpretations beyond conventional concepts and approaches to explain soil formation. As such it overcomes the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability of soil property predictions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using spatial data support for reducing uncertainty in geospatial applications	GEOINFORMATICA			English	Article						Mutual information; Data support; Sensor networks; Time series data; Spatial data mining	TIME-SERIES DATA; WAVELETS	Widespread use of GPS devices and ubiquity of remotely sensed geospatial images along with cheap storage devices have resulted in vast amounts of digital data. More recently, with the advent of wireless technology, a large number of sensor networks have been deployed to monitor many human, biological and natural processes. This poses a challenge in many data rich application domains now: how to best choose the datasets to solve specific problems? In particular, some of the datasets may be redundant and their inclusion in analysis may not only be time consuming, but also lead to erroneous conclusions. On the other hand, excluding some of the datasets hastily might skew the observations drawn. We propose the concept of data support as the basis for efficient, cost-effective and intelligent use of geospatial data in order to reduce uncertainty in the analysis and consequently in the results. Data support is defined as the process of determining the information utility of a data source to help decide which one to include or exclude to improve cost-effectiveness in existing data analysis. In this paper we use mutual information-a concept popular in information theory as a measure to compute information gain or loss between two datasets-as the basis of computing data support. The flexibility and effectiveness of the approach are demonstrated using an application in the hydrological analysis domain, specifically, watersheds in the state of Nebraska.

Analyzing data from past transplants could enhance the understanding of the factors influencing success. Records up to 120 measurements per transplant procedure from 1751 patients undergoing BMT were collected (Shariati Hospital). Collaborative filtering techniques allowed the processing of highly sparse records with 22.3% missing values. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of various classification algorithms trained on predicting the survival status. Modest accuracy levels were obtained in predicting the survival status (AUC = 0.69). More importantly, however, operations that had the highest chances of success were shown to be identifiable with high accuracy, e. g., 92% or 97% when identifying 74 or 31 recipients, respectively. Identifying the patients with the highest chances of survival has direct application in the prioritization of resources and in donor matching. For patients where high-confidence prediction is not achieved, assigning a probability to their survival odds has potential applications in probabilistic decision support systems and in combination with other sources of information.

In general, people with dementia are reluctant to change; therefore, it is important that suitable assistive technologies are selected for them. Consequently, the development of predictive models that are able to determine a person's potential to adopt a particular technology is desirable. In this paper, a predictive adoption model for a mobile phone-based video streaming system, developed for people with dementia, is presented. Taking into consideration characteristics related to a person's ability, living arrangements, and preferences, this paper discusses the development of predictive models, which were based on a number of carefully selected data mining algorithms for classification. For each, the learning on different relevant features for technology adoption has been tested, in conjunction with handling the imbalance of available data for output classes. Given our focus on providing predictive tools that could be used and interpreted by healthcare professionals, models with ease-of-use, intuitive understanding, and clear decision making processes are preferred. Predictive models have, therefore, been evaluated on a multi-criterion basis: in terms of their prediction performance, robustness, bias with regard to two types of errors and usability. Overall, the model derived from incorporating a k-Nearest-Neighbour algorithm using seven features was found to be the optimal classifier of assistive technology adoption for people with dementia (prediction accuracy 0.84 +/- 0.0242).

Waiting lists for surgery have always been a societal problem, which governments have been fighting with different management and operational stimulus plans. The current hospital information systems available in Portuguese public hospitals, lack a decision support system component that could help achieve better planning solutions. Thus, an intelligent decision support system has been developed, allowing the centralization and standardization of planning processes, improving the efficiency of the operating theater and tackling the waiting lists for surgery fragile situation. The intelligence of the system derives from data mining and optimization techniques, which enhance surgery duration predictions and operating rooms surgery schedules. Experimental results show significant gains, reducing overtime, undertime, and better resource utilization. Note to Practitioners-The Operating Theater (OT) is often considered hospitals' biggest budget consumer and revenue center in a hospital. This paper was motivated by a project that aims to reduce expenses and surgery waiting lists in Portuguese public hospitals, by developing an Intelligent Decision Support System (DSS) to support surgery scheduling. Prior to this research, decision makers (Surgeons, Department managers, Operating theatre managers) used their experience to make allocation, scheduling and estimation decisions. Since many of these decisions are made without analyzing past results, mistakes occur frequently, affecting the OT performance. With the help of business intelligence, data mining and optimization algorithms, surgeons' estimations can be more precise and the operating room schedule can be optimized. Preliminary experiments on the usage of DSS reveal a remarkable increase of the efficiency of the whole OT. In future research, we will extend the DSS and the techniques used to address the tactical master surgery scheduling problem, which aims to perform a better allocation of the different specialties to the operating rooms along the week. In addition, upstream and downstream resources shall be considered in the optimization module, as well as a simulation component to better evaluate generated solutions.

A possible solution to these problems is the use of a new type of the relay which takes advantage of the enhanced processing techniques and communication infrastructure, both of which are recently becoming available for power networks application. This paper proposes a new communication-based protection scheme for isolated microgrids where a data mining approach is used to identify the relay settings and parameters. A feature selection technique is implemented to help identify the most relevant electrical features required for the fault detection and to establish the best communication strategy to use between relays. The proposed approach is tested using a MATLAB simulation of a facility scale isolated microgrid embedded with IBDGs. The results show that a differential protection scheme that relies on symmetrical components is the most effective strategy for protecting microgrids with IBDGs.	[Casagrande, E.; Woon, W.

Exemplified on temperature anomalies in Europe and the tropical Pacific and Atlantic, the authors study lagged correlation and regressions analytically for a simple model system. A strong dependence on the influence of serial dependencies or autocorrelation is demonstrated, which can lead to misleading conclusions about time delays and also obscures a quantification of the interaction mechanism.To overcome these possible artifacts, the authors propose a two-step procedure based on the concept of graphical models recently introduced to climate research. In the first step, graphical models are used to detect the existence of (Granger) causal interactions that determine the time delays of a mechanism. In the second step, a certain partial correlation and a regression measure are introduced that allow one to specifically quantify the strength of an interaction mechanism in a well interpretable way that enables the exclusion of misleading effects of serial correlation as well as more general dependencies. The potential of the approach to quantify interactions between two and more processes is demonstrated by investigating teleconnections of ENSO and the mechanism of the Walker circulation.The article is intended to serve as a guideline to interpret lagged correlations and regressions in the presence of autocorrelation and introduces a powerful approach to analyze time delays and the strength of an interaction mechanism.

One approach to facilitate this task is network traffic summarization. Data summarization is a key concept in data mining. However, no current measures exist in order to facilitate the evaluation of summaries. This paper presents four metrics which can be used to characterize data summarization results. Conciseness and Information Loss have already been defined, but we modified Information Loss, due to the fact that it was biased towards recurring attributes across individual summaries. We also propose two additional metrics, Interestingness and Intelligibility. Using the proposed metrics, we evaluated existing summarization techniques on well known network traffic datasets. We also proposed a summarization technique, based on an existing one but incorporating the proposed metrics as objective function. In order to further demonstrate the usability of the metrics, we performed classification, on summarized datasets, showing that the metrics can be used to facilitate the selection of summaries for performing data mining. Using the summarized datasets with a reasonable conciseness, we were able to achieve similar results in terms of accuracy, but at a fraction of the running time, proportional to the conciseness of the summarized dataset.

Each router in CCN has a content store module to cache the chunks passed by, and is arranged in an arbitrary network topology. It is important to allocate an appropriate cache size to each router in order to both improve the network performance and reduce the economic investment. Previous works have proposed several heterogeneous cache allocation schemes, but the gain brought by these schemes is not obvious. In this paper, we introduce a data mining method into the cache size allocation. The proposed algorithm uses manifold learning to analyze the regularity of network traffic and user behaviors, and classify routers based on their roles in the content delivery. Guided by the manifold learning embedding results, a novel cache size optimization scheme is developed. Extensive experiments have been performed to evaluate the proposed scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing cache allocation schemes in CCN. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yun, U; Lee, G; Ryu, KH				Yun, Unil; Lee, Gangin; Ryu, Keun Ho			Mining maximal frequent patterns by considering weight conditions over data streams	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data stream; Data mining; Maximal frequent pattern mining; Weight condition; Knowledge discovery	EFFICIENT ALGORITHMS; SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS; ITEMSETS; SEQUENCES; MODELS; TREES	Frequent pattern mining over data streams is currently one of the most interesting fields in data mining. Current databases have needed more immediate processes since enormous amounts of data are being accumulated and updated in real time. However, existing traditional approaches have not been entirely suitable for a data stream environment since they operate with more than two database scans. Moreover, frequent pattern mining over data streams mostly generates an enormous number of frequent patterns, thereby causing a significant amount of overheads. In addition, as weight conditions are very useful factors in reflecting importance for each object in the real world, it is necessary to apply them to the mining process in order to obtain more practical, meaningful patterns. To consider and solve these problems, we propose a novel method for mining Weighted Maximal Frequent Patterns (WMFPs) over data streams, called MWS (Maximal frequent pattern mining with Weight conditions over data Streams). MWS guarantees efficient mining performance in the data stream environment by scanning stream databases only once, and prevents overheads of pattern extractions with an abbreviated notation: a maximal frequent pattern form instead of the general one. Furthermore, MWS contributes to enhanced reliability of the mining results by applying weight conditions to each element of the data streams. Extensive experiments report that MWS has outstanding performance in comparison to previous algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Microaggregation and generalization are two typical methods to implement k-anonymity. But both of them have some defects on anonymizing mixed microdata. To address the problem, we propose a novel anonymization method, named MAGE, which can retain more semantics than generalization and microaggregation in dealing with mixed microdata. The idea of MAGE is to combine the mean vector of numerical data with the generalization values of categorical data as a clustering centroid and to use it as incarnation of the tuples in the corresponding cluster. We also propose an efficient TSCKA algorithm to anonymize mixed data. Experimental results show that MAGE can anonymize mixed microdata effectively and the TSCKA algorithm can achieve better trade-off between data quality and algorithm efficiency comparing with two well-known anonymization algorithms, Incognito and KACA.

However, it is hard to improve the two elements since runtime is inversely proportional to memory usage in general. Researchers have made efforts to overcome the problem and have proposed mining methods which can improve both through various approaches. Many of state-of-the-art mining algorithms use tree structures, and they create nodes independently and connect them as pointers when constructing their own trees. Accordingly, the methods have pointers for each node in the trees, which is an inefficient way since they should manage and maintain numerous pointers. In this paper, we propose a novel tree structure to solve the limitation. Our new structure, LP-tree (Linear Prefix - Tree) is composed of array forms and minimizes pointers between nodes. In addition, LP-tree uses minimum information required in mining process and linearly accesses corresponding nodes. We also suggest an algorithm applying LP-tree to the mining process. The algorithm is evaluated through various experiments, and the experimental results show that our approach outperforms previous algorithms in term of the runtime, memory, and scalability.

We found that Isomap algorithm performs well for this problem. By comparing the performance of Isomap with that of principal component analysis (PCA), we found that (1) Isomap can project the spectra with similar features together and project the spectra with different features far away, while PCA may project the spectra with different features into nearby regions; (2) the outliers given by Isomap can be easily determined, and most of the outliers are binary stars with high scientific values; while the outliers given by PCA are difficult to determine and most of outliers are not binary stars. Thus, Isomap is more efficient than PCA in finding the outliers. Since the spectral data used in experiment are the spectra from the ninth data release of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR9), Isomap can find the spectra misclassified by SDSS pipeline efficiently and improve the classification accuracy obviously. Furthermore, since most of the spectra misclassified by SDSS pipeline are binary stars, Isomap can improve the efficiency of finding the binary stars with high scientific values. Though the experiment results show that Isomap is more sensitive to the noise than PCA, this disadvantage will not affect the application of Isomap in spectral classification since most of the spectra with low signal-to-noise ratios are the spectra whose spectral type can't be determined manually.

Although different industries face different levels of competition and therefore the likelihood of financial distress can differ for firms in different industries, scant attention has been paid to predicting restaurant financial distress. The primary objective of this paper is to examine the key financial distress factors for publicly traded U.S. restaurants for the period from 1988 to 2010 using decision trees (DT) and AdaBoosted decision trees. The AdaBoosted DT model for the entire dataset revealed that financially distressed restaurants relied more heavily on debt; and showed lower rates of increase of assets, lower net profit margins, and lower current ratios than non-distressed restaurants. A larger proportion of debt in the capital structure ruined restaurants' financial structure and the inability to pay their drastically increased debt exposed restaurants to financial distress. Additionally, a lack of capital efficiency increased the possibility of financial distress. We recommend the use of the AdaBoosted DT model as an early warning system for restaurant distress prediction because the AdaBoosted DT model demonstrated the best prediction performance with the smallest error in overall and type I error rates. The results of two subset models for full-service and limited-service restaurants indicated that the segments had slightly different financial risk factors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Covering-based rough fuzzy sets and binary relation	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Rough set; fuzzy set; data mining; covering; approximation		Rough set theory is a powerful tool for dealing with uncertainty, granularity, and incompleteness of knowledge in information systems. In this paper we study covering-based rough fuzzy sets in which a fuzzy set can be approximated by the intersection of some elements in a covering of the universe of discourse. Some properties of the covering-based fuzzy lower and upper approximation operators are examined. We present the conditions under which two coverings generate the same covering-based fuzzy lower and upper approximation. We approximate fuzzy sets based on a binary relation and its properties are introduced. Finally, we establish the equivalency between rough fuzzy sets generated by a covering and rough fuzzy sets generated by a binary relation.	[Kozae, A.

Characterization of Glycoproteins in Pancreatic Cyst Fluid Using a High-Performance Multiple Lectin Affinity Chromatography Platform	JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH			English	Article						pancreatic cancer; pancreatic cyst fluid; mucinous cyst; nonmucinous cyst; glycoproteins; biomarker discovery	SALT-STIMULATED LIPASE; BREAST-CANCER; M-LAC; PERIOSTIN; EXPRESSION; BIOMARKERS; PROTEOMICS; NEOPLASMS; PATHWAY; CELLS	Currently, pancreatic cancer is the fourth cause of cancer death. In 2013, it is estimated that similar to 38 460 people will die of pancreatic cancer. Early detection of malignant cyst (pancreatic cancer precursor) is necessary to help prevent late diagnosis of the tumor. In this study, we characterized glycoproteins and nonglycoproteins on pooled mucinous (n = 10) and nonmucinous (n = 10) pancreatic cyst fluid to identify "proteins of interest" to differentiate between mucinous cyst from nonmucinous cyst and investigate these proteins as potential biomarker targets. An automated multilectin affinity chromatography (M-LAC) platform was utilized for glycoprotein enrichment followed by nano-LC-MS/MS analysis. Spectral count quantitation allowed for the identification of proteins with significant differential levels in mucinous cysts from nonmucinous cysts of which one protein (periostin) was confirmed via immunoblotting. To exhaustively evaluate differentially expressed proteins, we used a number of proteomic tools including gene ontology classification, pathway and network analysis, Novoseek data mining, and chromosome gene mapping. Utilization of complementary proteomic tools revealed that several of the proteins such as mucin 6 (MUC6), bile Salt-activated lipase (CEL), and pyruvate kinase lysozyme M1/M2 with significant differential expression have strong association with pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, chromosome gene mapping demonstrated coexpressions and colocalization of some proteins of interest including 14-3-3 protein epsilon (YWHAE), pigment epithelium derived factor (SERPINF1), and oncogene p53.

An efficient projection-based indexing approach for mining high utility itemsets	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Utility mining; High utility itemsets; High transaction-weighted utilization itemsets; Indexing mechanism	FREQUENT ITEMSETS; CONSTRAINTS; DATABASES; PATTERNS	Recently, utility mining has widely been discussed in the field of data mining. It finds high utility itemsets by considering both profits and quantities of items in transactional data sets. However, most of the existing approaches are based on the principle of levelwise processing, as in the traditional two-phase utility mining algorithm to find a high utility itemsets. In this paper, we propose an efficient utility mining approach that adopts an indexing mechanism to speed up the execution and reduce the memory requirement in the mining process. The indexing mechanism can imitate the traditional projection algorithms to achieve the aim of projecting sub-databases for mining. In addition, a pruning strategy is also applied to reduce the number of unpromising itemsets in mining. Finally, the experimental results on synthetic data sets and on a real data set show the superior performance of the proposed approach.

In recent years there has been significant research effort spent on efficiently discovering these motifs in static time series data. However, for many applications, the streaming nature of time series demands a new kind of methods for discovery of time series motifs. In this paper, we develop a new method for motif discovery in streaming time series. In this method we use significant extreme points to determine motif candidates and then cluster motif candidates by BIRCH algorithm. The method is very effective not only for large time series data but also for streaming environment since it needs only one-pass of scan through the whole data.

In TPR, the dataset is distributed across a large number of users in which each record is owned by two different users, one user only knows the values for a subset of attributes and the other knows the values for the remaining attributes. A miner aims to learn, for example, classification rules on their data, while preserving each user's privacy. In this work we develop a cryptographic solution for frequency-based learning methods in TPR. The crucial step in the proposed solution is the privacy-preserving computation of frequencies of a tuple of values in the users' data, which can ensure each user's privacy without loss of accuracy. We illustrate the applicability of the method by using it to build the privacy preserving protocol for the naive Bayes classifier learning, and briefly address the solution in other applications. Experimental results show that our protocol is efficient.			luongthedung@gmail.com; hungtd@hnue.edu.vn						25	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	2194-5357		978-3-319-02821-7; 978-3-319-02820-0	ADV INTELL SYST			2014	245						319	335		10.1007/978-3-319-02821-7_29		17	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BJR51	WOS:000329821100029

It was originally applied on Market Basket Analysis (MBA) problem which represents the Boolean databases. In those databases, only the existence of an article (item) in a transaction is defined. However, in real-world application, the gathered information generally suffer from imperfections. In fact, a piece of information may contain two types of imperfection: imprecision and uncertainty. Recently, a new database representing and integrating those two types of imperfection were introduced: Evidential Database. Only few works have tackled those databases from a data mining point of view. In this work, we aim to discuss evidential itemset's support. We improve the complexity of state of art methods for support's estimation. We also introduce a new support measure gathering fastness and precision. The proposed methods are tested on several constructed evidential databases showing performance improvement.

In this paper, we propose an efficient concurrent algorithm, called CHUI-Mine (Concurrent High Utility Itemsets Mine), for mining high utility itemsets by dynamically pruning the tree structure. A tree structure, called the CHUI-Tree, is introduced to capture the important utility information of the candidate itemsets. By recording changes in support counts of candidate high utility items during the tree construction process, we implement dynamic CHUI-Tree pruning, and discuss the rationality thereof. The CHUI-Mine algorithm makes use of a concurrent strategy, enabling the simultaneous construction of a CHUI-Tree and the discovery of high utility itemsets. Our algorithm reduces the problem of huge memory usage for tree construction and traversal in tree-based algorithms for mining high utility itemsets. Extensive experimental results show that the CHUI-Mine algorithm is both efficient and scalable.

However, very few studies have been devoted to deal with privacy issues in this domain. Privacy is of great concern and preserving users' privacy plays a crucial role to promote their trust in agent-based technologies. In this paper, we focus on preference profiling, which is a well-known threat to users' privacy. Specifically, we review strategies for customers' agents to prevent seller agents from obtaining accurate preference profiles of the former group by using data mining techniques. We experimentally show the efficacy of each of these strategies and discuss their suitability in different situations. Our experimental results show that customers can improve their privacy notably with these strategies.

Electronic healthcare (eHealth) solutions are often introduced to deal with these issues. This technological equipment further increases the complexity of healthcare as the caregivers are responsible for integrating and configuring these solutions to their needs. Small differences in user requirements often occur between various environments where the services are deployed. It is difficult to capture these nuances at development time. Consequently, the services are not tuned towards the users' needs. This paper describes our experiences with extending an eHealth application with self-learning components such that it can automatically adjust its parameters at run-time to the users' needs and preferences. These components gather information about the usage of the application. This collected information is processed by data mining techniques to learn the parameter values for the application. Each discovered parameter is associated with a probability, which expresses its reliability. Unreliable values are filtered. The remaining parameters and their reliability are integrated into the application. The eHealth application is the ontology-based Nurse Call System (oNCS), which assesses the priority of a call based on the current context and assigns the most appropriate caregiver to a call. Decision trees and Bayesian networks are used to learn and adjust the parameters of the oNCS. For a realistic dataset of 1050 instances, correct parameter values are discovered very efficiently as the components require at most 100 ms execution time and 20 MB memory. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The education is provided by the social democratisation of the knowledge. This corresponds to the proportion of the arguments that support the positions. These arguments are extracted from the opinions expressed in the discussion stages included in the e-democracy models. (Moreno-Jimenez et al., 2012) presented a collaborative platform which is currently being used as the methodological support for the cognitive democracy known as e-cognocracy (Moreno-Jimenez, 2003a, 2004, 2006; Moreno-Jimenez & Polasek, 2003, 2005) and for identifying and classifying the messages or opinions that favour the different individual positions through the employment of quantitative (data mining) and qualitative (text mining) approaches. This paper represents the next step in the phase concerned with extraction of the policy-making arguments. Using opinion analysis techniques, the new e-learning tool extracts the arguments that support the different opinions. This tool has been applied to the discussion stage of a case study developed at the University of Zaragoza concerning the possible location of Europe's biggest leisure complex (Gran Scala) in Aragon (Spain).

In this paper, we present the Usage Mining Method to guide the analysis of data collected during software operation, in order to extract knowledge about how a software product is used by the end-users. Our method suggests three analysis tasks which employ data mining techniques for extracting usage knowledge from software operation data: users profiling, clickstream analysis and classification analysis. The Usage Mining Method was evaluated through a prototype that was executed in the case of Exact Online, the main online financial management application in the Netherlands. The evaluation confirmed the supportive role of the Usage Mining Method in software product management and development processes, as well as the applicability of the suggested data mining algorithms to carry out the usage analysis tasks.

However, in a real context, sufficient labeled examples are not always available because human labeling is enormously time-consuming. For this reason, there has been recent interest in methods that are capable of obtaining a high accuracy when the size of the training set is small. In this paper we introduce a new single label text classification method that performs better than baseline methods when the number of labeled examples is small. Differently from most of the existing methods that usually make use of a vector of features composed of weighted words, the proposed approach uses a structured vector of features, composed of weighted pairs of words. The proposed vector of features is automatically learned, given a set of documents, using a global method for term extraction based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation implemented as the Probabilistic Topic Model. Experiments performed using a small percentage of the original training set (about 1%) confirmed our theories. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We structure this exploratory research according to the steps of the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) process. Firstly, we interview 22 experts to determine the information needs in long-term care which we, secondly, translate into 25 data mining goals. Thirdly, we perform a single case study at a Dutch long-term care institution with around 850 clients in five locations. We analyze the institution's database which contains information from April 2008 to April 2012 to identify patterns in incident information, patterns in risk assessment information, the relationship between risk assessments and incident information, patterns in the average duration of stay, and we identify and predict Care Intensity Package (ZZP) combinations. Fourth and finally, we position all data mining goals in a two-by-two matrix to visualize the relative importance of each goal in relation to both quality of care and financial state of care institutions.

Optimization design method of product general tolerance system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Tolerance system; General tolerance; Optimization design; SVNR	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; GENETIC ALGORITHM; ALLOCATION; COST	A product manufacturing process starts from parts processing, then assembles parts into components, and forms the product finally. To obtain an expected product quality, the quality characteristics in the part level, component level, and product level must be controlled, and the deviations between their actual and target values are required to keep in specified tolerances. All these tolerances form a product tolerance system, and the quality characteristics of product levels contain the geometric and the non-geometric parameters, which are interrelated and form a complex system. General tolerance is the total amount the actual parameters are permitted to vary, which not only include the geometric parameters in machining, but also includes physical, chemical, electrical, and other parameters. What most concerns the product users is whether product quality characteristics meet their requirements, rather than a component quality characteristic or part quality characteristic, and the product quality characteristics are generally not only geometric quantities but also include many non-geometric quantities. The product tolerance system optimization design from part level to product level cannot be achieved, as it includes geometric and non-geometric quantities. In this paper, a product tolerance system model is developed on the basis of determining the quality characteristics of product levels, and the information of the product levels quality characteristics is excavated from data recorded in the product testing process using data mining methods through the support vector nonlinear regression relational model between parts quality characteristics deviations and product quality characteristics deviations. Then, the product manufacturing cost model is set up, which includes the machining dimensional tolerances and non-geometric tolerances, and the product tolerance system optimization model is developed by minimizing the product manufacturing costs as the objective function and the quality characteristics tolerances of product levels as constraint conditions. Finally, a micro-motor product is used as an example to optimize its tolerance system, and its manufacturing costs are decreased by 13.14 %. The results show that the developed method is effective and provides a new way for the product tolerance system optimization.	[Zhao, Y.

J	Hruschka, H				Hruschka, Harald			Analyzing market baskets by restricted Boltzmann machines	OR SPECTRUM			English	Article						Market basket analysis; Retailing; Marketing; Data mining	PRICE SENSITIVITIES; MODEL; HOUSEHOLDS; CATEGORIES; DECISIONS; LATTICE	We introduce a model which differs from the well-known multivariate logit model (MVL) used to analyze the cross-category dependence in market baskets by the addition of binary hidden variables. This model is called restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and new to the marketing literature. Extant applications of the MVL model for higher numbers of categories typically follow a two-step approach as simultaneous maximum likelihood estimation is computationally infeasible. In contrast to the MVL, the RBM can be simultaneously estimated by maximum likelihood even for a higher number of categories as long as the number of hidden variables is moderate. We measure the cross-category dependence by pairwise marginal cross effects which are obtained using estimated coefficients and sampling of baskets. In the empirical study, we analyze market baskets consisting of the 60 most frequently purchased categories of the assortment of a supermarket. For a validation data set, the RBM performs better than the MVL model estimated by maximum pseudo-likelihood. For our data, about 75 % of the baskets are reproduced by the model without cross-category dependence, but 25 % of the baskets cannot be adequately modeled if cross effects are ignored. Moreover, it turns out that both the number of significant cross effects and their relationships can be grasped rather easily.

However, the casing coupling location signal is usually submerged in noise, which will result in the failure of casing coupling detection under the harsh logging environment conditions. The limitation of Shannon wavelet time entropy, in the feature extraction of casing status, is presented by analyzing its application mechanism, and a corresponding improved algorithm is subsequently proposed. On the basis of wavelet transform, two derivative algorithms, singular values decomposition and Tsallis entropy theory, are proposed and their physics meanings are researched. Meanwhile, a novel data mining approach to extract casing status features with Tsallis wavelet singularity entropy is put forward in this paper. The theoretical analysis and experiment results indicate that the proposed approach can not only extract the casing coupling features accurately, but also identify the characteristics of perforation and local corrosion in casings. The innovation of the paper is in the use of simple wavelet entropy algorithms to extract the complex nonlinear logging signal features of a horizontal well tractor.

A methodological analysis of the literature about the topic was carried out, together with a qualitative comparative analysis' to give a more comprehensive review. Bioinformatics methods for whole-protein or protein-domain identification are commonly based on pairwise protein sequence comparisons; we added comparison of structures to detect the whole universe of proteins containing the PUA domain. We present an update of proteins having this domain, focusing on the specific proteins present in Homosapiens (dyskerin, MCT1, Nip7, eIF2D and Nsun6), and explore the existence of these in other species. We also analyze the phylogenetic distribution of the PUA domain in different species and proteins. Finally, we performed a structural comparison of the PUA domain through data mining of structural databases, determining a conserved structural motif, despite the differences in the sequence, even among eukaryotes, archaea and bacteria. All data discussed in this review, both bibliographic and analytical, corroborate the functional importance of the PUA domain in RNA-binding proteins.

Genome sequence databases provide potential to design new markers for various applications. Here we present the application of a recently developed core set of nuclear intron-targeting (indel) markers. These markers are based on the fact that in the plant genome introns are more variable than exons; therefore primers flanking exons can reveal polymorphisms related to introns. We detected such variation among accessions of the eight different species of black nightshades (Solanum sect. Solanum). Members of this group are important sources of food, mostly in Africa, while others are poisonous weeds with near global distribution. The tested 29 primers were designed previously for potato based on Solanaceae EST and other genomic databases and targeted 16 different genes. Our results showed that Solanum intron-targeting markers are not very polymorphic but identified considerable structure among accessions indicating fairly high interspecies differentiation. Further analyses showed that inbreeding is unlikely to be the major driving force in determining the genetic structure of the analyzed species. All phylogenetic analyses resolved the species included in our study as distinct clades with high support values, but provided weak information about their internal relationships. In summary, indel markers would be useful for the assignment of new Solanum germplasm to taxonomic groups or to identify certain taxa. They could also be used to address important question about genetic diversity and should yield results comparable to other markers covering the whole genome.

From Amazon to Apple: Modeling Online Retail Sales, Purchase Incidence, and Visit Behavior	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & ECONOMIC STATISTICS			English	Article						Copulas; Marketing models; Online purchasing	CLICKSTREAM DATA; DISTRIBUTIONS; COPULA	In this study, we propose a multivariate stochastic model for Web site visit duration, page views, purchase incidence, and the sale amount for online retailers. The model is constructed by composition from carefully selected distributions and involves copula components. It allows for the strong nonlinear relationships between the sales and visit variables to be explored in detail, and can be used to construct sales predictions. The model is readily estimated using maximum likelihood, making it an attractive choice in practice given the large sample sizes that are commonplace in online retail studies. We examine a number of top-ranked U. S. online retailers, and find that the visit duration and the number of pages viewed are both related to sales, but in very different ways for different products. Using Bayesian methodology, we show how the model can be extended to a finite mixture model to account for consumer heterogeneity via latent household segmentation. The model can also be adjusted to accommodate a more accurate analysis of online retailers like apple.com that sell products at a very limited number of price points. In a validation study across a range of different Web sites, we find that the purchase incidence and sales amount are both forecast more accurately using our model, when compared to regression, probit regression, a popular data-mining method, and a survival model employed previously in an online retail study.

This study found that tourism destination research is organized into four different concentrations of interest: destination image, tourist experience and stakeholder involvement, structural equation modeling, and customer relationship management. Future tourism destination research will probably continue to focus on these topics. This study presents a new way for researchers to profile development patterns objectively and provides a key reading method for searching useful research directions.

However, like other evolutionary algorithms, it tends to suffer from premature convergence and slow convergence rate when solving complex problems. In this paper, we propose an enhanced GEP algorithm, called CTSGEP, which is inspired by the principle of minimal free energy in thermodynamics. In CTSGEP, it employs a component thermodynamical selection (CTS) operator to quantitatively keep a balance between the selective pressure and the population diversity during the evolution process. Experiments are conducted on several benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. The results show that the performance of CTSGEP is better than the conventional GEP and some GEP variations.

Such bugs are not localized to one component that is faulty, but rather result from complex and unexpected interactions between multiple often individually nonfaulty components. Moreover, the manifestations of these bugs are often not repeatable, making them particularly hard to find, as the particular sequence of events that invokes the bug may not be easy to reconstruct. Because of the distributed nature of failure scenarios, our tool looks for sequences of events that may be responsible for faulty behavior, as opposed to localized bugs such as a bad pointer in a module. We identified several challenges in applying discriminative sequence mining for root cause analysis when the system fails to perform as expected and presented our solutions to those challenges. We also present two alternative schemes, namely, two-stage mining and the progressive discriminative sequence mining to address the scalability challenge. An extensible framework is developed where a front-end collects runtime data logs of the system being debugged and an offline back-end uses frequent discriminative pattern mining to uncover likely causes of failure. We provided several case studies where we applied our tool successfully to troubleshoot the cause of the problem. We uncovered a kernel-level race condition bug in the LiteOS operating system and a protocol design bug in the directed diffusion protocol. We also presented a case study of debugging a multichannel MAC protocol that was found to exhibit corner cases of poor performance (worse than single-channel MAC). The tool helped to uncover event sequences that lead to a highly degraded mode of operation. Fixing the problem significantly improved the performance of the protocol. We also evaluated the extensions presented in this article. Finally, we provided a detailed analysis of tool overhead in terms of memory requirements and impact on the running application.

Performance requirements are generally met as possible by finding some cases and changing their structures. However, when one is satisfied with the structures changed, the other effects are not taken into account by analyzing the correlations; that is, design conflicts are not identified and resolved. An approach to resolving the conflict problems is proposed based on propagation analysis in Extension Theory. Firstly, the extension distance is improved to better fit evaluating the similarity among cases, then, a case retrieval method is developed. Secondly, the transformations that can be made on selected cases are formulated by understanding the conflict natures in the different performance requirements, which leads to the extension transformation strategy development for coordinating conflicts using propagation analysis. Thirdly, the effects and levels of propagation are determined by analyzing the performance values before and after the transformations, thus the co-existing conflict coordination strategy of multiple performances is developed. The method has been implemented in a working prototype system for supporting decision-making. And it has been demonstrated the feasible and effective through resolving the conflicts of noise, exhaust, weight and intake pressure for the screw air compressor performance design.

Both the pathway activities and cytotoxicity effects were assessed using high-throughput screening (HTS) over an exposure period of up to 24 h and concentration range of 0.39200 mg L-1. HTS data were processed by outlier removal, normalization, and hit-identification (for significantly regulated cellular responses) to arrive at reliable multiparametric bioactivity profiles for the NPs. Association rule mining was then applied to the bioactivity profiles followed by a pruning process to remove redundant rules. The non-redundant association rules indicated that "significant regulation" of one or more cellular responses implies regulation of other (associated) cellular response types. Pairwise correlation analysis (via Pearson's x(2) test) and self-organizing map clustering of the different cellular response types indicated consistency with the identified non-redundant association rules. Furthermore, in order to explore the potential use of association rules as a tool for data-driven hypothesis generation, specific pathway activity experiments were carried out for ZnO NPs. The experimental results confirmed the association rule identified for the p53 pathway and mitochondrial superoxide levels (via MitoSox reagent) and further revealed that blocking of the transcriptional activity of p53 lowered the MitoSox signal. The present approach of using association rule mining for data-driven hypothesis generation has important implications for streamlining multi-parameter HTS assays, improving the understanding of NP toxicity mechanisms, and selection of endpoints for the development of nanomaterial structure-activity relationships.

Here by a metric we mean any image similarity or distance measure, and in this paper we consider intensity-based and statistical image measures and focus on registration as an image processing problem. We show how it is possible to develop meta-algorithms that evaluate different image processing results with a number of different metrics and mine the results in an automated fashion so as to select the best results. We show that the mining of multiple metrics offers a variety of potential benefits for many image processing problems, including improved robustness and validation.

Following the mainstream of MRDM research, we tackle the regression where the goal is to examine samples of past experience with known continuous answers (response) and generalize future cases through an inductive process. Mr-SMOTI, the solution we propose, resorts to the structural approach in order to recursively partition data stored into a tightly-coupled database and build a multi-relational model tree which captures the linear dependence between the response variable and one or more explanatory variables. The model tree is top-down induced by choosing, at each step, either to partition the training space or to introduce a regression variable in the linear models with the leaves. The tight-coupling with the database makes the knowledge on data structures (foreign keys) available free of charge to guide the search in the multi-relational pattern space. Experiments on artificial and real databases demonstrate that in general Mr-SMOTI outperforms both SMOTI and M5' which are two propositional model tree induction systems, and TILDE-RT which is a state-of-art structural model tree induction system.

The solution of the CSG problem finds applications in many fields such as Machine Learning (set covering machines, clustering), Data Mining (decision tree, discretization), Graph Theory, Natural Language Processing (aggregation), Semantic Web (service composition), and Bioinformatics. The problem of finding the optimal coalition structure is NP-complete. In this paper we present a greedy adaptive search procedure (GRASP) with path-relinking to efficiently search the space of coalition structures. Experiments and comparisons to other algorithms prove the validity of the proposed method in solving this hard combinatorial problem.	[Di Mauro, Nicola; Basile, Teresa M.

In recent years there has been a significant amount of research work in clustering categorical data. However, most of these works deal with market-basket type transaction data and are not specifically optimized for high-dimensional vectors. Our focus in this paper is to efficiently cluster high-dimensional vectors in non-ordered discrete data spaces (NDDS). We have defined several necessary geometrical concepts in NDDS which form the basis of our clustering algorithm. Several new heuristics have been employed exploiting the characteristics of vectors in NDDS.

It contains Python bindings that allow raw access to the data structures and algorithms implemented in OpenMS, specifically those for file access (mzXML, mzML, TraML, mzIdentML among others), basic signal processing (smoothing, filtering, de-isotoping, and peak-picking) and complex data analysis (including label-free, SILAC, iTRAQ, and SWATH analysis tools). pyOpenMS thus allows fast prototyping and efficient workflow development in a fully interactive manner (using the interactive Python interpreter) and is also ideally suited for researchers not proficient in C++. In addition, our code to wrap a complex C++ library is completely open-source, allowing other projects to create similar bindings with ease. The pyOpenMS framework is freely available at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyopenms while the autowrap tool to create Cython code automatically is available at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autowrap (both released under the 3-clause BSD licence).

J	Shah, RA; Asghar, S				Shah, Rahat Ali; Asghar, Sohail			Privacy preserving in association rules using a genetic algorithm	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						Privacy preserving data mining; association rules; sensitive association rules hiding; genetic algorithm		Association rule mining is one of the data mining techniques used to extract hidden knowledge from large datasets. This hidden knowledge contains useful and confidential information that users want to keep private from the public. Similarly, privacy preserving data mining techniques are used to preserve such confidential information or restrictive patterns from unauthorized access. The pattern can be represented in the form of a frequent itemset or association rule. Furthermore, a rule or pattern is marked as sensitive if its disclosure risk is above a given threshold. Numerous techniques have been used to hide sensitive association rules by performing some modifications in the original dataset. Due to these modifications, some nonrestrictive patterns may be lost, called lost rules, and new patterns are also generated, known as ghost rules. In the current research work, a genetic algorithm is used to counter the side effects of lost rules and ghost rules. Moreover, the technique can be applied for small as well as for large datasets in the domain of medical, military, and business datasets.

Current 3D imaging-technologies (various types MRI, PET, SPEC!') are labeled, i.e. they trace the localization of a specific compound in the body. In contrast, 3D MALDI mass spectrometry-imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a label-free method imaging the spatial distribution of molecular compounds. It complements 3D imaging labeled methods, immunohistochemistty, and genetics-based methods. However, 3D MALDI-MSI cannot tap its full potential due to the lack of statistical methods for analysis and interpretation of large and complex 3D datasets. To overcome this, we established a complete and robust 3D MALDI-MSI pipeline combined with efficient computational data analysis methods for 3D edge preserving image denoising, 3D spatial segmentation as well as finding colocalized m/z values, which will be reviewed here in detail. Furthermore, we explain, why the integration and correlation of the MALDI imaging data with other imaging modalities allows to enhance the interpretation of the molecular data and provides visualization of molecular patterns that may otherwise not be apparent. Therefore, a 3D data acquisition workflow is described generating a set of 3 different dimensional images representing the same anatomies. First, an in-vitro MRI measurement is performed which results in a three-dimensional image modality representing the 3D structure of the measured object After sectioning the 3D object into N consecutive slices, all N slices are scanned using an optical digital scanner, enabling for performing the MS measurements. Scanning the individual sections results into low-resolution images, which define the base coordinate system for the whole pipeline. The scanned images conclude the information from the spatial (MRI) and the mass spectrometric (MALDI-MSI) dimension and are used for the spatial three-dimensional reconstruction of the object performed by image registration techniques. Different strategies for automatic serial image registration applied to MS datasets are outlined in detail. The third image modality is histology driven, Le. a digital scan of the histological stained slices in high-resolution. After fusion of reconstructed scan images and MRI the slice-related coordinates of the mass spectra can be propagated into 3D-space. After image registration of scan images and histological stained images, the anatomical information from histology is fused with the mass spectra from MALDI-MSI. As a result of the described pipeline we have a set of 3 dimensional images representing the same anatomies, i.e. the reconstructed slice scans, the spectral images as well as corresponding clustering results, and the acquired MRI. Great emphasis is put on the fact that the co-registered MRI providing anatomical details improves the interpretation of 3D MALDI images. The ability to relate mass spectrometry derived molecular information with in vivo and in vitro imaging has potentially important implications.

The proposed method utilizes a finite mixture partial least squares (FIMIX-PLS) approach to examine bidder behaviors and personality characteristics, evaluate bidder differences, and then segment the bidders. The empirical experiment is conducted for two different auction mechanisms - English and Vickrey. Results from both auction mechanisms indicate that FIMIX-PLS is capable of profiling and segmenting the bidders based on their individual characteristics. The post hoc analysis confirms the segmentation scheme and the capability of FIMIX-PLS in segmenting bidders into statistically identifiable homogeneous groups without a priori information of group characteristics. Such advantage is practical for online businesses dealing with increasing amount of data about their customers on a real time basis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Integrating these two sources of data not only enriches the information available for the forecasting model, but it can potentially capture joint patterns that may not otherwise be identified when each data source is employed separately. We start with market data and then gradually add various textual data representations, going from simple representations, such as word counts, to more advanced representations involving sentiment analysis. To find the incremental value of each data representation, we build an end-to-end recommendation process including data preprocessing, modeling, validation, trade recommendations and economic evaluation. Each component of the modeling process is optimized to remove human bias and to allow us to impartially compare the results of the various models. Additionally, we experiment with several forecasting algorithms to find the one that yields the "best" results according to a variety of performance criteria. We employ data representation procedures and modeling improvements beyond those used in previous related studies. The economic evaluation of the results is conducted using a simulation procedure that inherently accounts for transaction costs and eliminates biases that have potentially affected previous related data-mining studies. This research is one of the largest-scale data-mining studies for evaluating the effectiveness of integrating market data with textual news data for the purpose of stock investment recommendations. The results of our study are promising in that they show that augmenting market data with advanced textual data representation significantly improves stock purchase decisions. Best results are achieved when the approach is implemented with a nonlinear neural network forecasting algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Until now a radiological report could be regarded as a text phrased by a radiologist after viewing imaging data. New solutions will be accessed by advances in visualization of large datasets, in extracting, analyzing, and communicating metadata as well as by improved integration and interpretation of clinical information. Virtual reality, texture analysis, growing networks, semantic annotation, data mining and context based presentation have the potential to extensively change the everyday working routine. Although many of these developments are still in a laboratory phase, the impact on the process of reporting can already be predicted. As the leading community in information analysis and technology, radiology as a subject should strive to lead and shape these impending changes.

Phosphoproteomics is the analysis of protein phosphorylation on a proteome-wide scale, and mainly uses the same instrumentation and analogous strategies as conventional mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. Measurements can be performed either in a discovery-type, also known as shotgun mode, or in a targeted manner which monitors a set of a priori known phosphopeptides, such as members of a signal transduction pathway, across biological samples. Here, we delineate the different experimental levels at which measures can be taken to optimize the scope, reliability, and information content of phosphoproteomic analyses. Various chromatographic and chemical protocols exist to physically enrich phosphopeptides from proteolytic digests of biological samples. Subsequent mass spectrometric analysis revolves around peptide ion fragmentation to generate sequence information and identify the backbone sequence of phosphopeptides as well as the phosphate group attachment site(s), and different modes of fragmentation like collision-induced dissociation (CID), electron transfer dissociation (ETD), and higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) have been established for phosphopeptide analysis. Computational tools are important for the identification and quantification of phosphopeptides and mapping of phosphorylation sites, the deposition of large-scale phosphoproteome datasets in public databases, and the extraction of biologically meaningful information by data mining, integration with other data types, and descriptive or predictive modeling. Finally, we discuss how orthogonal experimental approaches can be employed to validate newly identified phosphorylation sites on a biochemical, mechanistic, and physiological level.

Among the existing privacy models, epsilon-differential privacy provides one of the strongest privacy guarantees. In this paper, we address the problem of private data publishing, where different attributes for the same set of individuals are held by two parties. In particular, we present an algorithm for differentially private data release for vertically partitioned data between two parties in the semihonest adversary model. To achieve this, we first present a two-party protocol for the exponential mechanism. This protocol can be used as a subprotocol by any other algorithm that requires the exponential mechanism in a distributed setting. Furthermore, we propose a two-party algorithm that releases differentially private data in a secure way according to the definition of secure multiparty computation. Experimental results on real-life data suggest that the proposed algorithm can effectively preserve information for a data mining task.

To cope with the needs of mainland tourists, Taiwan must reinforce the software and hardware facilities and service quality of its entire tourism industry. This will attract more tourists to Taiwan and create more opportunities for the Taiwanese tourism industry. In this article, tourists visiting Taiwan are asked to complete a questionnaire survey; we then use the satisfaction information gathered to perform grey relational analysis so as to understand the best and worst scoring questions related to satisfaction. From the analysis results, it can be seen that in the assessment of satisfaction question performance, Taiwanese cuisine scores the highest, the cleanliness of Taiwan's streets scores the lowest, and of people interviewed between 30 and 40 years old, more rated satisfaction performance and characteristics negatively.

J	Huang, AP; Zhu, W				Huang, Aiping; Zhu, William			Geometric Lattice Structure of Covering and Its Application to Attribute Reduction through Matroids	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article							GENERALIZED ROUGH SETS; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS	The reduction of covering decision systems is an important problem in data mining, and covering-based rough sets serve as an efficient technique to process the problem. Geometric lattices have been widely used in many fields, especially greedy algorithm design which plays an important role in the reduction problems. Therefore, it is meaningful to combine coverings with geometric lattices to solve the optimization problems. In this paper, we obtain geometric lattices from coverings through matroids and then apply them to the issue of attribute reduction. First, a geometric lattice structure of a covering is constructed through transversal matroids. Then its atoms are studied and used to describe the lattice. Second, considering that all the closed sets of a finite matroid form a geometric lattice, we propose a dependence space through matroids and study the attribute reduction issues of the space, which realizes the application of geometric lattices to attribute reduction. Furthermore, a special type of information system is taken as an example to illustrate the application. In a word, this work points out an interesting view, namely, geometric lattice, to study the attribute reduction issues of information systems.

An intelligent neuro fuzzy temporal knowledge representation model for mining temporal patterns	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Fuzzy Temporal Cognitive Maps (FTCMs); knowledge representation; temporal data mining; fuzzy reasoning; fuzzy temporal rules; neuro fuzzy inference system	COGNITIVE MAPS	Representation of temporal knowledge and analysis of temporal data is becoming a good practice for effective classification and prediction. Various semantic levels on knowledge representation schemes have been measured for temporal data. The existing Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) facilitate modeling dynamic systems for knowledge representation and reasoning under uncertainty. However, the FCMs are constructed manually and are constrained by the human experts' validation for assessing its reliability and they are lacking in considering temporal features necessary for reasoning in medical applications. This paper proposes a new temporal mining system known as Fuzzy Temporal Cognitive Map (FTCM), which defines a complete discrete temporal extension and fuzzy inference mechanism of FCM. In FTCM, the temporal dependencies of concepts during a particular time interval are measured. This work aims to reduce the complexities of dynamic modeling of a complex causal system by proposing a four layer fuzzy neural network to construct FTCM from the temporal data. In this proposed model, a fuzzy temporal mutual subsethood operator is used to measure the activation spread in the FTCM for automatic quantification of causalities. This FTCM is designed for a set of temporal clinical records, which can be further used for inferencing and prediction in medical diagnosis by generating a set of fuzzy temporal rules using Allen's temporal relationships and fuzzy temporal rules.

The Choquet integral with respect to fuzzy measures is one of them. We present some methods to identify fuzzy measures based on the Choquet integral in this paper. An iterative method introduced by Grabisch is discussed with some counterexamples. Furthermore, after removing some restrictions which are used in Grabisch's model, we introduce an algebraic method and a genetic algorithm to identify fuzzy measures and present some experimental results on both artificial and real-world data sets to show their effectiveness.

This shift is welcome as an act of patient autonomy, reflected in the term "expert patient". At the same time, there is considerable concern that patients can be easily misguided by pseudoscientific research and debate. Little is known about the sources of information used in health-related online forums, how users apply this information, and how they behave in such forums. Objective: The intent of the study was to identify (1) the sources of information used in online health-related forums, and (2) the roles and behavior of active forum visitors in introducing and disseminating this information. Methods: This observational study used the largest German multiple sclerosis (MS) online forum as a database, analyzing the user debate about the recently proposed and controversial Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency (CCSVI) hypothesis. After extracting all posts and then filtering relevant CCSVI posts between 01 January 2008 and 17 August 2012, we first identified hyperlinks to scientific publications and other information sources used or referenced in the posts. Employing k-means clustering, we then analyzed the users' preference for sources of information and their general posting habits. Results: Of 139,912 posts from 11,997 threads, 8628 posts discussed or at least mentioned CCSVI. We detected hyperlinks pointing to CCSVI-related scientific publications in 31 posts. In contrast, 2829 different URLs were posted to the forum, most frequently referring to social media, such as YouTube or Facebook. We identified a total of 6 different roles of hyperlink posters including Social Media Fans, Organization Followers, and Balanced Source Users. Apart from the large and nonspecific residual category of the "average user", several specific behavior patterns were identified, such as the small but relevant groups of CCSVI-Focused Responders or CCSVI Activators. Conclusions: The bulk of the observed contributions were not based on scientific results, but on various social media sources. These sources seem to contain mostly opinions and personal experience. A small group of people with distinct behavioral patterns played a core role in fuelling the discussion about CCSVI.

This paper focuses on this problem and constructs a timestamp-based sliding window model, which can be further converted into a transaction-based sliding window. Based on this model, an extended enumeration tree is developed to incrementally maintain the essential information. In our proposed frequent itemset mining algorithm, we introduce the type transforming bound to dynamically classify the itemsets into categories; thus, certain itemset processing can be deferred or ignored, that is, an itemset will not be handled unless its type transforming bounds reach a threshold; as a result, the computational pruning can be conducted. Nevertheless, it only guarantees the conditions to obtain accurate results, and thus cannot achieve the best performance. This problem is further improved in our approximate mining algorithm, in which we propose a heuristic rule-based strategy. Additionally, it can save more computational cost with a tolerable mining error. Theoretical analysis and experimental studies demonstrate that our proposed algorithms have high accuracy, spend less computational time and memory, and significantly outperform the baseline method and state-of-the-art algorithms.

An accurate missing value imputation is crucial to increase the usability of a data set for statistical analyses and data mining tasks. In this paper we present a novel missing value imputation technique using a data set's existing patterns including co-appearances of attribute values, correlations among the attributes and similarity of values belonging to an attribute. Our technique can impute both numerical and categorical missing values. We carry out extensive experiments on nine natural data sets, and compare our technique with four high quality existing techniques. We simulate 32 types of missing patterns (combinations), and thereby generate 320 missing data sets for each of the nine natural data sets. Two well known evaluation criteria namely index of agreement (d(2)) and root mean squared error are used. Our experimental results, based on the statistical sign test, indicate that our technique achieves significantly better imputation accuracy than the existing techniques. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However it is difficult to find a set of clusters that best fits natural partitions without any class information. In this paper, a method for detecting the optimal cluster number is proposed. The optimal cluster number can be obtained by the proposal, while partitioning the data into clusters by FCM (Fuzzy c-means) algorithm. It overcomes the drawback of FCM algorithm which needs to define the cluster number.. in advance. The method works by converting the fuzzy cluster result into a weighted bipartite network and then the optimal cluster number can be detected by the improved bipartite modularity. The experimental results on artificial and real data sets show the validity of the proposed method.

Consequently, site selection does not highlight locations with higher risk grades. Thus, a hybrid analytical method for the site selection of emergency response centers is proposed. First, spatial predicates are incorporated into emergency event analysis. These spatial predicates describe the spatial relationships between emergency locations and surrounding objects. A spatial data association mining method is then developed to identify the correlation rules that contain emergency information and geographical factors. Such rules act as the weight adding mechanism on different urban buildings, such that every spatial object is assigned a risk grade based on these rules. Furthermore, a simulated annealing algorithm is developed by incorporating the weight adding method to locate the optimal sites for emergency centers. A series of experiments is conducted, and the results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed hybrid method.

J	Chou, JS; Lee, CM				Chou, Jui-Sheng; Lee, Chen-Ming			Integrating the geographic information system and predictive data mining techniques to model effects of compound disasters in Taipei	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Multi-hazards; Shelter capacity; GIS; TELES; Data mining	CLASSIFICATION	Located in the circum-Pacific seismic zone, Taiwan is continually threatened by such natural disasters as typhoons, floods, landslides, and earthquakes, which increase risk of property loss and severely endanger public safety. Taipei City, the political and economic capital of Taiwan, must address disaster prevention and relief operations for compound disasters and extreme climatic events in addition to existing metropolitan disaster prevention operations. This study formulates 48 compound-disaster scenarios based on threats to Taipei City due to heavy rainfall and surrounding faults. Hydrology and flood analysis results and the Taiwan earthquake loss estimation system are utilized to assess the potential for compound disasters and the number of people they would displace in Taipei's administrative districts. Analytical results can be used to create a pre-disaster static potential diagram and a refuge or shelter capacity assessment table. The disaster potential diagram is adopted to conduct geographic information system spatial and data analysis, and temporary refuges or shelters planned by the city government are integrated for shelter capacity comparison. Furthermore, a dynamic assessment curve for the number of displaced people during a disaster is plotted using data mining and attribute filtering. Subsequently, a cross table is obtained and employed to predict the number of refugees in the various administrative districts. Finally, conclusions and recommendations are provided for making disaster prevention and relief decisions simultaneously concerning earthquakes and flooding.

NGSmethDB: an updated genome resource for high quality, single-cytosine resolution methylomes	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							DNA METHYLATION; SEQUENCING EXPERIMENTS; CPG ISLAND; CANCER; DATABASE; METHDB; MEMORY; MIRANALYZER; ANNOTATION; EXPRESSION	The updated release of 'NGSmethDB' (http://bioinfo2.ugr.es/NGSmethDB) is a repository for single-base whole-genome methylome maps for the best-assembled eukaryotic genomes. Short-read data sets from NGS bisulfite-sequencing projects of cell lines, fresh and pathological tissues are first pre-processed and aligned to the corresponding reference genome, and then the cytosine methylation levels are profiled. One major improvement is the application of a unique bioinformatics protocol to all data sets, thereby assuring the comparability of all values with each other. We implemented stringent quality controls to minimize important error sources, such as sequencing errors, bisulfite failures, clonal reads or single nucleotide variants (SNVs). This leads to reliable and high-quality methylomes, all obtained under uniform settings. Another significant improvement is the detection in parallel of SNVs, which might be crucial for many downstream analyses (e.g. SNVs and differential-methylation relationships). A next-generation methylation browser allows fast and smooth scrolling and zooming, thus speeding data download/upload, at the same time requiring fewer server resources. Several data mining tools allow the comparison/retrieval of methylation levels in different tissues or genome regions. NGSmethDB methylomes are also available as native tracks through a UCSC hub, which allows comparison with a wide range of third-party annotations, in particular phenotype or disease annotations.

Here, we describe Manteia, a resource available online at http://manteia.igbmc.fr. Manteia allows the comparison of embryological, expression, molecular and etiological data from human, mouse, chicken and zebrafish simultaneously to identify new functional and structural correlations and gene-disease associations. Manteia is particularly useful for the analysis of gene lists produced by high-throughput techniques such as microarrays or proteomics. Data can be easily analyzed statistically to characterize the function of groups of genes and to correlate the different aspects of their annotation. Sophisticated querying tools provide unlimited ways to merge the information contained in Manteia along with the possibility of introducing custom user-designed biological questions into the system. This allows for example to connect all the animal experimental results and annotations to the human genome, and take advantage of data not available for human to look for candidate genes responsible for genetic disorders. Here, we demonstrate the predictive and analytical power of the system to predict candidate genes responsible for human genetic diseases.

An intermodal freight transport system for optimal supply chain logistics	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Spatio-temporal data mining; Intermodal transport; Support vector machines; Mixed integer programming	SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; URBAN TRAFFIC FLOW; PREDICTION; CONTAINERS; NETWORKS; MODELS; VOLUME; TRAINS	Complexity in transport networks evokes the need for instant response to the changing dynamics and uncertainties in the upstream operations, where multiple modes of transport are often available, but rarely used in conjunction. This paper proposes a model for strategic transport planning involving a network wide intermodal transport system. The system determines the spatio-temporal states of road based freight networks (unimodal) and future traffic flow in definite time intervals. This information is processed to devise efficient scheduling plans by coordinating and connecting existing rail transport schedules to road based freight systems (intermodal). The traffic flow estimation is performed by kernel based support vector mechanisms while mixed integer programming (MIP) is used to optimize schedules for intermodal transport network by considering various costs and additional capacity constraints. The model has been successfully applied to an existing Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) distribution network in India with encouraging results, (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A hybrid Bayesian Network approach to detect driver cognitive distraction	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Driver cognitive distraction; Driver state monitoring; Distraction detection; Distraction mitigation; Layered algorithm; Bayesian Network; Data mining; Supervised clustering	EYE-MOVEMENTS; BEHAVIOR; ROAD; PERFORMANCE; MODEL	Driver cognitive distraction (e.g., hand-free cell phone conversation) can lead to unapparent, but detrimental, impairment to driving safety. Detecting cognitive distraction represents an important function for driver distraction mitigation systems. We developed a layered algorithm that integrated two data mining methods Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) and supervised clustering to detect cognitive distraction using eye movement and driving performance measures. In this study, the algorithm was trained and tested with the data collected in a simulator-based study, where drivers drove either with or without an auditory secondary task. We calculated 19 distraction indicators and defined cognitive distraction using the experimental condition (i.e., "distraction" as in the drives with the secondary task, and "no distraction" as in the drives without the secondary task). We compared the layered algorithm with previously developed DBN and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The results showed that the layered algorithm achieved comparable prediction performance as the two alternatives. Nonetheless, the layered algorithm shortened training and prediction time compared to the original DBN because supervised clustering improved computational efficiency by reducing the number of inputs for DBNs. Moreover, the supervised clustering of the layered algorithm revealed rich information on the relationship between driver cognitive state and performance. This study demonstrates that the layered algorithm can capitalize on the best attributes of component data mining methods and can identify human cognitive state efficiently. The study also shows the value in considering the supervised clustering method as an approach to feature reduction in data mining applications. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Through data mining from published transcriptomic database, topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) was first identified as a differentially upregulated gene in NPC tissues, which implicates cell division via selective cleavage, rearrangement, and re-ligation of DNA strands. Given the roles of TOP2A in prognostication and in the frontline therapeutic regimen of common carcinomas, such as breast cancer, we explored TOP2A immunoexpression status and its associations with clinicopathological variables and survival in a well-defined cohort of NPC patients. TOP2A immunohistochemistry was retrospectively performed and analyzed using H-score method for biopsy specimens from 124 NPC patients who received standard treatment without distant metastasis at initial diagnosis. Those cases with H-score larger than the median value were construed as featuring TOP2A overexpression. The findings were correlated with the clinicopathological variables, disease-specific survival (DSS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). TOP2A overexpression was significantly associated with American Joint of Cancer Committee (AJCC) stages III-IV (p = 0.019) and univariately predictive of adverse outcomes for DSS (p = 0.0078) and DMFS (p = 0.0003). In the multivariate comparison, TOP2A overexpression remained prognostically independent to portend worse DSS (p = 0.047, hazard ratio = 1.732) and DMFS (p = 0.003, hazard ratio = 2.569), together with advanced AJCC stages III-IV. TOP2A expression is upregulated in a subset of NPCs and its increased immunoexpression significantly correlated with advanced stages and tumor aggressiveness, justifying the potentiality of TOP2A as a prognostic biomarker and a novel therapeutic target of NPC.

This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey and a structural understanding of online portfolio selection techniques published in the literature. From an online machine learning perspective, we first formulate online portfolio selection as a sequential decision problem, and then we survey a variety of state-of-the-art approaches, which are grouped into several major categories, including benchmarks, Follow-the-Winner approaches, Follow-the-Loser approaches, Pattern-Matching-based approaches, and Meta-Learning Algorithms. In addition to the problem formulation and related algorithms, we also discuss the relationship of these algorithms with the capital growth theory so as to better understand the similarities and differences of their underlying trading ideas. This article aims to provide a timely and comprehensive survey for both machine learning and data mining researchers in academia and quantitative portfolio managers in the financial industry to help them understand the state of the art and facilitate their research and practical applications. We also discuss some open issues and evaluate some emerging new trends for future research.	[Li, Bin] Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Hoi, Steven C.

Proper positioning ensures that the public service system would complete its tasks to the end users. This paper is focused on finding the best location for public service system, to improve its efficiency when using uncertain data clustering. By choosing the best location for the service system the respond time can be minimised, and the given tasks could be performed in a reasonable time. Improved bisector pruning method was proposed for clustering previous data of public service system to find the best location for its application. Presented method can be used for different Public Service Systems, like tragic services, positioning of ambulance vehicles and other mobile objects. Cluster centres are used as best locations for public service systems because, cluster centres minimized total expected distance from tasks that have been set to the service system. On this way, public service system will be improved and can fulfil more tasks during the shortest period of time.

In contrast to other approaches that are presented in the literature, the proposed algorithm makes use of a test window that can discard non-frequent itemsets from a set of candidates. The efficiency of this approach relies on the property that the higher the support threshold is, the smaller the test window is. In addition to considering a sharp horizon, we consider a smooth window. Indeed, in many applications that are of practical interest, not all of the time slots have the same relevance, e.g., more recent slots can be more interesting than older slots. Smoothness can be determined in both qualitative and quantitative terms. A comparison to other algorithms is conducted. The experimental results prove that the proposed solution is faster than other approaches but has a slightly higher cost in terms of memory. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

The main reason is that, in general, the database has a collection of normalized tables that must be joined, aggregated and transformed in order to build the required data set. Such scenario results in many complex SQL queries that are written independently from each other, in a disorganized manner. Therefore, the database grows with many tables and views that are not present as entities in the ER model and similar SQL queries are written multiple times, creating problems in database evolution and software maintenance. In this paper, we classify potential database transformations, we extend an ER diagram with entities capturing database transformations and we introduce an algorithm which automates the creation of such extended ER model. We present a case study with a public database illustrating database transformations to build a data set to compute a typical data mining model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study investigates the role that rationality play in government funding on this important aspect of homeland security. In particular, it examines how environmental changes and project characteristics influence the allocation of security-related Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grants in the aviation industry. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The central hypothesis is that rationality regulates transportations security investment through the dynamic balancing between type I error and type II error concerns. To empirically validate it, this study conducts various analyses on AIP history data. In particular, it uses text mining to identify the security-related AIP grants and their coverage, trend analysis to compare the trends of security funding and other transportation investment, and classification tree analysis to determine the factors that influence the allocation of security-related grants. Findings - The longitudinal distribution of security-related grants differs from other types of transportation funding in terms of their distinct responses to terrorist and economic events. Project characteristics including project coverage and facility location have secondary yet consistent effects on the allocation of security-related grants. Originality/value - This study empirically validates the concept of rationality in transportation security investment. In particular, the findings support that it in constant moves along both longitudinal and cross-sectional dimensions. The dynamic and multi-facet nature of rationality provides the key for researchers and practitioners to understand security funding in aviation industry.

To collect research data without disrupting a design learning process, design actions and artifacts are continuously logged as time series by the CAD tool behind the scenes, while students are working on a design challenge. These fine-grained data can be used to reconstruct and analyze the entire design process of a student with extremely high resolution. Results of a pilot study in a high school engineering class, in which students solved a solar urban design challenge, suggest that these data can be used to measure the level of student engagement, reveal the gender differences in design behaviors, and distinguish the iterative and non-iterative cycles in a design process. From the perspective of engineering education, this paper contributes to the emerging fields of educational data mining and learning analytics that aim to expand evidence approaches for learning in a digital world.

Development of a thermal and electrical energy management in residential building micro-grid	JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY			English	Article							DISTRIBUTED GENERATION; OPERATION	Global warming and pressing concern about CO2 emission along with increasing fuel and oil cost have brought about great challenges for energy companies and homeowners. In this regard, a potential candidate solution is widely used for Distributed Energy Resources, which are capable of providing high quality, low-cost heat and power to off-grid or remote facilities. To appropriately manage thermal and electrical energy, a Smart Energy Management System (SEMS) with hierarchical control scheme has been presented. The developed SEMS model results in mixed integer non-linear programming optimization problem with the objective function of minimizing the operation cost as well as considering emissions. Moreover, the optimization problem has been solved for deterministic and stochastic scheduling algorithms. The novelty of this work is basically reliant on using data mining approach to reduce forecasting error. Several case studies have been carried out to evaluate the performance of proposed data mining method on both energy cost and expected cost. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

Databases, data mining and machine learning algorithms (MLAs), including artificial neural networks (ANNs), may assist by storing and interpreting data from multiple sources, potentially improving clinical decision-making. Aims: 1) Identify database technologies used to store AP data, 2) collate and categorise variables stored in AP databases, 3) identify the MLA technologies, including ANNs, used to analyse AP data, and 4) identify clinical and non-clinical benefits and obstacles in establishing a national or international AP database. Methods: Comprehensive systematic search of online reference databases. The predetermined inclusion criteria were all papers discussing 1) databases, 2) data mining or 3) MLAs, pertaining to AP, independently assessed by two reviewers with conflicts resolved by a third author. Results: Forty-three papers were included. Three data mining technologies and five ANN methodologies were reported in the literature. There were 187 collected variables identified. ANNs increase accuracy of severity prediction, one study showed ANNs had a sensitivity of 0.89 and specificity of 0.96 six hours after admission - compare APACHE II (cutoff score >= 8) with 0.80 and 0.85 respectively. Problems with databases were incomplete data, lack of clinical data, diagnostic reliability and missing clinical data. Conclusion: This is the first systematic review examining the use of databases, MLAs and ANNs in the management of AP. The clinical benefits these technologies have over current systems and other advantages to adopting them are identified. Copyright (C) 2013, IAP and EPC.

Recently, several data mining techniques have been used as a way to solve the problem of detecting construction materials. These studies have applied single classifiers to detect construction materials and distinguish them from the background by using color as a feature. Recent studies suggest that combining multiple classifiers (into what is called a heterogeneous ensemble classifier) would show better performance than using a single classifier. However, the performance of ensemble classifiers in construction material detection is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the performance of six single classifiers and potential ensemble classifiers on three data sets: one each for concrete, steel, and wood. A heterogeneous voting-based ensemble classifier was created by selecting base classifiers which are diverse and accurate; their prediction probabilities for each target class were averaged to yield a final decision for that class. In comparison with the single classifiers, the ensemble classifiers performed better in the three data sets overall. This suggests that it is better to use an ensemble classifier to enhance the detection of construction materials in images acquired on a construction site. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although several antidementia drugs such as donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and memantine have been developed, the effectiveness of AD drug therapy is still far from satisfactory. Recently, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been chosen as one of the personalized medicine markers. Many pharmacogenomics databases have been developed to provide comprehensive information by associating SNPs with drug responses, disease incidence, and genes that are critical in choosing personalized therapy. However, we found that some information from different sets of pharmacogenomics databases is not sufficient and this may limit the potential functions for pharmacogenomics. To address this problem, we used approximate string matching method and data mining approach to improve the searching of pharmacogenomics database. After computation, we can successfully identify more genes linked to AD and AD-related drugs than previous online searching. These improvements may help to improve the pharmacogenomics of AD for personalized medicine.

Game-Based Assessment of Persistence	EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY			English	Article						Game-based assessment; Persistence; Measurement models; Educational data mining	TASK PERSISTENCE; CHILDHOOD	Interest in 21st century skills has brought concomitant interest in ways to teach and measure them. Games hold promise in these areas, but much of their potential has yet to be proven, and there are few examples of how to use the rich data from games to make inferences about players' knowledge, skills, and attributes. This article builds an evidence model for the assessment of persistence from Poptropica, a popular commercial game for children. Task persistence is an important skill related to successful school and work outcomes, particularly given new, complex tasks requiring sustained application of effort. Evidence extracted from log files of the game was used to identify players with a particular goal and then create a measure of persistence toward that goal. The results support the ability to create an assessment argument for a game-based measure of persistence.

According to earlier studies, decision trees resulting from an open and semiautomatic data-mining process are practically useful when classifying subsequently data arising from a robotics class. The current study shows that data-mining features of the OME can be used to predict and, hence, support learning processes also with real-time data. Results show that the data-mining features of the OME are affected by the nature and amount of data when working with a small number of students. Furthermore, the results show that the robotics-class instructors are able to modify the learning environment to match to the current context in a way that goes beyond normal teacher activities in a classroom. This role blending between a teacher and a software developer in a learning environment provides a novel way to build a personalized and contextualized support environment for a robotics class.

Clinical Data Mining Related to the Japanese Kampo Concept "Hie'' (Oversensitivity to Coldness) in Men and Pre- and Postmenopausal Women	EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article								"Hie" is a subjective oversensitivity to cold and a condition experienced in 60% of Japanese citizens. The condition of hie has not been documented in Western medicine. However, in Kampo medicine, hie is an important target of treatment, because it has been considered one of the sources of all kinds of diseases. This study aimed to clarify the symptoms and findings associated with hie and contribute to increased precision in hie diagnosis. During 2005-2006, data from interviews of 1691 patients during their initial visit to the Kampo Clinic of Keio University Hospital were analyzed using a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, a data mining technique. Symptoms and findings characteristic of each group are follows as, postmenopausal women: fatigability, absence of lower abdominal pain, and absence of hot flashes of feet: women with menstruation: leg swelling, knee pain, and abdominal pain; men: insomnia, leg weakness, and absence of excess saliva. From the perspective of Kampo medicine the result suggested that the feature of hie condition in postmenopausal women, women with menstruation, and men is statistically different.

It generates groups of data points that are similar to each other in a given aspect. Each group has some inherent latent similarity which is computed using the similarity measures. Clustering web users based on navigational pattern has always been an interesting as well as a challenging task. A web user, based on its navigational pattern, may belong to multiple categories. Intrinsically, web user navigation pattern exhibits sequential property. When dealing with sequence data, a similarity measure should be chosen, which captures both the order as well as content information during computation of similarity among sequences. In this paper, we have utilized the Sequence and Set Similarity Measure ((SM)-M-3) with rough set based similarity upper approximation clustering algorithm to group web users based on their navigational patterns. The quality of cluster formed using rough set based clustering algorithm with (SM)-M-3 measure has been compared with the well known clustering algorithm, Density based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). The experimental results show the viability of our approach.

This result has significant implications for both practitioners and researchers in terms of computational complexity, ensemble design and metalearning for algorithm selection. We outline the limits of the similarity between RBF and naive Bayes, and use metalearning to build a selection model capable of accurately discriminating between the two algorithms, so that extra computation is only incurred when it is likely to produce significant improvement in predictive accuracy.

A key feature of these levels in an XML document is to identify its components for additional processing. XML components can expose sensitive information after application of data mining techniques over a shared database. Therefore, privacy preservation of sensitive information must be ensured prior to signify the outcome especially in sensitive XML Association Rules. Privacy issues in XML domain are not exceptionally addressed to determine a solution by the academia in a reliable and precise manner. In this paper, we have proposed a model for identifying sensitive items (nodes) to declare sensitive XML association rules and then to hide them. Bayesian networks-based central tendency measures are applied in declaration of sensitive XML association rules. K2 algorithm is used to generate Bayesian networks to ensure reliability and accuracy in preserving privacy of XML Association Rules. The proposed model is tested and compared using several case studies and large UCI machine learning datasets. The experimental results show improved accuracy and reliability of proposed model without any side effects such as new rules and lost rules. The proposed model uses the same minimum support threshold to find XML Association Rules from the original and transformed data sources. The significance of the proposed model is to minimize an incredible disclosure risk involved in XML association rule mining from external parties in a competitive business environment.

J	Dai, J; Liu, X				Dai, Jin; Liu, Xin			Approach for Text Classification Based on the Similarity Measurement between Normal Cloud Models	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							CATEGORIZATION	The similarity between objects is the core research area of data mining. In order to reduce the interference of the uncertainty of nature language, a similarity measurement between normal cloud models is adopted to text classification research. On this basis, a novel text classifier based on cloud concept jumping up (CCJU-TC) is proposed. It can efficiently accomplish conversion between qualitative concept and quantitative data. Through the conversion from text set to text information table based on VSM model, the text qualitative concept, which is extraction from the same category, is jumping up as a whole category concept. According to the cloud similarity between the test text and each category concept, the test text is assigned to the most similar category. By the comparison among different text classifiers in different feature selection set, it fully proves that not only does CCJU-TC have a strong ability to adapt to the different text features, but also the classification performance is also better than the traditional classifiers.

It was also aimed to determine the types of tests that are more efficient among these schools. For this purpose, educational data mining techniques such as clustering and decision tree are used. By deploying the non-hierarchical k-means algorithm, schools are separated into 5 different clusters which have different success level for each of Math-Science (MS), Language and Math (LM) and Language-Social Studies (LS) test scores. It is found that Science High Schools, Private Science High Schools, Anatolian High Schools and Anatolian Teacher Schools found to be in the highest achievement level in all of the test scores. Furthermore, constructed decision tree models with CHAID algorithm show that (1) Chemistry for the score type MS, (2) Math for the score type LM and (3) Turkish Language and Literature for the core type LS were the test types which are primarily effective in the division of schools into clusters.

Hence how to protect the private information is quite a huge challenge, especially during the data mining procedure. In this paper, a new method is proposed for privacy protection which is based on fuzzy theory. The traditional fuzzy approach in this area will apply fuzzification to the data without considering its readability. A new style of obscured data expression is introduced to provide more details of the subsets without reducing the readability. Also we adopt a balance approach between the privacy level and utility when to achieve the suitable subgroups. An experiment is provided to show that this approach is suitable for the classification without a lower accuracy. In the future, this approach can be adapted to the data stream as the low computation complexity of the fuzzy function with a suitable modification.

J	Sarkar, AMJ				Sarkar, A. M. Jehad			Hidden Markov Mined Activity Model for Human Activity Recognition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article							SENSORS	Object-usage-based human activity recognition systems require activity data for learning. Acquiring such data from the real world is expensive and time consuming. To overcome such difficulties, the exploitation of web activity data is gaining popularity. However, due to a lack of much real-world information in such data, existing activity models are not suitable for web data. In this paper, we propose a hidden Markov model- (HMM-) based activity model specially designed to use web activity data for activity recognition. It utilizes a sequence of object-usage information for activity recognition. We also propose a web activity data mining algorithm for this model. It is extremely fast and efficient in comparison with the existing algorithms. We perform three experiments to validate the proposed model. We show that the model can be effectively utilized by an activity recognition system.

MICROARRAY GENE EXPRESSION MIAME-PLANT SUPPORTIVE TAB DELIMITED DATA FORMAT: MAGE-TAB-PLANT	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES			English	Article						Microarray; Data format; Tab delimited; MIAME	BIOINFORMATICS	The goal of Minimum Information about a Microarray Experiment (MIAME) is to outline the minimum information that can clearly state the microarray based gene expression experiment in such a way that the details of experiment design, description and sample annotation can help to check and reproduce the results in some other laboratory. MIAME/plant complements the MIAME standard with guideline for experiment design, description and sample preparation protocols using controlled vocabularies. MAGE-TAB-Plant format has been structured on the similar lines as MAGE-TAB format. It explains the main chain of all events in a typical Microarray based experiment such as steps involved in preparation and handling of samples, labelling and hybridization protocols, scanning of images, normalization of raw data and analysis of images. The physical entities in this chain are Biosource, Sample, Extract, labelled Extract, hybridization, scan image, raw, normalized and combined data matrix. It is hoped that little more effort may result in better precisely replicated, analyzed, and better interpreted reproducible plant based microarray experiments. Data mining capabilities of data submitted using MAGE-TAB-Plant format may generate breakthroughs in research and the use of controlled vocabularies may encourage efficient sharing and annotation of the experiment data.

The k-means clustering algorithm is one of the most commonly used methods. However, it highly depends on the initial solution and is easy to fall into local optimum solution. In view of the disadvantages of the k-means method, this paper proposed a hybrid monkey algorithm based on search operator of artificial bee colony algorithm for clustering analysis and experiment on synthetic and real life datasets to show that the algorithm has a good performance than that of the basic monkey algorithm for clustering analysis.

Recently, with the explosion of social media, users can upload media data and annotate content with descriptive tags. In this paper, we aim at measuring the semantic relatedness of Flickr images. Firstly, four information theory based functions are used to measure the semantic relatedness of tags. Secondly, the integration of tags pair based on bipartite graph is proposed to remove the noise and redundancy. Thirdly, the order information of tags is added to measure the semantic relatedness, which emphasizes the tags with high positions. The data sets including 1000 images from Flickr are used to evaluate the proposed method. Two data mining tasks including clustering and searching are performed by the proposed method, which shows the effectiveness and robustness of the proposedmethod. Moreover, some applications such as searching and faceted exploration are introduced using the proposed method, which shows that the proposed method has broad prospects on web based tasks.

While facilitating the exploration tasks, most visualization systems do not make use of all the data models that are generated during the exploration. In this paper, we introduce a system that allows the user to gain insights from the data space progressively by forming data models and consolidating the generated models on the fly. Each model can be a a computationally extracted or user-defined subset that contains a certain degree of interest and might lead to some discoveries. When the user generates more and more data models, the degree of interest of some portion of some models will either grow (indicating higher occurrence) or will fluctuate or decrease (corresponding to lower occurrence). Our system maintains a collection of such models and accumulates the interestingness of each model into a consolidated model. In order to consolidate the models, the system summarizes the associations between the models in the collection and identifies support (models reinforce each other), complementary (models complement each other), and overlap of the models. The accumulated interestingness keeps track of historical exploration and helps the user summarize their findings which can lead to new discoveries. This mechanism for integrating results from multiple models can be applied to a wide range of decision support systems. We demonstrate our system in a case study involving the financial status of US companies.

We discuss methods of both biostatistics and data mining based on various background, explain their principles, and compare their advantages and limitations. We also include dimension reduction methods tailor-made for classification analysis and also such classification methods which reduce the dimension of the computation intrinsically. A common feature of numerous classification methods is the shrinkage estimation principle, which has obtained a recent intensive attention in high-dimensional applications.

An Apriori-like level-wise approach (referred to as the HBC-algorithm or MTminer) was published in 2007 by Hebert, Bretto, and Cremilleux [A Data Mining Formalization to Improve Hypergraph Minimal Transversal Computation, Fundamenta Informaticae, 80(4), 2007, 415-433] and was experimentally demonstrated to have very good performance on hypergraphs with small transversals. In this short note extending the paper by Hagen [Lower bounds for three algorithms for transversal hypergraph generation, Discrete Applied Mathematics, 157(7), 2009, 1460-1469], we prove a superpolynomial lower bound for the HBC-algorithm. This lower bound also shows that the originally claimed upper bound on the HBC-algorithm's running time is wrong.

Visualization and analysis of such data (with the objective of uncovering the hidden patterns therein) is an important and challenging task. We present a tool, called Igloo-Plot, for efficient visualization of multidimensional datasets. The tool addresses some of the key limitations of contemporary multivariate visualization and analysis tools. The visualization layout, not only facilitates an easy identification of clusters of data-points having similar feature compositions, but also the 'marker features' specific to each of these clusters. The applicability of the various functionalities implemented herein is demonstrated using several well studied multi-dimensional datasets. Igloo-Plot is expected to be a valuable resource for researchers working in multivariate data mining studies. Igloo-Plot is available for download from: http://metagenomics.atc.tcs.com/IglooPlot/.

Clustering is used as a database to automatically group items with similar characteristics. Researchers aim to introduce a novel and powerful algorithm known as Inclined Planes system Optimization (IPO), with capacity to overcome clustering problems. The proposed method identifies each agent used in the algorithm to indicate the centroids of the clusters and automatically select the number of centroids in each time interval (unsupervised clustering). The evaluation method for clustering is based on the Davies Bouldin index (DBi) to show cluster validity. Researchers compare known algorithm on series of data bases from various studies to demonstrate the power and capability of the proposed method. These datasets are popular for pattern recognition with diversity in space dimension. Method performance was tested on standard images as a dataset. Study results show significant method advantage over other algorithms.

Experimental data were obtained from the NASA aviation safety reporting system (ASRS) database. These data contained a range of text records spanning 30 years of civilian aviation, both commercial (airline operations) and general aviation (private aircraft). Narrative data as well as categorical data were used. The associations between incident contributing factors and self-reported anomalies were investigated using data mining and correspondence analysis. The results revealed that a broadly defined human factors category and weather conditions were the main contributors to self-reported civil aviation anomalies. New associations between identified factors and reported anomaly conditions were also reported.

Data mining is understood as the computational analysis of data contained in a text or data set in order to extract new knowledge from it. There are two main ways in which HEIs are involved with data mining: in the process of conducting research, and as producers of data. As consumers, HEIs may have restrictions on the manner in which they can conduct research given the fact that it is likely that content will be protected by intellectual property rights. As producers, HEIs are faced with increasing pressure to make publicly-funded research available to the public through institutional repositories and other similar open access schemes, but some of these do not set out reuse policies for data. The article concludes that if more research was made available with adequate licensing strategies, then the question of whether data mining research is legal would be moot.

The illicit use of these types of drugs and substances appears to be increasing among elementary and high school students. After becoming addicted to drugs, life becomes unbearable and gets even worse for their users. Scientific studies show that it becomes extremely difficult for an individual to break this habit after being a user. Hence, preventing teenagers from addiction becomes an important issue. This study focuses on an urgent precaution system that helps families and educators prevent teenagers from developing this type of addiction. The aim of this study is to detect a teenager's probability of being a drug abuser using classification algorithms in machine learning and data mining. The objective is not to test the classifiers theoretically on the benchmark datasets, but rather to use this study as a basis for advanced and detailed studies in this field in the future. This paper not only uses a special dataset but also focuses on psychometrics and statistics. The findings of this study show that if there is a computed high risk for a teenager, some precautions, if necessary, may be taken by educators and parents to keep the teenager away from those substances.

Since some available real data is multi-valued and multi-labeled, researchers have focused their attention on developing approaches to mine multi-valued and multi-labeled data in recent years. Unfortunately, there are no algorithms can discretize multi-valued and multi-labeled data to improve the performance of data mining. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to solve this problem. Our approach is based on a statistical-based discretization metric and the simulated annealing search algorithm. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively improve the performance of the-state-of-art multi-valued and multi-labeled classification algorithm.

Note that some microarrays are very informative, but very expensive to have them for all the samples. However, we can use publicly available background knowledge about the potential links between the components of different microarrays (known, also, as genes). As a result, we shall translate all the selected genes in the terms of other genes. Those secondary genes are to be included in the regression models automatically to give the learning processes the right initial directions. The proposed method was tested online during the e-LICO data-mining Contest, where we had achieved second best score.

We aimed at overcoming this hurdle by combining two algorithms: i Independent Component Analysis to extract statistically-based potential signatures. ii Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to produce a score of enrichment with statistical significance of each potential signature. We have applied this strategy to identify regulatory T cell (Treg) molecular signatures from two experiments in mice, with cross-validation. These signatures can detect the similar to 1% Treg in whole spleen. These findings demonstrate the relevance of our approach as a signature discovery tool.

As an enhancement of RT, adaptive random testing (ART) has better failure-detection capability and has been widely applied in different scenarios, such as numerical programs, some object-oriented programs, and mobile applications. However, not much work has been done on the effectiveness of ART for the programs with combinatorial input domain (i.e., the set of categorical data). To extend the ideas to the testing for combinatorial input domain, we have adopted different similarity measures that are widely used for categorical data in data mining and have proposed two similarity measures based on interaction coverage. Then, we propose a new version named ART-CID as an extension of ART in combinatorial input domain, which selects an element from categorical data as the next test case such that it has the lowest similarity against already generated test cases. Experimental results show that ART-CID generally performs better than RT, with respect to different evaluation metrics.

In order to confront one of the most challenging features of a huge design space in capability based analysis (CBA), a literature review of design space exploration was first examined. Then, in the process of an aerospace system of systems design space exploration, a bilayer mapping method was put forward, based on the existing experimental and operating data. Finally, the feasibility of the foregoing approach was demonstrated with an illustrative example. With the data mining RST (rough sets theory) and SOM(self-organized mapping) techniques, the alternative to the aerospace system of systems architecture was mapping from P-space (performance space) to C-space (configuration space), and then from C-space to D-space (design space), respectively. Ultimately, the performance space was mapped to the design space, which completed the exploration and preliminary reduction of the entire design space. This method provides a computational analysis and implementation scheme for large-scale simulation.

Researchers have proposed several tools and various methodologies for developing effective medical expert systems. Diagnosing heart diseases is one of the important topics and many researchers have tried to develop intelligent medical expert systems to help the physicians. In this paper, we propose the use of PSO algorithm with a boosting approach to extract rules for recognizing the presence or absence of coronary artery disease in a patient. The weight of training examples that are classified properly by the new rules is reduced by a boosting mechanism. Therefore, in the next rule generation cycle, the focus is on those fuzzy rules that account for the currently misclassified or uncovered instances. We have used coronary artery disease data sets taken from University of California Irvine, (UCI), to evaluate our new classification approach. Results show that the proposed method can detect the coronary artery disease with an acceptable accuracy. Also, the discovered rules have significant interpretability as well.	[Hedeshi, N.

Overall models based on ensemble methods for predicting continuous annealing furnace temperature settings	IRONMAKING & STEELMAKING			English	Article						Hot dip galvanising line; Continuous annealing furnace; Data mining; Process modelling; Ensemble methods; Artificial intelligence	DIP GALVANIZING LINE; IMPACT ENERGY PREDICTION; HEATING FURNACE; NEURAL-NETWORKS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; STEEL; QUALITY; STRIP; PERFORMANCE; IMPROVEMENT	The prediction of the set points for continuous annealing furnaces on hot dip galvanising lines is essential if high product quality is to be maintained and energy consumption and related emissions into the atmosphere are to be reduced. Owing to the global and evolving nature of the galvanising industry, plant engineers are currently demanding better overall prediction models that maintain accuracy while working with continual changes in the production cycle. This paper presents three promising prediction models based on ensemble methods (additive regression, bagging and dagging) and compares them with models based on artificial intelligence to highlight how good ensembles are at creating overall models with lower generalisation errors. The models are trained using coil properties, chemical compositions of the steel and historical data from a galvanising process operating in Spain. The results show that the potential benefits from such ensemble models, once configured properly, include high performance in terms of both prediction and generalisation capacity, as well as reliability in prediction and a significant reduction in the difficulty of setting up the model.

The visualisation and quantification of pore size distribution by data mining and spatial variability by semi-variogams were investigated in 3D images with 60-mu m spatial resolution generated by X-ray CT scan (EVS/GE MS8x-130) in soil core samples collected at different depths of a kaolinitic Red-Yellow Latosol (RYL) and a gibbsitic Red Latosol (RL) from Brazil. Greater spatial variability occurred in the horizontal direction of the 3D image, a novel finding in this area of research. The pores detected were different between the Latosols studied, mainly at 0.20-0.34 m depth. The largest number (>4000) and volume (+/- 30 mm(3)) of pores was found in the RL. The soil classes differed in 3D pore characteristics, and this aspect may be important in the characterisation of causes of pore variability. Sphericity was similar for both soils, with greater emphasis on pore classes with a diameter <0.4 mm, mainly at the 0.20-0.34 m depth. A higher percentage of spheroid pores occurred in RL (+/- 25%), whereas the platy pores were more abundant in RYL (>15%).

However, the initial guess of cluster centers affects the clustering result seriously, which means that improper initialization cannot lead to a desirous clustering result. How to choose suitable initial centers is an important research issue for kappa-means algorithm. In this paper, we propose an adaptive initialization framework based on spatial local information (AIF-SLI), which takes advantage of local density of data distribution. As it is difficult to estimate density correctly, we develop two approximate estimations: density by t-nearest neighborhoods (t-NN) and density by epsilon-neighborhoods (epsilon-Ball), leading to two implements of the proposed framework. Our empirical study on more than 20 datasets shows promising performance of the proposed framework and denotes that it has several advantages: (1) can find the reasonable candidates of initial centers effectively; (2) it can reduce the iterations of kappa-means' methods significantly; (3) it is robust to outliers; and (4) it is easy to implement.

In the present study, the commonality of signals detected by 4 commonly used data mining algorithms was examined. Methods: A total of 2,231,029 reports were retrieved from the public release of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database between 2004 and 2009. The deletion of duplicated submissions and revision of arbitrary drug names resulted in a reduction in the number of reports to 1,644,220. Associations with adverse events were analyzed for 16 unrelated drugs, using the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), information component (IC), and empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM). Results: All EBGM-based signals were included in the PRR-based signals as well as IC- or ROR-based ones, and PRR- and IC-based signals were included in ROR-based ones. The PRR scores of PRR-based signals were significantly larger for 15 of 16 drugs when adverse events were also detected as signals by the EBGM method, as were the IC scores of IC-based signals for all drugs; however, no such effect was observed in the ROR scores of ROR-based signals. Conclusions: The EBGM method was the most conservative among the 4 methods examined, which suggested its better suitability for pharmacoepidemiological studies. Further examinations should be performed on the reproducibility of clinical observations, especially for EBGM-based signals.

Diameter, depth, and volume error are considered to be optimized as functions of the process parameters, which include laser intensity, pulse frequency, and scanning speed. Two different DES shapes are studied that combine semispheres and cylinders. Process inputs and outputs are defined by considering the process parameters that can be changed under industrial conditions and the industrial requirements of this manufacturing process. In total, 162 different conditions are tested in a process that is modeled with the following state-of-the-art data-mining regression techniques: Support Vector Regression, Ensembles, Artificial Neural Networks, Linear Regression, and Nearest Neighbor Regression. Ensemble regression emerged as the most suitable technique for studying this industrial problem. Specifically, Iterated Bagging ensembles with unpruned model trees outperformed the other methods in the tests. This method can predict the geometrical dimensions of the machined microcavities with relative errors related to the main average value in the range of 3 to 23%, which are considered very accurate predictions, in view of the characteristics of this innovative industrial task.

J	Lin, CW; Hong, TP; Hsu, HC				Lin, Chun-Wei; Hong, Tzung-Pei; Hsu, Hung-Chuan			Reducing Side Effects of Hiding Sensitive Itemsets in Privacy Preserving Data Mining	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							HIGH UTILITY ITEMSETS; DATA SANITIZATION; ALGORITHM	Data mining is traditionally adopted to retrieve and analyze knowledge from large amounts of data. Private or confidential data may be sanitized or suppressed before it is shared or published in public. Privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) has thus become an important issue in recent years. The most general way of PPDM is to sanitize the database to hide the sensitive information. In this paper, a novel hiding-missing-artificial utility (HMAU) algorithm is proposed to hide sensitive itemsets through transaction deletion. The transaction with the maximal ratio of sensitive to nonsensitive one is thus selected to be entirely deleted. Three side effects of hiding failures, missing itemsets, and artificial itemsets are considered to evaluate whether the transactions are required to be deleted for hiding sensitive itemsets. Three weights are also assigned as the importance to three factors, which can be set according to the requirement of users. Experiments are then conducted to show the performance of the proposed algorithm in execution time, number of deleted transactions, and number of side effects.

In order to perform reliable operational analysis, data mining of all available information spreading out from turbine control systems is required. In this work a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data analysis was performed on a small wind farm and new post-processing methods are proposed for condition monitoring of the aero-generators. Indicators are defined to detect the malfunctioning of a wind turbine and to select meaningful data to investigate the causes of the anomalous behaviour of a turbine. The operating state database is used to collect information about the proper power production of a wind turbine, becoming a tool that can be used to verify if the contractual obligations between the original equipment manufacturer and the wind farm operator are met. Results demonstrate that a proper selection of the SCADA data can be very useful to measure the real performances of a wind farm and thus to define optimal repair/replacement and preventive maintenance policies that play a major role in case of energy production.

The full-scan mass data of Kudiezi injection was acquired by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a linear ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometer system (HPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap) that features high resolution, mass accuracy and sensitivity. To screen the polyphenols including chlorogenic acids (CGAs) and flavonoids in the injection, the MDF approach was employed to rapidly screen them from the complex system. First, two filtering templates and several filters were set to remove the interference ions of a complex matrix by MetWorks 1.3 Software. Then, the filtered target peaks were characterized according to their accurate mass data and MSn fragment ions. Utilizing the proposed approach, 14 CGAs and 16 flavonoids could be screened and identified. The results of rapid screening and detection showed that the developed MDF approach based on high-resolution mass spectrometry would be adaptable to the analysis of a complex system of traditional Chinese medicines.

This tool was integrated into the hospital information system by the IT department having been granted full autonomy to improve the system. Objectives: To describe the development and various uses of a tool for full-text search of computerized patient records. Methods: The technology is based on Solr, an open-source search engine. It is a web-based application that processes HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses. A data processing pipeline that retrieves data from different repositories, normalizes, cleans and publishes it to Solr, was integrated in the information system of the Leon Berard center. The IT department developed also user interfaces to allow users to access the search engine within the computerized medical record of the patient. Results: From January to May 2013, 500 queries were launched per month by an average of 140 different users. Several usages of the tool were described, as follows: medical management of patients, medical research, and improving the traceability of medical care in medical records. The sensitivity of the tool for detecting the medical records of patients diagnosed with both breast cancer and diabetes was 83.0%, and its positive predictive value was 48.7% (gold standard: manual screening by a clinical research assistant). Conclusion: The project demonstrates that the introduction of full-text-search tools allowed practitioners to use unstructured medical information for various purposes.

Simulating adverse event spontaneous reporting systems as preferential attachment networks	APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Simulation; data mining; vaccines; safety; network analysis	SIGNAL GENERATION; US VACCINE; PHARMACOVIGILANCE; INTUSSUSCEPTION; VAERS	Background: Spontaneous Reporting Systems [SRS] are critical tools in the post-licensure evaluation of medical product safety. Regulatory authorities use a variety of data mining techniques to detect potential safety signals in SRS databases. Assessing the performance of such signal detection procedures requires simulated SRS databases, but simulation strategies proposed to date each have limitations. Objective: We sought to develop a novel SRS simulation strategy based on plausible mechanisms for the growth of databases over time. Methods: We developed a simulation strategy based on the network principle of preferential attachment. We demonstrated how this strategy can be used to create simulations based on specific databases of interest, and provided an example of using such simulations to compare signal detection thresholds for a popular data mining algorithm. Results: The preferential attachment simulations were generally structurally similar to our targeted SRS database, although they had fewer nodes of very high degree. The approach was able to generate signal-free SRS simulations, as well as mimicking specific known true signals. Explorations of different reporting thresholds for the FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System suggested that using proportional reporting ratio [PRR] > 3.0 may yield better signal detection operating characteristics than the more commonly used PRR > 2.0 threshold. Discussion: The network analytic approach to SRS simulation based on the principle of preferential attachment provides an attractive framework for exploring the performance of safety signal detection algorithms. This approach is potentially more principled and versatile than existing simulation approaches. Conclusion: The utility of network-based SRS simulations needs to be further explored by evaluating other types of simulated signals with a broader range of data mining approaches, and comparing network-based simulations with other simulation strategies where applicable.

Rough sets and neural networks are the most common techniques applied in data mining problems. In order to extract useful knowledge and classify ambiguous patterns effectively, this paper presented a hybrid algorithm based on the integration of rough sets and BP neural network to construct a novel classification system. The attribution values were discretized through PSO algorithm firstly to establish a decision table. The attribution reduction algorithm and rules extraction method based on rough sets were proposed, and the flowchart of proposed approach was designed. Finally, a prototype system was developed and some simulation examples were carried out.

Building an effective fraud detection method is thus pivotal for online advertising businesses. We organized a Fraud Detection in Mobile Advertising (FDMA) 2012 Competition, opening the opportunity for participants to work on real-world fraud data from BuzzCity Pte. Ltd., a global mobile advertising company based in Singapore. In particular, the task is to identify fraudulent publishers who generate illegitimate clicks, and distinguish them from normal publishers. The competition was held from September 1 to September 30, 2012, attracting 127 teams from more than 15 countries. The mobile advertising data are unique and complex, involving heterogeneous information, noisy patterns with missing values, and highly imbalanced class distribution. The competition results provide a comprehensive study on the usability of data mining-based fraud detection approaches in practical setting. Our principal findings are that features derived from fine-grained time-series analysis are crucial for accurate fraud detection, and that ensemble methods offer promising solutions to highly-imbalanced nonlinear classification tasks with mixed variable types and noisy/missing patterns. The competition data remain available for further studies at http://palanteer.sis.smu.edu.sg/fdma2012/.

In particular, we describe an annotation methodology to tag facial expression and body movements that conform to changes in the affective states of learners while dealing with cognitive tasks in a learning process. The ultimate goal is to combine these annotations with additional affective information collected during experimental learning sessions from different sources such as qualitative, self-reported, physiological, and behavioral information. These data altogether are to train data mining algorithms that serve to automatically identify changes in the learners' affective states when dealing with cognitive tasks which help to provide emotional personalized support.

Data Mining for Identifying Novel Associations and Temporal Relationships with Charcot Foot	JOURNAL OF DIABETES RESEARCH			English	Article							BONE-MINERAL DENSITY; RISK; DISEASE; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; EXPRESSION; MANAGEMENT; MORTALITY; FEET	Introduction. Charcot foot is a rare and devastating complication of diabetes. While some risk factors are known, debate continues regarding etiology. Elucidating other associated disorders and their temporal occurrence could lead to a better understanding of its pathogenesis. We applied a large data mining approach to Charcot foot for elucidating novel associations. Methods. We conducted an association analysis using ICD-9 diagnosis codes for every patient in our health system (n = 1.6 million with 41.2 million time-stamped ICD-9 codes). For the current analysis, we focused on the 388 patients with Charcot foot (ICD-9 713.5). Results. We found 710 associations, 676 (95.2%) of which had a P value for the association less than 1.0 Chi 10(-5) and 603 (84.9%) of which had an odds ratio > 5.0. There were 111 (15.6%) associations with a significant temporal relationship (P < 1.0 Chi 10(-3)). The three novel associations with the strongest temporal component were cardiac dysrhythmia, pulmonary eosinophilia, and volume depletion disorder. Conclusion. We identified novel associations with Charcot foot in the context of pathogenesis models that include neurotrophic, neurovascular, and microtraumatic factors mediated through inflammatory cytokines. Future work should focus on confirmatory analyses. These novel areas of investigation could lead to prevention or earlier diagnosis.

A broad array of supervised learning algorithms exists, every one of them with its own advantages and drawbacks. There are some basic issues that affect the accuracy of classifier while solving a supervised learning problem, like bias-variance tradeoff, dimensionality of input space, and noise in the input data space. All these problems affect the accuracy of classifier and are the reason that there is no global optimal method for classification. There is not any generalized improvement method that can increase the accuracy of any classifier while addressing all the problems stated above. This paper proposes a global optimization ensemble model for classification methods (GMC) that can improve the overall accuracy for supervised learning problems. The experimental results on various public datasets showed that the proposed model improved the accuracy of the classification models from 1% to 30% depending upon the algorithm complexity.

Developed and prototyped as part of an art-science research collaboration, we define an MDE as a 4D virtual environment structured by quantitative and qualitative metadata describing multidimensional data collections. Entire data sets (e.g. 10s of millions of records) can be visualized and sonified at multiple scales and at different levels of detail so they can be explored interactively in real-time within MDEs. They are designed to reflect similarities and differences in the underlying data or metadata such that patterns can be visually/aurally sorted in an exploratory fashion by an observer who is not familiar with the details of the mapping from data to visual, auditory or dynamic attributes. While many approaches for visual and auditory data mining exist, MDEs are distinct in that they utilize qualitative and quantitative data and metadata to construct multiple interrelated conceptual coordinate systems. These "regions" function as conceptual lattices for scalable auditory and visual representations within virtual environments computationally driven by multi-GPU CUDA-enabled fluid dyamics systems.

Textural discrimination in unconstrained environment	IMAGING AND MULTIMEDIA ANALYTICS IN A WEB AND MOBILE WORLD 2014	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Imaging and Multimedia Analytics in a Web and Mobile World	FEB 05-06, 2014	San Francisco, CA	Soc Imaging Sci & Technol, SPIE		Object segmentation; Textural descriptors; Seeded region growing; non-homogeneous textural bodies		Object region segmentation for object detection and identification in images captured in a complex background environment is one of the most challenging tasks in image processing and computer vision areas especially for objects that have non-homogeneous body textures. This paper presents an object segmentation technique in an unconstrained environment based on textural descriptors to extract the object region of interest from other surrounding objects and backgrounds in order to get an accurate identification of the segmented area precisely. The proposed segmentation method is developed on a textural based analysis and employs Seeded Region Growing (SRG) segmentation algorithm to accomplish the process. In our application of obtaining the region of a chosen object for further manipulation through data mining, human input is used to choose the object of interest through which seed points are identified and employed. User selection of the object of interest could be achieved in different ways, one of which is using mouse based point and click procedure. Therefore, the proposed system provides the user with the choice to select the object of interest that will be segmented out from other background regions and objects. It is important to note that texture information gives better description of objects and plays an important role for the characterization of regions. In region growing segmentation, three key factors are satisfied such as choice of similarity criteria, selection of seed points, and stopping rule. The choice of similarity criteria is accomplished through texture descriptors and connectivity properties. The selection of seed points is determined interactively by the user when they choose the object of interest. The definition of a stopping rule is achieved using a test for homogeneity and connectivity measures, therefore, a region would stop growing when there are no further pixels that satisfy the homogeneity and connectivity criteria. The segmentation region is iteratively grown by comparing all unallocated neighbouring pixels to that region. The difference between seed pixels' mean intensity value and the region's textural descriptors is used as a measure of similarity of pixels. The pixel with the smallest difference measured would be allocated to the particular segmentation region. Seeded region growing factors would change interactively according to the intensity levels of the chosen object of interest. The algorithm automatically computes segmentation thresholds based on local feature analysis. The system starts by measuring the intensity level of the selected object and accordingly adapts growing and stopping rules of the segmented region. The proposed segmentation method has been tested on a relatively large variety of databases with different objects of varying textures. The experimental results show that this simple framework is capable of achieving high quality performance and that this method can better handle the problem of segmenting objects of non-homogeneous textural bodies and correctly separate those objects from other objects and complex backgrounds. This framework can also be easily adapted to different applications by substituting suitable image feature definitions.

In this study, a data mining approach to analyzing the thermal performance of cool-pipes via in situ monitoring is proposed. Delicate monitoring program is applied in a high arch dam project that provides a good and mass data source. The factors and relations related to the thermal performance of cool-pipes are obtained in a built theory thermal model. The supporting vector machine (SVM) technology is applied to mine the data. The thermal performances of iron pipes and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes are compared. The data mining result shows that iron pipe has a better heat removal performance when flow rate is lower than 50 L/min. It has revealed that a turning flow rate exists for iron pipe which is 80 L/min. The prediction and classification results obtained from the data mining model agree well with the monitored data, which illustrates the validness of the approach.

Many classification methods are used in credit risk assessment aiming to establish classifiers to predict the credit state of the corporate (good or bad). However, most of classification methods can not handle continuous variables. So, continuous variables must be quantified. In this paper, we first propose an improved quantization method, namely IDM, based on the statistical independence; then we use data mining techniques, i.e., C4.5 decision tree, Naive-Bayes and SVM classifier, to classify and predict the quantified credit data. The aim is to investigate the effect of quantization method on the classification of credit approval data. The Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves the mean accuracy of classification than other known quantization methods. This denotes that the proposed method can make an effective interpretation and point out the ability of design of a new intelligent assistance credit approval data system.

The related information management and transmission costs are increasing and becoming an almost unbearable burden, due to the unprecedented number of data sources and the intrinsic vastness and variety of the datasets. In this paper, we propose RAZOR, a novel lightweight algorithm for data compression and classification, which is expected to alleviate both aspects by leveraging the advantages offered by data mining methods for optimizing communications and by enhancing information transmission to simplify data classification. In particular, RAZOR leverages the concept of motifs, recurrent features used for signal categorization, in order to compress data streams: in such a way, it is possible to achieve compression levels of up to an order of magnitude, while maintaining the signal distortion within acceptable bounds and allowing for simple lightweight distributed classification. In addition, RAZOR is designed to keep the computational complexity low, in order to allow its implementation in the most constrained devices.

However, storing data does not correspond with understanding the knowledge it contains. Thus, solutions capable of learning problem statements and gathering knowledge from huge amounts of data, be it structured or unstructured, are required. This is where computational intelligence and the introduced approach apply: within this paper, a new method of combining restricted Boltzmann machines and feed forward artificial neural networks is elucidated as well as the accuracy of the resulting solution is proofed.

However, practical limitations due to the cost of testing, traffic control and safety concerns, and the ability to test a large network may discourage some agencies from conducting the network-level FWD testing. For this reason, the surrogate measure of the structural condition index (SCI) is suggested for use. The main purpose of the research presented in this paper is to investigate data-mining strategies and to develop a prediction method of the structural condition trends for network-level applications, which do not require FWD testing. The research team first evaluated the existing and historical pavement condition, distress, ride, traffic, and other data attributes in the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Pavement Maintenance Information System (PMIS); applied data-mining strategies to the data; discovered useful patterns and knowledge for SCI value prediction; and finally provided a reasonable measure of pavement structural condition which is correlated to the SCI. To evaluate the performance of the developed prediction approach, a case study was conducted using the SCI data calculated from the FWD data collected on flexible pavements over a 5-year period (2005-2009) from 354 PMIS sections representing 37 pavement sections on the Texas highway system. The preliminary study results showed that the proposed approach can be used as a supportive pavement structural index in the event when FWD deflection data is not available and help pavement managers identify the timing and appropriate treatment level of preventive maintenance activities.

Consequently, the purpose of this study is to propose a novel method to forecast sales of PDCs. The presented method is a combination of network analysis tools and time series forecasting methods. Due to lack of enough past sales records of each drug, an explorative network based analysis is conducted to find clique sets and group members and to use comembers' sales data in their sales prediction. Afterwards, time series sales forecasting models were built with three different approaches including ARIMA methodology, neural network, and an advanced hybrid neural network approach. The offered hybrid method by applying each drug and its comembers past records facilitates capturing both linear and nonlinear patterns of sales accurately. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by a real dataset provided by one of the leading PDCs in Iran. The results indicated that the proposed method is able to cope with low number of past records while it forecasts medicines sales accurately.

J	Jing, X; Cimino, JJ				Jing, X.; Cimino, J. J.			A Complementary Graphical Method for Reducing and Analyzing Large Data Sets Case Studies Demonstrating Thresholds Setting and Selection	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Data mining method; data filtering method; threshold setting; threshold selection; data visualization; hierarchical terminology; data analysis; clinical data repository		Objectives: Graphical displays can make data more understandable; however, large graphs can challenge human comprehension. We have previously described a filtering method to provide high-level summary views of large data sets. In this paper we demonstrate our method for setting and selecting thresholds to limit graph size while retaining important information by applying it to large single and paired data sets, taken from patient and bibliographic databases. Methods: Four case studies are used to illustrate our method. The data are either patient discharge diagnoses (coded using the Inter, national Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modifications [ICD9-CM]) or Medline citations (coded using the Medical Subject Headings [MeSH]). We use combinations of different thresholds to obtain filtered graphs for detailed analysis. The thresholds setting and selection, such as thresholds for node counts, class counts, ratio values, p values (for diff data sets), and percentiles of selected class count thresholds, are demonstrated with details in case studies. The main steps include: data preparation, data manipulation, computation, and threshold selection and visualization. We also describe the data models for different types of thresholds and the considerations for thresholds selection. Results: The filtered graphs are 1%-3% of the size of the original graphs. For our case studies, the graphs provide 1) the most heavily used ICD9-CM codes, 2) the codes with most patients in a research hospital in 2011,3) a profile of publications on "heavily represented topics" in MEDLINE in 2011, and 4) validated knowledge about adverse effects of the medication of rosiglitazone and new interesting areas in the ICD9-CM hierarchy associated with patients taking the medication of pioglitazone. Conclusions: Our filtering method reduces large graphs to a manageable size by removing relatively unimportant nodes. The graphical method provides summary views based on computation of usage frequency and semantic context of hierarchical terminology. The method is applicable to large data sets (such as a hundred thousand records or more) and can be used to generate new hypotheses from data sets coded with hierarchical terminologies.

This study aims to empirically investigate the differences between different indicators in detecting rear-end conflicts and assessing the risk in an uninterrupted flow. Micro-level data of a 24-hr traffic stream (including 6,657 vehicles) were captured using inductive loop detectors installed on a rural freeway section. Different indicators (Time Headway (H), Time to Collision (TTC), Proportion of Stopping Distance (PSD), Deceleration Rate to Avoid Collision (DRAC) and Stopping Distance Index (SDI)) were used to measure each car following event in a bivalent state (safe/unsafe). Unsafe events associated with each indicator were detected and common unsafe events characterized by different indicators were identified. Temporal distributions of rear-end collision risks associated with each indicator at 15-min intervals were also compared. Finally, the 15-min risk values based on different indicators were categorized and compared across three levels (Low, Medium and High). Data mining and statistical techniques showed that while SDI is the single most conservative indicator, DRAC and TTC detect a few risky events but very equal ones. In almost all conflicts associated with TTC, headway is still lower than the critical threshold. However, there exist considerable risky events based on headway which are still safe according to TTC. Comparison of PSD and TTC also declares that almost all conflicts associated with TTC are also risky according to PSD.

However, in recent years, there has been a significant research focused on finding interesting infrequent itemsets leading to the discovery of negative association rules (NARs). The discovery of infrequent itemsets is far more difficult than their counterparts, that is, frequent itemsets. These problems include infrequent itemsets discovery and generation of accurate NARs, and their huge number as compared with positive association rules. In medical science, for example, one is interested in factors which can either adjudicate the presence of a disease or write-off of its possibility. The vivid positive symptoms are often obvious; however, negative symptoms are subtler and more difficult to recognize and diagnose. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for discovering positive and negative association rules among frequent and infrequent itemsets. We identify associations among medications, symptoms, and laboratory results using state-of-the-art data mining technology.

Then, we analyze the features of original clustering algorithm and SOM algorithm, and plan an improved SOM clustering algorithm to overcome low stability and poor quality of original algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the improved algorithm has a higher accuracy and has a better stability, compared with the original algorithm.

A typical feature of the outliers is that they are always far away from a majority of data in the data set. In this paper, we present a graph-based outlier detection algorithm named INOD, which makes use of this feature of the outlier. The DistMean-neighborhood is used to calculate the cumulative in-degree for each data. The data, whose cumulative in-degree is smaller than a threshold, is judged as an outlier candidate. A KNN-based selection algorithm is used to determine the final outlier. Experimental results show that the INOD algorithm can improve the precision 80% higher and decrease the error rate 75% lower than the classical LOF algorithm.

This process, known as multi-objective optimization, is challenging due to non-convexity in individual objectives and insufficient knowledge in the tradeoffs among the objective set. As such, clinical practice involves numerous iterations of human intervention that is costly and often inconsistent. In this work, we propose to address treatment planning with convex imputing, a new-data mining technique that explores the existence of a latent convex objective whose optimizer reflects the DVH and dose-shaping properties of previously optimized cases.

Trial data is augmented if DICOM scans, dose cubes, etc. from the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) are included for data mining. Unfortunately, there is as yet no structured way to collect DICOM objects in trial databases. In this paper, we obtain a tight integration of ECRF and PACS using open source software. Methods: DICOM identifiers for selected images/series/studies are stored in associated ECRF events (e.g., baseline) as follows: 1) JavaScript added to OpenClinica communicates using HTML with a gateway server inside the hospitals firewall; 2) On this gateway, an open source DICOM server runs scripts to query and select the data, returning anonymized identifiers; 3) The scripts then collects, anonymizes, zips and transmits selected data to a central trial server; 4) Here data is stored in a DICOM archive which allows authorized ECRF users to view and download the anonymous images associated with each event. Results: All integration scripts are open source. The PACS administrator configures the anonymization script and decides to use the gateway in passive (receiving) mode or in an active mode going out to the PACS to gather data. Our ECRF centric approach supports automatic data mining by iterating over the cases in the ECRF database, providing the identifiers to load images and the clinical data to correlate with image analysis results. Conclusions: Using open source software and web technology, a tight integration has been achieved between PACS and ECRF.

Computational diagnosis of canine lymphoma	2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MATHEMATICAL MODELING IN PHYSICAL SCIENCES 2013 (IC-MSQUARE 2013)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Mathematical Modeling in Physical Sciences (IC-MSQUARE)	SEP 01-05, 2013	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC				CLASSIFICATION	One out of four dogs will develop cancer in their lifetime and 20% of those will be lymphoma cases. PetScreen developed a lymphoma blood test using serum samples collected from several veterinary practices. The samples were fractionated and analysed by mass spectrometry. Two protein peaks, with the highest diagnostic power, were selected and further identified as acute phase proteins, C-Reactive Protein and Haptoglobin. Data mining methods were then applied to the collected data for the development of an online computer-assisted veterinary diagnostic tool. The generated software can be used as a diagnostic, monitoring and screening tool. Initially, the diagnosis of lymphoma was formulated as a classification problem and then later refined as a lymphoma risk estimation. Three methods, decision trees, kNN and probability density evaluation, were used for classification and risk estimation and several preprocessing approaches were implemented to create the diagnostic system. For the differential diagnosis the best solution gave a sensitivity and specificity of 83.5% and 77%, respectively (using three input features, CRP, Haptoglobin and standard clinical symptom). For the screening task, the decision tree method provided the best result, with sensitivity and specificity of 81.4% and >99%, respectively (using the same input features). Furthermore, the development and application of new techniques for the generation of risk maps allowed their user-friendly visualization.	[Mirkes, E. M.; Gorban, A.

In this study, online learning quality is evaluated through students' cognitive engagement which is reflected in their online written messages in discussions and their online participation. This study proposes the use of two types of data: students' participation, and written messages. Both types of data was collected and analyzed using the data mining technique to produce a predictive model that illustrates students' pathways while engaging in online learning cognitively. The findings of this study indicate that from 22 variables, only two were significant for students' online cognitive engagement; sharing information and posting high-level messages. The two variables led to the formation of three different pathways in the students' predictive model. (C) 2013 The Authors Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Under such pace of advancement, it is the development and utilization of energy that plays a key role. Among these great progresses, the development momentum of the coal industry has been far beyond people's previous expectation. The development and utilization of coal resources has not only been widely used in China, but also been an important research subject in some advanced countries in the world. The level of current coal data mining has seriously hampered the development of coal mining enterprises. As a kind of new revolutionary technology, data mining technique is mainly based on the power management system. Such technique can handle all the tasks and fully play the advantage of digital characterization. In this paper, we will make a related study of the hot topic on coal mining power management system based on the data mining technique.

We show how an HPC can be re-engineered to accommodate clinical data while retaining its utility in computationally intensive tasks such as data mining, machine learning, and statistics. We also discuss deploying protected virtual machines. A critical planning step was to engage the university's information security operations and the information security and privacy office. Access to the environment requires a double authentication mechanism. The first level of authentication requires access to the university's virtual private network and the second requires that the users be listed in the HPC network information service directory. The physical hardware resides in a data center with controlled room access. All employees of the HPC and its users take the university's local Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act training series.

In this paper, an effective algorithm is proposed to build the failure prediction Bayesian network (FPBN) model with data mining technology. First, the conception of FPBN is introduced to describe the state of components and system and the causeeffect relationships among them. The types of network nodes, the directions of network edges, and the conditional probability distributions (CPDs) of nodes in FPBN are discussed in detail. According to the characteristics of nodes and edges in FPBN, a divide-and-conquer principle based algorithm (FPBN-DC) is introduced to build the best FPBN network structures of different types of nodes separately. Then, the CPDs of nodes in FPBN are calculated by the maximum likelihood estimation method based on the built network. Finally, a simulation study of a helicopter convertor model is carried out to demonstrate the application of FPBN-DC. According to the simulations results, the FPBN-DC algorithm can get better fitness value with the lower number of iterations, which verified its effectiveness and efficiency compared with traditional algorithm.

Yet, the extraction of useful knowledge from this voluminous data presents a significant challenge to a scientific community. Efficient mining of vast and complex data sets for the needs of biomedical research critically depends on seamless integration of clinical, genomic, and experimental information with prior knowledge about genotype-phenotype relationships accumulated in a plethora of publicly available databases. Furthermore, such experimental data should be accessible to a variety of algorithms and analytical pipelines that drive computational analysis and data mining. Translational projects require sophisticated approaches that coordinate and perform various analytical steps involved in the extraction of useful knowledge from accumulated clinical and experimental data in an orderly semiautomated manner. It presents a number of challenges such as (1) high-throughput data management involving data transfer, data storage, and access control; (2) scalable computational infrastructure; and (3) analysis of large-scale multidimensional data for the extraction of actionable knowledge. We present a scalable computational platform based on crosscutting requirements from multiple scientific groups for data integration, management, and analysis. The goal of this integrated platform is to address the challenges and to support the end-to-end analytical needs of various translational projects.	[Sulakhe, Dinanath; Dave, Utpal; Gilliam, T.

J	Sarlin, P				Sarlin, Peter			Mapping financial stability	AI COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Macroprudential oversight; exploratory data analysis; risk communication; visual dynamic clustering; data reduction; dimension reduction		The ongoing global financial crisis has shown the importance of a system-wide, or macroprudential, approach to safeguarding financial stability. An essential part of macroprudential oversight concerns the tasks of early identification and assessment of risks and vulnerabilities. Yet, while risk identification and assessment oftentimes makes use of analytical tools, the analytical literature lacks a focus on a third task of risk communication. This article aims at summarizing key contributions of a PhD thesis that concerns models for the tasks of risk identification, assessment and communication. To integrate the three tasks, the thesis makes use of methods from the fields of data mining and knowledge discovery, not the least those for exploratory data analysis. The aim of the thesis is not only to apply methods for macroprudential oversight, but also to develop and extend methods according to the needs for the task.

In this system, the data of electric power, electric power quality, and electric energy is acquired in real time by installing an electric power management monitor in the main load points, so as to analyze electric energy efficiency and energy consumption. A large amount of data can be obtained from the system, and if these huge amounts of data are of a value can be further analyzed, finding the unknown factors affecting enterprises' energy consumption, equipment performance, and operational efficiency, and the disadvantages of the traditional data processing method. Therefore, an advanced data analysis and processing tool (i.e. efficiency data mining technology) is introduced for analyzing and mining large amounts of data monitored with the smart industrial park system.

The information obtained may be used for establishing risk evaluation criteria and to design future remediation strategies, which could be useful for new dams. The hydrochemical characterization was based on a sampling campaign performed in October 2011. A total of 28 samples, at 1-m-deep intervals, were obtained. The hydrogeochemical study of the polluted reservoir shows that the dilution effect is not sufficient to neutralize AMD contributions from mining activity. Sampling carried out from the surface water to the deepest points reveals stratification of the reservoir that allows it to be included in the group of monomictic and holomitic lakes.	[Ceron, J.

J	Egloff, W; Patterson, DJ; Agosti, D; Hagedorn, G				Egloff, Willi; Patterson, David J.; Agosti, Donat; Hagedorn, Gregor			Open exchange of scientific knowledge and European copyright: The case of biodiversity information	ZOOKEYS			English	Article						Biodiversity knowledge; taxonomy; intellectual property rights; European copyright; European database protection right; data use agreement; Open Access to data and information		Background. The 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development is helping the European Union to prepare for an integrative system for intelligent management of biodiversity knowledge. The infrastructure that is envisaged and that will be further developed within the Programme "Horizon 2020" aims to provide open and free access to taxonomic information to anyone with a requirement for biodiversity data, without the need for individual consent of other persons or institutions. Open and free access to information will foster the re-use and improve the quality of data, will accelerate research, and will promote new types of research. Progress towards the goal of free and open access to content is hampered by numerous technical, economic, sociological, legal, and other factors. The present article addresses barriers to the open exchange of biodiversity knowledge that arise from European laws, in particular European legislation on copyright and database protection rights. We present a legal point of view as to what will be needed to bring distributed information together and facilitate its re-use by data mining, integration into semantic knowledge systems, and similar techniques. We address exceptions and limitations of copyright or database protection within Europe, and we point to the importance of data use agreements. We illustrate how exceptions and limitations have been transformed into national legislations within some European states to create inconsistencies that impede access to biodiversity information. Conclusions. The legal situation within the EU is unsatisfactory because there are inconsistencies among states that hamper the deployment of an open biodiversity knowledge management system. Scientists within the EU who work with copyright protected works or with protected databases have to be aware of regulations that vary from country to country. This is a major stumbling block to international collaboration and is an impediment to the open exchange of biodiversity knowledge. Such differences should be removed by unifying exceptions and limitations for research purposes in a binding, Europe-wide regulation.

As the industry moves to advanced technology nodes, the manufacturing process window tightens and the number of patterns continues to rapidly increase. This increase in patterns brings about challenges in identifying, organizing, and carrying forward the learning of each pattern from test chip designs to first product and then to multiple product variants. This learning includes results from printability simulation, defect scans and physical failure analysis, which are important for accelerating yield ramp. Using pattern classification technology and a relational database, GLOBALFOUNDRIES has constructed a pattern database (PDB) of more than one million potential yield detractor patterns. In PDB, 2D geometries are clustered based on similarity criteria, such as radius and edge tolerance. Each cluster is assigned a representative pattern and a unique identifier (ID). This ID is then used as a persistent reference for linking together information such as the failure mechanism of the patterns, the process condition where the pattern is likely to fail and the number of occurrences of the pattern in a design. Patterns and their associated information are used to populate DRC Plus pattern matching libraries for design-for-manufacturing (DFM) insertion into the design flow for auto-fixing and physical verification. Patterns are used in a production-ready yield learning methodology to identify and score critical hotspot patterns. Patterns are also used to select sites for process monitoring in the fab. In this paper, we describe the design of PDB, the methodology for identifying and analyzing patterns across multiple design and technology cycles, and the use of PDB to accelerate manufacturing process learning. One such analysis tracks the life cycle of a pattern from the first time it appears as a potential yield detractor until it is either fixed in the manufacturing process or stops appearing in design due to DFM techniques such as DRC Plus. Another such analysis systematically aggregates the results of a pattern to highlight potential yield detractors for further manufacturing process improvement.

An innovative approach, which facilitates efficient planning, is represented by a model-based approach using the concept of the Digital Factory. In order to realize the vision of virtual production, modular solutions like simulations or optimization tools are merged into a holistic model that provides a digital mapping of the entire production process. In this work, a framework is described, which is capable to integrate planning modules by using an integrative information model. Based on intelligence approaches, multiple data is linked to reach a vertical integration of the information flow. These cross-linked data structures facilitate a consolidation of data from different levels of the production monitoring and management layers. The provided information is used to establish decision support systems, which enable an entirely holistic factory planning. The advantages of the approach are demonstrated by a process chain formation use case.

Yet, the disparity in the ICT adoption between developed and developing countries, often referred to as the Digital Divide, continues to widen. As a result, the digital divide has remained an issue of significant importance to policy-makers and scholars. In an effort to measure the magnitude of the digital divide and monitor how the disparity evolves over time, the United Nations commissioned the development of a comprehensive ICT Development Index (IDI) in 2009. The objective of this paper is to extend the methodology used in the IDI project and other scientific results presented in previous research to measure the digital divide. Using data mining techniques, we analyze ICT profiles from 154 countries to provide a rigorous quantitative assessment of the digital divide. In addition to analyzing the digital divide at the global level, we present our results at a regional level by identifying countries that are leaders and followers in their respective geographical area. Moreover, our analysis found that between 2002 and 2007, nine countries have made a significant progress in ICT adoption such that they have transitioned into a group previously consisting primarily of developed countries.

The managers can use the erasable itemsets for planning production plan of the factory. Besides the problem of mining erasable itemsets, the problem of mining top-rank-k erasable itemsets is an interesting and practical problem. In this paper, we first propose a new structure, call dPID_List and two theorems associated with it.

Recently, two efficient methods for reducing the number of candidates for Tanimoto similar real valued vectors have been offered: the one using lengths of vectors and the other using their non-zero dimensions. In this paper, we offer new theoretical results on combined usage of lengths of real valued vectors and their non-zero dimensions for more efficient reduction of candidates for Tanimoto similar vectors. In particular, we derive more restrictive bounds on lengths of such candidate vectors.

Nevertheless, in practice, choosing among a large number of solutions on the Pareto front is often a daunting task, if proper analysis and visualisation techniques are not applied. Recent research advancements have shown the advantages of using data mining techniques to automate the post-optimality analysis of Pareto-optimal solutions for engineering design problems. Nonetheless, it is argued that the existing approaches are inadequate for generating highquality results, when the set of the Pareto solutions is relatively small and the solutions close to the Pareto front have almost the same attributes as the Pareto-optimal solutions, of which both are commonly found in many real-world system problems. The aim of this paper is therefore to propose a distance-based data mining approach for the solution sets generated from simulation-based optimisation, in order to address these issues. Such an integrated data mining and MOO procedure is illustrated with the results of an industrial cost optimisation case study. Particular emphasis is paid to showing how the proposed procedure can be used to assist decision-makers in analysing and visualising the attributes of the design alternatives in different regions of the objective space, so that informed decisions can be made in production systems development.

In military, sonar signals are used in lieu of visuals to navigate underwater and/or locate enemy submarines in proximity. In particular, classification algorithm in data mining has been applied in sonar signal recognition for recognizing the type of surfaces from which the sonar waves are bounced. Classification algorithms in traditional data mining approach offer fair accuracy by training a classification model with the full dataset, in batches. It is well known that sonar signals are continuous and they are collected as data streams. Although the earlier classification algorithms are effective in traditional batch training, it may not be practical for incremental classifier learning. Since sonar signal data streams can amount to infinity, the data preprocessing time must be kept to a minimum to fulfill the need for high speed. This paper presents an alternative data mining strategy suitable for the progressive purging of noisy data via fast conflict analysis from the data stream without the need to learn from the whole dataset at one time. Simulation experiments are conducted and superior results are observed in supporting the efficacy of the methodology.

Individual's data are shared for business or legal reasons, containing sensitive information. Sharing data is a mutual benefit for business growth. The need to preserve privacy has become a challenging problem in privacy preserving data mining. In this paper we deal with a data analysis system having sensitive information. Exposing the information of an individual leads to security threats and could be harmful. The confidential attributes are perturbed or distorted using fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic is used to protect individual's data to hide details of data in public. Data is owned by an authorized user, and applies distortion. The Authorized user having original dataset distorts numeric data using S-fuzzy membership function. This distorted data is published to the analyst, hiding the sensitive information present in the original data. The analysts perform data mining techniques on the distorted dataset. Accuracy is measured using classification and clustering techniques generated on distorted data is relative to the original, thus privacy is achieved. Comparison of various classifiers is generated on the original and distorted datasets.

An important analytical task in a number of scientific and technological domains is to retrieve information from text data, aiming to get a deeper insight into the content represented by the data in order to obtain some useful, often not explicitly stated knowledge and facts, related to a particular domain of interest. The major challenge is the size, structural complexity, and frequency of the analysed text sets' updates (i.e., the 'big data' aspect), which makes the use of traditional analysis techniques and tools impossible. We introduce an innovative approach to analyse unstructured text data. This allows for improving traditional data mining techniques by adopting algorithms from ontological domain modelling, natural language processing, and machine learning. The technique is inherently designed with parallelism in mind, which allows for high performance on large-scale Cloud computing infrastructures.

Mining these data to discover possible consumption patterns and group the users in a more fine-grained way can help the State Grid Corporation to understand users' personalized and differentiated requirements. In this work, an algorithm called TMeans is proposed to mine the electricity consumption patterns. TMeans improves the classical K-Means algorithm by presenting a set of static and dynamical rules which can dynamically adjust the clustering process according to the statistical features of the clusters, making the process more flexible and practical. Then a MapReduce-based implementation of TMeans is proposed to make itself capable of handling large volume of data efficiently. Through experiment, we first demonstrate that the consumption patterns can be effectively discovered and can be refined to very small granularity through TMeans, and then we show that the MapReduce-based implementation of TMeans can efficiently speed up the clustering process.

Using Data Mining to Assess and Model the Metallurgical Efficiency of a Copper Concentrator	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Flotation; Modeling; Neural networks; Process optimization	FLOTATION PLANT; OPTIMIZATION	Data mining is a process designed to explore knowledge and hidden patterns from large amounts of data. The large volume of data recorded daily in mineral processing plants, due to several variables involved, necessitates using data mining techniques to optimize process performance as well as predict possible faults. In this research work various data mining techniques were utilized to model and predict the metallurgical efficiency of a copper concentrator (i.e., recovery and enrichment ratio) as a function of the process variables (i.e., feed copper grade, dosage of flotation reagents, particle size and slurry solids concentration of the feed reported to the flotation circuit). The results indicated that among the operating variables, the feed copper grade and particle size had the most significant influence on the efficiency parameters. Next, association rules between the input and output variables were successfully discovered. Then, the potential of different data mining algorithms for modeling the metallurgical efficiency parameters was evaluated. Neural network was found to be the most effective modeling algorithm. Finally, time series analysis was performed to predict future trends for plant performance.	[Massinaei, M.] Univ Birjand, Min Engn Dept, Birjand, Iran; [Sedaghati, M.

The most broadly discussed technique is data mining, which has been successfully applied to many fields. Data mining extracts implicit, previously unknown, and useful information from data. Clustering analysis is one of the most important and useful technologies in data mining methods. In this research, we utilize clustering analysis to analyze user loyalty of mobile phone APP software and use RFM analysis to describe the user behavior. By using the self-organizing map algorithm, the proposed system is expected to provide marketing survey industry with precise market segmentation for marketing strategy decision making and extended applications. According to the market segmentation, special offers to the varied consumer group can stimulate purchasing behavior and finally improve click-and-mortar conversion rate effectively.

In this paper, a combined attribute reduction method based on fractal dimension and joint entropy is proposed. To a certain extent, this method can solve the attribute reduction problem of a none-label data set. Experimental analysis shows that the method gives satisfactory performances on most data sets, can be used as a preprocessing approach for dimensionality reduction on high-dimensional data, or, a feature selection method on general data set.

To deal with the imprecise information, the notion of fuzziness has been introduced. This paper develops a two-stage decision support model to measure the assessment levels of alternatives with fuzzy information. The basic idea is to adapt the virtual multipliers derived from the data envelopment analysis (DEA) method to generate weights with criteria desirable and undesirable items. According to variable fuzzy set (VFS) theory, a mathematical program is formulated to calculate the related membership grade matrix. Fuzzy evaluation contains more information for making better decisions. An evaluation of water distribution systems in China is used for demonstration. The DEA-based VFS evaluation approach developed in this paper is reliable and convincing in identifying alternatives.

This paper formally analyzes the nature and mechanisms of voting systems and the derivation of collective opinion equilibrium. A set of numerical technologies for collective opinions analyses is presented in social networks, online voting, and general elections. The conventional methods such as those of simple max finding, average weighted sum, and statistics are enhanced by rigorous numerical regressions and weighted opinion integrations. These novel methodologies lead to the finding of a key concept known as collective opinion equilibrium implied in any voting and election, which denotes the representative centriod elicited from the spectrum of opinion distribution. A set of case studies on real-world general electron data is rigorously analyzed for demonstrating the value-added applications of the formal methods in poll data mining, collective opinion determination, and quantitative election data processing.

NetLoc is applied to yeast protein localisation prediction. The results showed that protein networks can provide rich information for protein localisation prediction, achieving Area Under Curve (AUC) score of 0.93. We also showed that networks with high connectivity and high percentage of co-localised PPI lead to better prediction performance. Investigation showed that NetLoc is a very robust approach which can produce good performance (AUC = 0.75) only using 30% of original interactions and capable of producing overall accuracy greater than 0.5 only with 20% annotation coverage. Compared to the previous network feature based prediction algorithm which achieved AUC scores of 0.49 and 0.52 on the yeast PPI network, NetLoc achieved significantly better overall performance with the AUC of 0.74.

Research aimed at accurate classification of catalytic mechanisms to increase the catalytic activity of GHs is receiving extensive attention. The traditional theories or methods used in the study of catalytic mechanisms of GHs are limited by reaction conditions. They are not suitable for the study of various GHs because different enzymes would show devious physicochemical properties. In this paper, a new method is proposed to classify and predict the catalytic mechanism of a certain glycoside hydrolase according to their sequence and structure features using k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB) Classifier and the Multilayer Perception (MLP) Classifier. The classification performance of the four computational methods used were evaluated and compared. Experimental results show that each classifier has its own advantages, but the kNN classifier is more accurate at the overall level. This research also helps us to gain a better understanding of the catalytic mechanisms in different GHs.

This database consists of relevant metadata and information derived from the following DICOM objects - CT images, RT Structure Set, RT Dose and RT Plan. The usefulness and accuracy of such patient models partly depends on the sample size of the learning data set. Our current goal is to increase this sample size by expanding our decision support system into a collaborative framework to include contributions from multiple collaborators. Potential collaborators are often reluctant to upload even anonymized patient files to repositories outside their local organizational network in order to avoid any conflicts with HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. We have circumvented this problem by developing a tool that can parse DICOM files on the client's side and extract de-identified numeric and text data from DICOM RT headers for uploading to a centralized system. As a result, the DICOM files containing PHI remain local to the client side. This is a novel workflow that results in adding only relevant yet valuable data from DICOM files to the centralized decision support knowledge base in such a way that the DICOM files never leave the contributor's local workstation in a cloud-based environment. Such a workflow serves to encourage clinicians to contribute data for research endeavors by ensuring protection of electronic patient data.

The system integrates the patient's clinical data with imaging studies and a computer-aided detection (CAD) algorithm for quantifying MS lesion volume, lesion contour, locations, and sizes in brain MRI studies. For compliance with IHE integration protocols, long-term storage in PACS, and data query and display in a DICOM compliant clinical setting, CAD results need to be converted into DICOM-Structured Report (SR) format. Open-source dcmtk and customized XML templates are used to convert quantitative MS CAD results from MATLAB to DICOM-SR format. A web-based GUI based on our existing web-accessible DICOM object (WADO) image viewer has been designed to display the CAD results from generated SR files. The GUI is able to parse DICOM-SR files and extract SR document data, then display lesion volume, location, and brain matter volume along with the referenced DICOM imaging study. In addition, the GUI supports lesion contour overlay, which matches a detected MS lesion with its corresponding DICOM-SR data when a user selects either the lesion or the data. The methodology of converting CAD data in native MATLAB format to DICOM-SR and displaying the tabulated DICOM-SR along with the patient's clinical information, and relevant study images in the GUI will be demonstrated. The developed SR conversion model and GUI support aim to further demonstrate how to incorporate CAD post-processing components in a PACS and imaging informatics-based environment.

Discovering hydrometeorological patterns is important for many applications, including forecasting hydrometeorological hazards (floods and droughts), predicting the hydrological responses of ungauged basins, and filling in missing hydrological or meteorological records. However, discovering these patterns is challenging due to the special characteristics of hydrological and meteorological data, and is computationally complex due to the archival history of the datasets. Moreover, defining monotonic interest measures to quantify these patterns is difficult. In this study, we propose a new monotonic interest measure, called the hydrometeorological prevalence index, and a novel algorithm for mining hydrometeorological patterns (HMP-Miner) out of large hydrological and meteorological datasets. Experimental evaluations using real datasets show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the naive alternative in discovering hydrometeorological patterns efficiently.

Due to the size of the network after training, this type of network is usually used for problems with a small-sized training dataset. In this paper, a new training algorithm is presented for use with large training databases. Application to the handwritten digit database shows that the reduced PNN performs better than the standard PNN for all of the studied cases with a big gain in size and processing speed. This new type of neural network can be used easily for problems with large training databases like biometrics and data mining applications. An extension of the network is possible for new training samples and/or classes without retraining.

The information, found by application of data mining techniques, is unknown in advance. Knowledge is described by relationships of new features that distinguish one attribute value from other set attributes. The new knowledge set must be applied to new information with some degree of reliability. Current algorithms for finding association rules require several passes over the analysed database. The paper presents a stochastic algorithm for mining association rules in large data sets. Our stochastic algorithm reduces the database activity considerably, because the database is analysed only once. The algorithm allows us to measure two significant criteria, i.e. time and accuracy. We analyse a large database of transactions. Each transaction consists of items purchased by a customer in a visit. The algorithm yields conclusions about association rules using the analysis of randomly selected subsequences. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm can find association rules efficiently in only one database scan.

A new method of detecting traffic accidents is proposed based on temporal data mining, which can identify the unknown and unrecorded accidents by traffic police. Time series model was constructed using ternary numbers to reflect the state of traffic flow based on cell transmission model. In order to deal with the aftereffects of linear drift between time series and to reduce the computational cost, discrete Fourier transform was implemented to turn time series from time domain to frequency domain. The pattern of the time series when an accident happened could be recognized using the historical crash data. Then taking Euclidean distance as the similarity evaluation function, similarity data mining of the transformed time series was carried out. If the result was less than the given threshold, the two time series were similar and an accident happened probably. A numerical example was carried out and the results verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

J	Gan, HT				Gan, Haitao			Laplacian regularized kernel minimum squared error and its application to face recognition	OPTIK			English	Article						Kernel minimum squared error; Semi-supervised learning; Laplacian regularization; Face recognition	FRAMEWORK	Kernel minimum squared error (KMSE) has been receiving much attention in data mining and pattern recognition in recent years. Generally speaking, training a KMSE classifier, which is a kind of supervised learning, needs sufficient labeled examples. However, labeled examples are usually insufficient and unlabeled examples are abundant in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a semi-supervised KMSE algorithm, called Laplacian regularized KMSE (LapKMSE), which explicitly exploits the manifold structure. We construct a p nearest neighbor graph to model the manifold structure of labeled and unlabeled examples. Then, LapKMSE incorporates the structure information of labeled and unlabeled examples in the objective function of KMSE by adding a Laplacian regularization term. As a result, the labels of labeled and unlabeled examples vary smoothly along the geodesics on the manifold. Experimental results on several synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. Finally our algorithm is applied to face recognition and achieves the comparable results compared to the other supervised and semi-supervised methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Experimental results show that the proposed model reduces the energy consumption by reducing the amount of data acquiring and query processing using the representative sensors and ensures that the transmission is done on the best path which minimizes the probability of retransmission of data.

The goal of this approach is to design a dataset which will help to perform the task of summarization very much like a human. A document summary is a text that is produced from one or more texts that conveys important information in the original texts. The proposed system consists of methods such as pre-processing, feature extraction, and generation of training dataset. For implementing the system, 50 test documents from DUC2002 is used. Each document is cleaned by preprocessing techniques such as sentence segmentation, tokenization, removing stop word, and word stemming. Eight important features are extracted for each sentence, and are converted as attributes for the training dataset. A high quality, proper training dataset is needed for achieving good quality in document summarization, and the proposed system aims in generating a well-defined training dataset that is sufficiently large enough and noise free for performing text summarization. The training dataset utilizes a set of features which are common that can be used for all subtasks of data mining. Primary subjective evaluation shows that our training is effective, efficient, and the performance of the system is promising.

Privacy Protected Mining Using Heuristic Based Inherent Voting Spatial Cluster Ensembles	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFT COMPUTING FOR PROBLEM SOLVING (SOCPROS 2012)	Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Soft Computing for Problem Solving (SocProS)	DEC 28-30, 2012	Jaipur, INDIA	JK Lakshmipat Univ, Inst Engn & Technol	JK Lakshmipat Univ	Cluster ensembles; Degree of agreement; Performance metrics; Spatial attribute data		Spatial data mining i.e., discovery of implicit knowledge in spatial data-bases, is very crucial for effective use of spatial data. Clustering is an important task, mostly used in preprocessing phase of data analysis. It is widely recognized that combining multiple models typically provides superior results compared to using a single, well-tuned model. The idea of combining object partitions without accessing the original objects' features leads us to knowledge reuse termed as cluster ensembles. The most important advantage is that ensembles provide a platform where vertical slices of data can be fused. This approach provides an easy and effective solution for the most haunted issue of preserving privacy and dimensionality curse in data mining applications. We have designed four approaches to implement spatial cluster ensembles and have used these for merging vertical slices of attribute data. In our approach, we have brought out that by using a guided approach in combining the outputs of the various clusterers, we can reduce the intensive distance matrix computations and also generate robust clusters. We have proposed hybrid and layered cluster merging approach for fusion of spatial clusterings and used it in our three-phase clustering combination technique. The major challenge in fusion of ensembles is creation and manipulation of voting matrix or proximity matrix of order n(2), where n is the number of data points. This is very expensive both in time and space factors, with respect to spatial data sets. We have eliminated the computation of such expensive voting matrix. Compatible clusterers are identified for the partially fused clusterers, so that this acquired knowledge will be used for further fusion. The apparent advantage is that we can prune the data sets after every (m-1)/2 layers. Privacy preserving has become a very important aspect as data sharing between organizations is also difficult. We have tried to provide a solution for this problem. We have obtained clusters from the partial datasets and then without access to the original data, we have used the clusters to help us inmerging similar clusters obtained from other partial datasets. Our ensemble fusion models are tested extensively with both intrinsic and extrinsic metrics.	[Anandhi, R.

Clustering of streaming data is very challenging because streaming data cannot be scanned multiple times and also new concepts may keep evolving in data over time. Inherent uncertainty involved in real world data stream further magnifies the challenge of working with streaming data. Rough set is a soft computing technique which can be used to deal with uncertainty involved in cluster analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel rough set based clustering method for streaming data. It describes a cluster as a pair of lower approximation and an upper approximation. Lower approximation comprises of the data objects that can be assigned with certainty to the respective cluster, whereas upper approximation contains those data objects whose belongingness to the various clusters in not crisp along with the elements of lower approximation. Uncertainty in assigning a data object to a cluster is captured by allowing overlapping in upper approximation. Proposed method generates soft-cluster. Keeping in view the challenges of streaming data, the proposed method is incremental and adaptive to evolving concept. Experimental results on synthetic and real world data sets show that our proposed approach outperforms Leader clustering algorithm in terms of classification accuracy. Proposed method generates more natural clusters as compare to k-means clustering and it is robust to outliers. Performance of proposed method is also analyzed in terms of correctness and accuracy of rough clustering.

Clusters play a vital role for users to organize, summarize and navigate the data effectively. Swarm Intelligence (SI) is a relatively new subfield of artificial intelligence which studies the emergent collective intelligence of groups of simple agents. It is based on social behavior that can be observed in nature, such as ant colonies, flocks of birds, fish schools and bee hives. SI technique is integrated with clustering algorithms. This paper proposes new approaches for using Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) to cluster data. It is shown how CSA can be used to find the optimally clustering N object into K clusters. The CSA is tested on various data sets, and its performance is compared with those of K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means, Fuzzy PSO and Genetic K-Means clustering. The simulation results show that the new method carries out better results than the K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means, Fuzzy PSO and Genetic K-Means.

Data mining is the process of extracting patterns from a large dataset. Therefore the pattern discovery and mining are often time consuming. In any data pattern, a data is represented by several columns called the linear low dimensions. But the data identity does not equally depend upon each of these dimensions. Therefore scanning and processing the entire dataset for every query not only reduces the efficiency of the algorithm but at the same time minimizes the speed of processing. This can be solved significantly by identifying the intrinsic dimensionality of the data and applying the classification on the dataset corresponding to the intrinsic dataset only. Several algorithms have been proposed for identifying the intrinsic data dimensions and reducing the same. Once the dimension of the data is reduced, it affects the classification rate and classification rate may drop due to reduction in number of data points for decision. In this work we propose a unique technique for classifying the leukemia data by identifying and reducing the dimension of the training or knowledge dataset using Iterative process of Intrinsic dimensionality discovery and reduction using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) technique. Further the optimized data set is used to classify the given data using Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification. Results show that the proposed technique performs much better in terms of obtaining optimized data set and classification accuracy.

The evolutionary methods attracted attention and gained popularity among the data mining researchers for clustering due to their expedient implementation, parallel nature, ability to search global optima, and other advantages over conventional methods. However, conventional clustering methods, e. g., K-means, are computationally efficient and widely used local search methods. Therefore, many researchers paid attention to hybrid algorithms. However, most of the algorithms lag in proper balancing of exploration and exploitation of solutions in the search space. In this work, the authors propose a hybrid method DKGK. It uses DE to diversify candidate solutions in the search space. The obtained solutions are refined by K-means. Further, GA with heuristic crossover operator is applied for fast convergence of solutions and the obtained solutions are further refined by K-means. This is why proposed method is called DKGK. Performance of the proposed method is compared to that of Deferential Evolution (DE), genetic algorithm (GA), a hybrid of DE and K-means (DEKM), and a hybrid of GA and K-Means (GAKM) based on the sum of intra-cluster distances. The results obtained on three real and two synthetic datasets are very encouraging as the proposed method DKGK outperforms all the competing methods.

In particular, the features of these methodologies, supported by the FastFlow parallel programming framework, are shown on a simulation tool to perform the modeling, the tuning, and the sensitivity analysis of stochastic biological models. A stochastic simulation needs thousands of independent simulation trajectories turning into big data that should be analysed by statistic and data mining tools. In the considered approach the two stages are pipelined in such a way that the simulation stage streams out the partial results of all simulation trajectories to the analysis stage that immediately produces a partial result. The simulation-analysis workflow is validated for performance and effectiveness of the online analysis in capturing biological systems behavior on a multicore platform and representative proof-of-concept biological systems. The exploited methodologies include pattern-based parallel programming and data streaming that provide key features to the software designers such as performance portability and efficient in-memory (big) data management and movement. Two paradigmatic classes of biological systems exhibiting multistable and oscillatory behavior are used as a testbed.

These data vary in granularity, quality, and complexity and are stored in various formats, including publications, technical reports, and databases. The challenge is to make the transition from data to actionable knowledge and wisdom and bridge the knowledge gap and application gap. We report a knowledge-based approach based on a framework called KB-builder that facilitates data mining by enabling fast development and deployment of web-accessible immunological data knowledge warehouses. Immunological knowledge discovery relies heavily on both the availability of accurate, up-to-date, and well-organized data and the proper analytics tools. We propose the use of knowledge-based approaches by developing knowledgebases combining well-annotated data with specialized analytical tools and integrating them into analytical workflow. A set of well-defined workflow types with rich summarization and visualization capacity facilitates the transformation from data to critical information and knowledge. By using KB-builder, we enabled streamlining of normally time-consuming processes of database development. The knowledgebases built using KB-builder will speed up rational vaccine design by providing accurate and well-annotated data coupled with tailored computational analysis tools and workflow.

The challenge is to develop models for computer-aided detection (CAD), capable to classify, at early stages, masses spotted in X-ray images. The dataset was available at KDD CUP 2008. The imbalanced nature of the dataset and its high-dimensional feature space poses problems to the modelling that are tackled using dimension reduction techniques. The algorithms are compared using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) between true-and false-positive rates (TPR and FPR). Other metrics, such as patient sensitivity and FPR are used and discussed. We find that Naive Bayes classifier achieved the best performance irrespective of the combination of datasets and allow controlled trade-offs between false positives and negatives.

While algorithmic innovations using surrogates, localization and parallelization can make the problem feasible, one still has very large data and compute tasks. The problem of dealing with large data gets compounded when data warehousing and data mining are intertwined with computationally expensive tasks. We present here an approach to solving this problem by using a mix of hardware suitable for each task in a carefully orchestrated workflow. The computing environment is essentially an integration of Netezza database and high-performance cluster. It is based on the simple idea of segregating the data-intensive and compute-intensive tasks and assigning the right architecture for them. We present here the layout of the computing model and the new computational scheme adopted to generate probabilistic hazard maps.

DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION OF HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA WITH A NONLINEAR PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ALIGNED GENERATIVE TOPOGRAPHIC MAPPING	SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING			English	Article						dimensionality reduction; generative topographic mapping; principal component analysis; density estimation; additive model; classification	EM ALGORITHM	Most high-dimensional real-life data exhibit some dependencies such that data points do not populate the whole data space but lie approximately on a lower-dimensional manifold. A major problem in many data mining applications is the detection of such a manifold and the expression of the given data in terms of a moderate number of latent variables. We present a method which is derived from the generative topographic mapping (GTM) and can be seen as a nonlinear generalization of the principal component analysis (PCA). It can detect certain nonlinearities in the data but does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality with respect to the latent space dimension as the original GTM and thus allows for higher embedding dimensions. We provide experiments that show that our approach leads to an improved data reconstruction compared to the purely linear PCA and that it can furthermore be used for classification.

An important observed problem is embedding a distributed data-mining algorithm into a sensor network. The proposed solution uses local predictors on each sensor node to make a local prediction and offers several original voting schemes. Results for one voting scheme from the open literature, and for several voting schemes introduced by this research are compared using a simulation methodology. Furthermore, a scheme for building local predictors on the data collected from several neighboring nodes is proposed and evaluated. The presented results indicate that the proposed voting schemes and the proposed scheme for local prediction offer an improved accuracy of the WSN-based prediction and a reduction in necessary communications during the prediction process.

The interactions amongst users provide information of their preferences and relationships. This information can be used to measure the influence of ideas, or opinions, and how they are spread within the Network. Currently, one of the most relevant and popular Social Networks is Twitter. This Social Network was created to share comments and opinions. The information provided by users is especially useful in different fields and research areas such as marketing. This data is presented as short text strings containing different ideas expressed by real people. With this representation, different Data Mining techniques (such as classification or clustering) will be used for knowledge extraction to distinguish the meaning of the opinions. Complex Network techniques are also helpful to discover influential actors and study the information propagation inside the Social Network. This work is focused on how clustering and classification techniques can be combined to extract collective knowledge from Twitter. In an initial phase, clustering techniques are applied to extract the main topics from the user opinions. Later, the collective knowledge extracted is used to relabel the dataset according to the clusters obtained to improve the classification results. Finally, these results are compared against a dataset which has been manually labelled by human experts to analyse the accuracy of the proposed method.

J	Vesely, A				Vesely, Arnost			INFORMATION CONTENT OF ASSOCIATION RULES	NEURAL NETWORK WORLD			English	Article						Association rules; information divergence; information content of logical formulas; information content of association rules		Database records can be often interpreted as state descriptions of some world, system or generic object, states of which occur independently and are described by binary properties. If records do not contain missing values, then there exists close relationship between association rules and propositions about state properties. In data mining we usually get a lot of association rules with large confidence and large support. Since their interpretation is often cumbersome, some quantitative measure of their "informativeness" would be very helpful. The main aim of the paper is to define a measure of the amount of information contained in an association rule. For this purpose we make use of the tight correspondence between association rules and logical implications. At first a quantitative measure of information content of logical formulas is introduced and studied. Information content of an association rule is then defined as information content of the corresponding logical implication in the situation when no knowledge about dependence among properties of world states is at our disposal. The intuitive meaning of the defined measure is that the association rule that allows more appropriate correction of the distribution of world states, acquired under unfair assumption of independence of state properties, contains also larger amount of information. The more appropriate correction here means a correction of the current probability distribution of states that leads to the distribution that is closer to the true distribution in the sense of Kullback-Leibler divergence measure.

The ability to accurately discriminate protein folding rate change is very helpful in protein design. However, there are fewer studies on the influence of amino acid substitution to protein folding rates. In our earlier studies, we constructed a dataset of 467 mutants upon amino acid substitution and proposed novel methods for discriminating and predicting the accelerating and decelerating mutants during the folding process. This study aimed to effectively develop simple rules for discriminating accelerating mutants from decelerating ones upon single amino acid substitution. The main points of the study were to build a more general dataset F661 with 661 mutants, analyze the dataset systematically, and then implement different data mining techniques to build discrimination rules. Furthermore, the rules obtained from different methods were interpreted, evaluated, compared and integrated. The results appeared that the present approach may effectively develop simple rules from these mutants and the quality of the rules may be improved by combining the statistical and learning methods. These results suggest that the present method, as well as the rules, may advance the understanding of discriminating protein folding rate change.

This enzyme is involved in the production of melanin and some other pigments in humans, animals and plants, including skin pigmentations in mammals, and browning process in plants and vegetables. Therefore, enzyme inhibitors has been under the attention of the scientist community, due to its broad applications in food, cosmetic, agricultural and medicinal fields, to avoid the undesirable effects of abnormal melanin overproduction. However, the research of novel chemical with anti-tyrosinase activity demands the use of more efficient tools to speed up the tyrosinase inhibitors discovery process. This chapter is focused in the different components of a predictive modeling workflow for the identification and prioritization of potential new compounds with activity against the tyrosinase enzyme. In this case, two structure chemical libraries Spectrum Collection and Drugbank are used in this attempt to combine different virtual screening data mining techniques, in a sequential manner helping to avoid the usually expensive and time consuming traditional methods. Some of the sequential steps summarize here comprise the use of drug-likeness filters, similarity searching, classification and potency QSAR multiclassifier systems, modeling molecular interactions systems, and similarity/diversity analysis. Finally, the methodologies showed here provide a rational workflow for virtual screening hit analysis and selection as a promissory drug discovery strategy for use in target identification phase.

They are impractical to be applied to a wide range of patients due to a high inter-individual variability of pre-seizure EEG patterns. This paper proposes an adaptive prediction framework, which is capable of accumulating knowledge of pre-seizure EEG patterns by monitoring long-term EEG recordings. The experimental results on five patients indicate that the adaptive prediction framework is effective to improve prediction accuracy over time and thus achieve a personalized seizure predication for each patient.

Such connections are found by identifying the locations of insertions or groups of insertions that frequently occur in the collection of tumour genomes. Recent work has employed a kernel density approach to find such commonly occurring insertions or co-occurring pairs of insertions. Unfortunately, this approach is extremely compute intensive for pairs of insertions and even more intractable for triples, etc. We present a technique that can efficiently find commonly co-occurring sets of insertions (or other genomic features) of any length by applying Association Analysis (AA) (frequent pattern mining) techniques from data mining. A comparison to the kernel density approach on RTCGD is provided, as well as results of the association approach on two other tumour data sets.

Thereupon, the knowledge regarding hybrid rocket system has been gained through the forepart of the conceptual design using design informatics. In the present study, the practical problem defined by using three objective functions and seven design variables for aurora observation is treated so as to contribute the real world using evolutionary computation and data mining for the field of aerospace engineering. The primary objective of the design in the present study is that the down range and the duration time in the lower thermosphere are sufficiently obtained for the aurora scientific observation, whereas the initial gross weight is held down. Investigated solid fuels are five, while liquid oxidizer is considered as liquid oxygen. A hybrid rocket uses one of five kinds of fuels. The condition of single-time ignition is assumed in flight sequence in order to quantitatively investigate the ascendancy of multi-time ignition. A hybrid evolutionary computation between the differential evolution and the genetic algorithm is employed for the multidisciplinary design optimization. A self-organizing map is used for the data mining technique in order to extract global design information. Consequently, the design information regarding the tradeoffs among the objective functions, the behaviors of the design variables in the design space to become the nondominated solutions, and the implication of the design variables for the objective functions have been obtained in order to quantitatively differentiate the advantage of hybrid rocket engine in view of the five fuels. Moreover, the next assignments were also revealed.

Identification of Plantago lanceolata Pollen Allergens Using an Immunoproteomic Approach	JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIONAL ALLERGOLOGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Plantago lanceolata; IgE-binding protein; Allergens; Airborne pollen; Mass spectrometry; 2D gel electrophoresis	PROTEOMIC ANALYSES; SENSITIZATION; PROTEINS; LOCALIZATION; PATTERNS; EXTRACTS; AIRBORNE; PLA-L-1; BINDING; EUROPE	Background: Airborne Plantago pollen triggers respiratory allergies in Mediterranean countries. Objectives: We aimed to study sensitization in patients with seasonal respiratory allergy and identify proteins of Plantago lanceolata pollen that could be responsible for hypersensitivity reactions in sensitized patients. We also determined the airborne pollen concentration of Plantago species from 2004 to 2011. Methods: IgE-binding proteins were analyzed and characterized using 1D and 2D gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with sera from individuals sensitized to P lanceolata pollen extracts, mass spectrometry analysis, and protein data mining. We used aerobiological methods to study airborne pollen. Results: P lanceolata pollen accounts for 3% of the annual pollen spectrum in the air of Porto. Of a total of 372 patients, 115 (31%) showed specific IgE levels to P lanceolata pollen extracts. All sera from P lanceolata-allergic patients recognized 8 prominent groups of IgE-reactive allergens. Separation of proteins using 2D gel electrophoresis followed by identification with mass spectrometry revealed the presence of other IgE-reactive components that could be involved in sensitization. Conclusions: We detected proteins in P lanceolata pollen extracts that, to our knowledge, have not yet been studied and could worsen sensitization to this weed pollen species. The proteins identified were involved in a variety of cellular functions. By applying 2D electrophoresis and immunoblotting with a pool of 2 sera from different P lanceolata-allergic patients, we obtained a more detailed characterization of the P lanceolata allergen profile.

To mine useful data, prior knowledge has been used to train the artificial neural network (ANN) to identify the traffic conditions in the traffic information forecasting. Subjective information has hence been introduced into the ANN model. To solve this problem, a new ANN model is proposed based on the data mining technology in this work. The Self-Organized Feature Map (SOFM) is firstly employed to cluster the traffic data through an unsupervised learning and provide the labels for these data. Then labeled data were used to train the GA-Chaos optimized RBF neural network. Herein, the GA-Chaos algorithm is used to train the RBF parameters. Experimental tests use practical data sets from the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to validate the performance of the proposed ANN model. The results show that the proposed method can extract the potential patterns hidden in the traffic data and can accurately predict the future traffic state. The prediction accuracy is beyond 95%.

This information applies not only to process performance but also metrology toolset and recipe performance through various diagnostic metrics. This is most evident on the Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscope (CD-SEM). Today state of the art CD-SEMs report out over 250 individual data points and several images per measurement. It is typical for a state of the art fab with numerous part numbers to generate at least 20TB of information over the course of a year on the CD-SEM fleet alone pushing metrology toolsets into the big data regime. Most of this comes from improvements in throughput, increased sampling and new data outputs relative to previous generations of tools. Oftentimes, these new data outputs are useful for helping to determine if the process, metrology recipe or tool is deviating from an ideal state. Many issues could be missed by singularly looking at the key process control metric like the bottom critical dimension (CD) or a small subset of this available information. By leveraging the entire data set the mean time to detect and finding the root cause of issues can be significantly reduced. In this paper a new data mining system is presented that achieves this goal. Examples are shown with a focus on the benefits realized using this new system which helps speed up development cycles of learning and reducing manufacturing cycle-time. This paper concludes discussing future directions to make this capability more effective.

Based on CART method, this paper establishes the relationship between freeway incident frequency and roadway characteristics, traffic variables and environmental factors. The results of CART method indicate that the impact of influencing factors (weather, weekday/weekend, traffic flow and roadway characteristics) of incident frequency is not consistent for different incident types during different time periods.

These rules can be used to further understand degradation phenomena and also provide transparency and trust for any underlying prognostic technique employed. A case study is presented on a wind turbine gearbox, utilising historical supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data in conjunction with a physics of failure model. Training is performed without failure data, with the technique accurately identifying gearbox degradation and providing prognostic signatures up to 5 months before catastrophic failure occurred. A robust derivation of the Mahalanobis distance is employed to perform outlier analysis in the bivariate domain, enabling the rapid labelling of historical SCADA data on independent wind turbines. Following this, the RIPPER rule learner was utilised to extract transparent, human-readable rules from the labelled data. A mean classification accuracy of 95.98% of the autonomously derived condition was achieved on three independent test sets, with a mean kappa statistic of 93.96% reported. In total, 12 rules were extracted, with an independent domain expert providing critical analysis, two thirds of the rules were deemed to be intuitive in modelling fundamental degradation behaviour of the wind turbine gearbox.

J	Song, YQ				Song, Yunquan			Moment Conditions Selection Based on Adaptive Penalized Empirical Likelihood	ABSTRACT AND APPLIED ANALYSIS			English	Article							ESTIMATORS; MODEL	Empirical likelihood is a very popularmethod and has been widely used in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and data mining as tablets and mobile application and social media dominate the technology landscape. This paper proposes an empirical likelihood shrinkage method to efficiently estimate unknown parameters and select correct moment conditions simultaneously, when the model is defined by moment restrictions in which some are possibly misspecified. We show that our method enjoys oracle-like properties; that is, it consistently selects the correct moment conditions and at the same time its estimator is as efficient as the empirical likelihood estimator obtained by all correct moment conditions. Moreover, unlike the GMM, our proposed method allows us to carry out confidence regions for the parameters included in the model without estimating the covariances of the estimators. For empirical implementation, we provide some data-driven procedures for selecting the tuning parameter of the penalty function. The simulation results show that the method works remarkably well in terms of correct moment selection and the finite sample properties of the estimators. Also, a real-life example is carried out to illustrate the new methodology.

The traditional fault detected model is difficult to effectively extract short fault signal, and unable to form meaningful fault recognition model, resulting in difficulties in the detection. In order to solve these problems, this paper presents a mining method for fault symptoms of the intelligent instruments based on the neural network model. The method uses the fault characteristic of the intelligent instrument as its basic data, according which to build neural network model in order to realize fault mining. The experiment results show that the proposed method can instantly detect the failure of the intelligent instruments, according to which the treatment can be carried out rapidly and accurately to ensure the performance of the instruments.

It uses feedback restriction technique to construct dimensionality reduction model for multidimensional product data. The data obtained is with high latitudes, where a large number of data are under components involved standardized restrictions. High-dimensional data participating in operation will increase the complexity of operation, and hence, we need to reduce its dimension. In this paper multi-constrained inverse regression model is adopted to reduce the dimension of cloud resource scheduling data in multi-constrained environments. Experimental results show that the proposed method increases the data coverage rate of high-dimensional data mining by 66%, and has great optimizing effect.

This problem has been extensively studied in different research fields. In this paper, based on our agricultural JOT (Internet of Things) platform, we study this problem from the viewpoint of data mining. In our agricultural JOT platform, by setting various types of sensors, it is possible for us to collect information of a farm product during its whole life cycle such as planting, storage, processing, transportation and sale. Shelf life of a farm product is very difficult to determine since it will be affected by many factors during its life cycle, such as temperature, air/soil humidity etc. After integrate raw sensor data streams into batch id-based data streams, we adapt Back-Propagation method to the integrated sensor data streams to predict the shelf life of a farm product. Experiments are conducted on real data from our agricultural JOT platform and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method could provide a very good prediction for the shelf life of a farm product.

Through the full analysis of complex impedance spectra including electrode polarization effect, we derived the number of moving ions and the diffusion coefficient. These useful numbers were extracted without using an equivalent electric circuit. Our approach has the potential to find a widespread use in various electrochemical fields, such as in batteries, solar cells, fuel cells and semiconductor industry in general. In this paper, we show results for a case example of an ionic conductor - Ag-doped chalcogenide glass. However, this approach can be exploited for any semiconducting or ionic conductor materials, either in amorphous or crystalline form.	[Macak, J. M.; Patil, D.

JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Code Completion; Sequential Pattern Mining; Software Maintenance	PATTERNS	In the software development field, the amount of data related to documentation and to the source code itself is huge. Relevant knowledge can be extracted from these data, provided that the adequate tools are in place. In this context, data mining can be seen as an important tool. This paper presents a new approach for code completion based on sequential patterns mined from previous developed source code. According to what is being coded, suggestions of new code sequences are made based on the mined patterns. As a result, a plug-in for the Eclipse IDE, named Vertical Code Completion, was developed and applied over widely known Open Source systems, identifying that our approach could provide suggestions that would anticipate what a developer intends to code.

An electronic nose combines a properly selected set of sensors (array) with pattern recognition methods for generating information rich odor response patterns and extracting chemical identities. Each sensor in the array is functionalized by a different polymer for diversely selective sorption of target chemical analytes. Selection of an optimal set of polymers from a long list of potential polymers is crucial for cost-effective high performance development of electronic noses. In this paper we present an application of fuzzy c-means clustering on partition coefficient data available for target vapors and most prospective polymers for selection of minimum number of polymers that can create maximum discrimination between target chemical compounds. The selection method has been validated by simulating a polymer coated surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor array for monitoring fish freshness.	[Verma, Prabha; Yadava, R. D.

Distributed data mining applications use sensitive data from distributed databases held by different parties. This comes into direct conflict with an individual's need and right to privacy. It is thus of great importance to develop adequate security techniques for protecting privacy of individual values used for data mining. Here, we study how to maintain privacy in distributed data mining. That is, we study how two (or more) parties can find frequent itemsets in a distributed database without revealing each party's portion of the data to the other. In this paper, we consider privacy-preserving na ve-Bayes classifier for horizontally partitioned distributed data and propose data mining privacy by decomposition (DMPD) method that uses genetic algorithm to search for optimal feature set partitioning by classification accuracy and k-anonymity constraints.

However, data stored in sensor data repository consists of inconsistent, inaccurate, redundant and noisy data. Deployment of data mining algorithm on such sensor datasets declines the performance of the mining algorithm. Therefore, data preprocessing techniques are proposed to eliminate inconsistent, inaccurate, redundant, noisy data from the datasets and symbolic data analysis approach is proposed to reduce the size of the data repository by creating a symbolic data table. The data stored in a more comprehensible manner through symbolic data table is modeled as object oriented data model for mining knowledge from the sensor data sets.

The C4.5 algorithm of decision tree is a useful method of data mining and classification. The paper solves evaluation of RLMM construction problem based on the C4.5 algorithm. By means of extracting the attribute with maximum gain ratio as the root node of the decision tree from training sample data, the evaluation decision tree was constructed.

J	Novoselova, N				Novoselova, Natalia			An algorithm to estimate the stability of the individual clusters in the hierarchical context	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Stability indices; stability-based algorithm; clustering; validity measure; consensus matrix; hierarchy; Hungarian method; data mining	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; MICROARRAY DATA; VALIDATION; PATTERNS	The stability techniques widely used in bioinformatics research estimate clusterings with a pre-defined number of clusters. But the complex nature of bio-molecular data necessitates the extension of the stability techniques in order to validate the whole clusters' hierarchy without strict setting of the number of clusters beforehand. In this paper we proposed a stability-based algorithm HClusterV to estimate the individual clusters of the dendrogram. It is based on a repetitive construction of the hierarchy of clusters followed by the calculation of the original consensus matrix. The proposed algorithm allows to overcome the deficiency of the previous approach and to improve the reliability of the stability indices. Experiments on two simulated datasets and further comparative analysis confirmed the advantages of our approach. The proposed HClusterV algorithm was evaluated on two real microarray datasets and gave the results consistent with the corresponding non-hierarchical stability-based methods and relevant biological knowledge.

Most of the existing techniques have been designed based on heuristic notions without provable privacy guarantees. epsilon-differential privacy is a strong notion of privacy, which guarantees provable privacy. However, low degree of utility is the key issue of epsilon-differential notion. In this paper, we have proposed an epsilon-differential based algorithm to generate a perturbed data for PPC purpose. Hence, we have used Haar wavelet transform (HWT) for two reasons: (1) for achieving the perturbed data with much lower dimension compared to the original data in order to increase the efficiency of clustering algorithms, and (2) for adding much lower noise in order to obtain the perturbed data with both appropriate level of utility and differential privacy guarantee. We have also compared the proposed algorithm with a recent algorithm based on the utility and privacy guarantees. In addition, we have presented the results of the experiments using several datasets, which show that the proposed algorithm has an appropriate level of utility.

J	Dey, S; Janeja, VP; Gangopadhyay, A				Dey, Sandipan; Janeja, Vandana P.; Gangopadhyay, Aryya			Discovery of temporal neighborhoods through discretization methods	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Spatial/temporal databases; data mining; temporal neighborhoods; mining methods and algorithms	HISTOGRAMS	Neighborhood discovery is a precursor to knowledge discovery in complex and large datasets such as Temporal data, which is a sequence of data tuples measured at successive time instances. Hence instead of mining the entire data, we are interested in dividing the huge data into several smaller intervals of interest which we call as temporal neighborhoods. In this paper we propose a class of algorithms to generate temporal neighborhoods through unequal depth discretization. We describe four novel algorithms (a) Similarity based Merging (SMerg), (b) Stationary distribution based Merging (StMerg), (c) Greedy Merge (GMerg) and, (d) Optimal Merging (OptMerg). The SMerg and STMerg algorithms are based on the robust framework of Markov models and the Markov Stationary distribution respectively. GMerg is a greedy approach and OptMerg algorithm is geared towards discovering optimal binning strategies for the most effective partitioning of the data into temporal neighborhoods. Both these algorithms do not use Markov models. We identify temporal neighborhoods with distinct demarcations based on unequal depth discretization of the data. We discuss detailed experimental results in both synthetic and real world data. Specifically, we show (i) the efficacy of our algorithms through precision and recall of labeled bins, (ii) the ground truth validation in real world traffic monitoring datasets and, (iii) Knowledge discovery in the temporal neighborhoods such as global anomalies. Our results indicate that we are able to identify valuable knowledge based on our ground truth validation from real world traffic data.

Finding longest frequent trajectory of dynamic objects using association approaches	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Data mining; frequent pattern mining; association mining; apriori algorithm; requent trajectory pattern	MINING SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS; CANDIDATE GENERATION; ITEMSETS; CONSTRAINTS; DATABASES; ALGORITHM	Data mining is mainly concerned with analyzing large volumes of unstructured data and automatically discovering interesting relationships among them. This information leads to better knowledge and power. Finding Frequent Trajectory patterns are the recently emerging area in data mining. Using the principles of data mining frequent trajectory patterns are derived and knowledge can be obtained out of it. Maximum length of the frequent path will give information about traveling time taken to cross the stretch, alternate path taken to avoid congestion etc. Finding the longest trajectory from the frequent trajectory pattern is a more challenging task and is done efficiently in this paper. Currently existing methods use spatial and spatial-temporal data and follows histogram method to find the frequency of occurrence and clustering method to group the data to find frequent patterns. All these cases spatial or spatiotemporal data may not have any standard approach to find the longest frequent path. This issue is addressed specifically by applying the association based mining concepts in spatiotemporal data. The path derived by applying the modified Apriori and frequent pattern tree methods are compared with a standard graph based method currently available and their performance is analyzed. This approach may be applied to interesting game domains to find the longest frequent trajectory of balls.	[Shaw, Arthur A.; Gopalan, N.

Many loss functions have been proposed and applied to different classification problems. This paper proposes a new so called the smoothed 0-1 loss function, that could be considered as an approximation of the classical 0-1 loss function. Due to the non-convexity property of the proposed loss function, global optimization methods are required to solve the corresponding optimization problems. Together with the proposed loss function, we compare the performance of several existing loss functions in the classification of noisy data sets. In this comparison, different optimization problems are considered in regards to the convexity and smoothness of different loss functions. The experimental results show that the proposed smoothed 0-1 loss function works better on data sets with noisy labels, noisy features, and outliers.

Here we applied machine learning to detect expertise from the oculomotor behavior of novice and expert billiard players during free viewing of a filmed billiard match with no specific task, and in a dynamic trajectory prediction task involving ad-hoc, occluded billiard shots. We have adopted a ground framework for feature space fusion and a Bayesian sparse classifier, namely, a Relevance Vector Machine. By testing different combinations of simple oculomotor features (gaze shifts amplitude and direction, and fixation duration), we could classify on an individual basis which group - novice or expert - the observers belonged to with an accuracy of 82% and 87%, respectively for the match and the shots. These results provide evidence that, at least in the particular domain of billiard sport, a signature of expertise is hidden in very basic aspects of oculomotor behavior, and that expertise can be detected at the individual level both with ad-hoc testing conditions and under naturalistic conditions - and suitable data mining. Our procedure paves the way for the development of a test for the "expert's eye", and promotes the use of eye movements as an additional signal source in Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI) systems.

Based on the 204 continuous hours of 3198 taxi vehicles' operation data of Shenzhen, China, this paper analyzed the urban taxi driver's activity distribution characteristics from different temporal and spatial levels. In the time level, we identified the difference with taxi daily operation pattern (weekday versus weekends), continuous time in one day, passengers in vehicle time, and taxi drivers' operation frequency; in the space level, we explored the taxi driver's searching pattern, including searching activity space distribution and the relationship between the pick-up locations and the drop-off locations. This research can be helpful for urban taxi drivers' operation and behavior pattern identification, as well as the contribution to the geographical activity space analysis.

Data mining presents an opportunity to increase significantly the rate at which the volume of data can be turned into useful information. This paper presents an architecture designed to gather data generated in industrial units on their maintenance activities, and to forecast future failures based on data analysis. Rapid Miner is used to apply different data mining prediction algorithms to maintenance data and compare their accuracy in the discovery of patterns and predictions. The tool is integrated with an online system which collects data using automatic agents and presents all the results to the maintenance teams. The purpose of the prediction algorithms is to forecast future values based on present records, in order to estimate the possibility of a machine breakdown and therefore to support maintenance teams in planning appropriate maintenance interventions.

CONSUMPTION MARKETS & CULTURE			English	Editorial Material						credit; data mining; finance; markets; money		The analytical and empirical shift from the study of the kinds of consumption facilitated by credit, to the processes and performances in consuming credit itself, opens up an array of questions for the social study of money and markets. Consuming credit relies on infrastructures of credit's creation and transmission, which in turn leave data trails in their wake. Both the infrastructures and the data suggest new business models and pose challenges to social studies of financialization because of their decidedly non-market characteristics. Credit may be less about money, and may function less as money, than as a means to other ends of fee generation and data mining.

Big data is automatically collected during manufacturing processes in modern wafer fabrication facility. Thus, potential useful information can be extracted from big data to enhance decision quality and enhance operational effectiveness. This study aims to develop a data mining framework that integrates FDC and MES data to enhance the overall usage effectiveness (OUE) for cost reduction. We validated this approach with an empirical study in a semiconductor company in Taiwan. The results demonstrated the practical viability of this approach. The extracted information and knowledge is helpful to engineers for identifying the major tools factors affecting indirect material usage effectiveness and identify specific periods of time when a functional tool has abnormal usage of material.

We define the architecture of SCA as the integration of three sets of resources, data management resources (DMR), IT-enabled planning resources and performance management resources (PMR), from the perspective of a resource-based view. Based on the data collected from 537 manufacturing plants, we test hypotheses exploring the relationships among these resources, supply chain planning satisfaction, and operational performance. Our analysis supports that DMR should be considered a key building block of manufacturers' business analytics initiatives for supply chains. The value of data is transmitted to outcome values through increasing supply chain planning and performance capabilities. Additionally, the deployment of advanced IT-enabled planning resources occurs after acquisition of DMR. Manufacturers with sophisticated planning technologies are likely to take advantage of data-driven processes and quality control practices. DMR are found to be a stronger predictor of PMR than IT planning resources. All three sets of resources are related to supply chain planning satisfaction and operational performance. The paper concludes by reviewing research limitations and suggesting further SCA research issues.

Online breakage detection of multitooth tools using classifier ensembles for imbalanced data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE			English	Article						industrial applications; breakage detection; multitooth tools; classifier ensembles; imbalanced data	FAULT-DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DIAGNOSIS; WEAR; ALGORITHMS; MACHINE; SYSTEMS	Cutting tool breakage detection is an important task, due to its economic impact on mass production lines in the automobile industry. This task presents a central limitation: real data-sets are extremely imbalanced because breakage occurs in very few cases compared with normal operation of the cutting process. In this paper, we present an analysis of different data-mining techniques applied to the detection of insert breakage in multitooth tools. The analysis applies only one experimental variable: the electrical power consumption of the tool drive. This restriction profiles real industrial conditions more accurately than other physical variables, such as acoustic or vibration signals, which are not so easily measured. Many efforts have been made to design a method that is able to identify breakages with a high degree of reliability within a short period of time. The solution is based on classifier ensembles for imbalanced data-sets. Classifier ensembles are combinations of classifiers, which in many situations are more accurate than individual classifiers. Six different base classifiers are tested: Decision Trees, Rules, Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbour, Multilayer Perceptrons and Logistic Regression. Three different balancing strategies are tested with each of the classifier ensembles and compared to their performance with the original data-set: Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE), undersampling and a combination of SMOTE and undersampling. To identify the most suitable data-mining solution, Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) graph and Recall-precision graph are generated and discussed. The performance of logistic regression ensembles on the balanced data-set using the combination of SMOTE and undersampling turned out to be the most suitable technique. Finally a comparison using industrial performance measures is presented, which concludes that this technique is also more suited to this industrial problem than the other techniques presented in the bibliography.

Extraribosomal functions have recently been discovered for many ribosomal proteins, acting either as individual regulatory proteins or as a complex with other cell components. However, extraribosomal functions of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ribosomal proteins have not been systematically addressed. To this end, M. tuberculosis ribosomal proteins potentially engaged in extraribosomal functions were curated by data mining from transcriptional profiles of M. tuberculosis exposed to diverse treatments. Six M. tuberculosis ribosomal proteins, namely, S3 (Rv0707, rpsC), L16 (Rv0708, rplP), L29 (Rv0709, rpmC), S17 (Rv0710, rpsQ), S14 (Rv2056c, rpsN2), and L33 (Rv2057c, rpmG1), were found to behave idiosyncratically. The function of these abnormal ribosomal subunits can be further explored. Special emphasis is on their potential value as novel targets for better antibiotics.

Deformation information system for facilitating studies of mining-ground deformations, development, and applications	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							INTERPOLATION; SUBSIDENCE; PREDICTION; MOVEMENTS	The paper presents the concept of the deformation information system (DIS) to support and facilitate studies of mining-ground deformations. The proposed modular structure of the system includes data collection and data visualisation components, as well as spatial data mining, modelling and classification modules. In addition, the system integrates interactive three-dimensional models of the mines and local geology. The system is used to calculate various parameters characterising ground deformation in space and time, i.e. vertical and horizontal displacement fields, deformation parameters (tilt, curvature, and horizontal strain) and input spatial variables for spatial data classifications. The core of the system in the form of an integrated spatial and attributive database has been described. The development stages and the functionality of the particular components have been presented and example analyses utilising the spatial data mining and modelling functions have been shown. These include, among other things, continuous vertical and horizontal displacement field interpolations, calculation of parameters characterising mining-ground deformations, mining-ground category classifications, data extraction procedures and data preparation preprocessing procedures for analyses in external applications. The DIS has been developed for the Walbrzych coal mines area in SW Poland where long-time mining activity ended at the end of the 20th century and surface monitoring is necessary to study the present-day condition of the former mining grounds.

Toward enhanced understanding and projections of climate extremes using physics-guided data mining techniques	NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS			English	Article							PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; PART I; DOWNSCALING EXTREMES; WARMING ENVIRONMENT; TROPICAL CYCLONES; REGRESSION-MODELS; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; TYPHOON TRACKS; CARBON-CYCLE; OCEAN MODEL	Extreme events such as heat waves, cold spells, floods, droughts, tropical cyclones, and tornadoes have potentially devastating impacts on natural and engineered systems and human communities worldwide. Stakeholder decisions about critical infrastructures, natural resources, emergency preparedness and humanitarian aid typically need to be made at local to regional scales over seasonal to decadal planning horizons. However, credible climate change attribution and reliable projections at more localized and shorter time scales remain grand challenges. Long-standing gaps include inadequate understanding of processes such as cloud physics and ocean-land-atmosphere interactions, limitations of physics-based computer models, and the importance of intrinsic climate system variability at decadal horizons. Meanwhile, the growing size and complexity of climate data from model simulations and remote sensors increases opportunities to address these scientific gaps. This perspectives article explores the possibility that physically cognizant mining of massive climate data may lead to significant advances in generating credible predictive insights about climate extremes and in turn translating them to actionable metrics and information for adaptation and policy. Specifically, we propose that data mining techniques geared towards extremes can help tackle the grand challenges in the development of interpretable climate projections, predictability, and uncertainty assessments. To be successful, scalable methods will need to handle what has been called "big data" to tease out elusive but robust statistics of extremes and change from what is ultimately small data. Physically based relationships (where available) and conceptual understanding (where appropriate) are needed to guide methods development and interpretation of results. Such approaches may be especially relevant in situations where computer models may not be able to fully encapsulate current process understanding, yet the wealth of data may offer additional insights.

Facebook is essentially an online social network site in which individuals can share photographs, personal information, and join groups of friends. This study investigates the experiences on Facebook of various users in Taiwan. Their degrees of confidence were often demonstrated by word-of-mouth disseminations about the social network site. Further, this research looks at how the reputations of Facebook proprietors and their affiliates were disseminated through relationship marketing for formulated social network marketing in its business model concerns. Therefore, this study uses the a priori algorithm as an association rules approach, and cluster analysis for data mining. We divide Facebook users into two groups of contributors and lurkers by their profiles and then find each group's social network community information utilization and online purchase behaviors for investigating the Facebook business models.

Over the past decade, a diversity of different activity recognition approaches has been developed from which the majority focuses on the processing of data from one sensor modality only (e.g., vision). Nonetheless, a merging of data from multiple disparate sources has the potential of offering more accurate, robust, descriptive, intuitive, and meaningful results due to the availability of complementary and partially redundant information. This article (1) gives a review of existing multimodal approaches for elderly activity recognition in home settings, (2) introduces a powerful activity recognition model based on brain-inspired multimodal data mining methods, (3) employs this model for the purpose of daily activity recognition in a home setting using a publically available real world dataset, and (4) quantitatively compares the obtained results with state of the art multimodal activity recognition methods including hidden Markov models, conditional random fields, decision trees, a Bayes approach, and a context lattice.

Transactions with quantitative values are, however, commonly seen in real-world applications. Fuzzy mining algorithms for inducing rules from quantitative databases have thus been developed, most of which are based on the Apriori algorithm. Fuzzy mining is seldom based on frequent pattern (FP) trees because fuzzy-set processing from an FP tree is much more complicated than crisp-set processing. In this paper, a two-phase fuzzy mining approach based on a tree structure to obtain fuzzy frequent itemsets from a quantitative database is proposed. A simple tree structure called the upper-bound fuzzy frequent-pattern (UBFFP) tree is designed. The two-phase fuzzy mining approach can easily derive the upper-bound fuzzy counts of itemsets using the tree. It prunes unpromising itemsets in the first phase, and then finds the actual fuzzy frequent itemsets in the second phase. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has good performance.

An historical rankings perspective	JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES			English	Article						trend analysis; athlete longevity; data mining; tennis; athlete development	CIRCUIT; SUCCESS	Tennis federations are regularly faced with decisions regarding which athletes should be supported in financial terms, and for how long. The financial investments can be considerable, given the cost of competing on tour has been estimated at a minimum $121,000 per year and only the top 130 professionally ranked athletes earned enough prize money to cover this cost in 2012. This study investigates key points of progression in tennis players' careers, to determine how these have changed over time and how that evolution may inform talent development. Approximately 400,000 weekly rankings for 273 male professional tennis players between 1985 and 2010 were compiled, and historical trends in the time taken to reach career milestones were investigated by least-squares regression. The time between earning a first professional ranking point and entry into the Top 100 significantly increased over time for all considered athletes. This was at the detriment of time spent within the Top 100 for some athletes. Career peak Top 50-100 athletes have shown an increase in longevity. These results assist tennis federations in assessing the progress of developing athletes and highlight the evolving nature of the competition for top players.

Graph mining is a well-explored area of research which is gaining popularity in the data mining community. A graph is a general model to represent data and has been used in many domains such as cheminformatics, web information management system, computer network, and bioinformatics, to name a few. In graph mining the frequent subgraph discovery is a challenging task. Frequent subgraph mining is concerned with discovery of those subgraphs from graph dataset which have frequent or multiple instances within the given graph dataset. In the literature a large number of frequent subgraph mining algorithms have been proposed; these included FSG, AGM, gSpan, CloseGraph, SPIN, Gaston, and Mofa. The objective of this research work is to perform quantitative comparison of the above listed techniques. The performances of these techniques have been evaluated through a number of experiments based on three different state-of-the-art graph datasets. This novel work will provide base for anyone who is working to design a new frequent subgraph discovery technique.

It is one of the most spectacular mesoscale weather phenomena in the atmosphere which occurs seasonally. On the other hand, prediction of thunderstorms is said to be the most complicated task in weather forecasting, due to its limited spatial and temporal extension either dynamically or physically. Every thunderstorm produce lightening, this kills more people every year than tornadoes. Heavy rain from thunderstorm leads to flash flooding, and causes extensive loss to property and other living organisms. Different scientific and technological researches are been carried on for the forecasting of this severe weather feature in advance to reduce damages. In this regard, many of the researchers proposed various methodologies like STP model, MOM model, CG model, LM model, QKP model, DBD model and so on for the detection, but neither of them could provide an accurate prediction. The present research adopted clustering and wavelet transform techniques in order to improve the prediction rate to a greater extent. This is the first research study carried on thunderstorm prediction using the clustering and wavelet techniques resulting with higher accuracy. The proposed model yields an average accuracy of 89.23% in the identification of thunderstorm.	[Reddy, Kishor Kumar C.; Anisha, P.

It is useful for extracting hidden and interesting patterns from large datasets. Clustering techniques are important when it comes to extracting knowledge from large amount of spatial data collected from various applications including GIS, satellite images, X-ray crystallography, remote sensing and environmental assessment and planning etc. To extract useful pattern from these complex data sources several popular spatial data clustering techniques have been proposed. DBSCAN (Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a pioneer density based algorithm. It can discover clusters of any arbitrary shape and size in databases containing even noise and outliers. DBSCAN however are known to have a number of problems such as: (a) it requires user's input to specify parameter values for executing the algorithm; (b) it is prone to dilemma in deciding meaningful clusters from datasets with varying densities; (c) and it incurs certain computational complexity. Many researchers attempted to enhance the basic DBSCAN algorithm, in order to overcome these drawbacks, such as VDBSCAN, FDBSCAN, DD_DBSCAN, and IDBSCAN. In this study, we survey over different variations of DBSCAN algorithms that were proposed so far. These variations are critically evaluated and their limitations are also listed.

Such power load data are available from smart meters that will be widely deployed in many countries by utilities or customers, creating an infrastructure at the forefront of the Internet of Things (IoT). The main contribution of this work is a time-dependent factorial hidden Markov model to extract behaviour related features linked with individual appliance usage. The results show that the introduced time-dependent structure can improve the performance while also provide a probability distribution related to ADLs. These results further provide a promising indication of appliance usage connotations of e-health, and a foundation for further research.

The high quality seeds are given input to K-Means as the set of initial seeds to produce the final clusters. DenClust uses a density based approach for initial seed selection. It calculates the density of each record, where the density of a record is the number of records that have the minimum distances with the record. This approach is expected to produce high quality initial seeds for K-Means resulting in high quality clusters from a dataset. The performance of DenClust is compared with five (5) existing techniques namely CRUDAW, AGCUK, Simple K-means (SK), Basic Farthest Point Heuristic (BFPH) and New Farthest Point Heuristic (NFPH) in terms of three (3) external cluster evaluation criteria namely F-Measure, Entropy, Purity and two (2) internal cluster evaluation criteria namely Xie-Beni Index (XB) and Sum of Square Error (SSE). We use three (3) natural datasets that we obtain from the UCI machine learning repository. DenClust performs better than all five existing techniques in terms of all five evaluation criteria for all three datasets used in this study.

In large scale network structures like social networks, graph theoretical link and annotation prediction algorithms are usually not applicable due to graph isomorphism problem, unless some form of approximation is applied. We propose a non-graph theoretical alternative to link and annotation prediction in large networks by flattening network structures into feature vectors. We extract repeated sub-network pattern vectors for the nodes of a network, and utilize traditional machine learning algorithms for estimating missing or unknown annotations and links in the network. Our main contribution is a novel method for extracting features from large scale networks, and evaluation of the benefit each extraction method provides. We applied our methodology for suggesting new Twitter friends. In our experiments, we observed 11-27% improvement in prediction accuracy when compared to the simple methodology of suggesting friends of friends.

One of the findings is that the process of face recognition is different for different subjects and therefore formulating general rules for face recognition process may be difficult. The hypothesis was that it is possible to analyze eye movements signal to predict if the subject observing the face recognizes it. A model that automatically differentiates observations of recognized and unrecognized faces was built and the results are encouraging. One of the contributions of the paper is a conclusion that the optimal set of attributes of eye movement signal for such classification is individually specific and different for different people.

[1]) containing a lot of experimental data characterizing the nucleus, for example, nuclear ground-state masses and radii, magnetic moments, half-lives, spins and parities of excited and ground-state, their decay modes and the relative intensities of these decays, the deformations and many others. Today there are about 2830 nuclei that have been observed. It is estimated that the total number of nuclei which may be obtained by experimenters is between 6000 and 7000. It is evident that many properties of atomic nuclei are so far unknown and we usually define them using a variety of theoretical methods, based on those properties of nuclei which are already known. One of the most important properties is the spin of the nucleus in the ground state, specifying also the possible excited states. The main aim of the presented paper is to use the latest experimental data to check the existing theoretical methods of the prediction of unknown spins of nuclei and proposals for new estimates based on the methods of data mining and artificial intelligence (cf. [4-6, 8, 9, 11]). We compare the different models of the prediction of spin value with the help of the R programistic language, well fitted to statistical and data mining modelling. The properties of atomic nuclei have been collected in the MySQL database. In order to integrate the R language with MySQL we use the package RMySQL which contains the interface to communicate with the MySQL.

At the same time, complexity of data processing grows as volume of available data exponentially rises and includes unstructured data. Clinical decision support systems based on relational and multidimensional technology lack capabilities of processing all available data because of its volume and format. On the other hand, NoSQL repositories offer great flexibility and speed in terms of data processing, but requires programming skills. A proposed solution presented in this paper is to combine both of the technologies in a single analytical system. Dual view of the data gathered in the repository allows to use data-mining tools, while Big Data technology delivers necessary data. Key-value style of querying a database enables efficient retrieval of input data for analytical models. Online loading processes guarantee that data is available for analysis immediately after it is produced either by physicians or medical equipment. Finally, this architecture can be successfully moved to the cloud.

This paper reviews the importance and present trends of data mining methodologies in predictive medicine by focusing on hemodynamic predictions in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). It also provides potential data mining working frameworks for hemodynamic predictions in AAA. These frameworks either allow the coupling between a typical computational modeling simulation and various data mining techniques, using the existing medical datasets of real-patient and mining it directly using various data mining techniques or implementing visual data mining approach to already available computed results of various hemodynamic features within the AAA models. These approaches allow the possibility of statistically predicting rupture potentials of aneurismal patients and ideally provide an alternate solution for substituting tedious and time-consuming computational modeling. Prediction trends of patient-specific aneurismal conditions via mining huge volume of medical data can also speed up the decision making process in real life medicine.

Both Type 1 Diabetes mellitus and Type 2 Diabetes mellitus are more prevalent and efforts are directed to actively control these metabolic syndromes. Currently, Alzheimer's disease (AD), is gaining popularity as 'Type 3 diabetes' or 'Diabetes of the brain' and it is now evident that this neurodegenerative disease has multiple shared pathology with DM. Alarming is the fact that the incidence of AD might double within the next two decades, and this is certain to cause devastating effects not only to the afflicted individual or the family, but also to the global economy. Methods to either delay the onset or inhibit the progression of AD are therefore necessary. Progressive dementia, increased deposition of amyloid- beta protein, neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques in the brain are some of the hallmarks of AD. More understanding of the disease at the cellular and molecular level will enable identifying the possible targets for intervention and pave way for either development of novel or modification of the existing therapeutic options. In this work we have performed semantic data mining analysis on a large collection of most recently published data and identified an updated list of common genes expressed in DM and AD. Functional analysis of these genes revealed both existing and missing links involved in a bigger network associated with both disease conditions. Thus we argue that computational analysis methods help not only in understanding the mechanistic links but also in narrowing down precise targets (genes, proteins, metabolites and signalling pathways) and provide the base for both disease intervention and development of therapeutic options.

We focus our analysis on molecular docking data obtained from application of differential evolution implemented in the program Molegro Virtual Docker. As a protein target, we selected the enzyme 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase (DHQD). This enzyme is part of the shikimate pathway, and a protein target for development of anti-tubercular drugs. We used a set with 20 DHQD crystallographic structures with ligands bound to the active site. In order to identify the best approach to molecular docking, we analyzed crystallographic parameters and looked for correlation between the docking results and structural features present in the protein target. Analysis of docking results helps to identify the best approach to use in ligand docking and identify structural features important for the success of this methodology. Analysis of results generated by ligand docking focused on DHQD made possible to assess the best docking protocol for this enzyme and use this optimized approach in the more computational demanding methodology of virtual screening (VS). We used a data set of natural products to identify structural features important for ligand-binding affinity.

This problem consists of finding a tensor of minimum n-rank subject to linear equality constraints and has been proposed in many areas such as data mining, machine learning and computer vision. In this paper, operator splitting technique and convex relaxation technique are adapted to transform the low n-rank tensor recovery problem into a convex, unconstrained optimization problem, in which the objective function is the sum of a convex smooth function with Lipschitz continuous gradient and a convex function on a set of matrices. Furthermore, in order to solve the unconstrained nonsmooth convex optimization problem, an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is proposed. Then, some computational techniques are used to improve the algorithm. At the end of this paper, some preliminary numerical results demonstrate the potential value and application of the tensor as well as the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

An Overview of Data Mining Algorithms in Drug Induced Toxicity Prediction	MINI-REVIEWS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Review						Bioinformatics; computational prediction; data mining; in silico; machine learning; toxicity prediction	HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA; SELF-ORGANIZING MAP; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY; TOPOLOGICAL INDEXES; CHEMICAL TOXICITY; COLON-CANCER; IN-VITRO; MODELS; CLASSIFICATION	The growth in chemical diversity has increased the need to adjudicate the toxicity of different chemical compounds raising the burden on the demand of animal testing. The toxicity evaluation requires time consuming and expensive undertaking, leading to the deprivation of the methods employed for screening chemicals pointing towards the need to develop more efficient toxicity assessment systems. Computational approaches have reduced the time as well as the cost for evaluating the toxicity and kinetic behavior of any chemical. The accessibility of a large amount of data and the intense need of turning this data into useful information have attracted the attention towards data mining. Machine Learning, one of the powerful data mining techniques has evolved as the most effective and potent tool for exploring new insights on combinatorial relationships among various experimental data generated. The article accounts on some sophisticated machine learning algorithms like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-mean clustering and Self Organizing Maps (SOM) with some of the available tools used for classification, sorting and toxicological evaluation of data, clarifying, how data mining and machine learning interact cooperatively to facilitate knowledge discovery. Addressing the association of some commonly used expert systems, we briefly outline some real world applications to consider the crucial role of data set partitioning.

Fungi were grown in 12-well plates to easily and rapidly obtain the large number of replicates necessary for employing metabolomic approaches. Fungal culture using such a format accelerated the production of metabolites by several weeks compared with using the large-format 9 cm Petri dishes. This strategy was applied to a co-culture of a Fusarium and an Aspergillus strain. The metabolite composition of the cultures was assessed using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionisation and time-of-flight mass spectrometry, followed by automated data mining. The de novo production of metabolites was dramatically increased by nutriment reduction. A time-series study of the induction of the fungal metabolites of interest over nine days revealed that they exhibited various induction patterns. The concentrations of most of the de novo induced metabolites increased over time. However, interesting patterns were observed, such as with the presence of some compounds only at certain time points. This result indicates the complexity and dynamic nature of fungal metabolism. The large-scale production of the compounds of interest was verified by co-culture in 15 cm Petri dishes; most of the induced metabolites of interest (16/18) were found to be produced as effectively as on a small scale, although not in the same time frames. Large-scale production is a practical solution for the future production, identification and biological evaluation of these metabolites.

Over the years several approaches and models have been developed in order to facilitate knowledge process but most of them recognize a high degree of personal commitment that involves mental models, personal beliefs, values and the process of reinventing oneself. Interestingly enough there seems to be a lack of literature on how to create it. Tools like data mining, brainstorming, problem solving approaches are well known, but how can we be sure that people will use them correctly? Ethical issues, cultural differences and misunderstanding could affect their effectiveness. Considering companies of different dimension like MNCs and SMEs, the differences become even bigger. Extrogen is an alliance between an Italian SME and a MNC, which name has been faked in order to keep it anonymous. A review of the management control system (MCS) has been conducted applying the Simons model which recognizes the role of MCS for creating boundaries, sharing core values, creating a communicative environment and measuring the results reached. This paper represents a case of study and aims to: 1. Analyze literature on KM barriers, especially comparing MNCs and SMEs and MCS literature; 2. Draw a model which combines the role of MCS as a Knowledge Management Tool; 3. Present a case study where MCS has been used for reducing KM barriers among MNCs and SMEs and supporting innovation.

However, they are still far from widespread production use due to lack of native support for auto-tuning in an ever changing and complex software and hardware stack, large and multi-dimensional optimization spaces, excessively long exploration times, and lack of unified mechanisms for preserving and sharing of optimization knowledge and research material. We present a possible collaborative approach to solve above problems using Collective Mind knowledge management system. In contrast with previous cTuning framework, this modular infrastructure allows to preserve and share through the Internet the whole auto-tuning setups with all related artifacts and their software and hardware dependencies besides just performance data. It also allows to gradually structure, systematize and describe all available research material including tools, benchmarks, data sets, search strategies and machine learning models. Researchers can take advantage of shared components and data with extensible meta-description to quickly and collaboratively validate and improve existing auto-tuning and benchmarking techniques or prototype new ones. The community can now gradually learn and improve complex behavior of all existing computer systems while exposing behavior anomalies or model mispredictions to an interdisciplinary community in a reproducible way for further analysis. We present several practical, collaborative and model-driven auto-tuning scenarios. We also decided to release all material at c-mind.org/repo to set up an example for a collaborative and reproducible research as well as our new publication model in computer engineering where experimental results are continuously shared and validated by the community.

In this contribution, we explore how different Data Mining techniques can be adapted to improve such characterization. Specifically, we here describe novel techniques for optimizing network representations of different data sets; automatize the extraction of relevant topological metrics, and using such metrics toward the synthesis of high-level knowledge. The validity and usefulness of such approach is demonstrated through the analysis of medical data sets describing groups of control subjects and patients.

In fault prediction model development research, combination of metrics significantly improves the prediction capability of the model, but it also gives rise to the issue of handling an increased number of predictors and evolved nonlinearity due to complex interaction among metrics. Ordinary least square (OLS) based parametric regression techniques cannot effectively model such nonlinearity with a large number of predictors because the global parametric function to fit the data is not known beforehand. In our previous studies[1-3], we showed the impact of interaction in the combined metrics approach of fault prediction and statistically established the simultaneous increment in the predictive accuracy of the model with interaction. In this study we use K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) regression as an example of nonparametric regression technique, otherwise well known for classification tasks in the data mining community. Through the results derived here, we empirically establish and validate the hypothesis that the performance of KNN regression remains ordinarily unaffected with increasing number of interacting predictors and simultaneously provides superior performance over widely used multiple linear regression (MLR).

Asymptotically optimal SAHN clustering algorithms are known for arbitrary dissimilarity measures, but their quadratic time and space complexity even in the best case still limits the applicability to small data sets. We present a new pivot based heuristic SAHN clustering algorithm exploiting the properties of metric distance measures in order to obtain a best case running time of O(n log n) for the input size n. Our approach requires only linear space and supports median and centroid linkage. It is especially suitable for expensive distance measures, as it needs only a linear number of exact distance computations. In extensive experimental evaluations on real-world and synthetic data sets, we compare our approach to exact state-of-the-art SAHN algorithms in terms of quality and running time. The evaluations show a subquadratic running time in practice and a very low memory footprint.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors propose a retrieval framework known as Cross-Domain Sentiment Search (CSS), which combines the usage of domain ontologies with specific linguistic rules to handle sentiment terms in textual data. The CSS framework also supports incrementally enriching domain ontologies when applied in new domains. Findings - The authors found that domain ontologies are extremely helpful when CSS is applied in specific domains. In the meantime, the embedded linguistic rules make CSS achieve better performance as compared to data mining techniques. Research limitations/implications - The approach has been initially applied in a real social monitoring system of a professional IT company. Thus, it is proved to be able to handle real data acquired from social media channels such as electronic newspapers or social networks. Originality/value - The authors have placed aspect-based sentiment analysis in the context of semantic search and introduced the CSS framework for the whole sentiment search process. The formal definitions of Sentiment Ontology and aspect-based sentiment analysis are also presented. This distinguishes the work from other related works.

Four main sources were used to represent and harmonize covariate space covering all of Mexico: topography, climate, remote sensing and legacy class polygon maps (soils and geology). Performance comparison of linear geo-statistics and two data mining methods for spatial prediction was carried out using the n-fold cross validation method. Resultant maps were interpreted by a soil experts group. Best model selection is discussed trying to meet criteria of both, statistics and soil science. Soil depth maps generated in this study are the first digital proxy developed in Mexico with a national perspective. Disaggregating the territory into spatial soil mapping domains will be part of future work, focused in to generate models that satisfy accuracy and error standards according to each variable, scale and region.

Design/methodology/approach - The proposed approach utilizes patent information that is considered the most effective data to investigate innovation activities by applying morphology analysis (MA) and generative topology map (GTM) to the process to identify the configurations of technologies and visualize the collected patent information. In particular, diverse informative indices can assist researchers in deriving appropriate partners for technological cooperation. Findings - The hybrid approach that combines MA, GTM, and indices is useful to discover technological opportunity, identify necessary technologies and explore potential partners. The systematic process can overcome the limitations of existing approaches that depend on the insights and strategic decisions of top management, reflect a superficial relationship among firms and mostly fail to consider both theoretical and practical approaches to retrieve potential partners. Practical implications - The results of this paper will help practitioners, academic researchers, and policy makers link a pair of partners who can maximize the synergy of collaboration in a systematic manner. The proposed approach is illustrated to show the validity of the process with a case of light emitting diode (LED) technology. In addition, the social cost for collaboration can be reduced by applying the proposed approach in open innovation. Originality/value - This paper tackles the important issue of exploring appropriate partners by applying a systematic approach that utilizes text mining, MA and GTM because existing research mostly deals with ad-hoc processes. The proposed approach utilizes multiple methodologies of data mining and technology forecasting to derive promising technology areas in a systematic manner and then employs critical indices to explore proper partners. Thus, this approach considers both quantitative and qualitative methodologies to suggest a sophisticated tool for successful open innovation. Moreover, a real case - LED case was illustrated to demonstrate that the proposed approach can be employed to implement technological cooperation.

In this paper, a dynamic multi-uEAC array is proposed based on the analysis of the uEAC unit mathematical model. By constructing a multi-uEAC array, the limitations of single uEAC unit on nonlinear mapping can be overcome. In order to obtain an optimal multi-uEAC array structure, a comprehensive optimization strategy based on particle swarm optimizer (PSO) is developed to optimize multi-uEAC array structure matrix and connection matrix simultaneously. Two simulation examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.

The financial data classification standard, which always performs excellently in these aspects, is an essential premise for data mining and analysis in the big data(2). To find a method to form the classification standard framework that can meet diverse purposes is very important. This research proposes a way to form the framework of financial data classification standard based on uniform classification standard and relative books, improved by comparing with classification standard of existed financial database and verified by practice with financial data sources. This framework can adapt to trends in the era of the big data and improve data storage mode.

In this paper we use Western Pacific events and basic background database as its data source to find the association between different marine parameters. The improved Apriori algorithm is utilized to discover knowledge in magnanimous spatio-temporal data. There are two main steps. First is according to the different variation degree of each point, the study area can be divided into lots of spatial-temporal transaction zones. Second is use the improved Apriori algorithm for spatial-temporal data mining. For the need of mining algorithm, the quantitative attributes need to be transformed into qualitative attributes. The concept generalization method is utilized to divide the original attribute data into several levels. Then the Apriori algorithm can be used to discover the potential association between marine parameters within the given time frame.

We describe, step by step, the complete methodological development process of the evaluation model as well as detailing the results obtained when applying it to a higher education teaching experience. This research demonstrates that the combined use of multicriteria decision methodologies and data mining prove to be particularly suitable for identifying behavioural patterns of the users through the analysis of records generated in LMS. The results reveal that the behavioural patterns in LMS offer certain indicators as to students' academic performance, although the study does not permit to state that those students who adopt passive attitudes in these spheres may necessarily produce low academic performance.

In recent years, various feature measurements have been proposed to select significant features from high-dimensional datasets. However, most traditional feature selection methods will ignore some features which have strong classification ability as a group but are weak as individuals. To deal with this problem, we redefine the redundancy, interdependence, and independence of features by using neighborhood entropy. Then the neighborhood entropy-based feature contribution is proposed under the framework of cooperative game. The evaluative criteria of features can be formalized as the product of contribution and other classical feature measures. Finally, the proposed method is tested on several UCI datasets. The results show that neighborhood entropy-based cooperative game theory model (NECGT) yield better performance than classical ones.

The model that is created on the basis of students' socio-demographic data, data on their behaviour, personality characteristics, attitudes towards learning and the entire teaching process organization tends to classify students into one of two categories of success. Performance is measured by students' grade point average achieved over the period of studies. We tested three methods of data mining: logistic regression, decision trees and neural networks. We believe that the presented model would serve as a test for the creation of a broader base of updated data by using some of the information tools and that, based on this model, a number of attributes that would relatively reliably predict the performance in studying will be defined.

In general, churn prediction can be achieved by many data mining techniques. However, during data mining, dimensionality reduction (or feature selection) and data reduction are the two important data preprocessing steps. In particular, the aims of feature selection and data reduction are to filter out irrelevant features and noisy data samples, respectively. The purpose of this paper, performing these data preprocessing tasks, is to make the mining algorithm produce good quality mining results. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a real telecom customer churn data set, seven different preprocessed data sets based on performing feature selection and data reduction by different priorities are used to train the artificial neural network as the churn prediction model. Findings - The results show that performing data reduction first by self-organizing maps and feature selection second by principal component analysis can allow the prediction model to provide the highest prediction accuracy. In addition, this priority allows the prediction model for more efficient learning since 66 and 62 percent of the original features and data samples are reduced, respectively. Originality/value - The contribution of this paper is to understand the better procedure of performing the two important data preprocessing steps for telecom churn prediction.

J	Wu, HC; Hu, YH; Huang, YH				Wu, Hsu-Che; Hu, Ya-Han; Huang, Yen-Hao			Two-stage credit rating prediction using machine learning techniques	KYBERNETES			English	Article						Knowledge management; Decision making	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SCORING MODELS; CLASSIFICATION	Purpose - Credit ratings have become one of the primary references for financial institutions to assess credit risk. Conventional credit rating approaches mainly concentrated on two-class classification (i. e. good or bad credit), which lacks adequate precision to perform credit risk evaluations in practice. In addition, most of previous researches directly focussed on employing various data mining techniques, but rare studies discussed the influence of data preprocessing before classifier construction. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This study considers nine-class classification (i. e. nine credit risk level) to credit rating prediction. For the development of more accurate classifiers, the paper adopts two-stage analysis, which integrates multiple data preprocessing and supervised learning techniques. Specifically, the first stage applies feature selection, data clustering, and data resampling methods to preprocess the data, and then the second stage utilizes several classification techniques and classifier ensembles to construct prediction models. Findings - The results show that Bagging-DT with data resampling method achieves excellent accuracy (82.96 percent), indicating that the proposed two-stage prediction model is better than conventional one-stage models. Originality/value - Practical implication of this study can lower credit rating expenses and also allow corporations to gain credit rating information instantly.

Experiencing KEEL Software: Application to Fatigue Data Segment Classification	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 21ST NATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES (SKSM21): GERMINATION OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION AND RESEARCH TOWARDS GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	21st National Symposium on Mathematical Sciences (SKSM)	NOV 06-08, 2013	MALAYSIA	Malaysian Math Sci Soc	Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci	KEEL software; data mining classification; fatigue data segment; discretization; feature selection	ALGORITHMS	Most researchers have doubts over what type of classification model is most suitable for representing their data when applying a data mining approach. However, this quandary can be solved by performing a comparison between the available models. Generating multiple classification models simultaneously is cost-effective when using free data mining tools such as KEEL (Knowledge Extraction based on Evolutionary Learning). KEEL is an interactive data mining software that provides a high level of functionality for users. This paper presents an experience of using this user-friendly software to solve a fatigue data segment classification problem. The problem concerns classifying fatigue data segments whether they consist of low or high damage. Experiments over the dataset using three different types of classification algorithms (i.e. CN2, C4.5 and Naive-Bayes), two discretization methods, and two filter-type feature selection methods show that there is no optimal classification algorithm in terms of indexing performance for our specific problem. Interestingly, however, this study does provide minor evidence that classifier performance could be increased by pairing discretization and feature selection methods appropriately.

While this is an ongoing development, the past three decades feature key events that have revolutionized the way drug discovery is conducted in Big Pharma industry. It has been a great privilege to have been involved in this transformation process, to have been able to collaborate with, direct, guide, or simply encourage outstanding experts in various disciplines to build and further develop what has become a major pillar of modern small-molecule drug discovery. This article is an account of major events that took place since the early decision of Roche to implement computer-assisted molecular modeling 32 years ago and is devoted to the key players involved. It highlights the internal build-up of structural biology, with protein X-ray structure determination at its core, and the early setup of bioinformatics. It describes the strategic shift to large compound libraries and high-throughput screening with the development of novel compound storage and ultra-high-throughput screening facilities, as well as the strategic return to focused screening of small motif-based compound libraries. These developments were accompanied by the rise of miniaturized parallel compound property analytics which resulted in a major paradigm shift in medicinal chemistry from linear to multi-dimensional lead optimization. The rapid growth of huge collections of property data stimulated the development of various novel data mining concepts with 'matched molecular pair' analysis and novel variants thereof playing crucial roles. As compound properties got more prominent in molecular design, exploration of specific structural motifs for property modulation became a research activity complementary to target-oriented medicinal chemistry. The exploration of oxetane is given as an example. For the sake of brevity, this account cannot detail all further developments that have taken place in each individual area of structure- and property-based drug discovery and it can only hint at important developments in other disciplines that have equally contributed to major paradigm shifts in Roche's small-molecule drug discovery efforts.

Secondly, data mining techniques can be used not only to help explore the population of potential solutions but also to exploit data regarding the behavior of the WDS under different work conditions. As a result, applications can be developed for supporting decision making regarding WDS models in both offline and online contexts.

Based on the historical data of the rupture of water supply pipe network, a spatial cluster analysis will be carried out towards the historical data of spatial fault in water supply pipeline, using density-based cluster analysis and the DBSCAN algorithm. K-neighborhood graph is well-used in optimizing the input parameter radius of neighborhood (Eps) and density (MinPts) and classifying the historical data of the rupture of pipeline. According to the pipe network failure point coordinates (X, Y), adopting density-based cluster analysis, a danger level classification will be researched without knowing the reasons of the rupture of pipe network, which lays the foundation for finding out pipeline rupture in local areas in the future. Meanwhile, a noise analysis will be processed in terms of the historical data of pipeline rupture in water supply network, avoiding the ineffective data caused by recording errors and regular analysis. This research focuses on the reasons that result in the rupture of water supply network, which plays a significant role in the identification of high-density and high-danger zones in water supply networks.

Existing works generate sensor association rules using occurrence frequency of patterns with binary frequency (either absent or present) or support of a pattern as a criterion. However, considering the binary frequency or support of a pattern may not be a sufficient indicator for finding meaningful patterns from WSN data because it only reflects the number of epochs in the sensor data which contain that pattern. The share measure of sensorsets could discover useful knowledge about numerical values associated with sensor in a sensor database. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new type of behavioral pattern called share-frequent sensor patterns by considering the non-binary frequency values of sensors in epochs. To discover share-frequent sensor patterns from sensor dataset, we propose a novel parallel technique. In this technique, we develop a novel tree structure, called parallel share-frequent sensor pattern tree (PShrFSP-tree) that is constructed at each local node independently, by capturing the database contents to generate the candidate patterns using a pattern growth technique with a single scan and then merges the locally generated candidate patterns at the final stage to generate global share-frequent sensor patterns. Comprehensive experimental results show that our proposed model is very efficient for mining share-frequent patterns from WSN data in terms of time and scalability.	[Rashid, Md.

Particularly, we propose the concept of extracting spatio-temporal meta data from Flickr photos, combining a collection of such photos together results in a spatio-temporal entity movement trail, a trajectory describing an individual's movements. Using these spatio-temporal Flickr photographer trajectories we aim to extract valuable tourist information about where people are going, what time they are going there, and where they are likely to go next. In order to achieve this goal we present our novel spatio-temporal trajectory regions-of-interest mining and sequential pattern mining framework. It is different from previous work since it forms regions-of-interest taking into consideration both space and time simultaneously, and thus produces higher-quality sequential patterns. We test our framework's ability to uncover interesting patterns for the tourism sciences industry by performing experiments using a large dataset of Queensland photo taker movements for the year 2012. Experimental results validate the usefulness of our approach at finding new, information rich spatio-temporal tourist patterns from this dataset, especially in comparison with the 2D approaches shown in the literature.

The classical methods of link prediction are based on graph topology structure and path features but few consider clustering information. The cluster in graphs is densely connected group of vertices and sparsely connected to other groups. Actually, the clustering results contain the essential information for link prediction, and these vertices common neighbors may play different roles depending on if they belong to the same cluster. Based on this assumption and characteristics of the common social networks, in this paper, we propose a link prediction method based on clustering and global information. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks show that this method can improve link prediction accuracy as the number of cluster grows.

We have conducted extensive experiments with different attributes for each constant using advanced data-mining techniques, and we have tried to express a theoretical model that can help to determine with high probability whether the numbers are normal in base ten. We have expanded and generalized the experimental results so as to formulate conjectures about the attributes of a normal number, and we have presented conjectures that can lead to determining whether a number is normal. The experimental results and analysis have shown that indeed, pi, e, phi, root 2 satisfy the definition of a normal number. Not only does the distribution of each of the base-10 digits occur with frequency approximately one-tenth, as is known already for very large sequences, but we have also shown for the first time that all arrangements with repetition of digits up to a specific length, depending on the number of decimals examined, occur also with the expected frequencies. As a result, we establish a new process to examine not only whether these constants are just simply normal but normal as well.

In this paper, a dynamic dispatching strategy selection approach for semiconductor production line is studied. The proposed approach is based on historical data, uses support vector machine (SVM) as a data mining tool and binary particle swarm optimization algorithm (BPSO) to optimize production attributes (i.e. features) subset, and finally creates a SVM-based dynamic scheduling strategy classification model for production line. Under any given production status, an approximate optimal scheduling strategy can be real-time acquired through the model. Finally, the proposed dynamic scheduling approach in this paper is tested in an actual semiconductor production line for its effectiveness and feasibility.

Rules are simple to understand and can be easily used for classification. For such a system to be widely adopted, it should give output that is correct and comprehensible. With the explosion of information, databases have become humongous containing a large number of records and attributes. Traditional methods of classification need to be modified to give output that is satisfactory to end users. This paper discusses a rule mining classifier based on a Dynamic Particle Swarm Optimizer. Due to its seeding procedure, concept of regions and their regrouping, it disallows premature convergence and provides a better value in every dimension. Quality evaluation is done both for individual rules and for entire rule sets. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison with other state-of-the-art associative classifiers. Results demonstrate competitive performance of the proposed method.

The study area was the Pyeongchang area in Gangwon Province, Korea, where many landslides occurred in 2006 and where the 2018 Winter Olympics are to be held. Spatial data, such as landslides, topography, and geology, were detected, collected, and compiled in a database using remote sensing and GIS. The 3994 recorded landslide locations were randomly split 50/50 for training and validation of the models. A decision tree model, which is a type of data-mining classification model, was applied and decision trees were constructed using the chi-squared (chi(2)) automatic interaction detector (CHAID) and the quick, unbiased, and efficient statistical tree (QUEST) algorithms. Also, as a reference, a frequency-ratio model was applied using the same database. The relationships between the detected landslide locations and their factors were identified and quantified by frequency-ratio and decision tree models. The relationships were used as factor ratings in the overlay analysis to create landslide susceptibility indices and maps. Then, the resulting landslide-susceptibility maps were validated using area-under-the-curve (AUC) analysis with the landslide area data that had not been used for training the model. The decision tree models using the CHAID and QUEST algorithms had accuracies of 81.56% and 80.91%, respectively, which were somewhat better than the results for the frequency-ratio model (80.15%). These results indicate that decision tree models using the CHAID and QUEST algorithms can be useful for landslide susceptibility analysis.

J	Pares-Casanova, PM				Pares-Casanova, Pere M.			Is the geometric morphometrics technique a valuable tool for classifying skulls of living species of Felidae?	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL RESEARCH			English	Article						allometry; clustering; data mining; felids; morphometry	FEEDING ECOLOGY	A sample of 40 adult specimens of different genera belonging to the family Felidae was studied according to geometric morphometric (GM) analysis, based on 14 homologous landmarks obtained from the lateral aspect of the skull. Multivariate statistics were applied to visualize the patterns and assess the significance of size and shape variation between species. Procrustes and tangent space distances between all specimens were compared and the correlations between these distances demonstrated a low redundancy in the original data. Size was revealed as the most identifiable component of species dimorphism. But although GM tools can depict similarities in form with accuracy, it is necessary to say that there is no necessary phylogenetic meaning to the results but rather biomechanical conclusions only, although the results reflected here depend on the choice of landmarks and specimens.

Therefore, we developed a 2-stage model for the detection and diagnosis of injury of the supraspinatus tendon. Methods: The first stage used coupled weighted histogram separation (WHS) to improve image enhancement, and the second stage extracted suspicious texture, features of both spatial and spectral domains, and sequential floating forward selection (SFFS) selected features conducive to classification of RCTs. We then tested injuries of the supraspinatus tendon using the classifier. Results: The extraction of features by SFFS can increase detection of supraspinatus injury by reducing the input vector by 57.78% from the enhanced input images. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve indicated an azimuth (Az) value of 84.38% when SFFS selected 76 features to construct a support vector machine (SVM) classifier from the enhanced images, compared with 56.94% when all 180 features from the raw input images were used for the construction. Conclusions: The performance of the classifier constructed by SFFS-selected features is superior to that using all features. These findings can serve as references to improve diagnosis and treatment of supraspinatus injuries.

To detect these targets, the radar detection threshold needs to be as low as possible to ensure some minimum probability of detection (Pd). Unfortunately, lowering the radar threshold naturally results in a higher false alarm rate. Although there are standard methods such as M of N to reduce the false alarms, new techniques can potentially drive the false alarm rate down even further. Many "theoretical" papers have shown that STAP can be designed to outperform DPCA because of its potential additional "degrees-of-freedom". However, in "practice," this isn't always the case. For example, it is well known that STAP can have training issues in heterogeneous clutter. Typically, a radar signal processor will implement one method or the other to detect these small endoclutter targets. The technique being explored here is a two-fold approach in which the existing STAP code first processes the data in order to find a list of candidate targets. Next, a DPCA technique is also used to find a separate list of candidate detections from the same data. Although the algorithms are working on the same data, the processing is "independent" between them so the target lists are different. After both techniques have finished processing, the modified radar signal processing code "intelligently" combines the two detection lists into a single detection list. It will be shown that the combined list of detections from the two methods results in better detection performance than either method used separately.

Monitoring of large-scale federated data storage: XRootD and beyond	20TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING IN HIGH ENERGY AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS (CHEP2013), PARTS 1-6	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (CHEP)	OCT 14-18, 2013	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS					The computing models of the LHC experiments are gradually moving from hierarchical data models with centrally managed data pre-placement towards federated storage which provides seamless access to data files independently of their location and dramatically improve recovery due to fail-over mechanisms. Construction of the data federations and understanding the impact of the new approach to data management on user analysis requires complete and detailed monitoring. Monitoring functionality should cover the status of all components of the federated storage, measuring data traffic and data access performance, as well as being able to detect any kind of inefficiencies and to provide hints for resource optimization and effective data distribution policy. Data mining of the collected monitoring data provides a deep insight into new usage patterns. In the WLCG context, there are several federations currently based on the XRootD technology. This paper will focus on monitoring for the ATLAS and CMS XRootD federations implemented in the Experiment Dashboard monitoring framework. Both federations consist of many dozens of sites accessed by many hundreds of clients and they continue to grow in size. Handling of the monitoring flow generated by these systems has to be well optimized in order to achieve the required performance. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the XRootD monitoring architecture is sufficiently generic to be easily adapted for other technologies, such as HTTP/WebDAV dynamic federations.

User Centric Job Monitoring - a redesign and novel approach in the STAR experiment	20TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING IN HIGH ENERGY AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS (CHEP2013), PARTS 1-6	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (CHEP)	OCT 14-18, 2013	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS					User Centric Monitoring (or UCM) has been a long awaited feature in STAR, whereas programs, workflows and system "events" could be logged, broadcast and later analyzed. UCM allows to collect and filter available job monitoring information from various resources and present it to users in a user-centric view rather than an administrative-centric point of view. The first attempt and implementation of "a" UCM approach was made in STAR 2004 using a log4cxx plug-in back-end and then further evolved with an attempt to push toward a scalable database back-end (2006) and finally using aWeb-Service approach (2010, CSW4DB SBIR). The latest showed to be incomplete and not addressing the evolving needs of the experiment where streamlined messages for online (data acquisition) purposes as well as the continuous support for the data mining needs and event analysis need to coexists and unified in a seamless approach. The code also revealed to be hardly maintainable. This paper presents the next evolutionary step of the UCM toolkit, a redesign and redirection of our latest attempt acknowledging and integrating recent technologies and a simpler, maintainable and yet scalable manner. The extended version of the job logging package is built upon three-tier approach based on Task, Job and Event, and features a Web-Service based logging API, a responsive AJAX-powered user interface, and a database back-end relying on MongoDB, which is uniquely suited for STAR needs. In addition, we present details of integration of this logging package with the STAR offline and online software frameworks. Leveraging on the reported experience and work from the ATLAS and CMS experience on using the ESPER engine, we discuss and show how such approach has been implemented in STAR for meta-data event triggering stream processing and filtering. An ESPER based solution seems to fit well into the online data acquisition system where many systems are monitored.

More efficient tape migrations and recalls have been implemented and deployed where bulk meta-data operations greatly reduce the overhead due to small files. A repack facility is now integrated in the system and it has been enhanced in order to automate the repacking of several tens of petabytes, required in 2014 in order to prepare for the next LHC run. Finally the scheduling system has been evolved to integrate the internal monitoring. To efficiently manage the service a solid monitoring infrastructure is required, able to analyze the logs produced by the different components (about 1 kHz of log messages). A new system has been developed and deployed, which uses a transport messaging layer provided by the CERN-IT Agile Infrastructure and exploits technologies including Hadoop and HBase. This enables efficient data mining by making use of MapReduce techniques, and real-time data aggregation and visualization. The outlook for the future is also presented. Directions and possible evolution will be discussed in view of the restart of data taking activities.	[Lo Presti, G.; Curull, X.

The main challenges for such system are: to cope with CASTOR's log format diversity and its information scattered among several log files, the need for long term information archival, the strict reliability requirements and the group based GUI visualization. For this purpose, we have designed, developed and deployed a centralized system consisting of four independent layers: the Log Transfer layer for collecting log lines from all tape servers to a single aggregation server, the Data Mining layer for combining log data into transaction context, the Storage layer for archiving the resulting transactions and finally the Web UI layer for accessing the information. Having flexibility, extensibility and maintainability in mind, each layer is designed to work as a message broker for the next layer, providing a clean and generic interface while ensuring consistency, redundancy and ultimately fault tolerance. This system unifies information previously dispersed over several monitoring tools into a single user interface, using Splunk, which also allows us to provide information visualization based on access control lists (ACL). Since its deployment, it has been successfully used by CASTOR tape operators for quick overview of transactions, performance evaluation, malfunction detection and from managers for report generation.			fotis.nikolaidis@cern.ch; daniele.francesco.kruse@cern.ch						2	0	0	IOP PUBLISHING LTD	BRISTOL	DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND	1742-6588			J PHYS CONF SER			2014	513								032070	10.1088/1742-6596/513/3/032070		5	Physics, Nuclear; Physics, Particles & Fields	Physics	BB2TA	WOS:000342287200151

Self managing experiment resources	20TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING IN HIGH ENERGY AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS (CHEP2013), PARTS 1-6	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (CHEP)	OCT 14-18, 2013	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS					Within this paper we present an autonomic Computing resources management system, used by LHCb for assessing the status of their Grid resources. Virtual Organizations Grids include heterogeneous resources. For example, LHC experiments very often use resources not provided by WLCG, and Cloud Computing resources will soon provide a non-negligible fraction of their computing power. The lack of standards and procedures across experiments and sites generated the appearance of multiple information systems, monitoring tools, ticket portals, etc... which nowadays coexist and represent a very precious source of information for running HEP experiments Computing systems as well as sites. These two facts lead to many particular solutions for a general problem: managing the experiment resources. In this paper we present how LHCb, via the DIRAC interware, addressed such issues. With a renewed Central Information Schema hosting all resources metadata and a Status System (Resource Status System) delivering real time information, the system controls the resources topology, independently of the resource types. The Resource Status System applies data mining techniques against all possible information sources available and assesses the status changes, that are then propagated to the topology description. Obviously, giving full control to such an automated system is not risk-free. Therefore, in order to minimise the probability of misbehavior, a battery of tests has been developed in order to certify the correctness of its assessments. We will demonstrate the performance and efficiency of such a system in terms of cost reduction and reliability.

In such situations, it is often resorted to multi-modal testing, where complementary and overlapping information from different NDT techniques are combined for a more comprehensive evaluation. Multi-modal material and defect characterization is an interesting task which involves several diverse fields of research, including signal and image processing, statistics and data mining The fusion of different modalities may improve quantitative nondestructive evaluation by effectively exploiting the augmented set of multi-sensor information about the material. It is the redundant information in particular, whose quantification is expected to lead to increased reliability and robustness of the inspection results. There are different systematic approaches to data fusion, each with its specific advantages and drawbacks. In our contribution, these will be discussed in the context of nondestructive materials testing. A practical study adopting a high-level scheme for the fusion of Eddy Current, GMR and Thermography measurements on a reference metallic specimen with built-in grooves will be presented. Results show that fusion is able to outperform the best single sensor regarding detection specificity, while retaining the same level of sensitivity.

Management	RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT	Over the last decade, there has been interest in presenting information fusion solutions to the user and ways to incorporate visualization, interaction, and command and control. In this paper, we explore Decisions-to-Data (D2D) in information fusion design: (1) sensing: from data to information (D2I) processing, (2) reporting: from human computer interaction (HCI) visualizations to user refinement (H2U), and (3) disseminating: from collected to resourced (C2R) information management. D2I supports net-centric intelligent situation awareness that includes processing of information from non-sensor resources for mission effectiveness. H2U reflects that completely automated systems are not realizable requiring Level 5 user refinement for efficient decision making. Finally, C2R moves from immediate data collection to fusion of information over an enterprise (e.g., data mining, database queries and storage, and source analysis for pedigree). By using D2I, H2U, and C2R concepts, they serve as informative themes for future complex information fusion interoperability standards, integration of man and machines, and efficient networking for distribution user situation understanding.

However the majority of such research is based on the assumption that there is enough resolution so that the subject's face can be resolved. Hence the majority of the research is actually in the face recognition and facial feature area. A gap exists for gender classification under challenging operating conditions-different seasonal conditions, different clothing, etc.-and when the subject's face cannot be resolved due to lack of resolution. The Seasonal Weather and Gender (SWAG) Database is a novel database that contains subjects walking through a scene under operating conditions that span a calendar year. This paper exploits a subset of that database-the SWAG One dataset-using data mining techniques, traditional classifiers (ex. Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, etc.) and traditional (canny edge detection, etc.) and non-traditional (height/width ratios, etc.) feature extractors to achieve high correct gender classification rates (greater than 85%). Another novelty includes exploiting frame differentials.

Based on the Apriori-alike process, the proposed algorithm uses the independent pruning strategy to mine the fuzzy sequential patterns, which could enhance the efficiency of the algorithm. Then, the optimal values of the process variables are determined by a searching method with the mined sequential patterns. The improved fuzzy sequential pattern support and the fuzzy sequential pattern confidence are adopted to ensure the accuracy of the mined sequential patterns. Moreover, the sliding time window technique is used to ensure the completeness of mining results. The experimental results for parameters optimization of ball mill pulverizing system also verify that the proposed algorithm could determine the optimal values correctly and the running time is not long. In addition, the proposed algorithm has been put into practice successfully and the statistic data show that the pulverizing capability of ball mill pulverizing system is increased and the energy consumption would be reduced.

J	Zimmermann, A				Zimmermann, Albrecht			Understanding episode mining techniques: Benchmarking on diverse, realistic, artificial data	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Pattern mining; episode mining; data generation; quality evaluation	FREQUENT EPISODES	Frequent episode mining has been proposed as a data mining task for recovering sequential patterns from temporal data sequences and several approaches have been introduced over the last fifteen years. These techniques have however never been compared against each other in a large scale comparison, mainly because the existing real life data is prevented from entering the public domain by non-disclosure agreements. We perform such a comparison for the first time. To get around the problem of proprietary data, we employ a data generator based on a number of real life observations and capable of generating data that mimics real life data at our disposal. Artificial data offers the additional advantage that the underlying patterns are known, which is typically not the case for real life data. Thus, we can evaluate for the first time the ability of mining approaches to recover patterns that are embedded in noise. Our experiments indicate that temporal constraints are more important in affecting the effectiveness of episode mining than occurrence semantics. They also indicate that recovering underlying patterns when several phenomena are present at the same time is rather difficult and that there is need to develop better significance measures and techniques for dealing with sets of episodes.

However, focusing on the efficiency and scalability of these algorithms to deal with time series data has come at the expense of losing the usability and effectiveness of clustering. In this paper a new multi-step approach is proposed to improve the accuracy of clustering of time series data. In the first step, time series data are clustered approximately. Then, in the second step, the built clusters are split into sub-clusters. Finally, sub-clusters are merged in the third step. In contrast to existing approaches, this method can generate accurate clusters based on similarity in shape in very large time series datasets. The accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated using various published datasets in different domains.

Particularly, we need to filter queries related to non-work activities. We show that, in the case of technical support agents, 78.7% of personal queries can be filtered using a words-as-features Maximum Entropy approach, while losing only 9.3% of the business related queries. Further improvements can be expected when running a data mining algorithm on the queries and when filtering private information from its output.

However, it may present too many sequential patterns to users, which makes it difficult for users to comprehend the results. As a solution, it was proposed to mine maximal sequential patterns, a compact representation of the set of sequential patterns, which is often several orders of magnitude smaller than the set of all sequential patterns. However, the task of mining maximal patterns remains computationally expensive. To address this problem, we introduce a vertical mining algorithm named VMSP (Vertical mining of Maximal Sequential Patterns). It is to our knowledge the first vertical mining algorithm for mining maximal sequential patterns. An experimental study on five real datasets shows that VMSP is up to two orders of magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art algorithm.

Therefore, they follow a 'one-size-fits-all' strategy which usually results in an inefficient solution and consequently leads to over-anonymization and information loss. We propose a Task Oriented Privacy (TOP) model and its corresponding software system which incorporates the ultimate usage of the data into the privacy preserving data mining and data publishing process. Our model allows the data recipient to perform privacy preserving data mining including data pre-processing using metadata. It also provides an intelligent privacy preserving data publishing technique guided by feature selection and personalized privacy preferences.

Based on the technique of MRI (MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging) T2 Mapping, through computer image processing, feature extraction, calculation and analysis via constructing a classifier, an effective computer-aided diagnosis method for knee OA was created to assist doctors in their accurate, timely and convenient detection of potential risk of OA. In order to evaluate this method, a total of 1380 data from the MRI images of 46 samples of knee joints were collected. These data were then modeled through linear regression on an offline general platform by the use of the ImageJ software, and a map of the physical parameter T2 was reconstructed. After the image processing, the T2 values of ten regions in the WORMS (WORMS: Whole-organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score) areas of the articular cartilage were extracted to be used as the eigenvalues in data mining. Then, a RBF (RBF: Radical Basis Function) network classifier was built to classify and identify the collected data. The classifier exhibited a final identification accuracy of 75%, indicating a good result of assisting diagnosis. Since the knee OA classifier constituted by a weights-directly-determined RBF neural network didn't require any iteration, our results demonstrated that the optimal weights, appropriate center and variance could be yielded through simple procedures. Furthermore, the accuracy for both the training samples and the testing samples from the normal group could reach 100%. Finally, the classifier was superior both in time efficiency and classification performance to the frequently used classifiers based on iterative learning. Thus it was suitable to be used as an aid to computer-aided diagnosis of early knee OA.

Problems such as low rate of accuracy and poor self-adaptability still exist in traditional diagnosis. In order to solve these problems, an AdaBoost-SVM classification algorithm, combined with the cluster boundary sampling preprocessing techniques (CBS-AdaBoost-SVM), is proposed in this paper for the early diagnosis of breast cancer. The algorithm uses machine learning method to diagnose the unknown image data. Moreover, not all of the characteristics play positive roles for classification. To address this issue the paper delete redundant features by using Rough set attribute reduction algorithm based on the genetic algorithm (GA). The effectiveness of the proposed methods are examined on DDSM by calculating its accuracy, confusion matrix, and receiver operating characteristic curves, which give important clues to the physicians for early diagnosis of breast cancer.

By collecting a large set of geo-located tweets characterizing a specific urban area over time, we semantically enrich the available tweets with information about its author - i.e. a resident or a tourist - and the purpose of the movement - i.e. the activity performed in each place. We exploit mobility data mining techniques together with social network analysis methods to aggregate similar trajectories thus pointing out hot spots of activities and flows of people together with their variations over time. We apply and validate the proposed trajectory mining approaches to a large set of trajectories built from the geo-positioned tweets gathered in Barcelona during the Mobile World Congress 2012 (MWC2012), one of the greatest events that affected the city in 2012.

Hong et al. proposed an efficient incremental mining algorithm for handling newly inserted transactions by using the concept of pre-large itemsets. The algorithm aimed to reduce the need to rescan the original database and also cut maintenance costs. Recently, Lin et al. proposed the Pre-FUFP algorithm to handle new transactions more efficiently, and make it easier to Update the FP-tree. However, frequent itemsets must be mined from the FP-growth algorithm. In this paper, we propose a Pre-FUT algorithm (Fast-Update algorithm using the Trie data structure and the concept of pre-large itemsets), which not only builds and updates the trie structure when new transactions are inserted, but also mines all the frequent itemsets easily from the tree. Experimental results show the good performance of the proposed algorithm.

Although location data obtained from GPS-equipped devices have promising applications, those GPS points are usually not uniformly distributed in two-dimensional space. As a result, substantial insights might be missed by using data mining algorithms that discover admissible or rectangular areas under the assumption that the GPS data points are distributed uniformly. The proposed algorithm composes transitively connected groups of irregular meshes that have locally maximized confidence. There is thus no need to assume the uniformity, which enables the discovery of areas not limited to a certain class of shapes. Iterative removal of the meshes in accordance with the local maximum property enables the algorithm to perform 50 times faster than state-of-the-art ones.

However, existing approaches to this problem do not perform as well when the number of nodes or dimensions is scaled up. In this paper, we present greedy filtering, an efficient and scalable algorithm for finding an approximate k-nearest neighbor graph by filtering node pairs whose large value dimensions do not match at all. In order to avoid skewness in the results and guarantee a time complexity of O(n), our algorithm chooses essentially a fixed number of node pairs as candidates for every node. We also present a faster version of greedy filtering based on the use of inverted indices for the node prefixes. We conduct extensive experiments in which we (i) compare our approaches to the state-of-the-art algorithms in seven different types of datasets, and (ii) adopt other algorithms in related fields (similarity join, top-k similarity join and similarity search fields) to solve this problem and evaluate them. The experimental results show that greedy filtering guarantees a high level of accuracy while also being much faster than other algorithms for large amounts of high-dimensional data.

Recently, ensemble pruning techniques have attracted significant attention in the machine learning and the data mining community. Unlike previous heuristic approaches, in this paper we formalize the ensemble pruning problem as a function maximization problem to strike an optimal balance between quality of classifiers and diversity within the subset. Firstly, a quality and pairwise diversity combined framework is proposed and the function is proved to be submodular. Furthermore, we propose a submodular and monotonic function which is the composition of both quality and entropy diversity. Based on the theoretical analysis, although this maximization problem is still NP-hard, the greedy search algorithm with approximation guarantee of factor 1-1/e is employed to get a near-optimal solution. Through the extensive experiments on 36 real datasets, our empirical studies demonstrate that our proposed approaches are capable of achieving superior performance and better efficiency.

A reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) query finds the objects having a given query object as its nearest neighbor. RNN queries find applications in data mining, marketing analysis, and decision making. Most previous research on RNN queries over trajectory databases assume that the data are certain. In realistic scenarios, however, trajectories are inherently uncertain due to measurement errors or time-discretized sampling. In this paper, we study RNN queries in databases of uncertain trajectories. We propose two types of RNN queries based on a well established model for uncertain spatial temporal data based on stochastic processes, namely the Markov model. To the best of our knowledge our work is the first to consider RNN queries on uncertain trajectory databases in accordance with the possible worlds semantics. We include an extensive experimental evaluation on both real and synthetic data sets to verify our theoretical results.

Informally, a frequent pattern is said to be periodic-frequent if it appears at a regular interval specified by the user (i.e., periodically) in a database. A pattern-growth algorithm, called PFP-growth, has been proposed in the literature to discover the patterns. This algorithm constructs a tid-list for a pattern and performs a complete search on the tid-list to determine whether the corresponding pattern is a periodic-frequent or a non-periodic-frequent pattern. In very large databases, the tid-list of a pattern can be very long. As a result, the task of performing a complete search over a pattern's tid-list can make the pattern mining a computationally expensive process. In this paper, we have made an effort to reduce the computational cost of mining the patterns. In particular, we apply greedy search on a pattern's tid-list to determine the periodic interestingness of a pattern. The usage of greedy search facilitate us to prune the non-periodic-frequent patterns with a sub-optimal solution, while finds the periodic-frequent patterns with the global optimal solution. Thus, reducing the computational cost of mining the patterns without missing any knowledge pertaining to the periodic-frequent patterns. We introduce two novel pruning techniques, and extend them to improve the performance of PFP-growth. We call the algorithm as PFP-growth++.

As a result, in the past decade we have witnessed unprecedented increase of trajectory data both in volume and variety. With some attributes such as variable lengths, uncontrolled quality, high redundancy and uncertainty and so on, trajectory data challenge the traditional methodologies and practices in many research areas including data storage and indexing, data mining and analytics, information retrieve, etc. Trajectory data management has been attracting numerous research interests from both academia and industry due to its tremendous value and benefits in a variety of critical applications like traffic analysis, fleet management, trip planning, location-based recommendation, etc. In this tutorial, we will talk about the challenges, techniques and open problems with the focus on similarity-based analytics, the foundation of trajectory management, and covering a range of topics from fundamental theory, algorithms to advanced applications.

HSIAO; COUNTER-CURRENT CHROMATOGRAPHY; TANDEM MASS-SPECTROMETRY; SPECIES IDENTIFICATION; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; PREPARATIVE ISOLATION; IN-VITRO; MEMBRANACEUS; HUANGQI; PURIFICATION	Radix Astragali is a popular herb used in traditional Chinese medicine for its proimmune and antidiabetic properties. However, methods are needed to help distinguish Radix Astragali from its varied adulterants. DNA barcoding is a widely applicable molecular method used to identify medicinal plants. Yet, its use has been hampered by genetic distance, base variation, and limitations of the bio-NJ tree. Herein, we report the validation of an integrated analysis method for plant species identification using DNA barcoding that focuses on genetic distance, identification efficiency, inter-and intraspecific variation, and barcoding gap. We collected 478 sequences from six candidate DNA barcodes (ITS2, ITS, psbA-trnH, rbcL, matK, and COI) from 29 species of Radix Astragali and adulterants. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence was demonstrated as the optimal barcode for identifying Radix Astragali and its adulterants. This new analysis method is helpful in identifying Radix Astragali and expedites the utilization and data mining of DNA barcoding.

Concept stability is a popular relevancy measure in FCA. Experimental results of this paper show that high stability of a concept for a context derived from the general population suggests that concepts with the same intent in other samples drawn from the population have also high stability. A new estimate of stability is introduced and studied. It is experimentally shown that the introduced estimate gives a better approximation than the Monte Carlo approach introduced earlier.

However, the DNS log analysis has not been studied except in the area of security until now because the size of the DNS logs is too huge and the logs are scattered in world-wide distributed servers. To resolve these issues, we propose the Localized Big Data Analysis (LBDA) with which data mining techniques are applied to the DNS log. We also perform an experiment using the real logs of the Korea national DNS servers and the result proved the validity of the LBDA. Using the LBDA, the DNS log is used to extract a lot of meaningful information for data-based decision-making by the government and enterprises.

The truth is, I immediately become kind-of skeptical when I see a lot of money flying around: my communist nature pops out and I start seeing flaws everywhere. I was an idealist, back then, which is good. But in that specific case, I was simply wrong. You may say that I am trying to convince myself just because my soul has been sold already (and they didn't even give me the thirty pieces of silver they promised, btw). Nonetheless, I will try to offer you evidences that there are some gems, out there in the data miner's cave, that you yourself may appreciate. Who knows?

It is not very good for analyzing incomplete information. Some successful extended rough set models based on different non-equivalence relations have been proposed. The valued tolerance relation is such an extended model of classical rough set theory. However, the general calculation method of tolerance degree needs to know the prior probability distribution of an information system in advance, and it is also difficult to select a suitable threshold. In this paper, a data-driven valued tolerance relation (DVT) is proposed to solve this problem based on the idea of data-driven data mining. The new calculation method of tolerance degree and the auto-selection method of threshold do not require any prior domain knowledge except the data set. Some properties about the DVT are analyzed. Experiment results show that the DVT can get better and more stable classification results than other extended models of the classical rough set theory.

There have been many theories, such as probability statistics, evidence theory, fuzzy set, rough set, cloud model, etc., to deal with uncertainty information from different perspectives, and they have been applied into obtaining the rules and knowledge from amount of data, for example, data mining, knowledge discovery, machine learning, expert system, etc. Simply, This is a cognitive transformation process from data to knowledge (FDtoK). However, the cognitive transformation process from knowledge to data (FKtoD) is what often happens in human brain, but it is lack of research. As an effective cognition model, cloud model provides a cognitive transformation way to realize both processes of FDtoK and FKtoD via forward cloud transformation (FCT) and backward cloud transformation (BCT). In this paper, the authors introduce the FCT and BCT firstly, and make a depth analysis for the two existing single-step BCT algorithms. We find that these two BCT algorithms lack stability and sometimes are invalid. For this reason we propose a new multi-step backward cloud transformation algorithm based on sampling with replacement (MBCT-SR) which is more precise than the existing methods. Furthermore, the effectiveness and convergence of new method is analyzed in detail, and how to set the parameters m, r appeared in MBCT-SR is also analyzed. Finally, we have error analysis and comparison to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed backward cloud transformation algorithm for some simulation experiments.

In this paper, an in silico search was conducted in order to identify and characterize members of NBS-encoding gene family in the tribe of Triticeae. A final dataset of 199 sequences was obtained by four search methods. Motif analysis confirmed the general structural organization of the NBS domain in cereals, characterized by the presence of the six commonly conserved motifs: P-loop, RNBS-A, Kinase-2, Kinase-3a, RNBS-C and GLPL. We revealed the existence of 11 distinct distribution patterns of these motifs along the NBS domain. Four additional conserved motifs were shown to be significantly present in all 199 sequences. Phylogenetic analyses, based on genetic distance and parsimony, revealed a significant overlap between Triticeae sequences and Coiled coil-Nucleotide binding site-Leucine rich repeat (CNL)-type functional genes from monocotyledons. Furthermore, several Triticeae sequences belonged to clades containing functional homologs from non Triticeae species, which has allowed for these sequences to be functionally assigned. The findings reported, in this study, will provide a strong groundwork for the isolation of candidateR-genes in Triticeae crops and the understanding of their evolution.

Data mining techniques will be used to analyze and present recommendations in a meaningful way to users of SugarCRM. One of the important outputs of the data mining process will be recommendations made to the user that effect KPIs of the business. Data mining can also be used to give users a better understanding of the dynamics of their own business and industry as predictable patterns can emerge from CRM datasets. While the approach and conclusions are general, the proposed strategies in this paper and the implementation are based on a SugarCRM installation. Predictive analytics in conjunction data mining has the potential to further improve reporting mechanisms from SugarCRM.

One of the most relevant aspect of the knowledge extraction is the detection of outliers. Numerous algorithms have been proposed with this purpose. However, not all of them are suitable to deal with very large data sets. In this work, a new approach aimed to detect outliers in very large data sets with a limited execution time is presented. This algorithm visualizes the tuples as N-dimensional particles able to create a potential well around them. Later, the potential created by all the particles is used to discriminate the outliers from the objects composing clusters. Besides, the capacity to be parallelized has been a key point in the design of this algorithm. In this proof-of-concept, the algorithm is tested by using sequential and parallel implementations. The results demonstrate that the algorithm is able to process large data sets with an affordable execution time, so that it overcomes the curse of dimensionality.

Iterated greedy search is a powerful metaheuristic, successfully applied to different optimisation problems, which to our knowledge, has not previously been used for classification rule mining. In this work, we analyse the convenience of using iterated greedy algorithms for the design of rule classification systems.

However, for several domains, the available data is unlabeled and the generation of a class label for each instance may have a high cost. An alternative to reduce this cost is the use of active learning, which selects instances according to a criterion of relevance. Diverse sampling strategies for active learning, following different paradigms, can be found in the literature. However, there is no detailed comparison between these strategies and they are usually evaluated for only one classification technique. In this paper, strategies from different paradigms are experimentally compared using different learning algorithms and datasets. Additionally, a multiclass hypothesis space search called SG-multi is proposed and empirically shown to be feasible. Experimental results show the effectiveness of active learning and which classification techniques are more suitable to which sampling strategies.	[dos Santos, Davi P.; de Carvalho, Andre C. P. L.

The optimal solution of describing a learning problem would be a functional dependency between the data, the learning algorithm's internal specifics and its performance. Unfortunately, a general, restrictionsfree theory on performance of arbitrary artificial learners has not been developed yet. Objective: The objective of this paper is to investigate which function is most appropriately describing the learning curve produced by C4.5 algorithm. Methods: The J48 implementation of the C4.5 algorithm was applied to datasets (n = 121) from publicly available repositories (e.g. UCI) in step wise k-fold cross-validation. First, four different functions (power, linear, logarithmic, exponential) were fit to the measured error rates. Where the fit was statistically significant (n = 86), we measured the average mean squared error rate for each function and its rank. The dependent samples T-test was performed to test whether the differences between mean squared error are significantly different, and Wilcoxon's signed rank test was used to test whether the differences between ranks are significant. Results: The decision trees error rate can be successfully modeled by an exponential function. In a total of 86 datasets, exponential function was a better descriptor of error rate function in 64 of 86 cases, power was best in 13, logarithmic in 3, and linear in 6 out of 86 cases. Average mean squared error across all datasets was 0.052954 for exponential function, and was significantly different at P = 0.001 from power and at P = 0.000 from linear function. The results also show that exponential function's rank is significantly different at any reasonable threshold (P = 0.000) from the rank of any other model. Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with tests performed in the area of human cognitive performance, e.g. with works by Heathcote et al. (2000), who were observing that the exponential function is best describing an individual learner. In our case we did observe an individual learner (C4.5 algorithm) at different tasks. The work can be used to forecast and model the future performance of C4.5 when not all data have been used or there is a need to obtain more data for better accuracy.

The proposed model is based on the generalized inverted Dirichlet distribution which has a more general covariance structure than the inverted Dirichlet that has been widely used recently in several machine learning and data mining applications. The proposed mixture is developed in an elegant way that allows simultaneous clustering and feature selection, and is learned using a fully Bayesian approach via Gibbs sampling. The merits of the proposed approach are demonstrated using a challenging application namely images categorization.

The hybrid model is developed with clustering and classification approaches. Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) is used to cluster the historical variables. The clustered data are then used as inputs to Back-Propagation Neural Network classification. The label dataset having value greater than zero in fire area size are clustered using FCM to produce two categorical clusters, i.e.: Light Burn, and Heavy Burn for its label. On the other hand, fire area label with value zero is clustered as No Burn Area. A Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) is trained based on these data to classify the output (burn area) in three categories, No Burn Area, Light Burn and Heavy Burn. The experiment shows promising results depicting classification size of forest fire with the accuracy of confusion matrix around 97, 50 % and Cohens Kappa 0.954. This research also compares the performance of proposed model with other classification method such as SVM, Naive Bayes, DCT Tree, and K-NN that showed BPNN have best performance.

The IDPS uses a local computational grid to detect malicious behaviors in a real-time manner. Our experimental results show that the IDPS's user identification accuracy is 93%, the accuracy on detecting its internal malicious attempts is up to 99% and the response time is less than 0.45 sec., implying that it can prevent a protected system from internal attacks effectively and efficiently.

Different measurement scales are studied in details and statistical comparison, modeling, and data mining methods are studied based upon using several medical examples. We have presented two ordinal-variables clustering examples, as more challenging variable in analysis, using Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data (WBCD). Ordinal-to-Interval scale conversion example: a breast cancer database of nine 10-level ordinal variables for 683 patients was analyzed by two ordinal-scale clustering methods. The performance of the clustering methods was assessed by comparison with the gold standard groups of malignant and benign cases that had been identified by clinical tests. Results: the sensitivity and accuracy of the two clustering methods were 98% and 96%, respectively. Their specificity was comparable. Conclusion: by using appropriate clustering algorithm based on the measurement scale of the variables in the study, high performance is granted. Moreover, descriptive and inferential statistics in addition to modeling approach must be selected based on the scale of the variables.

Traditional algorithms, such as classification and feature selection under neighborhood rough sets, have been proved to be very effective in real applications. Parallel approach to these traditional algorithms could be a way to take the challenge. This is what we present in this paper, the design of parallel approaches to neighborhood rough sets and the implementation of classification and feature selection. Two optimizing strategies are proposed to improve the performance of the approaches: (1) The distributed cache is used to reduce I/O time. (2) Most of computations are put into the Map phase which helps reduce the overhead of communication. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms scale pretty well and the speedup is getting higher with the increasing size of data.

We adopt a regression approach to predict the helpfulness of book reviews. A high quality subset of reviews is then selected accordingly. Since book review is typically longer and more diverse in content and style, we extract some complicate text features and propose a new way to weight word features.

In this paper, we carried out data mining on some quantitative indicators with influence on the movement of stock index, then we had short-term forecasting of Shanghai Component Stock Index with BP+GA model.

One major contribution of this paper is an updated overview about indicators which are ready for automatic data collection and processing. Following a design science research approach we introduce measures for a consumer side of interactivity and contrast them with a producer's perspective. For this purpose we contrast two ratio measures 'viewed posts prior to a statement' and `viewed posts after a statement' created by a student. In order to evaluate these indicators, we apply them to Pinio, an innovative asynchronous video discussion tool, used in a virtual seminar.

Distortion-Based Heuristic Sensitive Rule Hiding Method - The Greedy Way	MODERN ADVANCES IN APPLIED INTELLIGENCE, IEA/AIE 2014, PT I	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	27th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Other Applications of Applied Intelligent Systems (IEA - AIE)	JUN 03-06, 2014	Kaohsiung, TAIWAN	Chaoyang UnivTechnol, Harbin Inst Technol Univ	Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci	Association rule hiding; privacy preserving data mining; sensitive association rules; side effects		Today, people can use various database techniques to discover useful knowledge from large collections of data. However, people also face the risk of disclosing sensitive information to competitor when the data is shared between different organizations. Thus, there is a balance between the legitimate mining need and protection of confidential knowledge when people release or share data. In this paper, we study the privacy preserving in association rule mining. A new distortion-based method was proposed which hides sensitive rules by removing some items in database so as to reduce the support or confidence of sensitive rules below specified thresholds. Aimed at minimizing side effects, the number of sensitive rules and the number of non-sensitive rules supported by each transaction are utilized to sort the transactions and the candidates which contain most sensitive rules and least non-sensitive rules are selected to modify. Comparative experiments on real datasets showed that the new method can achieve satisfactory results with fewer side effects and data loss.

It provides a foundation for building owners to optimize not only the energy usage but also the operation to respond to the demand signals from smart grid. However, modeling energy consumption in traditional physic-modeling techniques remains a challenge. To address this issue, we present a data-mining-based methodology, as an alternative, for developing data-driven models to predict energy consumption for BEMSs. Following the methodology, we developed data-driven models for predicting energy consumption for a chiller in BEMS by using historic building operation data and weather forecast information. The models were evaluated with unseen data. The experimental results demonstrated that the data-driven models can predict energy consumption for chiller with promising accuracy.

The way to form a team and therefore improve team performance has become an important topic. Limited amount of studies have focused on forecasting team performance based on individual behaviors. If one's future team behavior and performance can be identified, it is beneficial for the process of human resource planning, recruitment, and training. This study aims to use data mining approach on the prediction of team performance and members' interaction based on individual personality traits. Using undergraduates' Big Five personality traits, we established neural network models in order to predict their team performance and members' interaction. We found that neural network can effectively predict team performance with the accuracy rate over 99%. It also correctly predicts members' interaction in more than 72% of cases. Our findings potentially contribute to the development of human resource management academically and practically.

In this paper, the pre-large concept is also adopted for maintaining and updating the FUSP tree. Only large sequences are kept in the built tree structure for reducing computations. The PreFUSP-TREE-MOD maintenance algorithm is proposed to reduce the rescans of the original database due to the pruning properties of pre-large concept. When the number of modified sequences is smaller than the safety bound of the pre-large concept, better results can be obtained by the proposed PreFUSP-TREE-MOD maintenance algorithm for sequence modification in the dynamic database.

This paper introduces a new rough set based classification rule generation algorithm. It has three features: the first is that the new algorithm can be used in inconsistent systems. The second is its ability to calculate the core value without attributes reduction before. The third is that every example gives a rule and the core values are added first in rule generation process. Experimental results indicate that the classification performanceismuch better than the standard rough set, its variants andJRIPPER, a little better thanCBA and KNN, andcompetive to C4.5in terms of 8 measures. The higher performance of the new algorithm may get benefit from its enough higher accuracy rules and having some properties like KNN.
