Oligomerized Pool ENgineering (OPEN) is a recently developed method for engineering C2H2 zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) designed to bind specific DNA sequences with high affinity and specificity in vivo. Because generation of ZFPs using OPEN requires considerable effort, a computational method for identifying the sites in any given gene that are most likely to be successfully targeted by this method is desirable. Results: Analysis of the base composition of experimentally validated ZFP target sites identified important constraints on the DNA sequence space that can be effectively targeted using OPEN. Using alternate encodings to represent ZFP target sites, we implemented Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine classifiers capable of distinguishing "active" targets, i.e., ZFP binding sites that can be targeted with a high rate of success, from those that are "inactive" or poor targets for ZFPs generated using current OPEN technologies. When evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation on a dataset of 135 experimentally validated ZFP target sites, the best Naive Bayes classifier, designated ZiFOpT, achieved overall accuracy of 87% and specificity(+) of 90%, with an ROC AUC of 0.89. When challenged with a completely independent test set of 140 newly validated ZFP target sites, ZiFOpT performance was comparable in terms of overall accuracy (88%) and specificity(+) (92%), but with reduced ROC AUC (0.77). Users can rank potentially active ZFP target sites using a confidence score derived from the posterior probability returned by ZiFOpT. Conclusion: ZiFOpT, a machine learning classifier trained to identify DNA sequences amenable for targeting by OPEN-generated zinc finger arrays, can guide users to target sites that are most likely to function successfully in vivo, substantially reducing the experimental effort required. ZiFOpT is freely available and incorporated in the Zinc Finger Targeter web server (http://bindr.gdcb.iastate.edu/ZiFiT).

Learning Graphical Models for Hypothesis Testing and Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Internatiional Conference on Accoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	MAR, 2008	Las Vegas, NC			Boosting; classification; graphical models; structure learning; tree distributions	BAYESIAN NETWORK CLASSIFIERS; VARIABLE SELECTION; DISTANCE MEASURES; SIGNAL; DISTRIBUTIONS	Sparse graphical models have proven to be a flexible class of multivariate probability models for approximating high-dimensional distributions. In this paper, we propose techniques to exploit this modeling ability for binary classification by discriminatively learning such models from labeled training data, i.e., using both positive and negative samples to optimize for the structures of the two models. We motivate why it is difficult to adapt existing generative methods, and propose an alternative method consisting of two parts. First, we develop a novel method to learn tree-structured graphical models which optimizes an approximation of the log-likelihood ratio. We also formulate a joint objective to learn a nested sequence of optimal forests-structured models. Second, we construct a classifier by using ideas from boosting to learn a set of discriminative trees. The final classifier can interpreted as a likelihood ratio test between two models with a larger set of pair-wise features. We use cross-validation to determine the optimal number of edges in the final model. The algorithm presented in this paper also provides a method to identify a subset of the edges that are most salient for discrimination. Experiments show that the proposed procedure outperforms generative methods such as Tree Augmented Naive Bayes and Chow-Liu as well as their boosted counterparts.	[Tan, Vincent Y.

To overcome the influence of the descending resolution caused by column pollution and the subsequent deterioration of column efficacy at different testing times, we constructed combined peaks by summing the peaks over a specific elution time interval Delta t. On constructing tree classifiers, both the original peaks and the combined peaks were considered. A data set of 75 samples from three grades of the same tobacco brand was used to evaluate our method. Two parameters of the random forest were optimized using out-of-bag error, and the relationship between Delta t and classification rate was investigated. Experiments show that partial least squares discriminant analysis was not suitable because of the overfitting, and the random forest with the combined features performed more accurately than Naive Bayes, support vector machines, bootstrap aggregating and the random forest using only its original features.

J	Huang, CN; Fu, TJ; Chen, HC				Huang, Chunneng; Fu, Tianjun; Chen, Hsinchun			Text-Based Video Content Classification for Online Video-Sharing Sites	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							AUTHORSHIP ATTRIBUTION; RETRIEVAL; WEB; RECOGNITION; IDENTIFICATION; COMMUNITIES; FRAMEWORK; MESSAGES; FEATURES; MIXTURE	With the emergence of Web 2.0, sharing personal content, communicating ideas, and interacting with other online users in Web 2.0 communities have become daily routines for online users. User-generated data from Web 2.0 sites provide rich personal information (e.g., personal preferences and interests) and can be utilized to obtain insight about cyber communities and their social networks. Many studies have focused on leveraging user-generated information to analyze blogs and forums, but few studies have applied this approach to video-sharing Web sites. In this study, we propose a text-based framework for video content classification of online-video sharing Web sites. Different types of user-generated data (e.g., titles, descriptions, and comments) were used as proxies for online videos, and three types of text features (lexical, syntactic, and content-specific features) were extracted. Three feature-based classification techniques (C4.5, Nave Bayes, and Support Vector Machine) were used to classify videos. To evaluate the proposed framework, user-generated data from candidate videos, which were identified by searching user-given keywords on YouTube, were first collected. Then, a subset of the collected data was randomly selected and manually tagged by users as our experiment data. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach was able to classify online videos based on users' interests with accuracy rates up to 87.2%, and all three types of text features contributed to discriminating videos. Support Vector Machine outperformed C4.5 and Naive Bayes techniques in our experiments. In addition, our case study further demonstrated that accurate video-classification results are very useful for identifying implicit cyber communities on video-sharing Web sites.

Many researchers have shown that the hidden Markov model (HMM) and the conditional random field (CRF)-based activity classifiers work well to classify activities in comparison with the widely used nave Bayes-based activity classifier. However, it would not be an exact verdict if a nave Bayes-based activity classifier is properly smoothed. Parameter estimation plays the central role in the performance of a nave Bayes activity classifier. Data sparsity puts substantial challenges in parameter estimation because the sizes of the real-life activity datasets are relatively small. The distribution of the sensors may not be even among the activity classes. Additionally, some of the sensors would appear during testing but would not appear while training. This is called zero-frequency problems which assign zero probability of a sensor for a given activity. To prevent such estimation problems, we propose two smoothing techniques for adjusting the maximum likelihood to produce more precise probability of a sensor given an activity. We performed three experiments using three real-life activity datasets. It is observed that our proposed mechanism yields significant improvement in the accuracy of activity classification in comparison with its existing counterparts. We achieved the class accuracy ranging between 63 and 83.	[Sarkar, A. M.

In order to avoid bias in data interpretation, it would be of advantage for the data analysis to include all available data. A practical challenge in exploratory metabolomics analysis is therefore how to interpret the changes related to unidentified peaks. In this paper, we address the challenge by predicting the class membership of unknown peaks by applying and comparing multiple supervised classifiers to selected lipidomics datasets. The employed classifiers include k-nearest neighbours (k-NN), support vector machines (SVM), partial least squares and discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and Naive Bayes methods which are known to be effective and efficient in predicting the labels for unseen data. Here, the class label predictions are sought for unidentified lipid profiles coming from high throughput global screening in Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (UPLC(TM)/MS) experimental setup. Our investigation reveals that k-NN and SVM classifiers outperform both PLS-DA and Naive Bayes classifiers. Naive Bayes classifier perform poorly among all models and this observation seems logical as lipids are highly co-regulated and do not respect Naive Bayes assumptions of features being conditionally independent given the class. Common label predictions from k-NN and SVM can serve as a good starting point to explore full data and thereby facilitating exploratory studies where label information is critical for the data interpretation.

The theory of rough sets provides a ternary classification method by approximating a set into positive, negative and boundary regions based on an equivalence relation on the universe. In this paper, we propose a naive Bayesian decision-theoretic rough set model, or simply a naive Bayesian rough set (NBRS) model, to integrate these two classification techniques. The conditional probability is estimated based on the Bayes' theorem and the naive probabilistic independence assumption. A discriminant function is defined as a monotonically increasing function of the conditional probability, which leads to analytical and computational simplifications.

J	Yi, X; Zhang, YC				Yi, Xun; Zhang, Yanchun			Privacy-preserving naive Bayes classification on distributed data via semi-trusted mixers	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Privacy-preserving distributed data mining; Classification; Data security		Distributed data mining applications, such as those dealing with health care, finance, counter-terrorism and homeland defense, use sensitive data from distributed databases held by different parties. This comes into direct conflict with an individual's need and right to privacy. It is thus of great importance to develop adequate security techniques for protecting privacy of individual values used for data mining. In this paper, we consider privacy-preserving naive Bayes classifier for horizontally partitioned distributed data and propose a two-party protocol and a multi-party protocol to achieve it. Our multi-party protocol is built on the semi-trusted mixer model, in which each data site sends messages to two semi-trusted mixers, respectively, which run our two-party protocol and then broadcast the classification result. This model facilitates both trust management and implementation. Security analysis has showed that our two-party protocol is a private protocol and our multi-party protocol is a private protocol as long as the two mixers do not conclude. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Our proposal targets spam control implementations on middleboxes. E-mails are first pre-classified (pre-detected) for spam on a per-packet basis. without the need for reassembly. This, in turn, allows fast e-mail class estimation (spam detection) at receiving e-mail servers to support more effective spam handling on both inbound and outbound (relayed) e-mails. In this paper, the naive Bayes classification technique is adapted to support both pre-classification and fast e-mail class estimation, on a per-packet basis. We focus on evaluating the accuracy of spam detection at layer 3, considering the constraints on processing byte-streams over the network, including packet reordering, fragmentation, overlapped bytes, and different packet sizes. Results show that the proposed layer-3 classification technique gives less than 0.5% false positive, which approximately equals the performance attained at layer 7. This shows that classifying e-mails at the packet level could differentiate non-spam from spam with high confidence for a viable spam control implementation on middleboxes. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Nielsen, JD; Rumi, R; Salmeron, A				Nielsen, Jens D.; Rumi, Rafael; Salmeron, Antonio			Supervised classification using probabilistic decision graphs	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article							CLASSIFIERS; TREES	A new model for supervised classification based on probabilistic decision graphs is introduced. A probabilistic decision graph (PDG) is a graphical model that efficiently captures certain context specific independencies that are not easily represented by other graphical models traditionally used for classification, such as the Naive Bayes (NB) or Classification Trees (CT). This means that the PDG model can capture some distributions using fewer parameters than classical models. Two approaches for constructing a PDG for classification are proposed. The first is to directly construct the model from a dataset of labelled data, while the second is to transform a previously obtained Bayesian classifier into a PDG model that can then be refined. These two approaches are compared with a wide range of classical approaches to the supervised classification problem on a number of both real world databases and artificially generated data.

The classifier is first trained on software history data, and then used to predict bugs. Two drawbacks of existing classifier-based bug prediction are potentially insufficient accuracy for practical use, and use of a large number of features. These large numbers of features adversely impact scalability and accuracy of the approach. This paper proposes a feature selection technique applicable to classification-based bug prediction. This technique is applied to predict bugs in software changes, and performance of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers is characterized.	[Shivaji, Shivkumar; Whitehead, E.

Biomarker selection and sample prediction for multi-category disease on MALDI-TOF data	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Joint Meeting of the 7th European Conference on Computational Biology/5th Meeting of the Bioinformatics-Italian-Society	SEP 22-26, 2008	Cagliari, ITALY	Bioinformat Italian Soc			SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CORRECTING OUTPUT CODES; MASS-SPECTROMETRY DATA; CLASSIFICATION; DESIGN	Motivation: Diseases normally progress through several stages. Therefore, biomarkers corresponding to each stage may exist. To deal with such a multi-category problem, including sample stage prediction and biomarker selection, we propose methods for classification and feature selection. The proposed classification method is based on two schemes: error-correcting output coding (ECOC) and pairwise coupling (PWC). The final decision for a test sample prediction is an integration of these two schemes. The biomarker pattern for distinguishing each disease category from another one is achieved by the development of an extended Markov blanket (EMB) feature selection method. Results: In this study, a liver cancer matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) dataset was used, which comprises hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cirrhosis, and healthy spectra. Peak patterns were discovered for distinguishing pairwise categories among the three classes. Importance and reliability of individual peaks were presented by the measurements of certain weight values and frequencies. The classification capability of the proposed approach was compared with classical ECOC, random forest, Naive Bayes, and J48 methods.

With the explosive growth in the number of electronic documents available on the Internet and digital libraries, it is increasingly difficult for library practitioners to categorize both electronic documents and traditional library materials using just a manual approach. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of document categorization at the library setting, more in-depth studies of using automatic document classification methods to categorize library items are required. Machine learning research has advanced rapidly in recent years. However, applying machine learning techniques to improve library practice is still a relatively unexplored area. This paper illustrates the design and development of a machine learning based automatic document classification system to alleviate the manual categorization problem encountered within the library setting. Two supervised machine learning algorithms have been tested. Our empirical tests show that supervised machine learning algorithms in general, and the k-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm in particular, can be used to develop an effective document classification system to enhance current library practice. Moreover, some concrete recommendations regarding how to practically apply the KNN algorithm to develop automatic document classification in a library setting are made. To our best knowledge, this is the first in-depth study of applying the KNN algorithm to automatic document classification based on the widely used LCC classification scheme adopted by many large libraries.

Using implicit information to identify smoking status in smoke-blind medical discharge summaries	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article								As part of the 2006 i2b2 NLP Shared Task, we explored two methods for determining the smoking status of patients from their hospital discharge summaries when explicit smoking terms were present and when those same terms were removed. We developed a simple keyword-based classifier to determine smoking status from de-identified hospital discharge summaries. We then developed a Naive Bayes classifier to determine smoking status from the same records after all smoking-related words had been manually removed (the smoke-blind dataset). The performance of the Naive Bayes classifier was compared with the performance of three human annotators on a subset of the same training dataset (n = 54) and against the evaluation dataset (n = 104 records). The rule-based classifier was able to accurately extract smoking status from hospital discharge summaries when they contained explicit smoking words. On the smoke-blind dataset, where explicit smoking cues are not available, two Naive Bayes systems performed less well than the rule-based classifier, but similarly to three expert human annotators.

The proposed solution is based on the approximation of the joint distribution by a Mixture of Truncated Exponentials (MTE). The construction of the TAN structure requires the use of the conditional mutual information, which cannot be analytically obtained for MTEs. In order to solve this problem, we introduce an unbiased estimator of the conditional mutual information, based on Monte Carlo estimation. We test the performance of the proposed model in a real life context, related to higher education management, where regression problems with discrete and continuous variables are common.

We propose a lexicographic ranker, LexRank, whose rankings are derived not from scores, but from a simple ranking of attribute values obtained from the training data. When using the odds ratio to rank the attribute values we obtain a restricted version of the naive Bayes ranker. We systematically develop the relationships and differences between classification, ranking, and probability estimation, which leads to a novel connection between the Brier score and ROC curves. Combining LexRank with isotonic regression, which derives probability estimates from the ROC convex hull, results in the lexicographic probability estimator LexProb. Both LexRank and LexProb are empirically evaluated on a range of data sets, and shown to be highly effective.

The chief aim of the present work is to compare four machine learning methods to sentiment classification of Chinese review. The corpus is made up of 16000 reviews from website. We investigate the factors which affect the performance: namely feature representation via Word-Based Unigram (WBU), Bigram (WBB) and Chinese CharacterBased Bigram (CBB), Trigram (CBT); feature weighting schemes and feature dimensionality. Experimental evaluations show that performance depends on different settings. As a result, we draw a conclusion that Naive Bayes (NB) classifier obtains the best averaging performance when using WBB, CBT as features with bool weighting under different dimensionality to the task.

A Probabilistic Model for Item-Based Recommender Systems	RECSYS 07: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2007 ACM CONFERENCE ON RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS			English	Proceedings Paper	ACM Conference on Recommender Systems	OCT 19-20, 2007	Minneapolis, MN	ACM SIGCHI, ACM SIGIR, ACM SIGWEB, ACM SIGKDD, ACM SIGART		shopping basket recommendation; naive bayes classifier; performance evaluation; popularity-based ordering		Recommender systems estimate the conditional probability P(x(j)vertical bar x(i)) of item x(j) being bought, given that a customer has already purchased item x(i). While there are different ways of approximating this conditional probability, the expression is generally taken to refer to the frequency of co-occurrence of items in the same basket, or other user-specific item lists, rather than being seen as the co-occurrence of x(j) with x(i) as a proportion of all other items bought alongside x(i). This paper proposes a probabilistic calculus for the calculation of conditionals based on item rather than basket counts. The proposed method has the consequence that items bough together as part of small baskets are more predictive of each other than if they co-occur in large baskets. Empirical results suggests that this may result in better take-up of personalised recommendations.

This approach is based on Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) in which Bayesian or Gaussian networks are applied to the evolution of a population of individuals (i.e. potential solutions to the optimization problem) in order to improve the quality of the individuals of the next generation. Our new approach, called Evolutionary Bayesian Classifier- based Optimization Algorithm (EBCOA), employs Bayesian classifiers instead of Bayesian or Gaussian networks in order to evolve individuals to a fitter population. In brief, EBCOAs are characterized by applying Bayesian classification techniques -usually applied to supervised classification problems-to optimization in continuous domains. We propose and review in this paper different Bayesian classifiers for implementing our EBCOA method, focusing particularly on EBCOAs applying nai ve Bayes, semi-naive Bayes, and tree augmented naive Bayes classifiers. This work presents a deep study on the behavior of these algorithms with classical optimiztion problems in continuous domains. The different parameters used for tuning the performance of the algorithms are discussed, and a comprehensive overview of their influence is provided. We also present experimental results to compare this new method with other state of the art approaches of the evolutionary computation field for continuous domains such as Evolutionary Strategies (ES) and Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs).

J	Venegas, R				Venegas, Rene			Academic text classification based on lexical-semantic content	REVISTA SIGNOS			Spanish	Article						academic discourse; vectorial model; Naive Bayes; Support Vector Machina		The aim of this research is to classify, using and comparing two automatic classification methods, the academic texts included in the PUCV-2006 Corpus belonging to the Fondecyt 1060440 research project. The methods are based on shared lexical-semantic content words present in a corpus of academic texts used in four professional carriers at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso, Chile. The research corpus, nowadays, is constituted by 652 texts with 96.288.874 words. For our purposes, we use a sample of 216 texts (30.886.081 words) divided, as following: 26 used in Construction Engineering, 31 used in Chemistry, 64 used Social Work, and 95 used in Psychology. The classification methods compared in this research are Multinomial Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine, both permits to identify a small group of shared words that permit, according statistical weights, to classify a new text into the four disciplinary areas. The results allows us to establish that Support Vector Machine classify in a efficient way academic texts, with high precision and recall values. With this method we are able to identify automatically the disciplinary domain, with a high percentage of accuracy (93,9%), of a new academic text in a query. We project to use this method as part of a more detailed multidimensional analysis of the PUCV-2006 Corpus.

J	Abellan, J				Abellan, Joaquin			Application of uncertainty measures on credal sets on the naive Bayesian classifier	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						imprecise probabilities; imprecise Dirichlet model; uncertainty measures; maximum entropy; classification; naive Bayesian classifier	MULTINOMIAL DATA; UPPER ENTROPY	The naive Bayes classifier is known to obtain good results with a simple procedure. The method is based on the independence of the attribute variables given the variable to be classified. In real databases, where this hypothesis is not verified, this classifier continues to give good results. In order to improve the accuracy of the method, various works have been carried out in an attempt to reconstruct the set of the attributes and to join them so that there is independence between the new sets although the elements within each set are dependent. These methods are included in the ones known as semi-naive Bayes classifiers. In this article, we present an application of uncertainty measures on closed and convex sets of probability distributions, also called credal sets, in classification. We represent the information obtained from a database by a set of probability intervals ( a credal set) via the imprecise Dirichlet model and we use uncertainty measures on credal sets in order to reconstruct the set of attributes, such as those mentioned, which shall enable us to improve the result of the naive Bayes classifier in a satisfactory way.

An immunological filter for spam	ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMS, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Artificial Immune Systems	SEP 04-06, 2006	Oeiras, PORTUGAL	Univ Libre Bruxelles, RIDIA Lab, Inst Gulbenkian Cienc				Spam messages are continually filling email boxes of practically every Web user. To deal with this growing problem, the development of high-performance filters to block those unsolicited messages is strongly required. An Antibody Network, more precisely SRABNET (Supervised Real-Valued Antibody Network), is proposed as an alternative filter to detect spam. The model of the antibody network is generated automatically from the training dataset and evaluated on unseen messages. We validate this approach using a public corpus, called PU1, which has a large collection of encrypted personal e-mail messages containing legitimate messages and spam. Finally, we compared the performance with the well known naive Bayes filter using some performances indexes that will be presented.

J	Zhou, L; Shi, Y; Feng, JJ; Sears, A				Zhou, L; Shi, Y; Feng, JJ; Sears, A			Data mining for detecting errors in dictation speech recognition	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING			English	Article						document retrieval; speech data mining; speech recognition	NETWORKS	The efficiency promised by a dictation speech recognition (DSR) system is lessened by the need for correcting recognition errors. Error detection is the precursor of error correction. Developing effective techniques for error detection can thus lead to improved error correction. Current research on error detection has focused mainly on transcription and/or domain-specific speech. Error detection in DSR has been studied less. We propose data mining models for detecting errors in DSR. Instead of relying on internal parameters from DSR systems, we propose a loosely coupled approach to error detection based on features extracted from the DSR output. The features mainly came from two sources: confidence scores and linguistics parsing. Link grammar was innovatively applied to error detection. Three data mining techniques, including Naive Bayes, neural networks, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), were evaluated on 5M DSR corpora. The experimental results showed that significant performance was achieved in that F-measures for error detection ranged from 55.3 % to 62.5 %.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have been proven to be very efficient in general data mining tasks. We explore their capability for the gene versus protein name disambiguation task. Results: We incorporated into the conventional SVM a weighting scheme based on distances of context words from the word to be disambiguated. This weighting scheme increased the performance of SVMs by five percentage points giving performance better than 85% as measured by the area under ROC curve and outperformed the Weighted Additive Classifier, which also incorporates the weighting, and the Naive Bayes classifier. Conclusion: We show that the performance of SVMs can be improved by the proposed weighting scheme. Furthermore, our results suggest that in this study the increase of the classification performance due to the weighting is greater than that obtained by selecting the underlying classifier or the kernel part of the SVM.

One version, called multi-variate Bernoulli or binary independence model, uses binary word occurrence vectors, while the multinomial model uses word frequency counts. Many publications cite this difference as the main reason for the superior performance of the multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. We argue that this is not true. We show that when all word frequency information is eliminated from the document vectors, the multinomial Naive Bayes model performs even better. Moreover, we argue that the main reason for the difference in performance is the way that negative evidence, i.e. evidence from words that do not occur in a document, is incorporated in the model. Therefore, this paper aims at a better understanding and a clarification of the difference between the two probabilistic models of Naive Bayes.

In many applications, however, a probability estimation tree (PET) with accurate probability estimates is desirable. Some researchers ascribe the poor probability estimates of decision trees to the decision tree learning algorithms. To our observation, however, the representation also plays an important role. Indeed, the representation of decision trees is fully expressive theoretically, but it is often impractical to learn such a representation with accurate probability estimates from limited training data. In this paper, we extend decision trees to represent a joint distribution and conditional independence, called conditional independence trees (CITrees), which is a more suitable model for PETs. We propose a novel algorithm for learning CITrees, and our experiments show that the CITree algorithm outperforms C4.5 and naive Bayes significantly in classification accuracy.

WebDoc constructs a knowledge base from the training data and then classifies the documents based on information in the knowledge base. One of the classification algorithms used in WebDoc is based on Bayes' theorem from probability, theory. This paper focuses upon three aspects of this approach: different event models for the naive Bayes method, different probability smoothing methods, and different feature selection methods. In this paper, we report the performance of each method in terms of recall, precision, and F-measures. Experimental results show that the WebDoc system can classify Web documents effectively and efficiently.

This classifier is based on the not always realistic assumption that class-conditional distributions can be factorized in the product of their marginal densities. On the other side, one of the most common ways of estimating the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) representation for a given random vector consists in minimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance between the joint density and the product of the marginal densities (mutual information). From this that ICA provides a representation where the independence assumption can be held on stronger grounds. In this paper we propose class-conditional ICA as a method that provides an adequate representation where Naive Bayes is the classifier of choice. Experiments on two public databases are performed in order to confirm this hypothesis.

We constructed and measured performance of three classifiers for the detection of cases of acute gastrointestinal syndrome of public health significance: one used ICD-9-coded ED diagnosis as input data; the other two used free-text triage diagnosis. We measured the performance of these classifiers against the expert classification of cases based on review of ED reports. The sensitivity of the ICD-9-code classifier was 0.32, and the specificity was 0.99. The sensitivity of a naive Bayes classifier using triage diagnoses was 0.63, the specificity was 0. 94, and the area under the ROC curve was 0.82. A bigram Bayes classifier had sensitivity 0.38, specificity 0.94, and area under the ROC of 0.69. We conclude that a naive Bayes classifier of free-text triage diagnosis data provides more sensitive and earlier detection of cases of acute gastrointestinal syndrome than either a bigram Bayes classifier or an ICD-9 code classifier. The sensitivity achieved should be sufficient for syndromic surveillance system designed to detect moderate to large epidemics.

Documents are represented as association-wordvectors that include a few words instead of single words. The focus in this paper is the association rule in reduction of a high dimensional feature space. The accuracy and recall of document classification depend on the number of words for composing association words, confidence, and support at Apriori algorithm. We show how confidence, support, and the number of words for composing association words at Apriori algorithm are selected efficiently. We have used Naive Bayes classifier on text data using proposed feature-vector document representation. By experiment for categorizing documents, we have proved that feature selection method of association word mining is more efficient than information gain and document frequency.

The analyser uses features extracted from 6 EEG channels as inputs and predicts the probabilities that the sleeping subject is either awake, in deep sleep or in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These probability estimates are provided for different temporal resolutions down to I second. The architecture uses a "divide and conquer" strategy, where the decisions of simple experts are fused by what is usually refered to as "naive Bayes" classification. In order to show that the proposed method provides viable means for sleep analysis, we present some results obtained from recordings of good and bad sleep and the corresponding manual scorings.

Here we propose an approach to object recognition that facilitates the transition from recognition to understanding. The proposed approach embraces the synergistic spirit of soft computing, exploiting the global search powers of genetic programming to determine fuzzy probabilistic models. It begins by segmenting the images into regions using standard image processing approaches, which are subsequently classified using a discovered fuzzy Cartesian granule feature classifier. Understanding is made possible through the transparent and succinct nature of the discovered models. The recognition of roads in images is taken as an illustrative problem in the vision domain. The discovered fuzzy models while providing high levels of accuracy (97%), also provide understanding of the problem domain through the transparency of the learnt models. The learning step in the proposed approach is compared with other techniques such as decision trees, naive Bayes and neural networks using a variety of performance criteria such as accuracy, understandability and efficiency.

J	Todorovski, L; Dzeroski, S				Todorovski, Ljupco; Dzeroski, Saso			Combining Multiple Models with Meta Decision Trees	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE <D>			English	Article								The paper introduces meta decision trees (MDTs), a novel method for combining multiple models. Instead of giving a prediction, MDT leaves specify which model should be used to obtain a prediction. We present an algorithm for learning MDTs based on the C4.5 algorithm for learning ordinary decision trees (ODTs). An extensive experimental evaluation of the new algorithm is performed on twenty-one data sets, combining models generated by five learning algorithms: two algorithms for learning decision trees, a rule learning algorithm, a nearest neighbor algorithm and a naive Bayes algorithm. In terms of performance, MDTs combine models better than voting and stacking with ODTs. In addition, MDTs are much more concise than ODTs used for stacking and are thus a step towards comprehensible combination of multiple models.

J	Oard, DW; Resnik, P				Oard, DW; Resnik, P			Support for interactive document selection in cross-language information retrieval	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article								As digital libraries grow to global scale, the provision of interactive access to content in many languages will become increasingly important. In systems that support query-based searching, the presence of multilingual content will affect both the search technology itself and the user interface components that support query formulation, document selection and query refinement. This article describes the interactions among these components and presents a practical way of evaluating the adequacy of the selection interface. A categorization-based model for the user's selection process is presented and an experimental methodology suitable for obtaining process centered results in this context is developed. The methodology is applied to assess the adequacy of a selection interface in which multiple candidate translations for a term can be simultaneously presented. The results indicate that the modeled selection process is somewhat less effective when users are presented with multi-translation glosses from Japanese to English rather than materials generated originally in English, but that users with access to the gloss translations substantially outperform a Naive Bayes classification algorithm.

This imposes a burden on both the system storage of the site and the network traffic neat the site. It thus comes to require the search process to be distributed. Recently, more and more Web sites provide the ability to search their local collection of Web pages. Query brokering systems are used to direct queries to the promising sites and merge the results from these sites. Creation of meta-information of the sites plays an important role in such systems. In this article, we introduce an ontology-based web site mapping method used to produce conceptual meta-information, the Vector Space approach, and present a serial of experiments comparing it with Naive-Bayes approach. We found that the Vector Space approach produces better accuracy in ontology-based web site mapping.

Due to high cost and laboriousness. in experimental tests, it is necessary to develop robust in silico methods to predict chemical mutagenicity. In this paper, a comprehensive database containing 7617 diverse compounds, including 4252 mutagens and 3365 nonmutagens, was constructed. On the basis. of this data set, high predictive models were then built using five machine learning methods, namely support Vector machine (SVM), C4.5 decision free (C4.5 DT), artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and naive Bayes (NB), along with five fingerprints, namely CDK fingerprint (FP), Estate fingerprint (Estate), MACCS keys.(MACCS) PubChem fingerprint (PubChem) and Substructure fingerprint (SubFP). Performances were measured by cross Validation and an external test set containing 831 diverse chemicals. Information.:Information gain and substructure analysis were used to interpret the models. The accuracies of fivefold Cross Validation were from 0.808 to 0.841 for top five Models. The, range of accuracy:for the,external validation set was from 0.904 to 0.980, which outperformed that of Toxtree., Three models (PubChem-kNN, MACCS-kNN, and PubChem-SVM) showed high and reliable,predictive accuracy. for the mutagens and nonmutagens and, hence, could he used in prediction of chemical Ames Mutagenicity:	[Xu, Congying; Cheng, Feixiong; Chen, Lei; Du, Zheng; Li, Weihua; Liu, Guixia; Lee, Philip W.; Tang, Yun] E China Univ Sci & Technol, Shanghai Key Lab New Drug Design, Sch Pharm, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Liu, Guixia] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Drug Res, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China	Liu, GX (reprint author), E China Univ Sci & Technol, Shanghai Key Lab New Drug Design, Sch Pharm, 130 Meilong Rd, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.	gxliu@ecust.edu.cn; ytang234@ecust.edu.cn	Cheng, Feixiong/D-9922-2013; LI, Weihua/G-7190-2011	Cheng, Feixiong/0000-0002-1251-3116; 	863 Project [2012AA020308]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [WY1113007]; State Key Laboratory of Drug Research [SIMM1203KF-13]; Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology [11DZ2260600]	We gratefully acknowledged the financial supports from the 863 Project (Grant 2012AA020308), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (WY1113007), the State Key Laboratory of Drug Research (Grant SIMM1203KF-13), and the Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology (Grant 11DZ2260600).

An unsupervised approach to feature discretization and selection	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Feature discretization; Feature quantization; Feature selection; Linde-Buzo-Gray algorithm; Sparse data; Support vector machines; Naive Bayes; k-nearest neighbor	RANDOM SUBSPACE METHOD; MICROARRAY DATA; GENE SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; CANCER; INFORMATION; REDUNDANCY; RELEVANCE	Many learning problems require handling high dimensional datasets with a relatively small number of instances. Learning algorithms are thus confronted with the curse of dimensionality, and need to address it in order to be effective. Examples of these types of data include the bag-of-words representation in text classification problems and gene expression data for tumor detection/classification. Usually, among the high number of features characterizing the instances, many may be irrelevant (or even detrimental) for the learning tasks. It is thus clear that there is a need for adequate techniques for feature representation, reduction, and selection, to improve both the classification accuracy and the memory requirements. In this paper, we propose combined unsupervised feature discretization and feature selection techniques, suitable for medium and high-dimensional datasets. The experimental results on several standard datasets, with both sparse and dense features, show the efficiency of the proposed techniques as well as improvements over previous related techniques.

A comparative study of Naive Bayes classifier and Bayes net classifier for fault diagnosis of monoblock centrifugal pump using wavelet analysis	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Wavelet analysis; Naive Bayes; Bayes net	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; DECISION TREE; ROTATING MACHINERY; FEATURE-SELECTION; FUZZY CLASSIFIER; NEURAL-NETWORKS; ROLLER BEARING; SYSTEM; TRANSFORM	In most of the industries related to mechanical engineering, the usage of pumps is high. Hence, the system which takes care of the continuous running of the pump becomes essential. In this paper, a vibration based condition monitoring system is presented for monoblock centrifugal pumps as it plays relatively critical role in most of the industries. This approach has mainly three steps namely feature extraction, classification and comparison of classification. In spite of availability of different efficient algorithms for fault detection, the wavelet analysis for feature extraction and Naive Bayes algorithm and Bayes net algorithm for classification is taken and compared. This paper presents the use of Naive Bayes algorithm and Bayes net algorithm for fault diagnosis through discrete wavelet features extracted from vibration signals of good and faulty conditions of the components of centrifugal pump. The classification accuracies of different discrete wavelet families were calculated and compared to find the best wavelet for the fault diagnosis of the centrifugal pump. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Lord, D; Kuo, PF				Lord, Dominique; Kuo, Pei-Fen			Examining the effects of site selection criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of traffic safety countermeasures	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Regression-to-the-mean; Biased estimate; Safety index; Site selection effects; Before-after study; Empirical Bayes method	BIAS-BY-SELECTION; REGRESSION; ACCIDENTS; INJURIES	The primary objective of this paper is to describe how site selection effects can influence the safety effectiveness of treatments. More specifically, the goal is to quantify the bias for the safety effectiveness of a treatment as a function of different entry criteria as well as other factors associated with crash data, and propose a new method to minimize this bias when a control group is not available. The study objective was accomplished using simulated data. The proposed method documented in this paper was compared to the four most common types of before-after studies: the Naive, using a control group (CG), the empirical Bayes (EB) method based on the method of moment (EBMM), and the EB method based on a control group (EBCG). Five scenarios were examined: a direct comparison of the methods, different dispersion parameter values of the Negative Binomial model, different sample sizes, different values of the index of safety effectiveness (theta), and different levels of uncertainty associated with the index. Based on the simulated scenarios (also supported theoretically), the study results showed that higher entry criteria, larger values of the safety effectiveness, and smaller dispersion parameter values will cause a larger selection bias. Furthermore, among all methods evaluated, the Naive and the EBMM methods are both significantly affected by the selection bias. Using a control group, or the EBCG, can mutually eliminate the site selection bias, as long as the characteristics of the control group (truncated data for the CG method or the non-truncated sample population for the EBCG method) are exactly the same as for the treatment group. In practice, finding datasets for the control group with the exact same characteristics as for the treatment group may not always be feasible. To overcome this problem, the method proposed in this study can be used to adjust the Naive estimator of the index of safety effectiveness, even when the mean and dispersion parameter are not properly estimated.

Non-invasive automated 3D thyroid lesion classification in ultrasound: A class of ThyroScan (TM) systems	ULTRASONICS			English	Article						Computer Aided Diagnosis; Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound; High Resolution Ultrasound; Texture; Thyroid lesion	CONTRAST-ENHANCED ULTRASOUND; LOCAL BINARY PATTERNS; FRACTAL DIMENSION; TEXTURE CLASSIFICATION; NODULES; BENIGN; CARCINOMA; IMAGES; ELASTOGRAPHY; MALIGNANCY	Ultrasound-based thyroid nodule characterization into benign and malignant types is limited by subjective interpretations. This paper presents a Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) technique that would present more objective and accurate classification and further would offer the physician a valuable second opinion. In this paradigm, we first extracted the features that quantify the local changes in the texture characteristics of the ultrasound off-line training images from both benign and malignant nodules. These features include: Fractal Dimension (FD), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Fourier Spectrum Descriptor (FS), and Laws Texture Energy (LTE). The resulting feature vectors were used to build seven different classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Sugeno Fuzzy, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Network (RBPNN), and Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC). Subsequently, the feature vector-classifier combination that results in the maximum classification accuracy was used to predict the class of a new on-line test thyroid ultrasound image. Two data sets with 3D Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) and 3D High Resolution Ultrasound (HRUS) images of 20 nodules (10 benign and 10 malignant) were used. Fine needle aspiration biopsy and histology results were used to confirm malignancy. Our results show that a combination of texture features coupled with SVM or Fuzzy classifiers resulted in 100% accuracy for the HRUS dataset, while GMM classifier resulted in 98.1% accuracy for the CEUS dataset. Finally, for each dataset, we have proposed a novel integrated index called Thyroid Malignancy Index (TMI) using the combination of FD, LBP, LTE texture features, to diagnose benign or malignant nodules. This index can help clinicians to make a more objective differentiation of benign/malignant thyroid lesions. We have compared and benchmarked the system with existing methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Classification algorithms for predicting sleepiness and sleep apnea severity	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						correlation; distribution; mutual information	EPWORTH SLEEPINESS; HEART HEALTH; LATENCY TEST; DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; RISK-FACTORS; SCALE; ASSOCIATION; PREVALENCE; STROKE; ADULTS	Identifying predictors of subjective sleepiness and severity of sleep apnea are important yet challenging goals in sleep medicine. Classification algorithms may provide insights, especially when large data sets are available. We analyzed polysomnography and clinical features available from the Sleep Heart Health Study. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the apneahypopnea index were the targets of three classifiers: k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes and support vector machine algorithms. Classification was based on up to 26 features including demographics, polysomnogram, and electrocardiogram (spectrogram). Naive Bayes was best for predicting abnormal Epworth class (010 versus 1124), although prediction was weak: polysomnogram features had 16.7% sensitivity and 88.8% specificity; spectrogram features had 5.3% sensitivity and 96.5% specificity. The support vector machine performed similarly to naive Bayes for predicting sleep apnea class (05 versus >5): 59.0% sensitivity and 74.5% specificity using clinical features and 43.4% sensitivity and 83.5% specificity using spectrographic features compared with the naive Bayes classifier, which had 57.5% sensitivity and 73.7% specificity (clinical), and 39.0% sensitivity and 82.7% specificity (spectrogram). Mutual information analysis confirmed the minimal dependency of the Epworth score on any feature, while the apneahypopnea index showed modest dependency on body mass index, arousal index, oxygenation and spectrogram features. Apnea classification was modestly accurate, using either clinical or spectrogram features, and showed lower sensitivity and higher specificity than common sleep apnea screening tools. Thus, clinical prediction of sleep apnea may be feasible with easily obtained demographic and electrocardiographic analysis, but the utility of the Epworth is questioned by its minimal relation to clinical, electrocardiographic, or polysomnographic features.

An ensemble of filters and classifiers for microarray data classification	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Feature selection; Ensemble methods for classification; Microarray data sets	GENE-EXPRESSION; FEATURE-SELECTION; CANCER CLASSIFICATION; TUMOR; PREDICTION; ALGORITHMS; PATTERNS	In this paper a new framework for feature selection consisting of an ensemble of filters and classifiers is described. Five filters, based on different metrics, were employed. Each filter selects a different subset of features which is used to train and to test a specific classifier. The outputs of these five classifiers are combined by simple voting. In this study three well-known classifiers were employed for the classification task: C4.5, naive-Bayes and IB1. The rationale of the ensemble is to reduce the variability of the features selected by filters in different classification domains. Its adequacy was demonstrated by employing 10 microarray data sets.

J	Jiang, SY; Pang, GS; Wu, ML; Kuang, LM				Jiang, Shengyi; Pang, Guansong; Wu, Meiling; Kuang, Limin			An improved K-nearest-neighbor algorithm for text categorization	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Text categorization; KNN text categorization; One-pass clustering; Spam filtering	CLASSIFICATION; MODEL	Text categorization is a significant tool to manage and organize the surging text data. Many text categorization algorithms have been explored in previous literatures, such as KNN, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine. KNN text categorization is an effective but less efficient classification method. In this paper, we propose an improved KNN algorithm for text categorization, which builds the classification model by combining constrained one pass clustering algorithm and KNN text categorization. Empirical results on three benchmark corpora show that our algorithm can reduce the text similarity computation substantially and outperform the-state-of-the-art KNN, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine classifiers. In addition, the classification model constructed by the proposed algorithm can be updated incrementally, and it has great scalability in many real-word applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The presence of class and attribute noise in software measurement datasets degrades the performance of machine learning-based classifiers, and the identification of these noisy modules improves the overall performance. In this study, we propose a noise detection algorithm based on software metrics threshold values. The threshold values are obtained from the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. This paper focuses on case studies of five public NASA datasets and details the construction of Naive Bayes-based software fault prediction models both before and after applying the proposed noise detection algorithm. Experimental results show that this noise detection approach is very effective for detecting the class noise and that the performance of fault predictors using a Naive Bayes algorithm with a logNum filter improves if the class labels of identified noisy modules are corrected.

Our model takes into account textual and visual contents to measure the similarity between the protected web page and suspicious web pages. A text classifier, an image classifier, and an algorithm fusing the results from classifiers are introduced. An outstanding feature of this paper is the exploration of a Bayesian model to estimate the matching threshold. This is required in the classifier for determining the class of the web page and identifying whether the web page is phishing or not. In the text classifier, the naive Bayes rule is used to calculate the probability that a web page is phishing. In the image classifier, the earth mover's distance is employed to measure the visual similarity, and our Bayesian model is designed to determine the threshold. In the data fusion algorithm, the Bayes theory is used to synthesize the classification results from textual and visual content. The effectiveness of our proposed approach was examined in a large-scale dataset collected from real phishing cases. Experimental results demonstrated that the text classifier and the image classifier we designed deliver promising results, the fusion algorithm outperforms either of the individual classifiers, and our model can be adapted to different phishing cases.

J	Wu, WW				Wu, Wei-Wen			IMPROVING CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY AND CAUSAL KNOWLEDGE FOR BETTER CREDIT DECISIONS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Credit scoring; classification accuracy; Bayesian network classifier; causal knowledge	NEURAL-NETWORK ENSEMBLES; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION; SCORING MODELS; STRUCTURAL OPTIMIZATION; LEARNING ALGORITHM; GENETIC ALGORITHM; RISK-EVALUATION; MINING APPROACH; FUZZY-SYSTEMS	Numerous studies have contributed to efforts to boost the accuracy of the credit scoring model. Especially interesting are recent studies which have successfully developed the hybrid approach, which advances classification accuracy by combining different machine learning techniques. However, to achieve better credit decisions, it is not enough merely to increase the accuracy of the credit scoring model. It is necessary to conduct meaningful supplementary analyses in order to obtain knowledge of causal relations, particularly in terms of significant conceptual patterns or structures involving attributes used in the credit scoring model. This paper proposes a solution of integrating data preprocessing strategies and the Bayesian network classifier with the tree augmented Naive Bayes search algorithm, in order to improve classification accuracy and to obtain improved knowledge of causal patterns, thus enhancing the validity of credit decisions.

To improve the performance of the spam filtering, feature selection, as an important and indispensable means of text categorization, also plays an important role in spam filtering. We proposed a new method, named Bi-Test, which utilizes binomial hypothesis testing to estimate whether the probability of a feature belonging to the spam satisfies a given threshold or not. We have evaluated Bi-Test on six benchmark spam corpora (pu1, pu2, pu3, pua, lingspam and CSDMC2010), using two classification algorithms, Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and compared it with four famous feature selection algorithms (information gain, chi(2)-statistic, improved Gini index and Poisson distribution). The experiments show that Bi-Test performs significantly better than chi(2)-statistic and Poisson distribution, and produces comparable performance with information gain and improved Gini index in terms of F1 measure when Naive Bayes classifier is used; it achieves comparable performance with the other methods when SVM classifier is used. Moreover, Bi-Test executes faster than the other four algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Song, EM; Huang, DS; Ma, GZ; Hung, CC				Song, Enmin; Huang, Dongshan; Ma, Guangzhi; Hung, Chih-Cheng			Semi-supervised multi-class Adaboost by exploiting unlabeled data	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Semi-supervised learning; J48 Decision Tree; Naive Bayes classifier; Unlabeled data	CLASSIFICATION	Semi-supervised learning has attracted much attention in pattern recognition and machine learning. Most semi-supervised learning algorithms are proposed for binary classification, and then extended to multi-class cases by using approaches such as one-against-the-rest. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised learning method by using the multi-class boosting, which can directly classify the multi-class data and achieve high classification accuracy by exploiting the unlabeled data. There are two distinct features in our proposed semi-supervised learning approach: (1) handling multi-class cases directly without reducing them to multiple two-class problems, and (2) the classification accuracy of each base classifier requiring only at least 1/K or better than 1/K (K is the number of classes). Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective based on the testing of 21 UCI benchmark data sets. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The information is extracted as time functions of various dynamic properties of the signatures. A database of 2160 signatures from 108 subjects was built. Thirty-one features were identified and extracted from each signature. Different feature reduction approaches and classifiers were used to assess their suitability for this application. Rough set approach has resulted in a reduced set of nine features that were found to capture the essential characteristics required for signature identification. Rough set classifier has achieved 100% correct classification rate, which demonstrates its suitability and effectiveness for online signature identification. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

However, not all patients with mastocytosis suffer from anaphylaxis. The aim of the study was to analyze differences in gene expression between patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) and a history of insect venom anaphylaxis (IVA) compared to those patients without a history of anaphylaxis, and to determine the predictive use of gene expression profiling. Methods: Whole-genome gene expression analysis was performed in peripheral blood cells. Results: Twenty-two adults with ISM were included: 12 with a history of IVA and 10 without a history of anaphylaxis of any kind. Significant differences in single gene expression corrected for multiple testing were found for 104 transcripts (P < 0.05). Gene ontology analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were involved in pathways responsible for the development of cancer and focal and cell adhesion suggesting that the expression of genes related to the differentiation state of cells is higher in patients with a history of anaphylaxis. Based on the gene expression profiles, a naive Bayes prediction model was built identifying patients with IVA. Conclusions: In ISM, gene expression profiles are different between patients with a history of IVA and those without. These findings might reflect a more pronounced mast cells dysfunction in patients without a history of anaphylaxis. Gene expression profiling might be a useful tool to predict the risk of anaphylaxis on insect venom in patients with ISM. Prospective studies are needed to substantiate any conclusions.

In order to deploy activity recognition systems in the real world, we need simple sensing systems with lightweight computational modules to accurately analyze sensed data. In this paper, we propose a simple method to recognize human activities using simple object information involved in activities. We apply activity theory for representing complex human activities and propose a penalized naive Bayes classifier for performing activity recognition. Our results show that our method reduces computation up to an order of magnitude in both learning and inference without penalizing accuracy, when compared to hidden Markov models and conditional random fields.

We extended the large-scale linear support vector machine library LIBLINEAR with state-of-the-art virtual high-throughput screening metrics to train classifiers on whole large and unbalanced data sets. The formulation of this linear support machine has an excellent performance if applied to high-dimensional sparse feature vectors. An additional advantage is the average linear complexity in the number of non zero features of a prediction. Nevertheless, the approach assumes that a problem is linearly separable. Therefore, we conducted an extensive benchmarking to evaluate the performance on large-scale problems up to a size of 175000 samples. To examine the virtual screening performance, we determined the chemotype clusters using Feature Trees and integrated this information to compute weighted AUC-based performance measures and a leave-cluster-out cross-validation. We also considered the BEDROC score, a metric that was suggested to tackle the early enrichment problem. The performance on each problem was evaluated by a nested cross-validation and a nested leave-cluster-out cross-validation. We compared LIBLINEAR against a Naive Bayes classifier, a random decision forest classifier, and a maximum similarity ranking approach. These reference approaches were outperformed in a direct comparison by LIBLINEAR A comparison to literature results showed that the LIBLINEAR performance is competitive but without achieving results as good as the top-ranked nonlinear machines on these benchmarks. However, considering the overall convincing performance and computation time of the large-scale support vector machine, the approach provides an excellent alternative to established large-scale classification approaches.

An exploratory study of a text classification framework for Internet-based surveillance of emerging epidemics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Natural language processing; Information storage and retrieval; Medical informatics applications; Disease notification; Disease outbreaks; Biosurveillance; Internet	AGREEMENT; HEALTHMAP; MACHINE; SUPPORT	Purpose: Early detection of infectious disease outbreaks is crucial to protecting the public health of a society. Online news articles provide timely information on disease outbreaks worldwide. In this study, we investigated automated detection of articles relevant to disease outbreaks using machine learning classifiers. In a real-life setting, it is expensive to prepare a training data set for classifiers, which usually consists of manually labeled relevant and irrelevant articles. To mitigate this challenge, we examined the use of randomly sampled unlabeled articles as well as labeled relevant articles. Methods: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were trained on 149 relevant and 149 or more randomly sampled unlabeled articles. Diverse classifiers were trained by varying the number of sampled unlabeled articles and also the number of word features. The trained classifiers were applied to 15 thousand articles published over 15 days. Top-ranked articles from each classifier were pooled and the resulting set of 1337 articles was reviewed by an expert analyst to evaluate the classifiers. Results: Daily averages of areas under ROC curves (AUCs) over the 15-day evaluation period were 0.841 and 0.836, respectively, for the naive Bayes and SVM classifier. We referenced a database of disease outbreak reports to confirm that this evaluation data set resulted from the pooling method indeed covered incidents recorded in the database during the evaluation period. Conclusions: The proposed text classification framework utilizing randomly sampled unlabeled articles can facilitate a cost-effective approach to training machine learning classifiers in a real-life Internet-based biosurveillance project. We plan to examine this framework further using larger data sets and using articles in non-English languages. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lee, LH; Isa, D				Lee, Lam Hong; Isa, Dino			Automatically computed document dependent weighting factor facility for Naive Bayes classification	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Naive Bayes; Text document classification; ACDD weighting factor facility	TEXT CATEGORIZATION	The Naive Bayes classification approach has been widely implemented in real-world applications due to its simplicity and low cost training and classifying algorithm. As a trade-off to its simplicity, the Naive Bayes technique has thus been reported to be one of the poorest-performing classification methods around. We have explored and investigated the Naive Bayes classification approach and found that one of the reasons that causes the low classification accuracy is the mis-classification of documents into several "popular" categories due to the improper organization of the training dataset where the distribution of training documents among categories is highly skewed. In this work, we propose a solution to the problem addressed above, which is the addition of the Automatically Computed Document Dependent (ACDD) weighting factor facility to the Naive Bayes classifier. The ACDD weighting factors are computed for the purpose of enhancing the classification performance by adjusting the probability values based on the density of classified documents in each available category to minimize the mis-classification rate.

Oude			Gene expression analysis in predicting the effectiveness of insect venom immunotherapy	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Insect venom allergy; venom immunotherapy gene expression; microarray assessment; prediction of treatment efficacy	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; ALLERGY	Background: Venom immunotherapy (VIT) enables longtime prevention of insect venom allergy in the majority of patients. However, in some, the risk of a resystemic reaction increases after completion of treatment. No reliable factors predicting individual lack of efficacy of VIT are currently available. Objective: To determine the use of gene expression profiles to predict the long-term effect of VIT. Methods: Whole genome gene expression analysis was performed on RNA samples from 46 patients treated with VIT divided into 3 groups: (1) patients who achieved and maintained long-term protection after VIT, (2) patients in whom insect venom allergy relapsed, and (3) patients still in the maintenance phase of VIT. Results: Among the 48.071 transcripts analyzed, 1401 showed a >2 fold difference in gene expression (P <.05); 658 genes (47%) were upregulated and 743 (53%) downregulated. Forty-three transcripts still show significant differences in expression after correction for multiple testing; 12 of 43 genes (28%) were upregulated and 31 of 43 genes (72%) downregulated. A naive Bayes prediction model demonstrated a gene expression pattern characteristic of effective VIT that was present in all patients with successful VIT but absent in all subjects with failure of VIT. The same gene expression profile was present in 88% of patients in the maintenance phase of VIT. Conclusion: Gene expression profiling might be a useful tool to assess the long-term effectiveness of VIT. The analysis of differently expressed genes confirms the involvement of immunologic pathways described previously but also indicates novel factors that might be relevant for allergen tolerance.

Studies on Bayes classifier for condition monitoring of single point carbide tipped tool based on statistical and histogram features	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature extraction; Decision tree; Naive Bayes; Bayes Net; Statistical features; Histogram features; Tool condition monitoring	TURNING OPERATIONS; WEAR; VIBRATION; NETWORK; SYSTEM	Various methods of tool condition monitoring techniques are used to control the tool wear during machining in CNC machine tools. Based on a continuous acquisition of signals with sensor systems it is possible to classify certain wear parameters by the extraction of features. Data mining approach is used to probe into the structural information hidden in the signals acquired. This paper discusses machine tool condition monitoring of carbide tipped tool by using Naive Bayes and Bayes Net classifiers and compares the results of histogram features with the statistical features to establish better classification among the two. The vibration signals are acquired for various tool conditions like tool-good condition, tip-breakage, etc. The effort is to bring out the better feature-classifier combine. The results are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Elangovan, M.; Ramachandran, K.

J	Chou, CH; Sinha, AP; Zhao, HM				Chou, Chen-Huei; Sinha, Atish P.; Zhao, Huimin			Commercial Internet filters: Perils and opportunities	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Internet abuse; Internet filters; Text mining; Text classification	TEXT CATEGORIZATION; LEARNING APPROACH; WEB USAGE; CLASSIFICATION; WORKPLACE; ABUSE; SYSTEM; WORK	Organizations are becoming increasingly aware of Internet abuse in the workplace. Such abuse results in loss of workers' productivity, network congestion, security risks, and legal liabilities. To address this problem, organizations have started to adopt Internet usage policies, management training, and filtering software. Several commercial Internet filters are experiencing an increasing number of organizational adoptions. These products mainly rely on black lists, white lists, and keyword/profile matching to filter out undesired web pages. In this paper, we describe three top-ranked commercial Internet filters - CYBERSitter, Net Nanny. and CyberPatrol - and evaluate their performance in the context of an Internet abuse problem. We then propose a text mining approach to address the problem and evaluate its performance using six different classification algorithms: naive Bayes, multinominal naive Bayes, support vector machine, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, and neural network. The evaluation results point to the perils of using commercial Internet filters on one hand, and to the prospects of using text mining on the other. The proposed text mining approach Outperforms the commercial filters. We discuss the possible reasons for the relatively poor performance of the filters and the steps that could be taken to improve their performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The evaluated classifiers are naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, J48 decision trees, multilayer perceptron, and support vector machines (SVM). The dataset used contains 843 regions of interest (ROI) of healthy and five pathologic lung tissue patterns identified by two radiologists at the University Hospitals of Geneva. Correlation of the feature space composed of 39 texture attributes is studied. A grid search for optimal parameters is carried out for each classifier family. Two complementary metrics are used to characterize the performances of classification. These are based on McNemar's statistical tests and global accuracy. SVM reached best values for each metric and allowed a mean correct prediction rate of 88.3% with high class-specific precision on testing sets of 423 ROIs.

Our application transforms remotely sensed topographic data gathered by orbiting satellites into semantically meaningful maps of landforms; such maps are valuable research tools for planetary science. As topographic data become increasingly available, the ability to derive geomorphic maps efficiently is becoming essential. In our proposed framework, the mapping is achieved by means of scene segmentation followed by supervised classification of segments. The two mapping steps use different sets of features derived from digital elevation models of planetary surfaces; selection of appropriate features is discussed. Using a particular set of terrain attributes relevant to annotating cratered terrain on Mars, we investigate the design choices for both segmentation and classification components. The segmentation assessment includes K-means-based agglomerative segmentation and watershed-based segmentation. The classification assessment includes three supervised learning algorithms: Naive Bayes, Bagging with decision trees, and support-vector machines (SVMs); segments are classified into the following landforms: crater floors, crater walls (concave and convex), ridges (concave and convex), and intercrater plains. The method is applied to six test sites on Mars. The analysis of the results shows that a combination of K-means-based agglomerative segmentation and either SVM with a quadratic kernel or Bagging with C4.5 yields best maps. The presented framework can be adopted to generate geomorphic maps of sites on Earth.

However, the performance of this distance relies heavily on the large number of local features in the training set and test image, which need heavy computation cost for nearest-neighbor (NN) search in the testing phase. If using small number of local features for accelerating the NN search, the performance will be poor. In this paper, we propose a large margin framework to improve the discrimination of I2C distance especially for small number of local features by learning Per-Class Mahalanobis metrics. Our I2C distance is adaptive to different class by combining with the learned metric for each class. These multiple Per-Class metrics are learned simultaneously by forming a convex optimization problem with the constraints that the I2C distance from each training image to its belonging class should be less than the distance to other classes by a large margin. A gradient descent method is applied to efficiently solve this optimization problem. For efficiency and performance improved, we also adopt the idea of spatial pyramid restriction and learning I2C distance function to improve this I2C distance. We show in experiments that the proposed method can significantly outperform the original NBNN in several prevalent image datasets, and our best results can achieve state-of-the-art performance on most datasets.

A FILTER-WRAPPER METHOD TO SELECT VARIABLES FOR THE NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER BASED ON CREDAL DECISION TREES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF UNCERTAINTY FUZZINESS AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Variable selection; classification; decision tree; Naive Bayes; imprecise probabilities; uncertainty measures	MATHEMATICAL-THEORY; COMMUNICATION; SETS	Variable selection methods play an important role in the field of attribute mining. In the last few years, several feature selection methods have appeared showing that the use of a set of decision trees learnt from a database can be a useful tool for selecting relevant and informative variables regarding a mainclass variable. With the Naive Bayes classifier as reference, in this article, our aims are two fold: (1) to study what split criterion has better performance when a complete decision tree is used to select variables; and (2) to present a filter-wrappers election method using decision trees built with the best possible split criterion obtained in (1).

J	Hu, YC; Ansell, J				Hu, Yu-Chiang; Ansell, Jake			Retail Default Prediction by Using Sequential Minimal Optimization Technique	JOURNAL OF FORECASTING			English	Article						credit risk; default prediction; sequential minimal optimization; multivariate statistics; artificial intelligence	FINANCIAL RATIOS; BANK FAILURE; BANKRUPTCY; MODELS	This paper employed sequential minimal optimization (SMO) to develop default prediction model in the US retail market. Principal components analysis is used for variable reduction purposes. Four standard credit scoring techniques-naive Bayes, logistic regression, recursive partitioning and artificial neural network-are compared to SMO, using a sample of 195 healthy firms and 51 distressed firms over five time periods between 1994 and 2002. The five techniques perform well in predicting default particularly one year before financial distress. Furthermore, the prediction still remains Sound even 5 years before default. No single methodology has the absolute best classification ability, as the model performance varies in terms of different time periods and variable groups. External influences have greater impacts on the naive Bayes than other techniques. In terms of similarity with Moody's ranking, SMO excelled over other techniques in most of the time periods.

Two steps feature selection strategy is proposed which combines the preprocess within classes with the feature selection among classes. Four different feature selection methods and three text representation weights are compared by exhaustive experiments. Both C-SVC classifier and Naive bayes classifier are adopted to assess the results. All experiments are performed on Chinese corpus TanCorpV1.0 which includes more than 14,000 texts divided in 12 classes. Our experiments concern: (1) the performance comparison among different feature selection strategies: absolute text frequency, relative text frequency, absolute n-gram frequency and relative n-gram frequency; (2) the comparison of the sparseness and feature correlation in the "text by feature" matrices produced by four feature selection methods; (3) the performance comparison among three term weights: 0/1 logical value, n-gram frequency numeric value (TF) and Tf*idf value.

Most of the work in this area was carried out for English text. Very little research has been carried out on Arabic text. The nature of Arabic text is different than that of English text, and preprocessing of Arabic text is more challenging. This paper presents an implementation of three automatic text-classification techniques for Arabic text. A corpus of 1445 Arabic text documents belonging to nine categories has been automatically classified using the kNN, Rocchio, and naive Bayes algorithms. The research results reveal that Naive Bayes was the best performer, followed by kNN and Rocchio.

J	Song, Y; Kolcz, A; Giles, CL				Song, Yang; Kolcz, Aleksander; Giles, C. Lee			Better Naive Bayes classification for high-precision spam detection	SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE			English	Article						spam filtering; naive Bayes; cascaded models	TEXT CLASSIFICATION; CLASSIFIERS; SYSTEM	Email spam has become a major problem for Internet users and providers. One major obstacle to its eradication is that the potential solutions need to ensure a very low false-positive rate, which tends to be difficult in practice. We address the problem of low-FPR classification in the context of naive Rayes, which represents one of the most popular machine learning models applied in the spam filtering domain. Drawing from the recent extensions, we propose a new term weight aggregation function, which leads to markedly better results than the standard alternatives. We identify short instances as ones with disproportionally poor performance and counter this behavior with a collaborative filtering-based feature augmentation. Finally, we propose a tree-based classifier cascade for which decision thresholds of the leaf nodes are jointly optimized for the best overall performance. These improvements, both individually and in aggregate, lead to substantially better detection rate of precision when compared with some of the best variants of naive Bayes proposed to date.

Bayesian methods: a useful tool for classifying injury narratives into cause groups	INJURY PREVENTION			English	Article							EXTERNAL CAUSE; TEXT	To compare two Bayesian methods (Fuzzy and Naive) for classifying injury narratives in large administrative databases into event cause groups, a dataset of 14 000 narratives was randomly extracted from claims filed with a worker's compensation insurance provider. Two expert coders assigned one-digit and two-digit Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Injury and Illness Classification event codes to each narrative. The narratives were separated into a training set of 11 000 cases and a prediction set of 3000 cases. The training set was used to develop two Bayesian classifiers that assigned BLS codes to narratives. Each model was then evaluated for the prediction set. Both models performed well and tended to predict one-digit BLS codes more accurately than two-digit codes. The overall sensitivity of the Fuzzy method was, respectively, 78% and 64% for one-digit and two-digit codes, specificity was 93% and 95%, and positive predictive value (PPV) was 78% and 65%. The Naive method showed similar accuracy: a sensitivity of 80% and 70%, specificity of 96% and 97%, and PPV of 80% and 70%. For large administrative databases, Bayesian methods show significant promise as a means of classifying injury narratives into cause groups. Overall, Naive Bayes provided slightly more accurate predictions than Fuzzy Bayes.

Using Bayesian networks with rule extraction to infer the risk of weed infestation in a corn-crop	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Bayesian network; Naive Bayes; Rule extraction; Weed infestation; Kriging	MACHINE VISION; MODELS; DISCRIMINATION; IDENTIFICATION; COMPETITION; CLASSIFIER	This paper describes the modeling of a weed infestation risk inference system that implements a collaborative inference scheme based on rules extracted from two Bayesian network classifiers. The first Bayesian classifier infers a categorical variable value for the weed-crop competitiveness using as input categorical variables for the total density of weeds and corresponding proportions of narrow and broad-leaved weeds. The inferred categorical variable values for the weed-crop competitiveness along with three other categorical variables extracted from estimated maps for the weed seed production and weed coverage are then used as input for a second Bayesian network classifier to infer categorical variables values for the risk of infestation. Weed biomass and yield loss data samples are used to learn the probability relationship among the nodes of the first and second Bayesian classifiers in a supervised fashion, respectively. For comparison purposes, two types of Bayesian network structures are considered, namely an expert-based Bayesian classifier and a naive Bayes classifier. The inference system focused on the knowledge interpretation by translating a Bayesian classifier into a set of classification rules. The results obtained for the risk inference in a corn-crop field are presented and discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Previously, this problem was formalized as classification and learning methods for classification were utilized. This paper points out that it is more essential to cast the problem as ranking and employ a learning to rank method to perform the task. Specifically, it employs Ranking SVM, a state-of-art method of learning to rank, in keyphrase extraction. Experimental results on three datasets show that Ranking SVM significantly outperforms the baseline methods of SVM and Naive Bayes, indicating that it is better to exploit learning to rank techniques in keyphrase extraction.

Feature selection (FS) is an avenue to dimensionality reduction. Evolutionary search techniques have been very promising in finding solutions in the exponentially growing search space of FS problems. This paper proposes a genetic programming (GP) approach to FS where the building blocks are subsets of features and set operators. We use bit-mask representation for subsets and a set of set operators as primitive functions. The GP search, then combines these subsets and set operations to find an optimal subset of features. The task we study is a highly imbalanced face detection problem. A modified version of the Naive Bayes classification model is used as the fitness function. Our results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a significant reduction in dimensionality and processing time. Using the GP-selected features, the performance of certain classifiers can also be improved.

However, this assumption may not hold in some situations because of data uncertainty arising from measurement errors, data staleness, and repeated measurements, etc. With uncertainty, the value of each data item is represented by a probability distribution function (pdf). In this paper, we propose a novel naive Bayes classification algorithm for uncertain data with a pdf. Our key solution is to extend the class conditional probability estimation in the Bayes model to handle pdf's. Extensive experiments on UCI datasets show that the accuracy of naive Bayes model can be improved by taking into account the uncertainty information.

When transferred to another domain, however, a supervised sentiment classifier often performs extremely bad. This is so-called domain-transfer problem. In this work, we attempt to attack this problem by making the maximum use of both the old-domain data. we proposed an effective measure, i.e., Frequently Co-occurring Entropy (FCE), to pick out generalizable features that occur frequently in both domains and have similar occurring probability. To gain knowledge from the new-domain data. we proposed Adapted Naive Bayes (ANB), a weighted transfer version of Naive Bayes Classifier. The experimental results indicate that proposed approach could improve the performance of base classifier dramatically, and even provide much better performance than the transfer-learning baseline, i.e the Naive Bayes Transfer Classifier (NTBC).			tansongbo@software.ict.ac.cn	Cheng, Xueqi/F-1706-2010				AUE A, 2005, RANLP 2005; DAI W, 2007, AAAI 2007; Daume H, 2006, J ARTIF INTELL RES, V26, P101; JIANG J, 2007, CIKM 2007; Joachims T., 1999, ICML; MCCALLUM A, 1998, AAAI ACML WORKSH LEA; NIGAM K, 1998, AAAI 1998; Pang B., 2002, EMNLP 2002; Sebastiani F, 2002, ACM COMPUT SURV, V34, P1, DOI 10.1145/505282.505283; Tan S., 2007, CIKM 2007; WHITELAW C, 2005, CIKM; Wilson T, 2006, COMPUT INTELL-US, V22, P73, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8640.2006.00275.x; ZHANG H, 2003, 2 SIGHAN WORKSH AFF	13	5	5	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743		978-3-642-00957-0	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2009	5478						337	349				13	Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BJG81	WOS:000265680800028	
J	Zhang, Y; Bhargava, B				Zhang, Yu; Bhargava, Bharat			Self-Learning Disk Scheduling	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Machine learning; application-transparent adaptation; I/O; operating system		The performance of disk I/O schedulers is affected by many factors such as workloads, file systems, and disk systems. Disk scheduling performance can be improved by tuning scheduler parameters such as the length of read timers. Scheduler performance tuning is mostly done manually. To automate this process, we propose four self-learning disk scheduling schemes: Change-sensing Round-Robin, Feedback Learning, Per-request Learning, and Two-layer Learning. Experiments show that the novel Two-layer Learning Scheme performs best. It integrates the workload-level and request-level learning algorithms. It employs feedback learning techniques to analyze workloads, change scheduling policy, and tune scheduling parameters automatically. We discuss schemes to choose features for workload learning, divide and recognize workloads, generate training data, and integrate machine learning algorithms into the Two-layer Learning Scheme. We conducted experiments to compare the accuracy, performance, and overhead of five machine learning algorithms: decision tree, logistic regression, naive Bayes, neural network, and support vector machine algorithms. Experiments with real-world and synthetic workloads show that self-learning disk scheduling can adapt to a wide variety of workloads, file systems, disk systems, and user preferences. It outperforms existing disk schedulers by as much as 15.8 percent while consuming less than 3 percent -5 percent of CPU time.

Knowledge is presented as patterns of classes. Each pattern includes attributes with weight and fitness values concerning the class. With the knowledge discovery method it is possible to form fitness values from data. Knowledge formation is based on frequency distributions of attributes. Knowledge formed by the knowledge discovery method is tested with two vertigo data sets and compared to experts' knowledge. The experts' and machine learnt knowledge are also combined in various ways in order to examine effects of weights on classification accuracy. The classification accuracy of knowledge discovery method is compared to 1- and 5-nearest neighbour method and Naive-Bayes classifier. The results showed that knowledge bases combining machine learnt knowledge with the experts' knowledge yielded the best classification accuracies. Further, attribute weighting had an important effect on the classification capability of the system. When considering different diseases in the used data sets, the performance of the knowledge discovery method and the inference method is comparable to other methods employed in this study.

J	Zhang, H; Su, J				Zhang, Harry; Su, Jiang			Naive Bayes for optimal ranking	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						naive Bayes; ranking; classification; AUC; ROC curve	ROC CURVE; AREA	It is well known that naive Bayes performs surprisingly well in classification, but its probability estimation is poor. AUC (the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve) is a measure different from classification accuracy and probability estimation, which is often used to measure the quality of rankings. Indeed, an accurate ranking of examples is often more desirable than a mere classification. What is the general performance of naive Bayes in yielding optimal ranking, measured by AUC? In this paper, we study it systematically by both empirical experiments and theoretical analysis. In our experiments, we compare naive Bayes with a state-of-the-art decision-tree learning algorithm C4.4 for ranking, and some popular extensions of naive Bayes which achieve a significant improvement over naive Bayes in classification, such as the selective Bayesian classifier (SBC) and tree-augmented naive Bayes (TAN). Our experimental results show that naive Bayes performs significantly better than C4.4 and comparably with TAN. This provides empirical evidence that naive Bayes performs well in ranking. Then we analyse theoretically the optimality of naive Bayes in ranking. We study two example problems: conjunctive concepts and m-of-n concepts, which have been used in analysing the performance of naive Bayes in classification. Surprisingly, naive Bayes performs optimally on them in ranking, even though it does not in classification. We present and prove a sufficient condition for the optimality of naive Bayes in ranking.

One possible approach to this kind of verification problem is one-class classification, learning a description of the target class concerned based solely on data from this elms. However, if known non-target classes are available at training time, it is also possible to use standard multi-class or two-class classification, exploiting the negative data to infer a description of the target class. In this paper we assume that this scenario holds and investigate under what conditions multi-class and two-class Naive Bayes classifiers are preferable to the corresponding one-class model when the aim is to identify examples from a new 'attacker' class. To this end we first identify a way of performing a fair comparison between the techniques concerned and present an adaptation of standard cross-validation. This is one of the main contributions of the paper. Based on the experimental results obtained, we then show under what conditions which group of techniques is likely to be preferable. Our main finding is that multi-class and two-class classification becomes preferable to one-class classification when a sufficiently large number of non-target classes is available.

During the last few years, many algorithms have been proposed for this task. In this paper we review different supervised machine learning techniques for classification of a novel dataset and perform a methodological comparison of these. We used the C4.5 tree classifier a Multilayer Perceptron and a naive Bayes classifier over a large set of tumour markers. We found good performance of the Multilayer Perceptron even when we reduced the number of features to be classified. We found naive Bayes achieved a competitive performance even though the assumption of normality of the data is strongly violated.

S	Wang, B; Spencer, B; Ling, CX; Zhang, H		Bergler, S		Wang, Bin; Spencer, Bruce; Ling, Charles X.; Zhang, Harry			Semi-supervised self-training for sentence subjectivity classification	ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	21st Conference of the Canadian-Society-for-Computational-Studies-of-Intelligence	MAY 28-30, 2008	Windsor, CANADA	Canadian Soc Computat Studies Intelligence				Recent natural language processing (NLP) research shows that identifying and extracting subjective information from texts can benefit many NLP applications. In this paper, we address a semi-supervised learning approach, self-training, for sentence subjectivity classification. In self-training, the confidence degree that depends on the ranking of class membership probabilities is commonly used as the selection metric that ranks and selects the unlabeled instances for next training of underlying classifier. Naive Bayes (NB) is often used as the underlying classifier because its class membership probability estimates have good ranking performance. The first contribution of this paper is to study the performance of self-training using decision tree models, such as C4.5, C4.4, and naive Bayes tree (NBTree), as the underlying classifiers. The second contribution is that we propose an adapted Value Difference Metric (VDM) as the selection metric in self-training, which does not depend on class membership probabilities. Based on the Multi-Perspective Question Answering (MPQA) corpus, a set of experiments have been designed to compare the performance of self-training with different underlying classifiers using different selection metrics under various conditions. The experimental results show that the performance of self-training is improved by using VDM instead of the confidence degree, and self-training with NBTree and VDM outperforms self-training with other combinations of underlying classifiers and selection metrics. The results also show that the self-training approach can achieve comparable performance to the supervised learning models.

This paper applies Genetic Algorithms (GA) for selecting a group of relevant genes from cancer microarray data. Then, the popular classifiers, such as OneR, Naive Bayes, decision tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are built on the basis of these selected genes. The performance of those classifiers is evaluated by using the publicly available gene expression data sets. Experimental results indicate that the cascade of GA and SVM has the highest rank among different methods. Moreover, the gene selection operation of GA is reproducible.

These models have also been applied to regression or prediction problems, i.e. classification problems where the class variable is continuous, but usually under the assumption that the joint distribution of the feature variables and the class is multivariate Gaussian. In this paper we are interested in regression problems where some of the feature variables are discrete while the others are continuous. We propose a Naive Bayes predictor based on the approximation of the joint distribution by a Mixture of Truncated Exponentials (MTE). We have followed a filter-wrapper procedure for selecting the variables to be used in the construction of the model. This scheme is based on the mutual information between each of the candidate variables and the class. Since the mutual information can not be computed exactly for the MTE distribution, we introduce an unbiased estimator of it, based on Monte Carlo methods. We test the performance of the proposed model in artificial and real-world datasets.

The out come of this research will assist people in diagnosing problems, such as in plant diseases, health, industrial and etc. While the previous works have extracted causality knowledge within only one or two adjacent EDUs (Elementary Discourse Units), this research focuses to mine causality knowledge existing within multiple EDUs which takes multiple causes and multiple effects in to consideration, where the adjacency between cause and effect is unnecessary. There are two main problems: how to identify the interesting causality events from documents, and how to identify the boundaries of the causative unit and the effective unit in term of the multiple EDUs. In addition, there are at least three main problems involved in boundaries identification: the implicit boundary de-limiter, the nonadjacent cause-consequence, and the effect surrounded by causes. This research proposes using verb-pair rules learnt by comparing the Naive Bayes classifier (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify causality EDUs in Thai agricultural and health news domains. The boundary identification problems are solved by utilizing verb-pair rules, Centering Theory and cue phrase set. The reason for emphasizing on using verbs to extract causality is that they explicitly make, in a certain way, the consequent events of cause-effect, e.g. 'Aphids suck the sap from rice leaves. Then leaves will shrink. Later, they will become yellow and dry.'. The outcome of the proposed methodology shown that the verb-pair rules extracted from NB outperform those extracted from SVM when the corpus contains high occurence of each verb, while the results from SVM is better than NB when the corpus contains less occurence of each verb. The verb-pair rules extracted from NB for causality extraction has the highest precision (0.88) with the recall of 0.75 from the plant disease corpus whereas from SVM has the highest precision (0.89) with the recall of 0.76 from bird flu news. For boundary determination, our methodology can handle very well with approximate 96% accuracy. In addition, the extracted causality results from this research can be generalized as laws in the Inductive-Statistical theory of Hempel's explanation theory, which will be useful for QA and reasoning.

At first, we collected 40 heterologous genes expressed in pPIC9 vector, and these 40 genes were classified into high-level expression group (expression level > 100 mg/L, 12 genes) and low-level expression group (expression level < 100 mg/L, 28 genes). Then, the Naive Bayes method was used to construct the model with RNA secondary structure profile of 3'-end of foreign genes as features. The classification accuracy from leave-one-out cross-validation was 100%. Finally, another five genes collected from literatures were used to test the ability of the model. The results indicated that there were four genes correctly predicted. In addition, the model was also verified by expressing human neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) gene with expression level more than 100 mg/L. Therefore, we propose that the model can be used to predict the expression level of heterologous genes before experiments and optimize the experiment designs to obtain the high-level expression. Furthermore, we have developed a web server for evaluation and design for high-level expression of foreign genes, which is accessible at http://ppic9.med.stu.edu.cn/ppic9. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

J	Agarwal, D				Agarwal, Deepak			Detecting anomalies in cross-classified streams: a Bayesian approach	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						multidimensional; multiple testing; hierarchical Bayesian; active learning	MULTIPLE COMPARISONS	We consider the problem of detecting anomalies in data that arise as multidimensional arrays with each dimension corresponding to the levels of a categorical variable. In typical data mining applications, the number of cells in such arrays are usually large. Our primary focus is detecting anomalies by comparing information at the current time to historical data. Naive approaches advocated in the process control literature do not work well in this scenario due to the multiple testing problem-performing multiple statistical tests on the same data produce excessive number of false positives. We use an empirical Bayes method which works by fitting a two-component Gaussian mixture to deviations at current time. The approach is scalable to problems that involve monitoring massive number of cells and fast enough to be potentially useful in many streaming scenarios. We show the superiority of the method relative to a naive "per component error rate" procedure through simulation. A novel feature of our technique is the ability to suppress deviations that are merely the consequence of sharp changes in the marginal distributions. This research was motivated by the need to extract critical application information and business intelligence from the daily logs that accompany large-scale spoken dialog systems. We illustrate our method on one such system.

J	Wu, Q; Bell, DA; Prasad, G; McGinnity, TM				Wu, QingXiang; Bell, David A.; Prasad, Girijesh; McGinnity, Thomas Martin			A distribution-index-based discretizer for decision-making with symbolic AI approaches	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; machine learning; information theory; decision support	ATTRIBUTES	When symbolic AI approaches are applied to handle continuous valued attributes, there is a requirement to transform the continuous attribute values to symbolic data. In this paper, a novel distribution-index-based discretizer is proposed for such a transformation. Based on definitions of dichotomic entropy and a compound distributional index, a simple criterion is applied to discretize continuous attributes adaptively. The dichotomic entropy indicates the homogeneity degree of the decision value distribution, and is applied to determine the best splitting point. The compound distributional index combines both the homogeneity degrees of attribute value distributions and the decision value distribution, and is applied to determine which interval should be split further; thus, a potentially improved solution of the discretization problem can be found efficiently. Based on multiple reducts in rough set theory, a multiknowledge approach can attain high decision accuracy for information systems with a large number of attributes and missing values. In this paper, our discretizer is combined with the multiknowledge approach to further improve decision accuracy for information systems with continuous attributes. Experimental results on benchmark data sets show that the new discretizer can improve not only the multiknowledge approach, but also the naive Bayes classifier and the C5.0 tree.

This assumption might be violated when the training and test data come from different time periods or domains. In such situations, traditional machine learning methods not aware of the shift of distribution may fail. This paper proposes a novel algorithm, namely bridged refinement, to take the shift into consideration. The algorithm corrects the labels predicted by a shift-unaware classifier towards a target distribution and takes the mixture distribution of the training and test data as a bridge to better transfer from the training data to the test data. In the experiments, our algorithm successfully refines the classification labels predicted by three state-of-the-art algorithms: the Support Vector Machine. the naive Bayes classifier and the Transductive Support Vector Machine on eleven data sets. The relative reduction of error rates is about 50% in average.

Our strategy for incorporating new data is based on bias management and gradual adaptation. Starting with the simple Naive Bayes, we scale up the complexity by gradually increasing the maximum number of allowable attribute dependencies, and then by searching for new dependences in the extended search space. Since updating the structure is a costly task, we use new data to primarily adapt the parameters and only if this is really necessary, do we adapt the structure. The method for handling concept drift is based on the Shewhart P-Chart. We evaluated our adaptive algorithms on artificial domains and benchmark problems and show its advantages and future applicability in real-world on-line learning systems.

A new discrete particle swarm algorithm applied to attribute selection in a bioinformatics data set	GECCO 2006: Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, Vol 1 and 2			English	Proceedings Paper	8th Annual Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference	JUL 08-12, 2006	Seattle, WA	ACM SIGEVO		particle swarm; optimization; data mining; attribute selection; Naive Bayes classifier; bioinformatics		Many data mining applications involve the task of building a model for predictive classification. The goal of such a model is to classify examples (records or data instances) into classes or categories of the same type. The use of variables (attributes) not related to the classes can reduce the accuracy and reliability of a classification or prediction model. Superfluous variables can also increase the costs of building a model - particularly on large data sets. We propose a discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm designed for attribute selection. The proposed algorithm deals with discrete variables, and its population of candidate solutions contains particles of different sizes. The performance of this algorithm is compared with the performance of a standard binary PSO algorithm on the task of selecting attributes in a bioinformatics data set. The criteria used for comparison are: (1) maximizing predictive accuracy; and (2) finding the smallest subset of attributes.

J	Desmarais, MC; Meshkinfam, P; Gagnon, M				Desmarais, Michel C.; Meshkinfam, Peyman; Gagnon, Michel			Learned student models with item to item knowledge structures	USER MODELING AND USER-ADAPTED INTERACTION			English	Article						student models; probabilistic models; Bayesian networks; Bayesian inference; POKS; knowledge spaces; knowledge assessment; adaptive testing; CAT; empirical simulations	BAYESIAN NETWORKS	Probabilistic and learned approaches to student modeling are attractive because of the uncertainty surrounding the student skills assessment and because of the need to automatize the process. Item to item structures readily lend themselves to probabilistic and fully learned models because they are solely composed of observable nodes, like answers to test questions. Their structure is also well grounded in the cognitive theory of knowledge spaces. We study the effectiveness of two Bayesian frameworks to learn item to item structures and to use the induced structures to predict item outcome from a subset of evidence. One approach, Partial Order Knowledge Structures (POKS), relies on a naive Bayes framework whereas the other is based on the Bayesian network (BN) learning and inference framework. Both approaches are assessed over their predictive ability and their computational efficiency in different experimental simulations. The results from simulations over three data sets show that they both can effectively perform accurate predictions, but POKS generally displays higher predictive power than the BN. Moreover, the simplicity of POKS translates to a time efficiency between one to three orders of magnitude greater than the BN runs. We further explore the use of the item to item approach for handling concepts mastery assessment. The approach investigated consist in augmenting an initial set of observations, based on inferences with the item to item structure, and feed the augmented set to a BN containing a number of concepts. The results show that augmented set can effectively improve predictive power of a BN for item outcome, but that improvement does not transfer to the concept assessment in this particular experiment. We discuss different explanations for the results and outline future research avenues.

It has recently been established that predictive performance can be improved further by appropriate data transformations [1,2]. In this paper we present another transformation that is designed to combat a potential problem with the application of MNB to unbalanced datasets. We propose an appropriate correction by adjusting attribute priors. This correction can be implemented as another data normalization step, and we show that it can significantly improve the area under the ROC curve. We also show that the modified version of MNB is very closely related to the simple centroid-based classifier and compare the two methods empirically.

Unfortunately, decision trees such as C4.5 [9] have been found to provide poor probability estimates. By the empirical studies, Provost and Domingos [6] found that Probability Estimation Trees (PETs) give a fairly good probability estimation. However, different from normal decision trees, pruning reduces the performances of PETs. In order to get a good probability estimation, we usually need large trees which are not good in terms of the model transparency. In this paper two hybrid models by combining the Naive Bayes classifier and PETs are proposed in order to build a model with good performance without losing too much transparency. The first model use Naive Bayes estimation given a PET and the second model use a group of small-sized PETs as Naive Bayes estimators. Empirical studies show that the first model outperforms the PET model at shallow depth and the second model is equivalent to Naive Bayes and PET.

While conducting a large meta-analysis of such studies, we spotted some anomalous results relating to the Naive Bayes method. This paper describes our detailed investigation into these anomalies. We conclude that a very large comparative study probably mislabelled another method as Naive Bayes, and that the Statlog project used the right method, but possibly incorrectly reported its provenance. Such mistakes, while not too harmful in themselves, can become seriously misleading if blindly propagated by citations which do not examine the source material in detail. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

They perform prediction by choosing the majority class at each leaf. Their predictive accuracy can be increased by adding Naive Bayes models at the leaves of the trees. By stress-testing these two prediction methods using noise and more complex concepts and an order of magnitude more instances than in previous studies, we discover situations where the Naive Bayes method outperforms the standard Hoeffding tree initially but is eventually overtaken. The reason for this crossover is determined and a hybrid adaptive method is proposed that generally outperforms the two original prediction methods for both simple and complex concepts as well as under noise.

Naive Bayes has been widely used in data mining as a simple and effective classification and ranking algorithm. Since its conditional independence assumption is rarely true, numerous algorithms have been proposed to improve naive Bayes, for example, SBC[1] and TAN[2]. Indeed, the experimental results show that SBC and TAN achieve a significant improvement in term of classification accuracy. However, unfortunately, our experiments also show that SBC and TAN perform even worse than naive Bayes in ranking measured by AUC[3,4](the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve). This fact raises the question of whether we can improve Naive Bayes with both accurate classification and ranking? In this paper, responding to this question, we present a new learning algorithm called One Dependence Augmented Naive Bayes(ODANB). Our motivation is to develop a new algorithm to improve Naive Bayes' performance not only on classification measured by accuracy but also on ranking measured by AUC. We experimentally tested our algorithm, using the whole 36 UCI datasets recommended by Weka[5], and compared it to Naive Bayes, SBC and TAN. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms all the other algorithms significantly in yielding accurate ranking, yet at the same time outperforms all the other algorithms slightly in tern-is of classification accuracy.

However, the critical issue of examining the usefulness of extracted biometric features has been largely ignored. Feature evaluation/selection helps to identify and remove much of the irrelevant and redundant features. The small dimension of feature set reduces the hypothesis space, which is critical for the success of online implementation in personal recognition. This paper focuses on the issue of feature subset selection and its effectiveness in a typical bimodal biometric system. The feature level fusion has not received adequate attention in the literature and therefore the performance improvement in feature level fusion using feature subset selection is also investigated. Our experimental results demonstrate that while majority of biometric features are useful in predicting the subjects identity, only a small subset of these features are necessary in practice for building an accurate model for identification. The comparison and combination of features extracted from hand images is evaluated on the diverse classification schemes; naive Bayes (normal, estimated, multinomial), decision trees (C4.5, LMT), k-NN, SVM, and FFN.

The concept of multidimensional category model is introduced for representing classes. In contrast with traditional flat and hierarchical category models, the multidimensional category model classifies each document using multiple predefined sets of categories, where each set corresponds to a dimension. Since a multidimensional model can be converted to flat and hierarchical models, three classification approaches are possible, i.e., classifying directly based on the multidimensional model and classifying with the equivalent flat or hierarchical models. The efficiency of these three approaches is investigated using drug information collection with two different dimensions: 1) drug topics and 2) primary therapeutic classes. In the experiments, k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, and two centroid-based methods are selected as classifiers. The comparisons among three approaches of classification are done using two-way analysis of variance, followed by the Scheffe's test for post hoc comparison. The experimental results show that multidimensional-based classification performs better than the others, especially in the presence of a relatively small training set. As one application, a category-based search engine using the multidimensional category concept was developed to help users retrieve drug information.

Additionally, the class distribution of the training set often does not match the target distribution. In this paper we compare the performance of many learning models on a substantial benchmark of binary text classification tasks having small training sets. We vary the training size and class distribution to examine the learning surface, as opposed to the traditional learning curve. The models tested include various feature selection methods each coupled with four learning algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Multinomial Naive Bayes. Different models excel in different regions of the learning surface, leading to meta-knowledge about which to apply in different situations. This helps guide the researcher and practitioner when facing choices of model and feature selection methods in, for example, information retrieval settings and others.

Applications of text classification include recommendation systems, personalization, help desk automation, content filtering and routing, selective alerting, and text mining. This paper describes an experiment for improving the classification accuracy of a large text corpus by the use of dimensionality reduction and multiple-classifier combination techniques. Three different classifiers have been used namely Naive Bayes, J48 Decision Tree and Decision Table. The results of these classifiers are combined using techniques such as Simple Voting, Weighted Voting and Probability-based Voting. The classification accuracy is further improved by the use of a dimensionality reduction method based on concept indexing. Experiments conducted on the Reuters 21578 dataset indicate that the combination approach provides an improved and scalable method for text classification. Also, it is observed that concept indexing helps with classification accuracy in addition to efficiency and scalability.

The semiparametric model assumes that, after unspecified univariate monotone transformations, the class distributions are multivariate normal. We introduce an estimation procedure based on the distribution quantiles, in which the parameters of the sermparametric model are estimated directly without estimating the nonparametric transformations. The procedure is computationally fast and the estimation accuracy is shown to have the usual parametric rate. The relationship between the method and more general nonparametric discriminant analysis is discussed. The semiparametric specification of the class densities is a submodel of the nonparametric log density functional analysis of variance model in which the main effects are completely nonparametric but the interaction terms are specified semiparametrically. Simulations and real examples are used to illustrate the procedure.	Univ Wisconsin, Dept Stat, Madison, WI 53706 USA	Lin, Y (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Stat, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

In recent years, the area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve, or simply AUC, has been proposed as an alternative single-number measure for evaluating performance of learning algorithms. In our previous work, we proved that AUC is, in general, a better measure (defined precisely) than accuracy. Many popular data mining algorithms should then be re-evaluated in terms of AUC. For example, it is well accepted that Naive Bayes and decision trees are very similar in accuracy. How do they compare in AUC? Also, how does the recently developed SVM (Support Vector Machine) compare to traditional learning algorithms in accuracy and AUC? We will answer these questions in this paper Our conclusions will provide important guidelines in data mining applications on real-world datasets.

This is especially true when learning parameters for incorrect structures, such as Naive Bayes (NB). In searching for algorithms to learn better BN classifiers, this paper uses ELR to learn parameters of more nearly correct BN structures - e.g., of a general Bayesian network (GBN) learned from a structure-learning algorithm [2]. While OFE typically produces more accurate classifiers with GBN (vs. NB), we show that ELR does not, when the training data is not sufficient for the GBN structure learner to produce a good model. Our empirical studies also suggest that the better the BN structure is, the less advantages ELR has over OFE, for classification purposes. ELR learning on NB (i.e., with little structural knowledge) still performs about the same as OFE on GBN in classification accuracy, over a large number of standard benchmark datasets.

But this assumption is not obviously hold in many real world domains. Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN) is a state-of-the-art extension of the naive Bayes, which can express partial dependence relations among attributes. In this paper, we analyze the implementations of two different TAN classifiers and their tree structures. Experiments show how different dependence relations impact on accuracy of TAN classifiers. We present a kind of semi-lazy TAN classifier, which builds a TAN identical to the original TAN at training time, but adjusts the dependence relations for a new test instance at classification time. Our extensive experimental results show that this kind of semi-lazy classifier delivers lower error than the original TAN and is more efficient than Superparent TAN.

As most of them pointed out, this task requires learning algorithms that should work on-line, incorporate new information incrementality, and should exhibit the capacity to deal with concept-drift. In this paper we present Adaptive Bayes, an extension to the well-known naive-Bayes, one of the most common used learning algorithms for the task of user modeling. Adaptive Bayes is an incremental learning algorithm that could work on-line. We have evaluated Adaptive Bayes on both frameworks. Using a set of benchmark problems from the UCI repository [2], and using several evaluation statistics, all the adaptive systems show significant advantages in comparison against their non-adaptive versions.

In this paper, we suggest the method of prediction by using associative user clustering and Bayesian estimated value to complement the problems of the current collaborative filtering system. The Representative Attribute-Neighborhood is for an active user to select the nearest neighbors who have similar preference through extracting the representative attributes that most affects the preference. Associative user behavior pattern 3_UB(associative users are composed of 3-users) is clustered according to the genre through Association Rule Hypergraph Partitioning Algorithm, and new users are classified into one of these genres by Naive Bayes classifier. Besides, to get the similarity between users belonged to the classified genre and new users, this paper allows the different estimated values to items which users evaluated through Naive Bayes learning. We evaluate our method on a large CF database of user rating and it significantly outperforms the previous proposed method.

In this paper we propose a new architecture for modeling high-dimensional data that requires resources (parameters and computations) that grow only at most as the square of the number of variables, using a multi-layer neural network to represent the joint distribution of the variables as the product of conditional distributions. The neural network can be interpreted as a graphical model without hidden random variables, but in which the conditional distributions are tied through the hidden units. The connectivity of the neural network can be pruned by using dependency tests between the variables. Experiments on modeling the distribution of several discrete data sets show statistically significant improvements over other methods such as naive Bayes and comparable Bayesian networks, and show that significant improvements can be obtained by pruning the network.

This paper describes five decision-level sensor-fusion techniques and their common optimisation method. The performance of the sensor-fusion techniques is evaluated by means of Receiver Operator Characteristics curves. These techniques are tested on an outdoor test facility. Three of four test lanes of this facility are used as training set and the fourth is used as evaluation set. The detection performance of naive Bayes, Dempster-Shafer, voting and linear discriminant are very similar on both the training and the evaluation set. This is probably caused by the flexibility of the sensor-fusion techniques resulting into similar optimal solutions independent of the fusion technique.

J	Bollacker, KD; Ghosh, J				Bollacker, KD; Ghosh, J			Effective supra-classifiers for knowledge base construction	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						knowledge reuse; evolving knowledge base; Hamming nearest neighbor		We explore the use of the supra-classifier framework in the construction of a classifier knowledge base. Previously, we introduced this framework within which labels produced by old classifiers are used to improve the generalization performance of a new classifier for a different but related classification task (Bollacker and Ghosh, 1998). We showed empirically that a simple Hamming nearest neighbor is superior to other techniques (e.g., multilayer perception (MLP), decision trees, Naive Bayes, Combiners) as a supra-classifier, Here, we describe theoretically how the probability that the Hamming nearest neighbor supra-classifier will predict the true target class approaches certainty at an exponential rate as more classifiers are reused. The scalability of the Hamming nearest neighbor with large numbers of previously created classifiers makes it a good choice as a supra-classifier in the application of building a repository of domain knowledge organized as a classifier knowledge base.

Firstly, the concept of mean potentiality approach (MPA) has been developed and an algorithm based on this new approach has been proposed to get a balanced solution of a fuzzy soft set based decision making problem. Secondly, a parameter reduction procedure based on relational algebra with the help of the balanced algorithm of mean potentiality approach has been used to reduce the choice parameter set in the parlance of fuzzy soft set theory and it is justified to the problems of diagnosis of a disease from the myriad of symptoms from medical science. Moreover the feasibility of this proposed method is demonstrated by comparing with Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Naive Bayes classification method and Feng's method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

These small RNAs have now been shown to be critical regulators in a number of biological processes in the cell including pathophysiology of diseases like cancers. The increasingly evident roles of microRNA in disease processes have also motivated attempts to target them therapeutically. Recently there has been immense interest in understanding small molecule mediated regulation of RNA, including microRNA. Results: We have used publicly available datasets of high throughput screens on small molecules with potential to inhibit microRNA. We employed computational methods based on chemical descriptors and machine learning to create predictive computational models for biological activity of small molecules. We further used a substructure based approach to understand common substructures potentially contributing to the activity. Conclusion: We generated computational models based on Naive Bayes and Random Forest towards mining small RNA binding molecules from large molecular datasets. We complement this with substructure based approach to identify and understand potentially enriched substructures in the active dataset. We use this approach to identify miRNA binding potential of a set of approved drugs, suggesting a probable novel mechanism of off-target activity of these drugs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and most comprehensive computational analysis towards understanding RNA binding activities of small molecules and predictive modeling of these activities.

The present study was conducted to investigate the alterations in the serum proteome in GBM patients compared to healthy controls. Comparative proteomic analysis was performed employing classical 2DE and 2D-DIGE combined with MALDI TOF/TOF MS and results were further validated through Western blotting and immunoturbidimetric assay. Comparison of the serum proteome of GBM and healthy subjects revealed 55 differentially expressed and statistically significant (p <0.05) protein spots. Among the identified proteins, haptoglobin, plasminogen precursor, apolipoprotein A-1 and M, and transthyretin are very significant due to their functional consequences in glioma tumor growth and migration, and could further be studied as glioma biomarkers and grade-specific protein signatures. Analysis of the lipoprotein pattern indicated elevated serum levels of cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and low-density lipoproteins in GBM patients. Functional pathway analysis was performed using multiple software including ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA), protein analysis through evolutionary relationships (PANTHER), database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID), and GeneSpring to investigate the biological context of the identified proteins, which revealed the association of candidate proteins in a few essential physiological pathways such as intrinsic prothrombin activation pathway, plasminogen activating cascade, coagulation system, glioma invasiveness signaling, and PI3K signaling in B lymphocytes. A subset of the differentially expressed proteins was applied to build statistical sample class prediction models for discrimination of GBM patients and healthy controls employing partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and other machine learning methods such as support vector machine (SVM), Decision Tree and Naive Bayes, and excellent discrimination between GBM and control groups was accomplished.

An Efficient High-Frequency Linear RF Amplifier Synthesis Method Based on Evolutionary Computation and Machine Learning Techniques	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Differential evolution; efficient global optimization; expensive black-box optimization; Gaussian process; mm-wave frequency; radio frequency (RF) circuit synthesis	GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; POWER-AMPLIFIER; DESIGN; LAYOUT; TOOL; ICS	Existing radio frequency (RF) integrated circuit (IC) design automation methods focus on the synthesis of circuits at a few GHz, typically less than 10 GHz. That framework is difficult to apply to RF IC synthesis at mm-wave frequencies (e. g., 60-100 GHz). In this paper, a new method, called efficient machine learning-based differential evolution, is presented for mm-wave frequency linear RF amplifier synthesis. By using electromagnetic (EM) simulations to evaluate the key passive components, the evaluation of circuit performances is accurate and solves the limitations of parasitic-included equivalent circuit models and predefined layout templates used in the existing synthesis framework. A decomposition method separates the design variables that require expensive EM simulations and the variables that only need cheap circuit simulations. Hence, a low-dimensional expensive optimization problem is generated. By the newly proposed core algorithm integrating adaptive population generation, naive Bayes classification, Gaussian process and differential evolution, the generated low-dimensional expensive optimization problem can be solved efficiently (by the online surrogate model), and global search (by evolutionary computation) can be achieved. A 100 GHz three-stage differential amplifier is synthesized in a 90 nm CMOS technology. The power gain reaches 10 dB with more than 20 GHz bandwidth. The synthesis costs only 25 h, having a comparable result and a nine times speed enhancement compared with directly using the EM simulator and global optimization algorithms.

Therefore, new computational tools are needed to facilitate assay design. In the isothermal EXPonential Amplification Reaction (EXPAR), template sequences with similar thermodynamic characteristics perform very differently. To understand what causes this variability, we characterized the performance of 384 template sequences, and used this data to develop two computational methods to predict EXPAR template performance based on sequence: a position weight matrix approach with support vector machine classifier, and RELIEF attribute evaluation with Naive Bayes classification. The methods identified well and poorly performing EXPAR templates with 67-70% sensitivity and 77-80% specificity. We combined these methods into a computational tool that can accelerate new assay design by ruling out likely poor performers. Furthermore, our data suggest that variability in template performance is linked to specific sequence motifs. Cytidine, a pyrimidine base, is over-represented in certain positions of well-performing templates. Guanosine and adenosine, both purine bases, are over-represented in similar regions of poorly performing templates, frequently as GA or AG dimers. Since polymerases have a higher affinity for purine oligonucleotides, polymerase binding to GA-rich regions of a single-stranded DNA template may promote non-specific amplification in EXPAR and other nucleic acid amplification reactions.

They function as messengers for transferring genetic information from DNA to proteins, as the primary genetic material in many viruses, as catalysts (ribozymes) important for protein synthesis and RNA processing, and as essential and ubiquitous regulators of gene expression in living organisms. Many of these functions depend on precisely orchestrated interactions between RNA molecules and specific proteins in cells. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which proteins recognize and bind RNA is essential for comprehending the functional implications of these interactions, but the recognition 'code' that mediates interactions between proteins and RNA is not yet understood. Success in deciphering this code would dramatically impact the development of new therapeutic strategies for intervening in devastating diseases such as AIDS and cancer. Because of the high cost of experimental determination of protein-RNA interfaces, there is an increasing reliance on statistical machine learning methods for training predictors of RNA-binding residues in proteins. However, because of differences in the choice of datasets, performance measures, and data representations used, it has been difficult to obtain an accurate assessment of the current state of the art in protein-RNA interface prediction. Results: We provide a review of published approaches for predicting RNA-binding residues in proteins and a systematic comparison and critical assessment of protein-RNA interface residue predictors trained using these approaches on three carefully curated non-redundant datasets. We directly compare two widely used machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) using three different data representations in which features are encoded using either sequence-or structure-based windows. Our results show that (i) Sequence-based classifiers that use a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM)-based representation (PSSMSeq) outperform those that use an amino acid identity based representation (IDSeq) or a smoothed PSSM (SmoPSSMSeq); (ii) Structure-based classifiers that use smoothed PSSM representation (SmoPSSMStr) outperform those that use PSSM (PSSMStr) as well as sequence identity based representation (IDStr). PSSMSeq classifiers, when tested on an independent test set of 44 proteins, achieve performance that is comparable to that of three state-of-the-art structure-based predictors (including those that exploit geometric features) in terms of Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), although the structure-based methods achieve substantially higher Specificity (albeit at the expense of Sensitivity) compared to sequence-based methods. We also find that the expected performance of the classifiers on a residue level can be markedly different from that on a protein level. Our experiments show that the classifiers trained on three different non-redundant protein-RNA interface datasets achieve comparable cross-validation performance. However, we find that the results are significantly affected by differences in the distance threshold used to define interface residues. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that protein-RNA interface residue predictors that use a PSSM-based encoding of sequence windows outperform classifiers that use other encodings of sequence windows. While structure-based methods that exploit geometric features can yield significant increases in the Specificity of protein-RNA interface residue predictions, such increases are offset by decreases in Sensitivity. These results underscore the importance of comparing alternative methods using rigorous statistical procedures, multiple performance measures, and datasets that are constructed based on several alternative definitions of interface residues and redundancy cutoffs as well as including evaluations on independent test sets into the comparisons.

J	Javed, K; Babri, HA; Saeed, M				Javed, Kashif; Babri, Haroon A.; Saeed, Mehreen			Feature Selection Based on Class-Dependent Densities for High-Dimensional Binary Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Feature ranking; binary data; feature subset selection; two-stage feature selection; classification	MUTUAL INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION; REDUNDANCY; RELEVANCE	Data and knowledge management systems employ feature selection algorithms for removing irrelevant, redundant, and noisy information from the data. There are two well-known approaches to feature selection, feature ranking (FR) and feature subset selection (FSS). In this paper, we propose a new FR algorithm, termed as class-dependent density-based feature elimination (CDFE), for binary data sets. Our theoretical analysis shows that CDFE computes the weights, used for feature ranking, more efficiently as compared to the mutual information measure. Effectively, rankings obtained from both the two criteria approximate each other. CDFE uses a filtrapper approach to select a final subset. For data sets having hundreds of thousands of features, feature selection with FR algorithms is simple and computationally efficient but redundant information may not be removed. On the other hand, FSS algorithms analyze the data for redundancies but may become computationally impractical on high-dimensional data sets. We address these problems by combining FR and FSS methods in the form of a two-stage feature selection algorithm. When introduced as a preprocessing step to the FSS algorithms, CDFE not only presents them with a feature subset, good in terms of classification, but also relieves them from heavy computations. Two FSS algorithms are employed in the second stage to test the two-stage feature selection idea. We carry out experiments with two different classifiers (naive Bayes' and kernel ridge regression) on three different real-life data sets (NOVA, HIVA, and GINA) of the "Agnostic Learning versus Prior Knowledge" challenge. As a stand-alone method, CDFE shows up to about 92 percent reduction in the feature set size. When combined with the FSS algorithms in two-stages, CDFE significantly improves their classification accuracy and exhibits up to 97 percent reduction in the feature set size. We also compared CDFE against the winning entries of the challenge and found that it outperforms the best results on NOVA and HIVA while obtaining a third position in case of GINA.

In contrast to previous approaches, we maintain the normalization constraints on the parameters of the Bayesian network during optimization, i.e., the probabilistic interpretation of the model is not lost. This enables us to handle missing features in discriminatively optimized Bayesian networks. In experiments, we compare the classification performance of maximum margin parameter learning to conditional likelihood and maximum likelihood learning approaches. Discriminative parameter learning significantly outperforms generative maximum likelihood estimation for naive Bayes and tree augmented naive Bayes structures on all considered data sets. Furthermore, maximizing the margin dominates the conditional likelihood approach in terms of classification performance in most cases. We provide results for a recently proposed maximum margin optimization approach based on convex relaxation [1]. While the classification results are highly similar, our CG-based optimization is computationally up to orders of magnitude faster. Margin-optimized Bayesian network classifiers achieve classification performance comparable to support vector machines (SVMs) using fewer parameters. Moreover, we show that unanticipated missing feature values during classification can be easily processed by discriminatively optimized Bayesian network classifiers, a case where discriminative classifiers usually require mechanisms to complete unknown feature values in the data first.

DETECTION OF HUANGLONGBING DISEASE IN CITRUS USING FLUORESCENCE SPECTROSCOPY	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						Bagged decision tree classifier; Citrus leaves; Fluorescence sensing; Huanglongbing; Naive-Bayes classifier	MULTISPECTRAL FLUORESCENCE; CLASSIFICATION; REFLECTANCE; STRESS; PLANTS	Huanglongbing (HLB) is an important citrus disease greatly affecting the citrus industry in Florida and other parts of the world. Early disease detection would control the spread of this disease through the application of suitable management measures. This study evaluates the application of fluorescence sensing for HLB detection of citrus leaves. A commercial handheld fluorescence sensor was used to collect yellow, red, and far-red fluorescence at ultraviolet (UV), blue, green, and red excitations from healthy, nutrient-deficient, and HLB-infected leaves of two different sweet orange cultivars, Hamlin and Valencia. Evaluation of the fluorescence sensing was performed under laboratory (controlled) and field conditions. The Naive-Bayes and the bagged decision tree classifiers were trained and tested to assess their performance in classifying the healthy and stressed (nutrient-deficient) leaves. Results revealed that the Naive-Bayes classifier yielded high classification accuracy under laboratory conditions (higher than 85%), while the bagged decision tree classifier yielded high overall classification accuracy under both laboratory and field conditions (higher than 94%). The bagged decision tree classifier performed better than the Naive-Bayes classifier; resulting in higher classification accuracy, although the computation time was at least 10 times greater than that of the Naive-Bayes classifier. In addition, feature extraction using forward feature selection indicated that fluorescence features such as yellow fluorescence (UV excitation) and simple fluorescence ratio (green excitation) contributed toward differentiating healthy leaves from nutrient-deficient and HLB-infected leaves.

J	Cai, T; Liu, WD				Cai, Tony; Liu, Weidong			A Direct Estimation Approach to Sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Classification; Constrained l(1) minimization; Fisher's rule; Naive Bayes rule; Sparsity	HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA; GENE-EXPRESSION; MATRIX ESTIMATION; CLASSIFICATION; CANCER	This article considers sparse linear discriminant analysis of high-dimensional data. In contrast to the existing methods which are based on separate estimation of the precision matrix Omega and the difference delta of the mean vectors, we introduce a simple and effective classifier by estimating the product Omega delta directly through constrained l(1) minimization. The estimator can be implemented efficiently using linear programming and the resulting classifier is called the linear programming discriminant (LPD) rule. The LPD rule is shown to have desirable theoretical and numerical properties. It exploits the approximate sparsity of Omega delta and as a consequence allows cases where it can still perform well even when Omega and/or delta cannot be estimated consistently. Asymptotic properties of the LPD rule are investigated and consistency and rate of convergence results are given. The LPD classifier has superior finite sample performance and significant computational advantages over the existing methods that require separate estimation of Omega and delta. The LPD rule is also applied to analyze real datasets from lung cancer and leukemia studies. The classifier performs favorably in comparison to existing methods.

Effect of SVM kernel functions on classification of vibration signals of a single point cutting tool	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature extraction; Decision Tree; Statistical features; Support Vector Machine; Tool condition monitoring	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; FAULT DIAGNOSTICS; ROLLER BEARING; WEAR; NETWORKS	The studies on tool condition monitoring along with digital signal processing can be used to prevent damages on cutting tools and workpieces when the tool conditions become faulty. These studies have become more relevant in today's context where the order realization dates are crunched and deadlines are to be met in order to catch up with the competition. Based on a continuous acquisition of signals with sensor systems it is possible to classify certain wear parameters by the extraction of features. Data mining approach is extensively used to probe into structural health of the tool and the process. This paper discusses condition monitoring of carbide tipped tool using Support Vector Machine and compares the classification efficiency between C-SVC and v-SVC. It further analyses the results with other classifiers like Decision Tree and Naive Bayes and Bayes Net.

OCA: Opinion Corpus for Arabic	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							TEXT CATEGORIZATION	Sentiment analysis is a challenging new task related to text mining and natural language processing. Although there are, at present, several studies related to this theme, most of these focus mainly on English texts. The resources available for opinion mining (OM) in other languages are still limited. In this article, we present a new Arabic corpus for the OM task that has been made available to the scientific community for research purposes. The corpus contains 500 movie reviews collected from different web pages and blogs in Arabic, 250 of them considered as positive reviews, and the other 250 as negative opinions. Furthermore, different experiments have been carried out on this corpus, using machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines and Naive Bayes. The results obtained are very promising and we are encouraged to continue this line of research.

The results show that it is possible to observe differences among species in the wood texture at this magnification. The micrographs have been processed in a simple way using segmentation and object recognition to identify the cross-section tracheids belonging to earlywood of 7 different timber species: Fagus sylvatica. Castanea sativa, Juglans regia, Eucalyptus globulus. Hymenaea courbaril, Pinus silvestris and Pinus radiata. We have analyzed the shape, number and distribution of the tracheids using 5 features: circularity, rectangularity, number of tracheids, distance between tracheids and average area. The extracted features are classified using different statistical methods: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic classification, Logistic regression, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks. A comparative study using gray level co-occurrence based features is also presented, with the improvement of using the segmentation method. Moreover, some additional results showing the possibility of using fractal analysis in this framework complete the research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Given an example x and a class c, a classifier usually works by estimating the probability of x being member of c (i.e., membership probability). Well calibrated classifiers are those able to provide accurate estimates of class membership probabilities, that is, the estimated probability (p) over cap (c vertical bar x) is close to p(c vertical bar(p) over cap (c vertical bar x)), which is the true, (unknown) empirical probability of x being member of c given that the probability estimated by the classifier is (p) over cap (c vertical bar x). Calibration is not a necessary property for producing accurate classifiers, and, thus, most of the research has focused on direct accuracy maximization strategies rather than on calibration. However, non-calibrated classifiers are problematic in applications where the reliability associated with a prediction must be taken into account. In these applications, a sensible use of the classifier must be based on the reliability of its predictions, and, thus, the classifier must be well calibrated. In this paper we show that lazy associative classifiers (LAC) are well calibrated using an MM.:based entropy minimization method. We investigate important applications where such characteristics (i.e., accuracy and calibration) are relevant, and we demonstrate empirically that LAC outperforms other classifiers, such as SVMs, Naive Bayes, and Decision Trees (even after these classifiers are calibrated). Additional highlights of LAC include the ability to incorporate reliable predictions for improving training, and the ability to refrain from doubtful predictions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

These graphical models provide, at first glance, a snapshot of the relevant relationships among the variables under consideration. We analyse the behaviour of the proposed methodology in a practical case, showing that it is a useful tool to help decision making when elaborating policies based on performance indicators. The methodology has been implemented in a software that interacts with the Elvira package for graphical models, and that is available to the administration board at the University of Almeria (Spain) through a web interface. The software also implements a new method for constructing composite indicators by using a Bayesian network regression model.

Differentiation between Viral and Bacterial Acute Infections Using Chemiluminescent Signatures of Circulating Phagocytes	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CHEMI-LUMINESCENCE; POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES; ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE; RESPIRATORY BURST; HUMAN-NEUTROPHILS; PNEUMONIA; BLOOD; CELLS; ACTIVATION; CHILDREN	Oftentimes the etiological diagnostic differentiation between viral and bacterial infections is problematic, while clinical management decisions need to be made promptly upon I admission. Thus, alternative rapid and sensitive diagnostic approaches need to be developed. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) or phagocytes act as major players in the defense response of the host during an episode of infection, and thereby undergo functional changes that differ according to the infections. PMNs functional activity can be characterized by quantification and localization of respiratory burst production and assessed by chemiluminescent (CL) byproduct reaction. We have assessed the functional states of PMNs of patients with acute infections in a luminol-amplified whole blood system using the component CL approach. In this study, blood was drawn from 69 patients with fever (>38 degrees C), and diagnosed as mainly viral or bacterial infections in origin. Data mining algorithms (C4.5, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes) were used to induce classification models to distinguish between clinical groups. The model with the best predictive accuracy was induced using C4.5 algorithm, resulting in 94.7% accuracy on the training set and 88.9% accuracy on the testing set. The method demonstrated a high predictive diagnostic value and may assist the clinician one day in the distinction between viral and bacterial infections and the choice of proper medication.

Performance comparison of machine learning algorithms and number of independent components used in fMRI decoding of belief vs. disbelief	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Machine learning; Classifier; fMRI; Interpretability; Optimization; Independent component analysis	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; REAL-TIME FMRI; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; PREDICTION; SELECTION; PATTERNS; ACCURATE; ROBUST	Machine learning (ML) has become a popular tool for mining functional neuroimaging data, and there are now hopes of performing such analyses efficiently in real-time. Towards this goal, we compared accuracy of six different ML algorithms applied to neuroimaging data of persons engaged in a bivariate task, asserting their belief or disbelief of a variety of propositional statements. We performed unsupervised dimension reduction and automated feature extraction using independent component (IC) analysis and extracted IC time courses. Optimization of classification hyperparameters across each classifier occurred prior to assessment. Maximum accuracy was achieved at 92% for Random Forest, followed by 91% for AdaBoost, 89% for Naive Bayes, 87% for a J48 decision tree, 86% for K* and 84% for support vector machine. For real-time decoding applications, finding a parsimonious subset of diagnostic ICs might be useful. We used a forward search technique to sequentially add ranked ICs to the feature subspace. For the current data set, we determined that approximately six ICs represented a meaningful basis set for classification. We then projected these six IC spatial maps forward onto a later scanning session within subject. We then applied the optimized ML algorithms to these new data instances, and found that classification accuracy results were reproducible. Additionally, we compared our classification method to our previously published general linear model results on this same data set. The highest ranked IC spatial maps show similarity to brain regions associated with contrasts for belief > disbelief, and disbelief < belief. 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Douglas, P.

Several approaches exist, but they have limited performance. Here, we present a new scheme to infer protein quaternary structure from lattice and protein information, with all-around coverage for strong, weak and very weak affinity homomeric and heteromeric complexes. The scheme combines naive Bayes classifier and point group symmetry under Boolean framework to detect quaternary structures in crystal lattice. It consistently produces >= 90% coverage across diverse benchmarking data sets, including a notably superior 95% coverage for recognition heteromeric complexes, compared with 53% on the same data set by current state-of-the-art method. The detailed study of a limited number of prediction-failed cases offers interesting insights into the intriguing nature of protein contacts in lattice. The findings have implications for accurate inference of quaternary states of proteins, especially weak affinity complexes.

J	Jiang, LX				Jiang, Liangxiao			Random one-dependence estimators	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Naive Bayes; One-dependence estimators; Random selection; Classification; Class probability estimation; Ranking	NAIVE BAYES; ROC CURVE; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; AREA	Many approaches attempt to improve naive Bayes and have been broadly divided into five main categories: (1) structure extension; (2) attribute weighting; (3) attribute selection; (4) instance weighting; (5) instance selection, also called local learning. In this paper, we work on the approach of structure extension and single out a random Bayes model by augmenting the structure of naive Bayes. We called it random one-dependence estimators, simply RODE. In RODE, each attribute has at most one parent from other attributes and this parent is randomly selected from log(2)m (where m is the number of attributes) attributes with the maximal conditional mutual information. Our work conducts the randomness into Bayesian network classifiers. The experimental results on a large number of UCI data sets validate its effectiveness in terms of classification, class probability estimation, and ranking. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Methods and materials: The test collection is the data used in large-scale systematic review on the topic of the dissemination strategy of health care services for elderly people. From a group of 47,274 abstracts marked by human reviewers to be included in or excluded from further screening, we randomly selected 20,000 as a training set, with the remaining 27,274 becoming a separate test set. As a machine learning algorithm we used complement naive Bayes. We tested both a global classification method, where a single classifier is trained on instances of abstracts and their classification (i.e., included or excluded), and a novel per-question classification method that trains multiple classifiers for each abstract, exploiting the specific protocol (questions) of the systematic review. For the per-question method we tested four ways of combining the results of the classifiers trained for the individual questions. As evaluation measures, we calculated precision and recall for several settings of the two methods. It is most important not to exclude any relevant documents (i.e., to attain high recall for the class of interest) but also desirable to exclude most of the non-relevant documents (i.e., to attain high precision on the class of interest) in order to reduce human workload. Results: For the global method, the highest recall was 67.8% and the highest precision was 37.9%. For the per-question method, the highest recall was 99.2%, and the highest precision was 63%. The human-machine workflow proposed in this paper achieved a recall value of 99.6%, and a precision value of 17.8%. Conclusion: The per-question method that combines classifiers following the specific protocol of the review leads to better results than the global method in terms of recall. Because neither method is efficient enough to classify abstracts reliably by itself, the technology should be applied in a semi-automatic way, with a human expert still involved. When the workflow includes one human expert and the trained automatic classifier, recall improves to an acceptable level, showing that automatic classification techniques can reduce the human workload in the process of building a systematic review.

Serum biomarker profiles as diagnostic tools in lung cancer	CANCER BIOMARKERS			English	Article						Lung cancer; NSCLC; diagnosis; serum biomarkers; CT-scanning	MIGRATION INHIBITORY FACTOR; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; POTENTIAL BIOMARKER; PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; POOR-PROGNOSIS; TUMOR-MARKERS; GROWTH-FACTOR; EXPRESSION; PROLACTIN; CARCINOMA	Background: Computed tomography (CT) scanning has emerged as an effective means of early detection for lung cancer. Despite marked improvement over earlier methodologies, the low level of specificity demonstrated by CT scanning has limited its clinical implementation as a screening tool. A minimally-invasive biomarker-based test that could further characterize CT-positive patients based on risk of malignancy would greatly enhance its clinical efficacy. Methods: We performed an analysis of 81 serum proteins in 92 patients diagnosed with lung cancer and 172 CT-screened control individuals. We utilize a series of bioinformatics algorithms including Metropolis-Monte Carlo, artificial neural networks, Naive Bayes, and additive logistic regression to identify multimarker panels capable of discriminating cases from controls with high levels of sensitivity and specificity in distinct training and independent validation sets. Results: A three-biomarker panel comprised of MIF, prolactin, and thrombospondin identified using the Metropolis-Monte Carlo algorithm provided the best classification with a % Sensitivity/Specificity/Accuracy of 74/90/86 in the training set and 70/93/82 in the validation set. This panel was effective in the classification of control individuals demonstrating suspicious pulmonary nodules and stage I lung cancer patients. Conclusions: The selected serum biomarker panel demonstrated a high diagnostic utility in the current study and performance characteristics which compare favorably with previous reports. Further advancements may lead to the development of a diagnostic tool useful as an adjunct to CT-scanning.

Standard programs, such as MASCOT, provide peptide assignments for many of the spectra, including identification of PTM sites, but these results are plagued by false-positive identifications. In phosphoproteomic experiments, only a single peptide assignment is typically available to support identification of each phosphorylation site, and hence minimizing false positives is critical. Thus, tedious manual validation is often required to increase confidence in the spectral assignments. We have developed phoMSVal, an open-source platform for managing MS/MS data and automatically validating identified phosphopeptides. We tested five classification algorithms with 17 extracted features to separate correct peptide assignments from incorrect ones using over 2600 manually curated spectra. The naive Bayes algorithm was among the best classifiers with an AUC value of 97% and PPV of 97% for phosphotyrosine data. This classifier required only three features to achieve a 76% decrease in false positives as compared with MASCOT while retaining 97% of true positives. This algorithm was able to classify an independent phosphoserine/threonine data set with AUC value of 93% and PPV of 91%, demonstrating the applicability of this method for all types of phospho-MS/MS data.

An adaptive Kalman-based Bayes estimation technique to classify locomotor activities in young and elderly adults through accelerometers	MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS			English	Article						Activity monitoring; Accelerometer; Bayes estimation; Classification; Kalman filter	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; TRIAXIAL ACCELEROMETER; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; ORIENTATION; PATTERNS; WALKING; SYSTEM; INDIVIDUALS; OVERWEIGHT; GYROSCOPES	An accelerometer-based system able to classify among different locomotor activities during real life conditions is here presented, and its performance evaluated. Epochs of walking at different speeds, and with different slopes, and stair descending and ascending, are detected, segmented, and classified by using an adaptation of a naive 2D-Bayes classifier, which is updated on-line through the history of the estimated activities, in a Kalman-based scheme. The feature pair used for classification is mapped from an ensemble of 16 features extracted from the accelerometer data for each activity epoch. Two different versions of the classifier are presented to combine the multi-dimensional nature of the accelerometer data, and their results are compared in terms of correct recognition rate of the segmented activities, on two population samples of different age. The classification algorithm achieves correct classification rates higher than 90% and higher than 92%, for young and elderly adults, respectively. (c) 2010 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Analyzing taxonomic classification using extensible Markov models	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							16S RIBOSOMAL-RNA	Motivation: As next generation sequencing is rapidly adding new genomes, their correct placement in the taxonomy needs verification. However, the current methods for confirming classification of a taxon or suggesting revision for a potential misplacement relies on computationally intense multi-sequence alignment followed by an iterative adjustment of the distance matrix. Due to intra-heterogeneity issues with the 16S rRNA marker, no classifier is available for sub-genus level, which could readily suggest a classification for a novel 16S rRNA sequence. Metagenomics further complicates the issue by generating fragmented 16S rRNA sequences. This article proposes a novel alignment-free method for representing the microbial profiles using extensible Markov models (EMMs) with an extended Karlin-Altschul statistical framework similar to the classic alignment paradigm. We propose a log odds (LODs) score classifier based on Gumbel difference distribution that confirms correct classifications with statistical significance qualifications and suggests revisions where necessary. Results: We tested our method by generating a sub-genus level classifier with which we re-evaluated classifications of 676 microbial organisms using the NCBI FTP database for the 16S rRNA. The results confirm current classification for all genera while ascertaining significance at 95%. Furthermore, this novel classifier isolates heterogeneity issues to a mere 12 strains while confirming classifications with significance qualification for the remaining 98%. The models require less memory than that needed by multi-sequence alignments and have better time complexity than the current methods. The classifier operates at sub-genus level, and thus outperforms the naive Bayes classifier of the RNA Database Project where much of the taxonomic analysis is available online. Finally, using information redundancy in model building, we show that the method applies to metagenomic fragment classification of 19 Escherichia coli strains.

J	Dayanik, A				Dayanik, Aynur			Feature interval learning algorithms for classification	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Classification learning; Inductive learning; Feature partitioning; Adaptive feature weights	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR; DECISION TREE; NAIVE BAYES; INSTANCE	This paper presents Feature Interval Learning algorithms (FIL) which represent multi-concept descriptions in the form of disjoint feature intervals. The FIL algorithms are batch supervised inductive learning algorithms and use feature projections of the training instances to represent induced classification knowledge. The concept description is learned separately for each feature and is in the form of a set of disjoint intervals. The class of an unseen instance is determined by the weighted-majority voting of the feature predictions. The basic FIL algorithm is enhanced with adaptive interval and feature weight schemes in order to handle noisy and irrelevant features. The algorithms are empirically evaluated on twelve data sets from the UCI repository and are compared with k-NN, k-NNFP, and NBC classification algorithms. The experiments demonstrate that the FIL algorithms are robust to irrelevant features and missing feature values, achieve accuracy comparable to the best of the existing algorithms with significantly less average running times.

Classification of Protein-Protein Interaction Full-Text Documents Using Text and Citation Network Features	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Text mining; literature mining; binary classification; protein-protein interaction; citation network	RETRIEVAL; SYSTEM; GENES	We participated ( as Team 9) in the Article Classification Task of the Biocreative II.5 Challenge: binary classification of full-text documents relevant for protein-protein interaction. We used two distinct classifiers for the online and offline challenges: 1) the lightweight Variable Trigonometric Threshold (VTT) linear classifier we successfully introduced in BioCreative 2 for binary classification of abstracts and 2) a novel Naive Bayes classifier using features from the citation network of the relevant literature. We supplemented the supplied training data with full-text documents from the MIPS database. The lightweight VTT classifier was very competitive in this new full-text scenario: it was a top-performing submission in this task, taking into account the rank product of the Area Under the interpolated precision and recall Curve, Accuracy, Balanced F-Score, and Matthew's Correlation Coefficient performance measures. The novel citation network classifier for the biomedical text mining domain, while not a top performing classifier in the challenge, performed above the central tendency of all submissions, and therefore indicates a promising new avenue to investigate further in bibliome informatics.

Evaluation by Data Mining Techniques of Fluconazole Breakpoints Established by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and Comparison with Those of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST)	ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY			English	Article							INTERPRETIVE BREAKPOINTS; THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE; CANDIDA-INFECTIONS; DOSE/MIC RATIO; ITRACONAZOLE; ASSOCIATION; RESISTANCE; MORTALITY; M27-A2; MICS	The EUCAST and the CLSI have established different breakpoints for fluconazole and Candida spp. However, the reference methodologies employed to obtain the MICs provide similar results. The aim of this work was to apply supervised classification algorithms to analyze the clinical data used by the CLSI to establish fluconazole breakpoints for Candida infections and to compare these data with the results obtained with the data set used to set up EUCAST fluconazole breakpoints, where the MIC for detecting failures was >4 mg/liter, with a sensitivity of 87%, a false-positive rate of 8%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.89. Five supervised classifiers (J48 and CART decision trees, the OneR decision rule, the naive Bayes classifier, and simple logistic regression) were used to analyze the original cohort of patients (Rex's data set), which was used to establish CLSI breakpoints, and a later cohort of candidemia (Clancy's data set), with which CLSI breakpoints were validated. The target variable was the outcome of the infections, and the predictor variable was the MIC or dose/MIC ratio. For Rex's data set, the MIC detecting failures was >8 mg/liter, and for Clancy's data set, the MIC detecting failures was >4 mg/liter, in close agreement with the EUCAST breakpoint (MIC > 4 mg/liter). The sensitivities, false-positive rates, and areas under the ROC curve obtained by means of CART, the algorithm with the best statistical results, were 52%, 18%, and 0.7, respectively, for Rex's data set and 65%, 6%, and 0.72, respectively, for Clancy's data set. In addition, the correlation between outcome and dose/MIC ratio was analyzed for Clancy's data set, where a dose/MIC ratio of > 75 was associated with successes, with a sensitivity of 93%, a false-positive rate of 29%, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.83. This dose/MIC ratio of > 75 was identical to that found for the cohorts used by EUCAST to establish their breakpoints ( a dose/MIC ratio of > 75, with a sensitivity of 91%, a false-positive rate of 10%, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.90).

Development of a five-year mortality model in systemic sclerosis patients by different analytical approaches	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RHEUMATOLOGY			English	Article						Systemic sclerosis; survival; Cox regression; data mining; Naive Bayes	SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; COX PROPORTIONAL-HAZARDS; BREAST-CANCER; FEATURE-SELECTION; UNITED-STATES; SURVIVAL; SCLERODERMA; DISEASE; DEATH; PROGNOSIS	Objective. Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a multiorgan disease with high mortality rates. Several clinical features have been associated with poor survival in different populations of SSc patients, but no clear and reproducible prognostic model to assess individual survival prediction in scleroderma patients has ever been developed. Methods. We used Cox regression and three data mining-based classifiers (Naive Bayes Classifier [NBC], Random Forests [RND-F] and logistic regression [Log-Reg]) to develop a robust and reproducible 5-year prognostic model. All the models were built and internally validated by means of 5-fold cross-validation on a population of 558 Italian SSc patients. Their predictive ability and capability of generalisation was then tested on an independent population of 356 patients recruited from 5 external centres and finally compared to the predictions made by two SSc domain experts on the same population. Results. The NBC outperformed the Cox-based classifier and the other data mining algorithms after internal cross-validation (area under receiving operator characteristic curve, AUROC: NBC=0.759; RND-F=0.736; Log-Reg=0.754 and Cox= 0.724). The NBC had also a remarkable and better trade-off between sensitivity and specificity (e.g. Balanced accuracy, BA) than the Cox-based classifier, when tested on an independent population of SSc patients (BA: NBC=0.769, Cox=0.622). The NBC was also superior to domain experts in predicting 5-year survival in this population (AUROC=0.829 vs. AUROC=0.788 and BA=0.769 vs. BA=0.67). Conclusion. We provide a model to make consistent 5-year prognostic predictions in SSc patients. Its internal validity, as well as capability of generalisation and reduced uncertainty compared to human experts support its use at bedside.

While prior methods can accurately identify the location of hosts in some regions of the Internet, they produce erroneous results when the delay or topology measurement on which they are based is limited. The hypothesis of our work is that the accuracy of IP geolocation can be improved through the creation of a flexible analytic framework that accommodates different types of geolocation information. In this paper, we describe a new framework for IP geolocation that reduces to a machine-learning classification problem. Our methodology considers a set of lightweight measurements from a set of known monitors to a target, and then classifies the location of that target based on the most probable geographic region given probability densities learned from a training set. For this study, we employ a Naive Bayes framework that has low computational complexity and enables additional environmental information to be easily added to enhance the classification process. To demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our approach, we test IP geolocation on over 16,000 routers given ping measurements from 78 monitors with known geographic placement. Our results show that the simple application of our method improves geolocation accuracy for over 96% of the nodes identified in our data set, with on average accuracy 70 miles closer to the true geographic location versus prior constraint-based geolocation. These results highlight the promise of our method and indicate how future expansion of the classifier can lead to further improvements in geolocation accuracy.

Chi-square-based Scoring Function for Categorization of MEDLINE Citations	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Applied statistics; text mining; natural language processing; document categorization	DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION; BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE; ALGORITHMS	Objectives: Text categorization has been used in biomedical informatics for identifying documents containing relevant topics of interest. We developed a simple method that uses a chi-square-based scoring function to determine the likelihood of MEDLINE (R) citations containing genetic relevant topic. Methods: Our procedure requires construction of a genetic and a nongenetic domain document corpus. We used MeSH (R) descriptors assigned to MEDLINE citations for this categorization task. We compared frequencies of MeSH descriptors between two corpora applying chi-square test. A MeSH descriptor was considered to be a positive indicator if its relative observed frequency in the genetic domain corpus was greater than its relative observed frequency in the nongenetic domain corpus. The output of the proposed method is a list of scores for all the citations, with the highest score given to those citations containing MeSH descriptors typical for the genetic domain. Results: Validation was done on a set of 734 manually annotated MEDLINE citations. It achieved predictive accuracy of 0.87 with 0.69 recall and 0.64 precision. We evaluated the method by comparing it to three machine-learning algorithms (support vector machines, decision trees, naive Bayes). Although the differences were not statistically significantly different, results showed that our chi-square scoring performs as good as compared machine-learning algorithms. Conclusions: We suggest that the chi-square scoring is an effective solution to help categorize MEDLINE citations. The algorithm is implemented in the BITOLA literature-based discovery support system as a preprocessor for gene symbol disambiguation process.

In our work, we provide reliable confidence measures for the assessment of stroke risk, using the Conformal Prediction framework. This framework provides a way for assigning valid confidence measures to predictions of classical machine learning algorithms. We conduct experiments on a dataset which contains morphological features derived from ultrasound images of atherosclerotic carotid plaques, and we evaluate the results of four different Conformal Predictors (CPs). The four CPs are based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Naive Bayes classification (NBC), and k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN). The results given by all CPs demonstrate the reliability and usefulness of the obtained confidence measures on the problem of stroke risk assessment.

Bayesian Classifiers Programmed in SQL	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Classification; K-means; query optimization		The Bayesian classifier is a fundamental classification technique. In this work, we focus on programming Bayesian classifiers in SQL. We introduce two classifiers: Naive Bayes and a classifier based on class decomposition using K-means clustering. We consider two complementary tasks: model computation and scoring a data set. We study several layouts for tables and several indexing alternatives. We analyze how to transform equations into efficient SQL queries and introduce several query optimizations. We conduct experiments with real and synthetic data sets to evaluate classification accuracy, query optimizations, and scalability. Our Bayesian classifier is more accurate than Naive Bayes and decision trees. Distance computation is significantly accelerated with horizontal layout for tables, denormalization, and pivoting. We also compare Naive Bayes implementations in SQL and C++: SQL is about four times slower. Our Bayesian classifier in SQL achieves high classification accuracy, can efficiently analyze large data sets, and has linear scalability.

Early detection of exudates could improve patients' chances to avoid blindness. In this paper, we present a series of experiments on feature selection and exudates classification using naive Bayes and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. We first fit the naive Bayes model to a training set consisting of 15 features extracted from each of 115,867 positive examples of exudate pixels and an equal number of negative examples. We then perform feature selection on the naive Bayes model, repeatedly removing features from the classifier, one by one, until classification performance stops improving. To find the best SVM, we begin with the best feature set from the naive Bayes classifier, and repeatedly add the previously-removed features to the classifier. For each combination of features, we perform a grid search to determine the best combination of hyperparameters nu ( tolerance for training errors) and gamma ( radial basis function width). We compare the best naive Bayes and SVM classifiers to a baseline nearest neighbour (NN) classifier using the best feature sets from both classifiers. We find that the naive Bayes and SVM classifiers perform better than the NN classifier. The overall best sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy are 92.28%, 98.52%, 53.05%, and 98.41%, respectively.

Results: We exploit features derived from the alignment of protein-protein interaction networks and gene coexpression networks to reconstruct KEGG orthologs for Drosophila melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens protein-protein interaction networks extracted from the DIP repository and Mus musculus and Homo sapiens and Sus scrofa gene coexpression networks extracted from NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus using the decision tree, Naive-Bayes and Support Vector Machine classification algorithms. Conclusions: The performance of our classifiers in reconstructing KEGG orthologs is compared against a basic reciprocal BLAST hit approach. We provide implementations of the resulting algorithms as part of BiNA, an open source biomolecular network alignment toolkit.	[Towfic, Fadi; VanderPlas, Susan; Tuggle, Christopher K.; Greenlee, M.

J	Ibanez, A; Larranaga, P; Bielza, C				Ibanez, Alfonso; Larranaga, Pedro; Bielza, Concha			Predicting citation count of Bioinformatics papers within four years of publication	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							GOOGLE SCHOLAR; SCIENCE; SCOPUS; IMPACT; WEB	Motivation: Nowadays, publishers of scientific journals face the tough task of selecting high-quality articles that will attract as many readers as possible from a pool of articles. This is due to the growth of scientific output and literature. The possibility of a journal having a tool capable of predicting the citation count of an article within the first few years after publication would pave the way for new assessment systems. Results: This article presents a new approach based on building several prediction models for the Bioinformatics journal. These models predict the citation count of an article within 4 years after publication (global models). To build these models, tokens found in the abstracts of Bioinformatics papers have been used as predictive features, along with other features like the journal sections and 2-week post-publication periods. To improve the accuracy of the global models, specific models have been built for each Bioinformatics journal section (Data and Text Mining, Databases and Ontologies, Gene Expression, Genetics and Population Analysis, Genome Analysis, Phylogenetics, Sequence Analysis, Structural Bioinformatics and Systems Biology). In these new models, the average success rate for predictions using the naive Bayes and logistic regression supervised classification methods was 89.4% and 91.5%, respectively, within the nine sections and for 4-year time horizon.

Bayesian Classifier is a simple but effective probabilistic classifier which has been shown to be able to achieve good results in most real world applications. Existing works for multi-relational Naive Bayes classifier mainly focus on how to extend traditional flat Naive Bayes classification method to multi-relational environment. In this paper, we look into issues concerned with how to increase the accuracy of multi-relational Bayesian classifier but still retain its efficiency. We develop a Semantic Relationship Graph (SRG) to describe the relationship between multiple tables and guide the search within relation space. Afterwards. we optimize the Semantic Relationship Graph by avoiding undesirable joins between relations and eliminating unnecessary attributes and relations. The experimental study on the real-world and synthetic databases shows that the proposed optimizing strategies make the multi-relational Naive Bayesian classifier achieve improved accuracy by sacrificing a small amount of running time.

J	Catal, C; Diri, B				Catal, Cagatay; Diri, Banu			Unlabelled extra data do not always mean extra performance for semi-supervised fault prediction	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						semi-supervised classification; software fault prediction; artificial immune systems; YATSI; naive Bayes; classification algorithms; random forests; machine learning		This research focused on investigating and benchmarking several high performance classifiers called J48, random forests, naive Bayes, KStar and artificial immune recognition systems for software fault prediction with limited fault data. We also studied a recent semi-supervised classification algorithm called YATSI (Yet Another Two Stage Idea) and each classifier has been used in the first stage of YATSI. YATSI is a meta algorithm which allows different classifiers to be applied in the first stage. Furthermore, we proposed a semi-supervised classification algorithm which applies the artificial immune systems paradigm. Experimental results showed that YATSI does not always improve the performance of naive Bayes when unlabelled data are used together with labelled data. According to experiments we performed, the naive Bayes algorithm is the best choice to build a semi-supervised fault prediction model for small data sets and YATSI may improve the performance of naive Bayes for large data sets. In addition, the YATSI algorithm improved the performance of all the classifiers except naive Bayes on all the data sets.

Carson			Local cell metrics: a novel method for analysis of cell-cell interactions	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							ITERATIVE SELECTION METHOD; CADHERIN-MEDIATED ADHESION; CONTACT INHIBITION; GROWTH-FACTOR; PROLIFERATION; COMBINATORIAL; DIFFERENTIATION; FIBROBLASTS; EXPRESSION; DENSITY	Background: The regulation of many cell functions is inherently linked to cell-cell contact interactions. However, effects of contact interactions among adherent cells can be difficult to detect with global summary statistics due to the localized nature and noise inherent to cell-cell interactions. The lack of informatics approaches specific for detecting cell-cell interactions is a limitation in the analysis of large sets of cell image data, including traditional and combinatorial or high-throughput studies. Here we introduce a novel histogram-based data analysis strategy, termed local cell metrics (LCMs), which addresses this shortcoming. Results: The new LCM method is demonstrated via a study of contact inhibition of proliferation of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. We describe how LCMs can be used to quantify the local environment of cells and how LCMs are decomposed mathematically into metrics specific to each cell type in a culture, e. g., differently-labelled cells in fluorescence imaging. Using this approach, a quantitative, probabilistic description of the contact inhibition effects in MC3T3-E1 cultures has been achieved. We also show how LCMs are related to the naive Bayes model. Namely, LCMs are Bayes class-conditional probability functions, suggesting their use for data mining and classification. Conclusion: LCMs are successful in robust detection of cell contact inhibition in situations where conventional global statistics fail to do so. The noise due to the random features of cell behavior was suppressed significantly as a result of the focus on local distances, providing sensitive detection of cell-cell contact effects. The methodology can be extended to any quantifiable feature that can be obtained from imaging of cell cultures or tissue samples, including optical, fluorescent, and confocal microscopy. This approach may prove useful in interpreting culture and histological data in fields where cell-cell interactions play a critical role in determining cell fate, e. g., cancer, developmental biology, and tissue regeneration.

J	Doan, S; Kawazoe, A; Conway, M; Collier, N				Doan, Son; Kawazoe, Ai; Conway, Mike; Collier, Nigel			Towards role-based filtering of disease outbreak reports	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Text classification; Semantic roles; Named entities; Information extraction		This paper explores the role of named entities (NEs) in the classification of disease outbreak report. In the annotation schema of BioCaster, a text mining system for public health protection, important concepts that reflect information about infectious diseases were conceptually analyzed with a formal ontological methodology and classified into types and roles. Types are specified as NE classes and roles are integrated into NEs as attributes such as a chemical and whether it is being used as a therapy for some infectious disease. We focus on the roles of NEs and explore different ways to extract, combine and use them as features in a text classifier. In addition, we investigate the combination of roles with semantic categories of disease-related nouns and verbs. Experimental results using naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms show that: (1) roles in combination with NEs improve performance in text classification, (2) roles in combination with semantic categories of noun and verb features contribute substantially to the improvement of text classification. Both these results were statistically significant compared to the baseline "raw text" representation. We discuss in detail the effects of roles on each NE and on semantic categories of noun and verb features in terms of accuracy, precision/recall and F-score measures for the text classification task.

Olex supports a hypothesis language of the form "if T(1) or ... or T(n) occurs in document d, and none of T(n+1), ... T(n+m) occurs in d, then classify d under category c," where each T(i) is a conjunction of terms. The proposed method is simple and elegant. Despite this, the results of a systematic experimentation performed on the REUTERS-21578, the OHSUMED, and the ODP data collections show that Olex provides classifiers that are accurate, compact, and comprehensible. A comparative analysis conducted against some of the most well-known learning algorithms (namely, Naive Bayes, Ripper, C4.5, SVM, and Linear Logistic Regression) demonstrates that it is more than competitive in terms of both predictive accuracy and efficiency.

Countering imbalanced datasets to improve adverse drug event predictive models in labor and delivery	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Adverse drug events; Pregnancy; Labor and delivery; Oversampling; Data-mining	HOSPITAL DISCHARGE DATA; MATERNAL MORBIDITY; CARE	Background: The IOM report, Preventing Medication Errors, emphasizes the overall lack of knowledge of the incidence of adverse drug events (ADE). Operating rooms, emergency departments and intensive care units are known to have a higher incidence of ADE. Labor and delivery (L&D) is an emergency care unit that could have in increased risk of ADE, where reported rates remain low and under-reporting is suspected. Risk factor identification with electronic pattern recognition techniques could improve ADE detection rates. Objective: The objective of the present study is to apply Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique (SMOTE) as an enhanced sampling method in a sparse dataset to generate prediction models to identify ADE in women admitted for labor and delivery based on patient Fisk factors and comorbidities. Results: By creating synthetic cases with the SMOTE algorithm and using a 10-fold cross-validation technique, we demonstrated improved performance of the Naive Bayes and the decision tree algorithms. The true positive rate (TPR) of 0.32 in the raw dataset increased to 0.67 in the 800% over-sampled dataset. Conclusion: Enhanced performance from classification algorithms can be attained with the use of synthetic minority class oversampling techniques in sparse clinical datasets. Predictive models created in this manner can be used to develop evidence based ADE monitoring systems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Taft, L. M.; Evans, R. S.; Shyu, C. R.; Egger, M.

Michael			Interpretation of hybrid generative/discriminative algorithms	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Hybrid generative/discriminative models; Probabilistic generative and discriminative approaches; Statistical modelling and learning		In discriminant analysis, probabilistic generative and discriminative approaches represent two paradigms of statistical modelling and learning. In order to exploit the best of both worlds, hybrid modelling and learning techniques have attracted much research interest recently, one example being the so-called hybrid generative/discriminative algorithm proposed in Raina et al. [Classification with hybrid generative/discriminative models, in: NIPS, 2003] and its multi-class extension [A. Fujino, N. Ueda, K. Saito, A hybrid generative/discriminative approach to text classification with additional information, Inf. Process. Manage. 43(2) (2007) 379-392]. In this paper, we interpret this hybrid algorithm from three perspectives, namely class-conditional probabilities, class-posterior probabilities and loss functions underlying the model. We suggest that the hybrid algorithm is by nature a generative model with its parameters learnt through both generative and discriminative approaches, in the sense that it assumes a scaled data-generation process and uses scaled class-posterior probabilities to perform discrimination. Our suggestion can also be applied to its multi-class extension. In addition, using simulated and real-world data, we compare the performance of the normalised hybrid algorithm as a classifier with that of the naive Bayes classifier and linear logistic regression. Our simulation studies suggest in general the following: if the covariance matrices are diagonal matrices, the naive Bayes classifier performs the best; if the covariance matrices are full matrices, linear logistic regression performs the best. Our studies also suggest that the hybrid algorithm may provide worse performance than either the naive Bayes classifier or linear logistic regression alone. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It has previously predominantly been investigated in a two-class context. This paper investigates multi-class Subgroup discovery methods. We consider six evaluation measures for multi-class subgroups, four of them new, and study their theoretical properties. We extend the two-class Subgroup discovery algorithm CN2-SD to incorporate the new evaluation measures and a new weighting scheme inspired by AdaBoost. We demonstrate the usefulness of multi-class subgroup discovery experimentally, using discovered subgroups as features for a decision tree learner. Not only is the number of leaves of the decision tree reduced with a factor between 8 and 16 on average, but significant improvements in accuracy and AUC are achieved with particular evaluation measures and settings. Similar performance improvements can be observed when using naive Bayes.

The method lies at the border between unsupervised and knowledge-based techniques. It performs unsupervised word sense disambiguation based on an underlying Naive Bayes model, while using WordNet as knowledge source for feature selection. The proposed extension of the disambiguation method makes ample use of the WordNet semantic relations that are typical of adjectives. Its performance is compared to that of previous approaches that rely on completely different feature sets. Test results show that feature selection using a knowledge source of type WordNet is more effective in the disambiguation of adjective senses than local type features (like part-of-speech tags) are.

In this paper, we present an active example selection method with naive Bayes classifier (AESNB) as a solution for the imbalanced data problem. The proposed method starts with a small balanced subset of training examples. A naive Bayes classifier is trained incrementally by actively selecting and adding informative examples regardless of the original class distribution. Informative examples are defined as examples that produce high error scores by the current classifier. We examined the performance of AESNB algorithm by using five imbalanced biomedical datasets. Our experimental results show that the naive Bayes classifier with our active example selection method achieves a competitive classification performance compared to the classifier with sampling or cost-sensitive methods.

This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of a set of diverse machine learning schemes on a number of biomedical datasets. To this end, we follow a four step evaluation methodology: (1) pre-proccssing the datasets to remove any redundancy, (2) classification of the datasets using six different machine learning algorithms; Naive Bayes (probabilistic), multi-layer perceptron (neural network), SMO (support vector machine), lBk (instance based learner), J48 (decision tree) and RIPPER (rule-based induction), (3) bagging and boosting each algorithm, and (4) combining the best version of each of the base classifiers to make a team of classifiers with stacking and voting techniques. Using this methodology, we have performed experiments on 31 different biomedical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which such a diverse set of machine learning algorithms are evaluated on so many biomedical datasets. The important outcome of our extensive study is a set of promising guidelines which will help researchers in choosing the best classification scheme for a particular nature of biomedical dataset.

Successful developments based on frequentist and Bayesian procedures have been extensively applied to obtain two-stage disease risk predictions at the subregional level. Bayesian procedures are preferred for making inferences, as the posterior standard errors (SE) of the two-stage prediction account for the variability in the variance component estimates; however, some recent work based on frequentist procedures and the use of bootstrap adjustments for the SE has been undertaken. In this article we investigate the suitability of an analytical adjustment for disease risk inference that provides accurate interval predictions by using the penalized quasilikelihood (PQL) technique to obtain model parameter estimates. The method is a first-order approximation of the naive SE based on a Taylor expansion and is interpreted as a conditional measure of variability providing conditional calibrated prediction intervals, given the data. We conduct a simulation study to demonstrate how the method can be used to estimate the specific subregion risk by interval. We evaluate the proposed methodology by analyzing the commonly used example data set of lip cancer incidence in the 56 counties of Scotland for the period 1975-1980. This evaluation reveals a close similarity between the solutions provided by the method proposed here and those of its fully Bayesian counterpart.

Related work can be broadly divided into two approaches: eager learning and lazy learning.(1) Different from eager learning, the key idea for extending naive Bayes using lazy learning is to learn an improved naive Bayes for each test instance. In recent years, several lazy extensions of naive Bayes have been proposed. For example, LBR,(30) SNNB,(27) and LWNB.(8) All these algorithms aim to improve naive Bayes' classification performance. Indeed, they achieve significant improvement in terms of classification, measured by accuracy. In many real-world data mining applications, however, an accurate ranking is more desirable than an accurate classification. Thus a natural question is whether they also achieve significant improvement in terms of ranking, measured by AUC (the area under the ROC curve).(2,11,17) Responding to this question, we conduct experiments on the 36 UCI data sets(18) selected by Weka(12) to investigate their ranking performance and find that they do not significantly improve the ranking performance of naive Bayes. Aiming at scaling up naive Bayes' ranking performance, we present a novel lazy method ICNB (instance cloned naive Bayes) and develop three ICNB algorithms using different instance cloning strategies. We empirically compare them with naive Bayes. The experimental results show that our algorithms achieve significant improvement in terms of AUC. Our research provides a simple but effective method for the applications where an accurate ranking is desirable.

Its changeable structures and variability raise the need for new spam classification techniques. The present study proposes using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) for spam classification and evaluates its performance against other classification methods, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Classification and Regression Trees, Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Naive Bayes. BART in its original form is not designed for such problems, hence we modify BART and make it applicable to classification problems. We evaluate the classifiers using three spam datasets; Ling-Spam, PU1, and Spambase to determine the predictive accuracy and the false positive rate.

They are particularly important for processing large data sets that may contain millions of documents and are typically represented by a large number, possibly tens of thousands of features. Processing large data sets thus raises the issue of computational resources and we often have to find the right trade-off between the size of the feature set and the number of training data that we can taken into account. Furthermore, depending on the selected classification technique, different feature selection methods require different optimization approaches, raising the issue of compatibility between the two. We demonstrate an effective classifier training and feature selection method that is suitable for large data collections. We explore feature selection based on the weights obtained from linear classifiers themselves, trained on a subset of training documents. While most feature weighting schemes score individual features independently from each other, the weights of linear classifiers incorporate the relative importance of a feature for classification as observed for a given subset of documents thus taking the feature dependence into account. We investigate how these feature selection methods combine with various learning algorithms. Our experiments include a comparative analysis of three learning algorithms: Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) in combination with three feature weighting methods: Odds ratio, Information Gain, and weights from the linear SVM and Perceptron. We show that by regulating the size of the feature space (and thus the sparsity of the resulting vector representation of the documents) using an effective feature scoring, like linear SVM, we need only a half or even a quarter of the computer memory to train a classifier of almost the same quality as the one obtained from the complete data set. Feature selection using weights from the linear SVMs yields a better classification performance than other feature weighting methods when combined with the three learning algorithms. The results support the conjecture that it is the sophistication of the feature weighting method rather than its compatibility with the learning algorithm that improves the classification performance.

The word segmentation approaches could be classified into distinct types, dictionary based (DCB) and machine learning based (MLB). The DCB approach relies on a set of terms for parsing and segmenting input texts. Whereas the MLB approach relies on a model trained from a corpus by using machine learning techniques. We compare between two algorithms from the DCB approach: longest-matching and maximal matching, and four algorithms from the MLB approach: Naive Bayes (NB), decision free, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Conditional Random Field (CRF). From (he experimental results, the DCB approach yielded better performance than the NB, decision tree and SVM algorithms from the MLB approach. However, the best performance was obtained from the CRF algorithm with the precision and recall of 95.79% and 94.98%, respectively.

Binary LNS-based nalive Bayes inference engine for spam control: noise analysis and FPGA implementation	IET COMPUTERS AND DIGITAL TECHNIQUES			English	Article							ADAPTIVE CORDIC ALGORITHM; SYSTEM	A hardware architecture for naive Bayes inference engine to classify e-mail contents for Spam control is proposed. The inference engine utilises the logarithmic number system (LNS) to simplify naive Bayes computations. For high throughput LNS recoding, a non-iterative binary LNS recoding hardware architecture that uses look-up table approach is proposed. A noise model for the inference engine was developed and the noise bounds were analysed to determine the inference accuracy. The inference engine design is synthesised targeting the Altera Stratix field programmable gate array (FPGA) device. From the synthesis results, the binary LNS naive Bayes inference engine was found to have the capability to classify more than 117 million features per second, given a stream of a priori and likelihood probabilities as input with small computation noise. The synthesised inference engine was functionally verified against a MATLAB implementation.	[Marsono, M.

Everyday, millions of unwanted and unhelpful messages are received by Internet users annoying their mailboxes. Fortunately, nowadays there are different kinds of filters able to automatically identify and delete most of these messages. In order to reduce the bulk of information to deal with, only distinctive attributes are selected spam and legitimate e-mails. This work presents a comparative study about the performance of five well-known feature selection techniques when they are applied in conjunction with four different types of Naive Bayes classifier. The results obtained from the experiments carried out show the relevance of choosing an appropriate feature selection technique in order to obtain the most accurate results.	[Mendez, J.

We focus on NB due to its popularity and linear training time. We investigate the impact of eight discretization algorithms (Equal Width, Equal Frequency, Maximum Entropy, IEM, CADD, CAIM, MODL, and CA CC) on the classification with NB and two modern semi-NB classifiers, LBR and A ODE. Our comprehensive empirical study indicates that unsupervised discretization algorithms are the fastest while among the supervised algorithms the fastest is Maximum Entropy, followed by CAIM and IEM. The CAIM and MODL discretizers generate the lowest and the highest number of discrete values, respectively. We compare the time to build the classification model and classification accuracy when using raw and discretized data. We show that discretization helps to improve the classification with the NB when compared with Flexible NB which models continuous features using Gaussian kernels. The AODE classifier obtains on average the best accuracy, while the best performing setup includes discretization with IEM and classification with AODE. The runner-up setups include CAIM and CA CC coupled with A ODE and CAIM and JEM coupled with LBR. JEM and CAIM are shown to provide statistically significant improvements across all considered datasets for LBR and A ODE classifiers when compared with using NB on the continuous data. We also show that the improved accuracy comes at the trade-off of substantially increased runtime.

We introduce a novel probabilistic approach to estimate the posterior distribution of the target rank conditionally to the predictors. We turn this learning task into a model selection problem. For that, we define a 2D partitioning family obtained by discretizing numerical variables and grouping categorical ones and we derive an analytical criterion to select the partition with the highest posterior probability. We show how these partitions can be used to build univariate predictors and multivariate ones under a naive Bayes assumption. We also propose a new evaluation criterion for probabilistic rank estimators. Based on the logarithmic score, we show that such criterion presents the advantage to be minored, which is not the case of the logarithmic score computed for probabilistic value estimator. A first set of experimentations on synthetic data shows the good properties of the proposed criterion and of our partitioning approach. A second set of experimentations on real data shows competitive performance of the univariate and selective naive Bayes rank estimators projected on the value range compared to methods submitted to a recent challenge on probabilistic metric regression tasks. Our approach is applicable for all regression problems with categorical or numerical predictors. It is particularly interesting for those with a high number of predictors as it automatically detects the variables which contain predictive information. It builds pertinent predictors of the normalized rank of the numerical target from one or several predictors. As the criteria selection is regularized by the presence of a prior and a posterior term, it does not suffer from overfitting.

J	Zhou, Y; Mulekar, MS; Nerellapalli, P				Zhou, Yan; Mulekar, Madhuri S.; Nerellapalli, Praveen			Adaptive spam filtering using dynamic feature spaces	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence	NOV 14-16, 2005	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE Comp Soc, Informat Technol Res Inst, Wright State Univ, Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol		adaptive spam filtering; dynamic feature space; Huffman coding; message scoring; logistic regression	HUFFMAN	Unsolicited bulk e-mail, also known as spam, has been an increasing problem for the e-mail society. This paper presents a new spam filtering strategy that 1) uses a practical entropy coding technique, Huffman coding, to dynamically encode the feature space of the e-mail collected over time and, 2) applies an online algorithm to adaptively enhance the learned spam concept as new e-mail data becomes available. The contributions of this work include a highly efficient spam filtering algorithm in which the input space is radically reduced to a single-dimension input vector, and an adaptive learning technique that is robust to vocabulary change, concept drifting and skewed class distributions. We compare our technique with several existing off-line learning techniques including support vector machine, logistic regression, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, C4.5 decision tree, RBFNetwork, boosted decision tree and stacking. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by presenting the experimental results on the e-mail data that is publicly available. A more in-depth statistical analysis on the experimental results is also presented and discussed.

Predicting carcinoid heart disease with the noisy-threshold classifier	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						carcinoid heart disease; Bayesian classification; causal independence; noisy-threshold model	PROBABILISTIC EVENTS; DISCRETE-TIME; NETWORKS; TUMORS; EXPLANATION; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEMS	Objective: To predict the development of carcinoid heart disease (CHD), which is a life-threatening complication of certain neuroendocrine tumors. To this end, a novel type of Bayesian classifier, known as the noisy-threshold classifier, is applied. Materials and methods: Fifty-four cases of patients that suffered from a low-grade midgut carcinoid tumor, of which 22 patients developed CHD, were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI). Eleven attributes that are known at admission have been used to classify whether the patient develops CHD. Classification accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve of the noisy-threshold classifier are compared with those of the naive-Bayes classifier, logistic regression, the decision-tree learning algorithm C4.5, and a decision rule, as formulated by an expert physician. Results: The noisy-threshotd classifier showed the best classification accuracy of 72% correctly classified cases, although differences were significant only for logistic regression and C4.5. An area under the ROC curve of 0.66 was attained for the noisy-threshold classifier, and equated that of the physician's decision-rule. Conclusions: The noisy-threshotd classifier performed favorably to other state-of the-art classification algorithms, and equally well as a decision-rute that was formulated by the physician. Furthermore, the semantics of the noisy-threshold classifier make it a useful machine learning technique in domains where multiple causes influence a common effect. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Cai, DM; Gokhale, M; Theiler, J				Cai, D. Michael; Gokhale, Maya; Theiler, James			Comparison of feature selection and classification algorithms in identifying malicious executables	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						feature selection; support vector machine; Naive Bayes classifier; malicious executable file; email filtering	RECOGNITION; NETWORKS	Malicious executables, often spread as email attachments, impose serious security threats to computer systems and associated networks. We investigated the use of byte sequence frequencies as a way to automatically distinguish malicious from benign executables without actually executing them. In a series of experiments, we compared classification accuracies over seven feature selection methods, four classification algorithms, and variable byte sequence lengths. We found that single-byte patterns provided surprisingly reliable features to separate malicious executables from benign. Between classifiers and feature selection methods, the overall performance of the models depended more on the choice of classifier than the method of feature selection. Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were found to be superior in terms of prediction accuracy, training time, and aversion to overfitting. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Robust approach for estimating probabilities in naive-Bayes classifier	PATTERN RECOGNITION AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence	DEC 18-22, 2007	Calcutta, INDIA	Indian Stat Inst, Machine Intelligence Univ, ISI Ctr Soft Comp Res, Int Assoc Pattern Recognit, Int Ctr Pure & Appl Math, Web Intelligence Consortium, Yahoo India Res & Dev, Philips Res Asia				Naive-Bayes classifier is a popular technique of classification in machine learning. Improving the accuracy of naive-Bayes classifier will be significant as it has great importance in classification using numerical attributes. For numeric attributes, the conditional probabilities are either modeled by some continuous probability distribution over the range of that attribute's values or by conversion of numeric attribute to discrete one using discretization. The limitation of the classifier using discretization is that it does not classify those instances for which conditional probabilities of any of the attribute value for every class is zero. The proposed method resolves this limitation of estimating probabilities in the naive-Bayes classifier and improve the classification accuracy for noisy data. The proposed method is efficient and robust in estimating probabilities in the naive-Bayes classifier. The proposed method has been tested over a number of databases of UCI machine learning repository and the comparative results of existing naive-Bayes classifier and proposed method has also been illustrated.

The objective of this study is to use classification modeling techniques to identify suspicious policies to assist manual inspections. The predictive models can label high-risk policies and help investigators to focus on suspicious records and accelerate the claim-handling process. The study uses health insurance data with some known suspicious and normal policies. These known policies are used to train the predictive models. Missing values and irrelevant variables are removed before building predictive models. Three predictive models: Naive Bayes (NB), decision tree, and Multiple Criteria Linear Programming (MCLP), are trained using the claim data. Experimental study shows that NB outperformed decision tree and MCLP in terms of classification accuracy.

One is probability theory and the other is fuzzy set theory. One of the basic ideas of fuzzy set theory is how to define and interpret membership functions. In this paper, we will study tree-structured data mining model based on a new interpretation of fuzzy theory. In this new theory, fuzzy labels will be used for modelling. The membership function is interpreted as appropriateness degrees for using labels to describe a fuzzy concept. Each fuzzy concept is modelled by a distribution on the appropriate fuzzy label sets. Previous work has shown that the new model outperforms some well-known data mining models such as Naive Bayes and Decision trees. However, the fuzzy labels used in previous works were predefined. We are interested in study the influences on the performance by using fuzzy labels with different degrees of overlapping. We test a series of UCI datasets and the results show that the performance of the model increased almost monotonically with the increase of the overlapping between fuzzy labels. For this empirical study with the LDT model, we can conclude that more fuzziness implies better performance.

This paper analyzes how these methods can be applied to a Naive Bayes learner. The key result is that the pairwise variant of Naive Bayes is equivalent to a regular Naive Bayes. This result holds for several aggregation techniques for combining the predictions of the individual classifiers, including the commonly used voting and weighted voting techniques. On the other hand, Naive Bayes with one-against-all binarization is not equivalent to a regular Naive Bayes. Apart from the theoretical results themselves, the paper offers a discussion of their implications.

Identifying wrist fracture patients with high accuracy by automatic categorization of x-ray reports	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							RADIOLOGY REPORTS	The authors performed this study to determine the accuracy of several text classification methods to categorize wrist x-ray reports. We randomly sampled 751 textual wrist x-ray reports. Two expert reviewers rated the presence (n = 301) or absence (n = 450) of an acute fracture of wrist. We developed two information retrieval (IR) text classification methods and a machine learning method using a support vector machine (TC-1). In cross-validation on the derivation set (n = 493), TC-1 outperformed the two IR based methods and six benchmark classifiers, including Naive Bayes and a Neural Network. In the validation set (n = 258), TC-1 demonstrated consistent performance with 93.8% accuracy; 95.5% sensitivity; 92.9% specificity; and 87.5% positive predictive value. TC-1 was easy to implement and superior in performance to the other classification methods.

J	Li, YM; Anderson-Sprecher, R				Li, Yumei; Anderson-Sprecher, Richard			Facies identification from well logs: A comparison of discriminant analysis and naive Bayes classifier	JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						facies; well logs; discriminant analysis; naive Bayes classifier	NEURAL NETWORKS; LITHO-FACIES; FUZZY-LOGIC	The performance of a naive Bayes classifier is compared with a well-established statistical classification approach, linear discriminant analysis, by considering core and log data from marine-eolian sediments. The results indicate that both methods perform adequately, and the Gaussian naive Bayes classifier provides estimates as good as those based on the linear discriminant analysis for the given data set. Quadratic discriminant analysis, a more conventional Bayesian analysis, and kemel-based density estimation methods perform unexpectedly poor, probably because of overfitting. We conclude that the normal distribution is appropriate to fit the distribution of log readings in the present data, and the simplifications of naive Bayes provide a robust, simple approach for facies identification.

This medicinal activity is produced by interaction of the functional groups on the ligand with a binding site on a target protein. In identifying structure-activity relations of this kind there are three principal issues: (1) It is often difficult to "align" the ligands in order to identify common structural properties that may be responsible for activity; (2) Ligands in solution can adopt different shapes (or 'conformations') arising from torsional rotations about bonds. The 3-D molecular substructure is typically sought on one or more low-energy conformers; and (3) Pharmacophore models must, ideally, predict medicinal activity on some quantitative scale. It has been shown that the logical representation adopted by Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) naturally resolves many of the difficulties associated with the alignment and multi-conformation issues. However, the predictions of models constructed by ILP have hitherto only been nominal, predicting medicinal activity to be present or absent. In this paper, we investigate the construction of two kinds of quantitative pharmacophoric models with ILP: (a) Models that predict the probability that a ligand is "active"; and (b) Models that predict the actual medicinal activity of a ligand. Quantitative predictions are obtained by the utilising the following statistical procedures as background knowledge: logistic regression and naive Bayes, for probability prediction; linear and kernel regression, for activity prediction. The multi-conformation issue and, more generally, the relational representation used by ILP results in some special difficulties in the use of any statistical procedure. We present the principal issues and some solutions. Specifically, using data on the inhibition of the protease Thermolysin, we demonstrate that it is possible for an ILP program to construct good quantitative structure-activity models. We also comment on the relationship of this work to other recent developments in statistical relational learning.

While the mar assumption, as such, is not testable, it can become testable in the context of other distributional assumptions, e.g. the naive Bayes assumption. In this paper we investigate a method for testing the mar assumption in the presence of other distributional constraints. We present methods to (approximately) compute a test statistic consisting of the ratio of two profile likelihood functions. This requires the optimization of the likelihood under no assumptions on the missingness mechanism, for which we use our recently proposed At & M algorithm. We present experimental results on synthetic data that show that our approximate test statistic is a good indicator for whether data is mar relative to the given distributional assumptions.

In this paper, we use SMOreg in exactly the same way as linear regression(LR) is used in locally weighted linear regression [5] (LWLR): a local SMOreg is fit to a subset of the training instances that is in the neighborhood of the test instance whose target function value is to be predicted. The training instances in this neighborhood are weighted, with less weight being assigned to instances that are further from the test instance. A regression prediction is then obtained from SMOreg taking the attribute values of the test instance as input. We called our improved algorithm locally weighted SMOreg, simply LWSMOreg. We conduct extensive empirical comparison for the related algorithms in two groups in terms of relative mean absolute error, using the whole 36 regression data sets obtained from various sources and recommended by Weka[3]. In the first group, we compare SMOreg[l] with NB[4](naive Bayes), KNNDW[5](k-nearest-neighbor with distance weighting), and LR. In the second group, we compare LWSMOreg with SMOreg, LR, and LWLR. Our experimental results show that SMOreg performs well in regression and LWSMOreg significantly outperforms all the other algorithms used to compare.

Noise on web pages are irrelevant to the main content on the web pages being mined, and include advertisements, navigation bar, and copyright notices. The few existing work on web page cleaning detect noise blocks with exact matching contents but are weak at detecting near duplicate blocks, characterized by items like navigation bars. This paper proposes a system, WebPageCleaner, for eliminating noise blocks from web pages for purposes of improving the accuracy and efficiency of web content mining. A vision-based technique is employed for extracting blocks from web pages. Then, relevant web page blocks are identified as those with high importance level by analyzing such physical features of the blocks as the block location, percentage of web links on the block, and level of similarity of block contents to other blocks. Important blocks are exported to be used for web content mining using Naive Bayes text classification. Experiments show that WebPageCleaner leads to a more accurate and efficient web page classification results than comparable existing approaches.

However, it has two main drawbacks: (i) its classification accuracy decreases when the attributes are not independent, and (ii) it can not deal with nonparametric continuous attributes. In this work we propose a method that deals with both problems, and learns an optimal naive Bayes classifier The method includes two phases, discretization and structural improvement, which are repeated alternately until the classification accuracy can not be improved. Discretization is based on the minimum description length principle. To deal with dependent and irrelevant attributes, we apply a structural improvement method that eliminates and/or joins attributes, based on mutual and conditional information measures. The method has been tested in two different domains with good results.

The texts represent short Web-page descriptions from the dmoz Open Directory Web-page ontology. Different transformations of input data: stemming, normalization, logtf and idf, together with dimensionality reduction, are found to have a statistically significant improving or degrading effect on classification performance measured by classical metrics - accuracy, precision, recall, F-1 and F-2. The emphasis of the study is not on determining the best document representation which corresponds to each classifier, but rather on describing the effects of every individual transformation on classification, together with their mutual relationships.

Only relatively recently did detailed studies on the impact of various document representations step into the spotlight, showing that there may be statistically significant differences in classifier performance even among variations of the classical bag-of-words model. This paper examines the relationship between the idf transform and several widely used feature selection methods, in the context of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines classifiers, on datasets extracted from the dmoz ontology of Web-page descriptions. The described experimental study shows that the idf transform considerably effects the distribution of classification performance over feature selection reduction rates, and offers an evaluation method which permits the discovery of relationships between different document representations and feature selection methods which is independent of absolute differences in classification performance.

The identification of interacting motif pairs is essential for exploring the mechanism of protein interactions. We describe a stochastic AdaBoost approach for discovering motif pairs from known interactions and pairs of proteins that are putatively not to interact. Our interacting motif pairs are validated by multiple-chain PDB structures and show more significant than those selected by traditional statistical method. Furthermore, in a cross-validated comparison, our model can be used to predict interactions between proteins with higher sensitivity (66.42%) and specificity (87.38%) comparing with the Naive Bayes model and the dominating model.

Applying one-class classification to the minorities in an imbalanced data has been shown to achieve better performance than the two-class one. In this paper, in order to make the best use of all the available information during the learning procedure, we propose a general framework which first uses the minority class for training in the one-class classification stage; and then uses both minority and majority class for estimating the generalization performance of the constructed classifier. Based upon this generalization performance measurement, parameter search algorithm selects the best parameter settings for this classifier. Experiments on UCI and Reuters text data show that one-class SVM embedded in this framework achieves much better performance than the standard one-class SVM alone and other learning schemes, such as one-class Naive Bayes, one-class nearest neighbour and neural network.

Although the boosting technique has been shown to effectively improve the accuracy of machine-learning-based classifiers, boosting does not work well with NB text classification owing to the low variance in the accuracy of its base classifier. In this study, we propose boosting the NB text classifier by combining the AdaBoost boosting algorithm with uncertainty-based selective sampling. Experiments using the popular Reuters-21578 document collection showed that the proposed algorithm effectively improves classification accuracy. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We model individuals as naive Bayesian norm followers, rational agents whose subjective expected utility is increased by adherence to an established norm. Agents use Bayesian reasoning to combine their private preferences and prior beliefs with empirical observations of others' decisions. When agents must infer the preferences of others from observation, this can result in negative cascades, causing the majority of agents to choose a dispreferred action (because they believe, incorrectly, that they are following the majority preference). We demonstrate that negative cascades can result even when the degree of conformity is relatively low, and under a wide range of conditions (including heterogeneity in preferences, priors, and impact of public opinion). This allows us to present a general model of how rational norm-following behavior can occur, and how unpopular norms might emerge, in real populations with heterogeneous preferences and beliefs.

Instead of choosing a priori a particular model class of BNCs, our adaptive algorithm scales up the model's complexity by gradually increasing the number of allowable dependencies among features, Starting with the simple Naive Bayes structure, it uses simple decision rules based on qualitative information about the performance's dynamics to decide when it makes sense to do the next move in the spectrum of feature dependencies and to start searching for a more complex classifier. Results in conducted experiments using the class of Dependence Bayesian Classifiers on three large datasets show that our algorithm is able to select a model with the appropriate complexity for the current amount of training data, thus balancing the computational cost of updating a model with the benefits of increasing in accuracy.

Since its conditional independence assumption is rarely true, numerous algorithms have been proposed to improve naive Bayes, among which tree augmented naive Bayes (TAN) [3] achieves a significant improvement in term of classification accuracy, while maintaining efficiency and model simplicity. In many real-world data mining applications, however, an accurate ranking is more desirable than a classification. Thus it is interesting whether TAN also achieves significant improvement in term of ranking, measured by AUC(the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve) [8, 1]. Unfortunately, our experiments show that TAN performs even worse than naive Bayes in ranking. Responding to this fact, we present a novel learning algorithm, called forest augmented naive Bayes (FAN), by modifying the traditional TAN learning algorithm. We experimentally test our algorithm on all the 36 data sets recommended by Weka [12], and compare it to naive Bayes, SBC [6], TAN [3], and C4.4 [10], in terms of AUC. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms all the other algorithms significantly in yielding accurate rankings. Our work provides an effective and efficient data mining algorithm for applications in which an accurate ranking is required.

Experiments were conducted in the online learning setting to model the way in which time series data is presented. The performance of each learner's probability forecasts was assessed using ROC curves, square loss, classification accuracy and Empirical Reliability Curves (ERC) [1]. Our results demonstrate that effective probability forecasts can be generated on time series data and we discuss the practical implications of this.

Most such methods are character-based, and thus have the potential to automatically capture non-word features of a document, such as punctuation, word-stems, and features spanning more than one word. However, compression-based classification methods have drawbacks (such as slow running time), and not all such methods are equally effective. We present the results of a number of experiments designed to evaluate the effectiveness and behavior of different compression-based text classification methods on English text. Among our experiments are some specifically designed to test whether the ability to capture non-word (including super-word) features causes character-based text compression methods to achieve more accurate classification.

For example, the patent office uses the similarity of shape to ensure that there are no infringements of copyrighted trademarks. This paper focuses on using machine learning and information retrieval techniques to classify an image into one of many classes based on shape. In particular, we compare Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes and relevance language models for classification. Our results indicate that, on the MPEG-7 database, the relevance model outperforms the machine learning techniques and is competitive with prior work on shape based retrieval. We also show how the relevance model approach may be used to perform shape retrieval using keywords. Experiments on the MPEG-7 database and a binary version of the COIL-100 database show good retrieval performance.

Its severe assumption that each feature word is independent with other feature words in a document makes higher efficiency possible but also adversely affects the quality of its results because some of feat,ire words are interrelated In this paper, in order to enhance the performance of the text classification, some solutions are proposed to some of the problems with Naive Bayes classifiers. Based on the original Naive Bayes algorithm, we take feature weight into account and make it a factor and combine KL-divergence (relative entropy) between the words to improve Naive Bayes classifier. The improved Naive Bayes classification algorithm is called INBA. By theory and experiment analyses it is proved that INBA algorithm not only has advantages of Naive Bayes classifier, but also results in higher classification accuracy, ana the solutions are feasible, practical and effective.

In this paper, we combine the two strategies of data transform and data hiding to propose a new randomization method, Randomized Response with Partial Hiding (RRPH), for distorting the original data. Then, an effective naive Bayes classifier is presented to predict the class labels for unknown samples according to the distorted data by RRPH. Shown in the analytical and experimental results, our method can obtain significant improvements in terms of privacy, accuracy, and applicability.

As a statistical model of dependence, in the sequences of patterns, the first-order Markov chain is assumed. Additionally, the assumption about independence between the attributes in the feature vector is made. The pattern recognition algorithms with such assumption are called in the literature "naive Bayes algorithm". In this paper such approach is made to the pattern recognition algorithm for first-order Markov chain and some results of numerical investigation are presented. The main goal of these investigations was to verify if it is reasonable to make such assumption in the real recognition tasks..

J	Browning, J; Miller, DJ				Browning, J; Miller, DJ			A maximum entropy approach for collaborative filtering	JOURNAL OF VLSI SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						maximum entropy; collaborative filtering; iterative scaling; latent clustering; naive Bayes	CLASSIFICATION; PROBABILITY; INFERENCE; PRINCIPLE	Collaborative filtering (CF) involves predicting the preferences of a user for a set of items given partial knowledge of the user's preferences for other items, while leveraging a database of profiles for other users. CF has applications e.g. in predicting Web sites a person will visit and in recommending products. Fundamentally, CF is a pattern recognition task, but a formidable one, often involving a huge feature space, a large data set, and many missing features. Even more daunting is the fact that a CF inference engine must be capable of predicting any (user-selected) items, given any available set of partial knowledge on the user's other preferences. In other words, the model must be designed to solve any of a huge (combinatoric) set of possible inference tasks. CF techniques include memory-based, classification-based, and statistical modelling approaches. Among these, modelling approaches scale best with large data sets and are the most adept at handling missing features. The disadvantage of these methods lies in the statistical assumptions (e.g. feature independence), which may be unjustified. To address this shortcoming we propose a new model-based CF method, based on the maximum entropy principle. For the MS Web application, the new method is demonstrated to outperform a number of CF approaches, including naive Bayes and latent variable (cluster) models, support vector machines (SVMs), and the (Pearson) correlation method.

Moreover, there are some evidences that the emotional state of the learner correlated with his performance. Furthermore, it's important that new Intelligent Tutoring Systems involve this emotional aspect; they may be able to recognize the emotional state of the learner, and to change it so as to be in the best conditions for learning. In this paper we describe such an architecture developed in order to determine the optimal emotional state for learning and to induce it. Based on experimentation, we have used the Naive Bayes classifier to predict the optimal emotional state according to the personality and then we induce it using a hybrid technique which combines the guided imagery technique, music and images.

Boosting has been evaluated to effectively improve the accuracy of machine-learning based classifiers. However, Naive Bayes classifier, which is remarkably successful in practice for text classification problems, is known not to work well with the boosting technique due to its instability of base classifiers. The proposed algorithm focuses on boosting Naive Bayes classifiers by performing active learning at each iteration of boosting process.

TAN, Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes, is a tree-like Bayesian network. The standard TAN learning algorithm is the stable, which is difficult to improve its accuracy by bagging technique. In this paper, a new TAN learning algorithm called RTAN is presented, and the diversity of the TAN classifiers generated by RTAN is investigated by K statistic. And then Bagging-MultiTAN algorithm generates a TAN ensemble classifier. Through the comparisons of this TAN ensemble classifier with the standard TAN classifier in the experiments, the TAN ensemble classifier shows higher classification accuracy than the standard TAN classifier on the most data.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reduce dimensionality of the feature space by employing Independent Component Analysis. While ICA is primarily a Jeature extraction technique, we use it here as a feature selection technique in a generic way. Our technique, called FSS - ICA, is more efficient than many of its competitors without loss in accuracy. FSS_ICA determines a set of statistically independent features instead of merely reducing the number of the original features. In applications FSS_ICA results in a smaller number of effective features than the Relief attribute estimator, and it usually outperforms both the Relief attribute estimator and CFS, when used as a pre-processing step for Naive Bayes, instance based learning and decision trees. In addition, by disregarding some features, we demonstrate that in some cases FSS_ICA is more accurate than classification based on all features. Also, decision trees built from the preprocessed data are often significantly smaller than those derived from the original feature space. In addition, we also report the performance of ICA on a "real world" application in medical image segmentation.

Bitnets are riemannian manifolds of finite volume when Fisher information is used as the metric. I compute the exact volumes for several interesting topologies including the complete graph, the directed line of n nodes, the exploding star (naive bayes) and its reverse. the collapsing star. I show a fast algorithm for approximating the volumes of general bitnets. Computer experiments show that the average Ricci scalar of bitnets is always half an integer. Typically bitnets have singular boundaries obtained when some of the conditional probabilities for the binary variables are either zero or one. At the singular points the Ricci scalar becomes negative infinity.

Image measurements may, for example, correspond to various filter responses at multiple scales and orientations. Most tracking approaches exploit ad hoc likelihood models while those that exploit more rigorous, learned, models often make unrealistic assumptions about the underlying probabilistic model. Such assumptions cause problems for Bayesian inference when an unsound likelihood is combined with an a priori probability distribution. Errors in modeling the likelihood can lead to brittle tracking results, particularly when using non-parametric inference techniques such as particle filtering. We show how assumptions of conditional independence of filter responses are violated in common tracking scenarios, lead to incorrect likelihood models, and cause problems for Bayesian inference. We address the problem of modeling more principled likelihoods using Gibbs learning. The learned models are compared with naive Bayes methods which assume conditional independence of the filter responses. We show how these Gibbs models can be used as an effective image likelihood, and demonstrate them in the context of particle filter-based human tracking.

Feature selection is used to improve the performance of data mining algorithms by removing the irrelevant and redundant features. By positional cross-identification, the multi-wavelength data of 1656 active galactic nuclei (AGNs), 3718 stars, and 173 galaxies are obtained from optical (USNO-A2.0), X-ray (ROSAT), and infrared (Two Micron All- Sky Survey) bands. In this paper we applied a kind of filter approach named ReliefF to select features from the multi-wavelength data. Then we put forward the naive Bayes classifier to classify the objects with the feature subsets and compare the results with and without feature selection, and those with and without adding weight to features. The result shows that the naive Bayes classifier based on ReliefF algorithms is robust and efficient to preselect AGN candidates.

Each variable has strong statistical dependency with a small number of other variables and negligible dependency with the remaining ones. Such structuring makes it possible to construct a powerful classifier by only representing the stronger dependencies among the variables. In particular, a semi-naive Bayes classifier compactly represents sparseness. A semi-naive Bayes classifier decomposes the input variables into subsets and represents statistical dependency within each subset, while treating the subsets as statistically independent. However, learning the structure of a semi-naive Bayes classifier is known to be NP complete. The high dimensionality of images makes statistical structure teaming especially challenging. This paper describes an algorithm that searches for the structure of a semi-naive Bayes classifier in this large space of possible structures. The algorithm seeks to optimize two cost functions: a localized error in the log-likelihood ratio function to restrict the structure and a global classification error to choose the final structure. We use this approach to train detectors for several objects including faces, eyes, ears, telephones, push-carts, and door-handles. These detectors perform robustly with a high detection rate and low false alarm rate in unconstrained settings over a wide range of variation in background scenery and lighting.

We call such an effect discretization bias and variance. Proportional k-interval discretization (PKID) tunes discretization bias and variance by adjusting discretized interval size and number proportional to the number of training instances. Theoretical analysis suggests that this is desirable for naive-Bayes classifiers. However PKID is sub-optimal when learning from training data of small size. We argue that this is because PKID equally weighs bias reduction and variance reduction. But for small data, variance reduction can contribute more to lower learning error and thus should be given greater weight than bias reduction. Accordingly we propose weighted proportional k-interval discretization (WPKID), which establishes a more suitable bias and variance trade-off for small data while allowing additional training data to be used to reduce both bias and variance. Our experiments demonstrate that for naive-Bayes classifiers, WPKID improves upon PKID for smaller datasets(1) with significant frequency; and WPKID delivers lower classification error significantly more often than not in comparison to three other leading alternative discretization techniques studied.

The FMP is a modification we introduce in the Hidden Markov Model in order to enable it to predict numerical values. The FMP can be seen as an extension of the Fuzzy Bayes Predictor (FBP) that was modified from the Naive Bayes Classifier. For verifying the efficiency of the FMP's prediction, we compare it with the FBP, one fuzzy system and two traditional forecasting methods, Box-Jenkins and Winters exponential smoothing.

According to the reported results, the models show an ideal trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness, i.e., a balance between the cost of the unsupervised model learning process and the quality of the learnt models. Moreover, the proposed models are very appealing due to their closeness to human intuition and computational advantages for the unsupervised model induction process. while preserving a rich enough modeling power.

Nevertheless, the shape of the resulting class borders of fuzzy classification roles depends to a great part on the used t-norm and t-conorm and can sometimes even he counter-intuitive. In this paper ww discuss the shape of class borders between overlapping rules under consideration of different t-norms and t-conorms and the effect of rule aggregation i.e. more than one rule defining the santa class are overlapping. Furthermore, we discuss the influence of rule weights and point out some aspects of the classification behavior of naive Bayes classifiers, which can be seen as a subset of fuzzy systems. Our main goal is to give rite potential user an insight into the classification behavior of fuzzy classifiers. For this, mainly 2D and 3D visualizations flue used to illustrate the cluster shapes and the borders between distinct classes.

We give necessary and sufficient conditions on linearly separable functions in the binary domain to be learnable by Naive Bayes under uniform representation. We then show that the learnability land error rates) of Naive Bayes can be affected dramatically by sampling distributions. Our results help us to gain a much deeper understanding of this seemingly simple, yet powerful learning algorithm.

J	Myslin, M; Zhu, SH; Chapman, W; Conway, M				Myslin, Mark; Zhu, Shu-Hong; Chapman, Wendy; Conway, Mike			Using Twitter to Examine Smoking Behavior and Perceptions of Emerging Tobacco Products	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						social media; twitter messaging; smoking; natural language processing	UNITED-STATES; HEALTH; SURVEILLANCE; SEARCH; MEDIA; YOUNG	Background: Social media platforms such as Twitter are rapidly becoming key resources for public health surveillance applications, yet little is known about Twitter users' levels of informedness and sentiment toward tobacco, especially with regard to the emerging tobacco control challenges posed by hookah and electronic cigarettes. Objective: To develop a content and sentiment analysis of tobacco-related Twitter posts and build machine learning classifiers to detect tobacco-relevant posts and sentiment towards tobacco, with a particular focus on new and emerging products like hookah and electronic cigarettes. Methods: We collected 7362 tobacco-related Twitter posts at 15-day intervals from December 2011 to July 2012. Each tweet was manually classified using a triaxial scheme, capturing genre, theme, and sentiment. Using the collected data, machine-learning classifiers were trained to detect tobacco-related vs irrelevant tweets as well as positive vs negative sentiment, using Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Finally, phi contingency coefficients were computed between each of the categories to discover emergent patterns. Results: The most prevalent genres were first- and second-hand experience and opinion, and the most frequent themes were hookah, cessation, and pleasure. Sentiment toward tobacco was overall more positive (1939/4215, 46% of tweets) than negative (1349/4215, 32%) or neutral among tweets mentioning it, even excluding the 9% of tweets categorized as marketing. Three separate metrics converged to support an emergent distinction between, on one hand, hookah and electronic cigarettes corresponding to positive sentiment, and on the other hand, traditional tobacco products and more general references corresponding to negative sentiment. These metrics included correlations between categories in the annotation scheme (phi(hookah-positive)=0.39; phi(e-cigs-positive)=0.19); correlations between search keywords and sentiment (chi(2)(4)=414.50, P<.001, Cramer's V=0.36), and the most discriminating unigram features for positive and negative sentiment ranked by log odds ratio in the machine learning component of the study. In the automated classification tasks, SVMs using a relatively small number of unigram features (500) achieved best performance in discriminating tobacco-related from unrelated tweets (F score=0.85). Conclusions: Novel insights available through Twitter for tobacco surveillance are attested through the high prevalence of positive sentiment. This positive sentiment is correlated in complex ways with social image, personal experience, and recently popular products such as hookah and electronic cigarettes. Several apparent perceptual disconnects between these products and their health effects suggest opportunities for tobacco control education. Finally, machine classification of tobacco-related posts shows a promising edge over strictly keyword-based approaches, yielding an improved signal-to-noise ratio in Twitter data and paving the way for automated tobacco surveillance applications.

Nevertheless, extant methods to examine small-molecule interactions with plasma protein have various limitations, thus creating a need for alternative methods. Herein we present a comprehensive and cross-validated in silico workflow for the prediction of small-molecule binding to Human Serum Albumin (HSA), the most ubiquitous plasma protein. This protocol reliably predicts small-molecule interactions with HSA, including a binding affinity calculation using multiple linear regression methods, binding site prediction using a naive-Bayes classifier, and a three-dimensional binding pose using induced fit docking.

The classifier is first trained on software history, and then used to predict if an impending change causes a bug. Drawbacks of existing classifier-based bug prediction techniques are insufficient performance for practical use and slow prediction times due to a large number of machine learned features. This paper investigates multiple feature selection techniques that are generally applicable to classification-based bug prediction methods. The techniques discard less important features until optimal classification performance is reached. The total number of features used for training is substantially reduced, often to less than 10 percent of the original. The performance of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers when using this technique is characterized on 11 software projects. Naive Bayes using feature selection provides significant improvement in buggy F-measure (21 percent improvement) over prior change classification bug prediction results (by the second and fourth authors [28]). The SVM's improvement in buggy F-measure is 9 percent. Interestingly, an analysis of performance for varying numbers of features shows that strong performance is achieved at even 1 percent of the original number of features.

J	Koc, L; Mazzuchi, TA; Sarkani, S				Koc, Levent; Mazzuchi, Thomas A.; Sarkani, Shahram			A network intrusion detection system based on a Hidden Naive Bayes multiclass classifier	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Intrusion detection systems; Data mining; Multiclass classification; Hidden Naive Bayes (HNB); Denial-of-services (DoS)	SELECTION	With increasing Internet connectivity and traffic volume, recent intrusion incidents have reemphasized the importance of network intrusion detection systems for combating increasingly sophisticated network attacks. Techniques such as pattern recognition and the data mining of network events are often used by intrusion detection systems to classify the network events as either normal events or attack events. Our research study claims that the Hidden Naive Bayes (HNB) model can be applied to intrusion detection problems that suffer from dimensionality, highly correlated features and high network data stream volumes. HNB is a data mining model that relaxes the Naive Bayes method's conditional independence assumption. Our experimental results show that the HNB model exhibits a superior overall performance in terms of accuracy, error rate and misclassification cost compared with the traditional Naive Bayes model, leading extended Naive Bayes models and the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) Cup 1999 winner. Our model performed better than other leading state-of-the art models, such as SVM, in predictive accuracy. The results also indicate that our model significantly improves the accuracy of detecting denial-of-services (DoS) attacks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The proposed method focuses on specific characteristics of text categorization domain. Also, it ensures that every document in the training set is represented by at least one feature and the number of selected features is determined in a data-driven way. We compare the effectiveness of the proposed method with the Variable Ranking method using three text categorization benchmarks (Reuters-21578, 20 Newsgroup and WebKB), two different classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbor and Naive Bayes) and five feature evaluation functions. The experiments show that ALOFT obtains equivalent or better results than the classical Variable Ranking. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Pinheiro, Roberto H. W.; Cavalcanti, George D.

Two types of data representations were considered: microarray based and medical imaging based. In contrast to previous researches, this research also considered the imbalanced nature of these data. It was observed that the SMO algorithm performed better for the majority of the test data, especially for microarray based data when accuracy was used as performance measure. Considering the imbalanced characteristic of the data, the Naive Bayes algorithm was seen to perform highly in terms of true positive rate (TPR). Regarding the influence of SMOTE, a well-known imbalanced data classification technique, it was observed that there was a notable performance improvement for J48, while the performance of SMO remained comparable for the majority of the datasets. Overall, the results indicated SMO as the most potential candidate for the microarray and image dataset considered in this research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Parameter uncertainty in portfolio selection: Shrinking the inverse covariance matrix	JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE			English	Article						Portfolio optimisation; Inverse covariance matrix; Estimation risk; Shrinkage	MULTINORMAL PRECISION MATRIX; NAIVE DIVERSIFICATION; EFFICIENT PORTFOLIOS; EMPIRICAL BAYES; OPTIMIZATION; VARIANCE; CHOICE; MODEL; SENSITIVITY; PERFORMANCE	The estimation of the inverse covariance matrix plays a crucial role in optimal portfolio choice. We propose a new estimation framework that focuses on enhancing portfolio performance. The framework applies the statistical methodology of shrinkage directly to the inverse covariance matrix using two non-parametric methods. The first minimises the out-of-sample portfolio variance while the second aims to increase out-of-sample risk-adjusted returns. We apply the resulting estimators to compute the minimum variance portfolio weights and obtain a set of new portfolio strategies. These strategies have an intuitive form which allows us to extend our framework to account for short-sale constraints, transaction costs and singular covariance matrices. A comparative empirical analysis against several strategies from the literature shows that the new strategies often offer higher risk-adjusted returns and lower levels of risk. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Classification Accuracies of Physical Activities Using Smartphone Motion Sensors	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						Activity classification; machine learning; accelerometer; gyroscope; smartphone	UNITED-STATES	Background: Over the past few years, the world has witnessed an unprecedented growth in smartphone use. With sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes on board, smartphones have the potential to enhance our understanding of health behavior, in particular physical activity or the lack thereof. However, reliable and valid activity measurement using only a smartphone in situ has not been realized. Objective: To examine the validity of the iPod Touch (Apple, Inc.) and particularly to understand the value of using gyroscopes for classifying types of physical activity, with the goal of creating a measurement and feedback system that easily integrates into individuals' daily living. Methods: We collected accelerometer and gyroscope data for 16 participants on 13 activities with an iPod Touch, a device that has essentially the same sensors and computing platform as an iPhone. The 13 activities were sitting, walking, jogging, and going upstairs and downstairs at different paces. We extracted time and frequency features, including mean and variance of acceleration and gyroscope on each axis, vector magnitude of acceleration, and fast Fourier transform magnitude for each axis of acceleration. Different classifiers were compared using the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) toolkit, including C4.5 (J48) decision tree, multilayer perception, naive Bayes, logistic, k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and meta-algorithms such as boosting and bagging. The 10-fold cross-validation protocol was used. Results: Overall, the kNN classifier achieved the best accuracies: 52.3%-79.4% for up and down stair walking, 91.7% for jogging, 90.1%-94.1% for walking on a level ground, and 100% for sitting. A 2-second sliding window size with a 1-second overlap worked the best. Adding gyroscope measurements proved to be more beneficial than relying solely on accelerometer readings for all activities (with improvement ranging from 3.1% to 13.4%). Conclusions: Common categories of physical activity and sedentary behavior (walking, jogging, and sitting) can be recognized with high accuracies using both the accelerometer and gyroscope onboard the iPod touch or iPhone. This suggests the potential of developing just-in-time classification and feedback tools on smartphones.

However, most of the existing palmprint recognition systems are based on encoding and matching creases, which are not as reliable as ridges. This affects the use of palmprints in large-scale person identification applications where the biometric modality needs to be distinctive as well as insensitive to changes in age and skin conditions. Recently, several ridge-based palmprint matching algorithms have been proposed to fill the gap. Major contributions of these systems include reliable orientation field estimation in the presence of creases and the use of multiple features in matching, while the matching algorithms adopted in these systems simply follow the matching algorithms for fingerprints. However, palmprints differ from fingerprints in several aspects: 1) Palmprints are much larger and thus contain a large number of minutiae, 2) palms are more deformable than fingertips, and 3) the quality and discrimination power of different regions in palmprints vary significantly. As a result, these matchers are unable to appropriately handle the distortion and noise, despite heavy computational cost. Motivated by the matching strategies of human palmprint experts, we developed a novel palmprint recognition system. The main contributions are as follows: 1) Statistics of major features in palmprints are quantitatively studied, 2) a segment-based matching and fusion algorithm is proposed to deal with the skin distortion and the varying discrimination power of different palmprint regions, and 3) to reduce the computational complexity, an orientation field-based registration algorithm is designed for registering the palmprints into the same coordinate system before matching and a cascade filter is built to reject the nonmated gallery palmprints in early stage. The proposed matcher is tested by matching 840 query palmprints against a gallery set of 13,736 palmprints. Experimental results show that the proposed matcher outperforms the existing matchers a lot both in matching accuracy and speed.

J	Bekhuis, T; Demner-Fushman, D				Bekhuis, Tanja; Demner-Fushman, Dina			Screening nonrandomized studies for medical systematic reviews: A comparative study of classifiers	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Review						Medical informatics; Clinical research informatics; Text mining; Document classification; Systematic reviews	TEXT CATEGORIZATION; SEARCH FILTERS; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; WORKLOAD; QUALITY	Objectives: To investigate whether (1) machine learning classifiers can help identify nonrandomized studies eligible for full-text screening by systematic reviewers; (2) classifier performance varies with optimization; and (3) the number of citations to screen can be reduced. Methods: We used an open-source, data-mining suite to process and classify biomedical citations that point to mostly nonrandomized studies from 2 systematic reviews. We built training and test sets for citation portions and compared classifier performance by considering the value of indexing, various feature sets, and optimization. We conducted our experiments in 2 phases. The design of phase I with no optimization was: 4 classifiers x 3 feature sets x 3 citation portions. Classifiers included k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, complement nave Bayes, and evolutionary support vector machine. Feature sets included bag of words, and 2- and 3-term n-grams. Citation portions included titles, titles and abstracts, and full citations with metadata. Phase II with optimization involved a subset of the classifiers, as well as features extracted from full citations, and full citations with overweighted titles. We optimized features and classifier parameters by manually setting information gain thresholds outside of a process for iterative grid optimization with 10-fold cross-validations. We independently tested models on data reserved for that purpose and statistically compared classifier performance on 2 types of feature sets. We estimated the number of citations needed to screen by reviewers during a second pass through a reduced set of citations. Results: In phase I, the evolutionary support vector machine returned the best recall for bag of words extracted from full citations; the best classifier with respect to overall performance was k-nearest neighbor. No classifier attained good enough recall for this task without optimization. In phase II, we boosted performance with optimization for evolutionary support vector machine and complement naive Bayes classifiers. Generalization performance was better for the latter in the independent tests. For evolutionary support vector machine and complement naive Bayes classifiers, the initial retrieval set was reduced by 46% and 35%, respectively. Conclusions: Machine learning classifiers can help identify nonrandomized studies eligible for full-text screening by systematic reviewers. Optimization can markedly improve performance of classifiers. However, generalizability varies with the classifier. The number of citations to screen during a second independent pass through the citations can be substantially reduced. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We then made an F2 cross between CSS-11 and B6 and narrowed the locus (Bayes credible interval: 79109 Mb) which was inherited dominantly and accounted for 14% of the phenotypic variance in the CSS panel. In the present study, we created congenic and subcongenic lines possessing heterozygous portions of this QTL to narrow the interval. We identified one line (8496 Mb) that recapitulated the QTL, thus narrowing the region to 12 Mb. This interval also produced a small decrease in locomotor activity following prior saline treatment. When we generated subcongenic lines spanning the entire 12-Mb region, the phenotypic difference in MA sensitivity abruptly disappeared, suggesting an epistatic mechanism. We also evaluated the rewarding properties of MA (2 mg/kg, i.p.) in the 84- to 96-Mb congenic line using the conditioned place preference (CPP) test. We replicated the locomotor difference in the MA-paired CPP chamber yet observed no effect of genotype on MA-CPP, supporting the specificity of this QTL for MA-induced locomotor activity under these conditions. Lastly, to aid in prioritizing candidate genes responsible for this QTL, we used the Affymetrix GeneChip (R) Mouse Gene 1.0ST Array to identify genes containing expression QTLs (eQTL) in the striatum of drug-naIve, congenic mice. These findings highlight the difficulty of using congenic lines to fine map QTLs and illustrate how epistasis may thwart such efforts.	[Bryant, C. D.; Kole, L. A.; Guido, M.

In this paper, we propose a novel method, that advances the state of the art of fusing image information from different views, based on a special class of probabilistic graphical models, called causal independence models. The strength of this method is its ability to systematically and naturally capture uncertain domain knowledge, while performing information fusion in a computationally efficient way. We examine the value of the method for mammographic analysis and demonstrate its advantages in terms of explicit knowledge representation and accuracy (increase of at least 6.3% and 5.2% of true positive detection rates at 5% and 10% false positive rates) in comparison with previous single-view and multi-view systems, and benchmark fusion methods such as naive Bayes and logistic regression.

Energy-Efficient Context Classification With Dynamic Sensor Control	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Classification; energy efficiency; hidden Markov model; optimization; partially observable Markov decision process; sensor selection; wearable platform	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; ACTIVITY RECOGNITION; WEARABLE SYSTEMS; CARE	Energy efficiency has been a longstanding design challenge for wearable sensor systems. It is especially crucial in continuous subject state monitoring due to the ongoing need for compact sizes and better sensors. This paper presents an energy-efficient classification algorithm, based on partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In every time step, POMDP dynamically selects sensors for classification via a sensor selection policy. The sensor selection problem is formalized as an optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize misclassification cost given some energy budget. State transitions are modeled as a hidden Markov model (HMM), and the corresponding sensor selection policy is represented using a finite-state controller (FSC). To evaluate this framework, sensor data were collected from multiple subjects in their free-living conditions. Relative accuracies and energy reductions from the proposed method are compared against naive Bayes (always-on) and simple random strategies to validate the relative performance of the algorithm. When the objective is to maintain the same classification accuracy, significant energy reduction is achieved.	[Au, Lawrence K.; Bui, Alex A.

J	Kang, H; Yoo, SJ; Han, D				Kang, Hanhoon; Yoo, Seong Joon; Han, Dongil			Senti-lexicon and improved Naive Bayes algorithms for sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Review						Sentiment analysis; Lexicon; Machine learning; Opinion mining; Restaurant review		The existing senti-lexicon does not sufficiently accommodate the sentiment word that is used in the restaurant review. Therefore, this thesis proposes a new senti-lexicon for the sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews. When classifying a review document as a positive sentiment and as a negative sentiment using the supervised learning algorithm, there is a tendency for the positive classification accuracy to appear up to approximately 10% higher than the negative classification accuracy. This creates a problem of decreasing the average accuracy when the accuracies of the two classes are expressed as an average value. In order to mitigate such problem, an improved Naive Bayes algorithm is proposed. The result of the experiment showed that when this algorithm was used and a unigrams + bigrams was used as the feature, the gap between the positive accuracy and the negative accuracy was narrowed to 3.6% compared to when the original Naive Bayes was used, and that the 28.5% gap was able to be narrowed compared to when SVM was used. Additionally, the use of this algorithm based on the senti-lexicon showed an accuracy that improved by a maximum of 10.2% in recall and a maximum of 26.2% in precision compared to when SVM was used, and by a maximum of 5.6% in recall and a maximum of 1.9% in precision compared to when Naive Bayes was used.

J	Ma, Y; Luo, GC; Zeng, X; Chen, AG				Ma, Ying; Luo, Guangchun; Zeng, Xue; Chen, Aiguo			Transfer learning for cross-company software defect prediction	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Machine learning; Software defect prediction; Transfer learning; Naive Bayes; Different distribution	NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; METRICS; MODELS	Context: Software defect prediction studies usually built models using within-company data, but very few focused on the prediction models trained with cross-company data. It is difficult to employ these models which are built on the within-company data in practice, because of the lack of these local data repositories. Recently, transfer learning has attracted more and more attention for building classifier in target domain using the data from related source domain. It is very useful in cases when distributions of training and test instances differ, but is it appropriate for cross-company software defect prediction? Objective: In this paper, we consider the cross-company defect prediction scenario where source and target data are drawn from different companies. In order to harness cross company data, we try to exploit the transfer learning method to build faster and highly effective prediction model. Method: Unlike the prior works selecting training data which are similar from the test data, we proposed a novel algorithm called Transfer Naive Bayes (TNB), by using the information of all the proper features in training data. Our solution estimates the distribution of the test data, and transfers cross-company data information into the weights of the training data. On these weighted data, the defect prediction model is built. Results: This article presents a theoretical analysis for the comparative methods, and shows the experiment results on the data sets from different organizations. It indicates that TNB is more accurate in terms of AUC (The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), within less runtime than the state of the art methods. Conclusion: It is concluded that when there are too few local training data to train good classifiers, the useful knowledge from different-distribution training data on feature level may help. We are optimistic that our transfer learning method can guide optimal resource allocation strategies, which may reduce software testing cost and increase effectiveness of software testing process.

J	Hausfeld, L; De Martino, F; Bonte, M; Formisano, E				Hausfeld, Lars; De Martino, Federico; Bonte, Milene; Formisano, Elia			Pattern analysis of EEG responses to speech and voice: Influence of feature grouping	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Machine learning; Classification; Audition; Speech	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; CLASSIFICATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; COMMUNICATION; RECORDINGS; ALGORITHMS; SELECTION	Pattern recognition algorithms are becoming increasingly used in functional neuroimaging. These algorithms exploit information contained in temporal, spatial, or spatio-temporal patterns of independent variables (features) to detect subtle but reliable differences between brain responses to external stimuli or internal brain states. When applied to the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, a choice needs to be made on how the input features to the algorithm are obtained from the signal amplitudes measured at the various channels. In this article, we consider six types of pattern analyses deriving from the combination of three types of feature selection in the temporal domain (predefined windows, shifting window, whole trial) with two approaches to handle the channel dimension (channel wise, multi-channel). We combined these different types of analyses with a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier and analyzed a multi-subject EEG data set from a study aimed at understanding the task dependence of the cortical mechanisms for encoding speaker's identity and speech content (vowels) from short speech utterances (Bonte, Valente, & Formisano, 2009). Outcomes of the analyses showed that different grouping of available features helps highlighting complementary (i.e. temporal, topographic) aspects of information content in the data. A shifting window/multi-channel approach proved especially valuable in tracing both the early build up of neural information reflecting speaker or vowel identity and the late and task-dependent maintenance of relevant information reflecting the performance of a working memory task. Because it exploits the high temporal resolution of EEG (and MEG), such a shifting window approach with sequential multi-channel classifications seems the most appropriate choice for tracing the temporal profile of neural information processing.

J	Alvares-Cherman, E; Metz, J; Monard, MC				Alvares-Cherman, Everton; Metz, Jean; Monard, Maria Carolina			Incorporating label dependency into the binary relevance framework for multi-label classification	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Machine learning; Multi-label classification; Binary relevance; Label dependency	CATEGORIZATION	In multi-label classification, examples can be associated with multiple labels simultaneously. The task of learning from multi-label data can be addressed by methods that transform the multi-label classification problem into several single-label classification problems. The binary relevance approach is one of these methods, where the multi-label learning task is decomposed into several independent binary classification problems, one for each label in the set of labels, and the final labels for each example are determined by aggregating the predictions from all binary classifiers. However, this approach fails to consider any dependency among the labels. Aiming to accurately predict label combinations, in this paper we propose a simple approach that enables the binary classifiers to discover existing label dependency by themselves. An experimental study using decision trees, a kernel method as well as Naive Bayes as base-learning techniques shows the potential of the proposed approach to improve the multi-label classification performance.

J	Jiang, LX; Cai, ZH; Wang, DH; Zhang, H				Jiang, Liangxiao; Cai, Zhihua; Wang, Dianhong; Zhang, Harry			Improving Tree augmented Naive Bayes for class probability estimation	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Naive Bayes; Tree Augmented Naive Bayes; Class probability estimation; Conditional log likelihood; Ensemble learning	ONE-DEPENDENCE ESTIMATORS; ROC CURVE; CLASSIFIERS; RANKING; AREA	Numerous algorithms have been proposed to improve Naive Bayes (NB) by weakening its conditional attribute independence assumption, among which Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN) has demonstrated remarkable classification performance in terms of classification accuracy or error rate, while maintaining efficiency and simplicity. In many real-world applications, however, classification accuracy or error rate is not enough. For example, in direct marketing, we often need to deploy different promotion strategies to customers with different likelihood (class probability) of buying some products. Thus, accurate class probability estimation is often required to make optimal decisions. In this paper, we investigate the class probability estimation performance of TAN in terms of conditional log likelihood (CLL) and present a new algorithm to improve its class probability estimation performance by the spanning TAN classifiers. We call our improved algorithm Averaged Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (ATAN). The experimental results on a large number of UCI datasets published on the main web site of Weka platform show that ATAN significantly outperforms TAN and all the other algorithms used to compare in terms of CLL.

It utilizes a single parameter that transforms the approach between a low-variance high-bias learner (Naive Bayes) and a high-variance low-bias learner with Bayes optimal asymptotic error. It extends the underlying strategy of Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE), which relaxes the Naive Bayes independence assumption while retaining many of Naive Bayes' desirable computational and theoretical properties. AnDE further relaxes the independence assumption by generalizing AODE to higher-levels of dependence. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that the bias-variance trade-off for Averaged 2-Dependence Estimators results in strong predictive accuracy over a wide range of data sets. It has training time linear with respect to the number of examples, learns in a single pass through the training data, supports incremental learning, handles directly missing values, and is robust in the face of noise. Beyond the practical utility of its lower-dimensional variants, AnDE is of interest in that it demonstrates that it is possible to create low-bias high-variance generative learners and suggests strategies for developing even more powerful classifiers.

Emotional states in judicial courtrooms: An experimental investigation	SPEECH COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Emotion recognition; Pattern recognition; Application	SPEECH; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION	Thanks to the recent progress in the judicial proceedings management, especially related to the introduction of audio/video recording facilities, the challenge of identification of emotional states can be tackled. Discovering affective states embedded into speech signals could help in semantic retrieval of multimedia clips, and therefore in a deep understanding of mechanisms behind courtroom debates and judges/jurors decision making processes. In this paper two main contributions are given: (1) the collection of real-world human emotions coming from courtroom audio recordings; (2) the investigation of a hierarchical classification system, based on a risk minimization method, able to recognize emotional states from speech signatures. The accuracy of the proposed classification approach - named Multilayer Support Vector Machines - has been evaluated by comparing its performance with traditional machine learning approaches, by using both benchmark datasets and real courtroom recordings. Results in recognition obtained by the proposed technique outperform the prediction power achieved by traditional approaches like SVM, k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and Bayesian Networks.

J	Jiang, LX; Zhang, H; Cai, ZH; Wang, DH				Jiang, Liangxiao; Zhang, Harry; Cai, Zhihua; Wang, Dianhong			Weighted average of one-dependence estimators	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						naive Bayes; averaged one-dependence estimators; attribute weighting; classification; data mining	ROC CURVE; AREA	Naive Bayes (NB) is a probability-based classification model which is based on the attribute independence assumption. However, in many real-world data mining applications, its attribute independence assumption is often violated. Responding to this fact, researchers have made a substantial amount of effort to improve the classification accuracy of NB by weakening its attribute independence assumption. For a recent example, averaged one-dependence estimators (AODE) is proposed, which weakens its attribute independence assumption by averaging all models from a restricted class of one-dependence classifiers. However, all one-dependence classifiers in AODE have same weights and are treated equally. According to our observation, different one-dependence classifiers should have different weights. Therefore, in this article, we proposed an improved model called weighted average of one-dependence estimators (WAODE) by assigning different weights to these one-dependence classifiers. In our WAODE, four different weighting approaches are designed and thus four different versions are created. For simplicity, we respectively denote them by WAODE-MI, WAODE-ACC, WAODE-CLL and WAODE-AUC. The experimental results on a large number of UCI datasets published on the main website of Weka platform show that our WAODE significantly outperform AODE.

Automated Classification of Free-text Pathology Reports for Registration of Incident Cases of Cancer	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Medical Informatics; neoplasm; pathology; free text; automated classification	MEDICAL INFORMATICS; HIGH AGREEMENT; LOW KAPPA; RETRIEVAL; BIOINFORMATICS; PARADOXES	Objective: Our study aimed to construct and evaluate functions called "classifiers", produced by supervised machine learning techniques, in order to categorize automatically pathology reports using solely their content. Methods: Patients from the Poitou-Charentes Cancer Registry having at least one pathology report and a single non-metastatic invasive neoplasm were included. A descriptor weighting function accounting for the distribution of terms among targeted classes was developed and compared to classic methods based on inverse document frequencies. The classification was performed with support vector machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes classifiers. Two levels of granularity were tested for both the topographical and the morphological axes of the ICD-03 code. The ability to correctly attribute a precise ICD-03 code and the ability to attribute the broad category defined by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) for the multiple primary cancer registration rules were evaluated using F1-measures. Results: 5121 pathology reports produced by 35 pathologists were selected. The best performance was achieved by our class-weighted descriptor, associated with a SVM classifier. Using this method, the pathology reports were properly classified in the IARC categories with F1-measures of 0.967 for both topography and morphology. The ICD-03 code attribution had lower performance with a 0.715 F1-measure for topography and 0.854 for morphology. Conclusion: These results suggest that free-text pathology reports could be useful as a data source for automated systems in order to identify and notify new cases of cancer. Future work is needed to evaluate the improvement in performance obtained from the use of natural language processing, including the case of multiple tumor description and possible incorporation of other medical documents such as surgical reports.

This paper presents a novel haptic exploration strategy for recognizing the physical properties of unknown object surfaces using an intelligent finger. This developed intelligent finger is capable of identifying the contact location, normal and tangential force, and the vibrations generated from the contact in real time. In the proposed strategy, this finger gently slides along the surface with a short stroke while increasing and decreasing the sliding velocity. By applying a dynamic friction model to describe this contact, rich and accurate surface physical properties can be identified within this stroke. This allows different surface materials to be easily distinguished even if when they have very similar texture. Several supervised learning algorithms have been applied and compared for surface recognition based on the obtained surface properties. It has been found that the naive Bayes classifier is superior to radial basis function network and k-NN method, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 88.5% for distinguishing twelve different surface materials.

When mining knowledge from emerging applications such as sensor networks or location based services, data uncertainty should be handled cautiously to avoid erroneous results. In this paper, we apply probabilistic and statistical theory on uncertain data and develop a novel method to calculate conditional probabilities of Bayes theorem. Based on that, we propose a novel Bayesian classification algorithm for uncertain data. The experimental results show that the proposed method classifies uncertain data with potentially higher accuracies than the Naive Bayesian approach. It also has a more stable performance than the existing extended Naive Bayesian method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Selecting Relevant Descriptors for Classification by Bayesian Estimates: A Comparison with Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines Approaches for Disparate Data Sets	MOLECULAR INFORMATICS			English	Article						Chemoinformatics; Drug design; Feature selection; in silico-ADMET; Machine learning; Molecular descriptors; Naive Bayes classifier	CYTOCHROME-P450 3A4; PHARMACOPHORE MODEL; COMBINED PROTEIN; DRUG-METABOLISM; SHANNON ENTROPY; PREDICTION; CYP2D6; 2C9; 2D6; INFORMATION	Classification algorithms suffer from the curse of dimensionality, which leads to overfitting, particularly if the problem is over-determined. Therefore it is of particular interest to identify the most relevant descriptors to reduce the complexity. We applied Bayesian estimates to model the probability distribution of descriptors values used for binary classification using n-fold cross-validation. As a measure for the discriminative power of the classifiers, the symmetric form of the Kullback-Leibler divergence of their probability distributions was computed. We found that the most relevant descriptors possess a Gaussian-like distribution of their values, show the largest divergences, and therefore appear most often in the cross-validation scenario. The results were compared to those of the LASSO feature selection method applied to multiple decision trees and support vector machine approaches for data sets of substrates and nonsubstrates of three Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, which comprise strongly unbalanced compound distributions. In contrast to decision trees and support vector machines, the performance of Bayesian estimates is less affected by unbalanced data sets. This strategy reveals those descriptors that allow a simple linear separation of the classes, whereas the superior accuracy of decision trees and support vector machines can be attributed to nonlinear separation, which are in turn more prone to overfitting.

Medications are not always effectively used and misuse may harm patients. Drugs are the fastest-growing element of Canadian health care spending, second only to hospital spending. Three hundred million prescriptions are filled annually. Prescription drugs accounted for 5.8% of total health care spending in 1980 and close to 18% today. A primary long-term goal of this research is to develop a decision support system for evidence-based management, quality control and best practice recommendations for medical prescriptions. Our results will improve accessibility and management of information by: (1) building an prototype for adaptive information extraction, text and data mining from (online) documents to find evidence on which to base best practices; and (2) employing multiply sectioned Bayesian networks (MSBNs) to infer a probabilistic interpretation to validate evidence for recommendations; MSBNs provide this structure. Best practices to improve drug-related health outcomes; patients' quality of life; and cost-effective use of medications by changing knowledge and behavior. This research will support next generation eHealth decision support systems, which routinely find and verify evidence from multiple sources, leading to cost-effective use of drugs, improve patients' quality of life and optimize drug-related health outcomes.

An AR system trained in an environment would only be applicable to that environment. Such a system would not be able to recognize the new activities of interest. In this paper we propose a General-Purpose Activity Recognition System (GPARS) using simple and ubiquitous sensors. It would be applicable to almost any environment and would have the ability to handle growing amounts of activities and sensors in a graceful manner (Scalable). Given a set of activities to monitor, object names (with embedded sensors) and their corresponding locations, the GPARS first mines activity knowledge from the web, and then uses them as the basis of AR. The novelty of our system, compared to the existing general-purpose systems, lies in: (1) it uses more robust activity models, (2) it significantly reduces the mining time. We have tested our system with three real world datasets. It is observed that the accuracy of activity recognition using our system is more than 80%. Our proposed mechanism yields significant improvement (more than 30%) in comparison with its counterpart.

Tissue-specific prediction of directly regulated genes	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							FACTOR-BINDING-SITES; HUMAN GENOME; CELLS; PLURIPOTENT; MODEL; MAPS	Direct binding by a transcription factor (TF) to the proximal promoter of a gene is a strong evidence that the TF regulates the gene. Assaying the genome-wide binding of every TF in every cell type and condition is currently impractical. Histone modifications correlate with tissue/cell/condition-specific ('tissue specific') TF binding, so histone ChIP-seq data can be combined with traditional position weight matrix (PWM) methods to make tissue-specific predictions of TF-promoter interactions. Results: We use supervised learning to train a naive Bayes predictor of TF-promoter binding. The predictor's features are the histone modification levels and a PWM-based score for the promoter. Training and testing uses sets of promoters labeled using TF ChIP-seq data, and we use cross-validation on 23 such datasets to measure the accuracy. A PWM+histone naive Bayes predictor using a single histone modification (H3K4me3) is substantially more accurate than a PWM score or a conservation-based score (phylogenetic motif model). The naive Bayes predictor is more accurate (on average) at all sensitivity levels, and makes only half as many false positive predictions at sensitivity levels from 10% to 80%. On average, it correctly predicts 80% of bound promoters at a false positive rate of 20%. Accuracy does not diminish when we test the predictor in a different cell type (and species) from training. Accuracy is barely diminished even when we train the predictor without using TF ChIP-seq data.

Although a number of tools have been developed to identify optimal gene expression signatures, they often generate gene lists that are too long to be exploited clinically. Consequently, researchers in the field try to identify the smallest set of genes that provide good sample classification. We investigated the genome-wide expression of the inflammatory phenotype in dendritic cells. Dendritic cells are a complex group of cells that play a critical role in vertebrate immunity. Therefore, the prediction of the inflammatory phenotype in these cells may help with the selection of immune-modulating compounds. Results: A data mining protocol was applied to microarray data for murine cell lines treated with various inflammatory stimuli. The learning and validation data sets consisted of 155 and 49 samples, respectively. The data mining protocol reduced the number of probe sets from 5,802 to 10, then from 10 to 6 and finally from 6 to 3. The performances of a set of supervised classification models were compared. The best accuracy, when using the six following genes -II12b, Cd40, Socs3, Irgm1, Plin2 and Lgals3bp- was obtained by Tree Augmented Naive Bayes and Nearest Neighbour (91.8%). Using the smallest set of three genes -II12b, Cd40 and Socs3- the performance remained satisfactory and the best accuracy was with Support Vector Machine (95.9%). These data mining models, using data for the genes II12b, Cd40 and Socs3, were validated with a human data set consisting of 27 samples. Support Vector Machines (71.4%) and Nearest Neighbour (92.6%) gave the worst performances, but the remaining models correctly classified all the 27 samples. Conclusions: The genes selected by the data mining protocol proposed were shown to be informative for discriminating between inflammatory and steady-state phenotypes in dendritic cells. The robustness of the data mining protocol was confirmed by the accuracy for a human data set, when using only the following three genes: II12b, Cd40 and Socs3. In summary, we analysed the longitudinal pattern of expression in dendritic cells stimulated with activating agents with the aim of identifying signatures that would predict or explain the dentritic cell response to an inflammatory agent.

In NIDAAC, the concepts and formal definitions of self, nonself, antibody, antigen and detector in the intrusion detection domain are given. Then, in initial IDS, new detectors are generated from the gene library and tested by the negative selection. In every effective IDS node, according to the intrusion network traffic pattern intensity, the change of antibody number is recorded from the process of clone proliferation based on the detector evolution. Finally, building upon the above works, a probabilistic calculation model for intrusion alarm production, which is based on the correlation between the antibody concentration and the intrusion network traffic pattern intensity, is proposed. Compared with Naive Bayes (NB), Multilevel Classifier (AdaBoost) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM), the false alarm rate of NIDAAC is reduced by 8.66%, 4.93% and 6.36%, respectively. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results show that NIDAAC has a better performance than previous approaches.

Application of an efficient Bayesian discretization method to biomedical data	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							GENE-EXPRESSION PROFILES; B-CELL LYMPHOMA; MOLECULAR CLASSIFICATION; PREDICT SURVIVAL; BREAST-CANCER; NETWORKS; ADENOCARCINOMA; CARCINOMAS; DISCOVERY; TUMOR	Background: Several data mining methods require data that are discrete, and other methods often perform better with discrete data. We introduce an efficient Bayesian discretization (EBD) method for optimal discretization of variables that runs efficiently on high-dimensional biomedical datasets. The EBD method consists of two components, namely, a Bayesian score to evaluate discretizations and a dynamic programming search procedure to efficiently search the space of possible discretizations. We compared the performance of EBD to Fayyad and Irani's (FI) discretization method, which is commonly used for discretization. Results: On 24 biomedical datasets obtained from high-throughput transcriptomic and proteomic studies, the classification performances of the C4.5 classifier and the naive Bayes classifier were statistically significantly better when the predictor variables were discretized using EBD over FI. EBD was statistically significantly more stable to the variability of the datasets than FI. However, EBD was less robust, though not statistically significantly so, than FI and produced slightly more complex discretizations than FI. Conclusions: On a range of biomedical datasets, a Bayesian discretization method (EBD) yielded better classification performance and stability but was less robust than the widely used FI discretization method. The EBD discretization method is easy to implement, permits the incorporation of prior knowledge and belief, and is sufficiently fast for application to high-dimensional data.

Higher Order Naive Bayes: A Novel Non-IID Approach to Text Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Machine learning; statistical relational learning; naive bayes; text classification; IID		The underlying assumption in traditional machine learning algorithms is that instances are Independent and Identically Distributed (IID). These critical independence assumptions made in traditional machine learning algorithms prevent them from going beyond instance boundaries to exploit latent relations between features. In this paper, we develop a general approach to supervised learning by leveraging higher order dependencies between features. We introduce a novel Bayesian framework for classification termed Higher Order Naive Bayes (HONB). Unlike approaches that assume data instances are independent, HONB leverages higher order relations between features across different instances. The approach is validated in the classification domain on widely used benchmark data sets. Results obtained on several benchmark text corpora demonstrate that higher order approaches achieve significant improvements in classification accuracy over the baseline methods, especially when training data is scarce. A complexity analysis also reveals that the space and time complexity of HONB compare favorably with existing approaches.

J	Li, CQ; Li, HW				Li, Chaoqun; Li, Hongwei			One Dependence Value Difference Metric	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Value Difference Metric; Attribute independence assumption; One dependence; Bayesian network classifiers; Structure learning	AUGMENTED NAIVE BAYES; LEARNING ALGORITHMS; CLASSIFIERS; ESTIMATORS; RANKING; TREE	Many distance-related algorithms depend upon a good distance metric to be successful. The Value Difference Metric, simply VDM, is proposed to find reasonable distance metric between each pair of instances with nominal attribute values only. In VDM, all of the attributes are assumed to be fully independent, and the difference between two values of an attribute is only considered to be closer if they have more similar correlation with the output classes. It is obvious that the attribute independence assumption in VDM is rarely true in reality, which would harm its performance in the applications with complex attribute dependencies. In this paper, we single out an improved Value Difference Metric by relaxing its unrealistic attribute independence assumption. We call it One Dependence Value Difference Metric, simply ODVDM. In ODVDM, the structure learning algorithms for Bayesian network classifiers, such as tree augmented naive Bayes, are used to find the dependence relationships among the attributes. Our experimental results validate its effectiveness in terms of classification accuracy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This classifier requires only a single pass over the dataset to compute the feature frequencies per class, is easy to implement, and has memory usage that is linear in the number of features. Results of experiments performed on 128 binary and multi-class text and web datasets show that FWC's performance is at least comparable to, and often better than that of Naive Bayes, TWCNB, Winnow, Balanced Winnow and linear SVM. On a large-scale web dataset with 12,294 classes and 135,973 training instances, FWC trained in 13 s and yielded comparable classification performance to a state of the art multi-class SVM implementation, which took over 15 min to train.

J	Xing, CH; Dunson, DB				Xing, Chuanhua; Dunson, David B.			Bayesian Inference for Genomic Data Integration Reduces Misclassification Rate in Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							INTERACTION NETWORKS; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; DRUG DISCOVERY; GENE FUSION; YEAST; SCALE; ORGANISMS; BIOLOGY; MODEL; TEXT	Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essential to most fundamental cellular processes. There has been increasing interest in reconstructing PPIs networks. However, several critical difficulties exist in obtaining reliable predictions. Noticeably, false positive rates can be as high as > 80%. Error correction from each generating source can be both time-consuming and inefficient due to the difficulty of covering the errors from multiple levels of data processing procedures within a single test. We propose a novel Bayesian integration method, deemed nonparametric Bayes ensemble learning (NBEL), to lower the misclassification rate (both false positives and negatives) through automatically up-weighting data sources that are most informative, while down-weighting less informative and biased sources. Extensive studies indicate that NBEL is significantly more robust than the classic naive Bayes to unreliable, error-prone and contaminated data. On a large human data set our NBEL approach predicts many more PPIs than naive Bayes. This suggests that previous studies may have large numbers of not only false positives but also false negatives. The validation on two human PPIs datasets having high quality supports our observations. Our experiments demonstrate that it is feasible to predict high-throughput PPIs computationally with substantially reduced false positives and false negatives. The ability of predicting large numbers of PPIs both reliably and automatically may inspire people to use computational approaches to correct data errors in general, and may speed up PPIs prediction with high quality. Such a reliable prediction may provide a solid platform to other studies such as protein functions prediction and roles of PPIs in disease susceptibility.

J	Wong, TT; Chang, LH				Wong, Tzu-Tsung; Chang, Liang-Hao			Individual attribute prior setting methods for naive Bayesian classifiers	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Dirichlet distribution; Generalized Dirichlet distribution; Naive Bayesian classifier; Prior distribution; Selective naive Bayes	DIRICHLET DISTRIBUTION	The generalized Dirichlet distribution has been shown to be a more appropriate prior for naive Bayesian classifiers, because it can release both the negative-correlation and the equal-confidence requirements of the Dirichlet distribution. The previous research did not take the impact of individual attributes on classification accuracy into account, and therefore assumed that all attributes follow the same generalized Dirichlet prior. In this study, the selective naive Bayes mechanism is employed to choose and rank attributes, and two methods are then proposed to search for the best prior of each single attribute according to the attribute ranks. The experimental results on 18 data sets show that the best approach is to use selective naive Bayes for filtering and ranking attributes when all of them have Dirichlet priors with Laplace's estimate. After the ranks of the chosen attributes are determined, individual setting is performed to search for the best noninformative generalized Dirichlet prior for each attribute. The selective naive Bayes is also compared with two representative filters for the feature selection, and the experimental results show that it has the best performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Catal, C; Sevim, U; Diri, B				Catal, Cagatay; Sevim, Ugur; Diri, Banu			Practical development of an Eclipse-based software fault prediction tool using Naive Bayes algorithm	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Machine learning; Naive Bayes; Eclipse technology; Software fault prediction	MODELS; METRICS; CODE	Despite the amount of effort software engineers have been putting into developing fault prediction models. software fault prediction still poses great challenges. This research using machine learning and statistical techniques has been ongoing for 15 years, and yet we still have not had a breakthrough. Unfortunately, none of these prediction models have achieved widespread applicability in the software industry due to a lack of software tools to automate this prediction process. Historical project data, including software faults and a robust software fault prediction tool, can enable quality managers to focus on fault-prone modules. Thus, they can improve the testing process. We developed an Eclipse-based software fault prediction tool for Java programs to simplify the fault prediction process. We also integrated a machine learning algorithm called Naive Bayes into the plug-in because of its proven high-performance for this problem. This article presents a practical view to software fault prediction problem, and it shows how we managed to combine software metrics with software fault data to apply Naive Bayes technique inside an open source platform.

J	Chowdhury, I; Zulkernine, M				Chowdhury, Istehad; Zulkernine, Mohammad			Using complexity, coupling, and cohesion metrics as early indicators of vulnerabilities	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE			English	Article						Vulnerability prediction; Software metrics; Complexity; Coupling; Cohesion	OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN; SYSTEMS; SUITE	Software security failures are common and the problem is growing. A vulnerability is a weakness in the software that, when exploited, causes a security failure. It is difficult to detect vulnerabilities until they manifest themselves as security failures in the operational stage of software, because security concerns are often not addressed or known sufficiently early during the software development life cycle. Numerous studies have shown that complexity, coupling, and cohesion (CCC) related structural metrics are important indicators of the quality of software architecture, and software architecture is one of the most important and early design decisions that influences the final quality of the software system. Although these metrics have been successfully employed to indicate software faults in general, there are no systematic guidelines on how to use these metrics to predict vulnerabilities in software. If CCC metrics can be used to indicate vulnerabilities, these metrics could aid in the conception of more secured architecture, leading to more secured design and code and eventually better software. In this paper, we present a framework to automatically predict vulnerabilities based on CCC metrics. To empirically validate the framework and prediction accuracy, we conduct a large empirical study on fifty-two releases of Mozilla Firefox developed over a period of four years. To build vulnerability predictors, we consider four alternative data mining and statistical techniques - C4.5 Decision Tree, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, and Naive-Bayes - and compare their prediction performances. We are able to correctly predict majority of the vulnerability-prone files in Mozilla Firefox, with tolerable false positive rates. Moreover, the predictors built from the past releases can reliably predict the likelihood of having vulnerabilities in the future releases. The experimental results indicate that structural information from the non-security realm such as complexity, coupling, and cohesion are useful in vulnerability prediction. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Groth, SS; Muntermann, J				Groth, Sven S.; Muntermann, Jan			An intraday market risk management approach based on textual analysis	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Market risk management; Text mining; Corporate disclosures		The management of financial risk is one of the most challenging tasks of financial institutions. In the last two decades, diverse quantitative models and approaches have been developed and refined to address the impact of volatile markets on business. Whereas existing approaches have intensively utilized structured data such as historical price series, little attention has been paid to unstructured (textual) data, which could be a large source of information in this context. Previous empirical research has shown that certain news stories, such as corporate disclosures, can cause abnormal price behavior subsequent to their publication. On the basis of a data set comprising such news stories as well as intraday stock prices, this paper explores the risk implications of information being newly available to market participants. After showing that such events can significantly drive stock price volatilities, this research aims at identifying among the textual data provided those disclosures that have resulted in most supranormal risk exposures. To this end, four different learners - Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbour, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine - have been applied in order to detect patterns in the textual data that could explain increased risk exposure. Two evaluations are presented in order to assess the learning capabilities of the approach in the context of risk management. First, "classic" data mining evaluation metrics are applied and, second, a newly developed simulation-based evaluation method is presented. Evaluation results provide strong evidence that unstructured (textual) data represents a valuable source of information also for financial risk management - a domain in which, in the past, little attention has been paid to unstructured data. With regard to classification performance, it is also shown that there exist significant differences between the applied learning techniques. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Alan; Chen, Hsinchun			Identity matching using personal and social identity features	INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS			English	Article						Identity management; Identity matching; Probabilistic relational model; Social context	HETEROGENEOUS DATABASES; NAIVE BAYES; MODEL	Identity verification is essential in our mission to identify potential terrorists and criminals. It is not a trivial task because terrorists reportedly assume multiple identities using either fraudulent or legitimate means. A national identification card and biometrics technologies have been proposed as solutions to the identity problem. However, several studies show their inability to tackle the complex problem. We aim to develop data mining alternatives that can match identities referring to the same individual. Existing identity matching techniques based on data mining primarily rely on personal identity features. In this research, we propose a new identity matching technique that considers both personal identity features and social identity features. We define two groups of social identity features including social activities and social relations. The proposed technique is built upon a probabilistic relational model that utilizes a relational database structure to extract social identity features. Experiments show that the social activity features significantly improve the matching performance while the social relation features effectively reduce false positive and false negative decisions.

The NBNN kernel	2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION (ICCV)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)	NOV 06-13, 2011	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE, Toyota, Google, Microsoft Res, Siemens, Technicolor, Adobe, Alcatel Lucent, Gentex Corp, Kooaba Image Recognit, Mitsubishi Elect, Mobileye, Object Video (OV), Toshiba, Xerox, Zeiss, 2d3, SATURNUS				Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor (NBNN) has recently been proposed as a powerful, non-parametric approach for object classification, that manages to achieve remarkably good results thanks to the avoidance of a vector quantization step and the use of image-to-class comparisons, yielding good generalization. In this paper, we introduce a kernelized version of NBNN. This way, we can learn the classifier in a discriminative setting. Moreover, it then becomes straightforward to combine it with other kernels. In particular, we show that our NBNN kernel is complementary to standard bag-of-features based kernels, focussing on local generalization as opposed to global image composition. By combining them, we achieve state-of-the-art results on Caltech101 and 15 Scenes datasets. As a side contribution, we also investigate how to speed up the NBNN computations.

Discretization as the enabling technique for the Naive Bayes and semi-Naive Bayes-based classification	KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING REVIEW			English	Review							MIXED-MODE DATA; CONTINUOUS ATTRIBUTES; ALGORITHM; CLASSIFIERS; RULES	Current classification problems that concern data sets of large and increasing size require scalable classification algorithms. In this study, we concentrate on several scalable, linear complexity classifiers that include one of the top 10 voted data mining methods, Naive Bayes (NB), and several recently proposed semi-NB classifiers. These algorithms perform front-end discretization of the continuous features since by design they work only with nominal or discrete features. We address the lack of studies that investigate the benefits and drawbacks of discretization in the context of the subsequent classification. Our comprehensive empirical study considers 12 discretizers (two unsupervised and 10 supervised), seven classifiers (two classical NB and five semi-NB), and 16 data sets. We investigate the scalability of the discretizers and show that the fastest supervised discretizers fast class-attribute interdependency maximization (FCAIM), class-attribute interdependency maximization (CAIM), and information entropy maximization (IEM) provide discretization schemes with the highest overall quality. We show that discretization improves the classification accuracy when compared against the two classical methods, NB and Flexible Naive Bayes (FNB), executed on the raw data. The choice of the discretization algorithm impacts the significance of the improvements. The MODL, FCAIM, and CAIM methods provide statistically significant improvements, while the IEM, Class-attribute contingency coefficient (CACC), and Khiops discretizers provide moderate improvements. The most accurate classification models are generated by the Averaged one-dependence estimators (AODEsr) classifier followed by AODE and HNB (Hidden Naive Bayes). AODEsr run on data discretized with MODL, FCAIM, and CAIM provides statistically significantly better accuracies than both the classical NB methods. The worst results are obtained with the NB, FNB, and LBR (Lazy Bayes rule) classifiers. We show that although the time to build the discretization scheme could be longer than the time to train the classifier, the completion of the entire process (to discretize data, compute the classifier, and predict test instances) is often faster than the NB-based classification of the continuous instances. This is because the time to classify test instances is an important factor that is positively influenced by discretization. The biggest positive influence, both on the accuracy and the classification time, is associated with the MODL, FCAIM, and CAIM algorithms.

This information can vary in many fields such as tendencies, habits, attitudes, guilt situations, and intentions of the speakers. Therefore, analysis and processing of these conversations are of much importance. Many social and semantic inferences can be made from these conversations. In determining characteristics of conversations and analysis of conversations, subject designation can be grounded on. In this study, chat mining is chosen as an application of text mining, and a study concerning determination of subject in the Turkish text based chat conversations is conducted. In sorting the conversations, supervised learning methods are used in this study. As for classifiers, Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine are used. Ninety-one percent success is achieved in determination of subject. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ong, MS; Magrabi, F; Coiera, E				Ong, Mei-Sing; Magrabi, Farah; Coiera, Enrico			Automated categorisation of clinical incident reports using statistical text classification	QUALITY & SAFETY IN HEALTH CARE			English	Article							QUALITY	Objectives To explore the feasibility of using statistical text classification techniques to automatically categorise clinical incident reports. Methods Statistical text classifiers based on Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine algorithms were trained and tested on incident reports submitted by public hospitals to identify two classes of clinical incidents: inadequate clinical handover and incorrect patient identification. Each classifier was trained on 600 reports (300 positives, 300 negatives), and tested on 372 reports (248 positives, 124 negatives). The results were evaluated using standard measures of accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure and area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Classifier learning rates were also evaluated, using classifier accuracy against training set size. Results All classifiers performed well in categorising clinical handover and patient identification incidents. Naive Bayes attained the best performance on handover incidents, correctly identifying 86.29% of reporter-classified incidents (precision=0.84, recall=0.90, F-measure=0.87, AUC=0.93) and 91.53% of expert-classified incidents (precision=0.87, recall=0.98, F-measure=0.92, AUC=0.97). For patient identification incidents, the best results were obtained when Support Vector Machine with radial-basis function kernel was used to classify reporter-classified reports (accuracy=97.98%, precision=0.98, recall=0.98, F-measure=0.98, AUC=1.00); and when Naive Bayes was used on expert-classified reports (accuracy=95.97%, precision=0.95, recall=0.98, F-measure=0.96, AUC=0.99). A relatively small training set was found to be adequate, with most classifiers achieving an accuracy above 80% when the training set size was as small as 100 samples. Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility of using text classification techniques to automatically categorise clinical incident reports.

It is not easy to collect data, utilize any type of algorithm and build a permanent model at once. We have conducted a study in a large telecommunications company in Turkey to employ a software measurement program and to predict pre-release defects. Based on our prior publication, we have shared our experience in terms of the project steps (i.e. challenges and opportunities). We have further introduced new techniques that improve our earlier results. Objective: In our previous work, we have built similar predictors using data representative for US software development. Our task here was to check if those predictors were specific solely to US organizations or to a broader class of software. Method: We have presented our approach and results in the form of an experience report. Specifically, we have made use of different techniques for improving the information content of the software data and the performance of a Naive Bayes classifier in the prediction model that is locally tuned for the company. We have increased the information content of the software data by using module dependency data and improved the performance by adjusting the hyper-parameter (decision threshold) of the Naive Bayes classifier. We have reported and discussed our results in terms of defect detection rates and false alarms. We also carried out a cost-benefit analysis to show that our approach can be efficiently put into practice. Results: Our general result is that general defect predictors, which exist across a wide range of software (in both US and Turkish organizations), are present. Our specific results indicate that concerning the organization subject to this study, the use of version history information along with code metrics decreased false alarms by 22%, the use of dependencies between modules further reduced false alarms by 8%, and the decision threshold optimization for the Naive Bayes classifier using code metrics and version history information further improved false alarms by 30% in comparison to a prediction using only code metrics and a default decision threshold. Conclusion: Implementing statistical techniques and machine learning on a real life scenario is a difficult yet possible task. Using simple statistical and algorithmic techniques produces an average detection rate of 88%. Although using dependency data improves our results, it is difficult to collect and analyze such data in general. Therefore, we would recommend optimizing the hyper-parameter of the proposed technique, Naive Bayes, to calibrate the defect prediction model rather than employing more complex classifiers. We also recommend that researchers who explore statistical and algorithmic methods for defect prediction should spend less time on their algorithms and more time on studying the pragmatic considerations of large organizations.

Gene function prediction using semantic similarity clustering and enrichment analysis in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							PROTEIN FUNCTION; PATTERN IDENTIFICATION; TRANSLATION INITIATION; LIFE-CYCLE; DATABASE; ONTOLOGY; ANNOTATION; PROFILES; TAXONOMY; REVEALS	Motivation: Functional genomics data provides a rich source of information that can be used in the annotation of the thousands of genes of unknown function found in most sequenced genomes. However, previous gene function prediction programs are mostly produced for relatively well-annotated organisms that often have a large amount of functional genomics data. Here, we present a novel method for predicting gene function that uses clustering of genes by semantic similarity, a naive Bayes classifier and 'enrichment analysis' to predict gene function for a genome that is less well annotated but does has a severe effect on human health, that of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Results: Predictions for the molecular function, biological process and cellular component of P.falciparum genes were created from eight different datasets with a combined prediction also being produced. The high-confidence predictions produced by the combined prediction were compared to those produced by a simple K-nearest neighbour classifier approach and were shown to improve accuracy and coverage. Finally, two case studies are described, which investigate two biological processes in more detail, that of translation initiation and invasion of the host cell.	[Tedder, Philip M.

Electrodes built with conductive textiles are arranged on both sides of a compressible spacer, forming a variable capacitor. The use of textiles makes unobtrusive, comfortable, lightweight, and washable sensors possible. This simplifies the goal to integrate such sensors into clothing in the future, to be simple, and fast to mount just as getting dressed. Hysteresis induced by the spacer of the sensor has been modeled with the Preisach model to reduce the measurement error from 24% to 5% on average and the maximal error from above 50% to below 10%. Standard textiles that are not specially optimized for low hysteresis can be used for designing the sensor due to the modeling. The model may also be used for other pressure or even strain sensors to reduce their hysteresis. The modeling enhances the accuracy of the textile sensor to those of commercial, nontextile pressure sensing mats. Furthermore, we used the sensor system for the classification of sitting postures in a chair. The data of nine subjects have been classified with Naive Bayes classifier, achieving an average recognition rate of 82%. We show that the textile sensor performs similarly to a commercial, nontextile pressure sensing mat for this application.

Unfortunately, the classification process can be time-consuming and users are still required to spend considerable amount of time scanning through the classified web documents to identify the ones with contents that satisfy their information needs. In solving this problem, we first introduce CorSum, an extractive single-document summarization approach, which is simple and effective in performing the summarization task, since it only relies on word similarity to generate high-quality summaries. We further enhance CorSum by considering the significance factor of sentences in documents, in addition to using word-correlation factors, for document summarization. We denote the enhanced approach CorSum-SF and use the summaries generated by CorSum-SF to train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for categorizing web document summaries into predefined classes. Experimental results on the DUC-2002 and 20 Newsgroups datasets show that CorSum-SF outperforms other extractive summarization methods, and classification time (accuracy, respectively) is significantly reduced (compatible, respectively) using CorSum-SF generated summaries compared with using the entire documents. More importantly, browsing summaries, instead of entire documents, which are assigned to predefined categories, facilitates the information search process on the Web.

Prediction of weekly nitrate-N fluctuations in a small agricultural watershed in Illinois	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS			English	Article						artificial neural networks; drinking water; forecasting; genetic algorithms; naive Bayes model; nitrate-N	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; RESOURCES APPLICATIONS; INPUT DETERMINATION; ALGAL BLOOMS; MODEL; CLASSIFICATION; REGRESSION; NITROGEN; RUNOFF; SYSTEM	Agricultural nonpoint source pollution has been identified as one of the leading causes of surface water quality impairment in the United States. Such an impact is important, particularly in predominantly agricultural areas, where application of agricultural fertilizers often results in excessive nitrate levels in streams and rivers. When nitrate concentration in a public water supply reaches or exceeds drinking water standards, costly measures such as well closure or water treatment have to be considered. Thus, having accurate nitrate-N predictions is critical in making correct and timely management decisions. This study applied a set of data mining tools to predict weekly nitrate-N concentrations at a gauging station on the Sangamon River near Decatur, Illinois. The data mining tools used in this study included artificial neural networks, evolutionary polynomial regression and the naive Bayes model. The results were compared using seven forecast measures. In general, all models performed reasonably well, but not all achieved best scores in each of the measures, suggesting that a multi-tool approach is needed. In addition to improving forecast accuracy compared with previous studies, the tools described in this study demonstrated potential for application in error analysis, input selection and ranking of explanatory variables, thereby designing cost-effective monitoring networks.

Evolutionary Learning of Dynamic Naive Bayesian Classifiers	JOURNAL OF AUTOMATED REASONING			English	Article						Naive Bayes classifier; Dynamic Bayesian networks; Genetic algorithms; Gesture recognition	GENETIC ALGORITHMS; NETWORKS	Many problems such as voice recognition, speech recognition and many other tasks have been tackled with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). These problems can also be dealt with an extension of the Naive Bayesian Classifier (NBC) known as Dynamic NBC (DNBC). From a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) perspective, in a DNBC at each time there is a NBC. NBCs work well in data sets with independent attributes. However, they perform poorly when the attributes are dependent or when there are one or more irrelevant attributes which are dependent of some relevant ones. Therefore, to increase this classifier accuracy, we need a method to design network structures that can capture the dependencies and get rid of irrelevant attributes. Furthermore, when we deal with dynamical processes there are temporal relations that should be considered in the network design. In order to learn automatically these models from data and increase the classifier accuracy we propose an evolutionary optimization algorithm to solve this design problem. We introduce a new encoding scheme and new genetic operators which are natural extensions of previously proposed encoding and operators for grouping problems. The design methodology is applied to solve the recognition problem for nine hand gestures. Experimental results show that the evolved network has higher average classification accuracy than the basic DNBC and a HMM.

Nowadays, numerous attacks made by the malware pose a major security threat to computer users. Unfortunately, along with the development of the malware writing techniques, the number of file samples that need to be analyzed, named "gray list,"on a daily basis is constantly increasing. In order to help our virus analysts, quickly and efficiently pick out the malicious executables from the "gray list," an automatic and robust tool to analyze and classify the file samples is needed. In our previous work, we have developed an intelligent malware detection system (IMDS) by adopting associative classification method based on the analysis of application programming interface (API) execution calls. Despite its good performance in malware detection, IMDS still faces the following two challenges: 1) handling the large set of the generated rules to build the classifier; and 2) finding effective rules for classifying new file samples. In this paper, we first systematically evaluate the effects of the postprocessing techniques (e. g., rule pruning, rule ranking, and rule selection) of associative classification in malware detection, and then, propose an effective way, i.e., CIDCPF, to detect the malware from the "gray list." To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort on using postprocessing techniques of associative classification in malware detection. CIDCPF adapts the postprocessing techniques as follows: first applying Chi-square testing and Insignificant rule pruning followed by using Database coverage based on the Chi-square measure rule ranking mechanism and Pessimistic error estimation, and finally performing prediction by selecting the best First rule. We have incorporated the CIDCPF method into our existing IMDS system, and we call the new system as CIMDS system. Case studies are performed on the large collection of file samples obtained from the Antivirus Laboratory at Kingsoft Corporation and promising experimental results demonstrate that the efficiency and ability of detecting malware from the "gray list" of our CIMDS system outperform popular antivirus software tools, such as McAfee VirusScan and Norton AntiVirus, as well as previous data-mining-based detection systems, which employed Naive Bayes, support vector machine, and decision tree techniques. In particular, our CIMDS system can greatly reduce the number of generated rules, which makes it easy for our virus analysts to identify the useful ones.

A novel time series analysis approach for prediction of dialysis in critically ill patients using echo-state networks	BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article							MORTALITY PREDICTION; DISCOVERY; SCORES	Background: Echo-state networks (ESN) are part of a group of reservoir computing methods and are basically a form of recurrent artificial neural networks (ANN). These methods can perform classification tasks on time series data. The recurrent ANN of an echo-state network has an 'echo-state' characteristic. This 'echo-state' functions as a fading memory: samples that have been introduced into the network in a further past, are faded away. The echostate approach for the training of recurrent neural networks was first described by Jaeger H. et al. In clinical medicine, until this moment, no original research articles have been published to examine the use of echo-state networks. Methods: This study examines the possibility of using an echo-state network for prediction of dialysis in the ICU. Therefore, diuresis values and creatinine levels of the first three days after ICU admission were collected from 830 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between May 31th 2003 and November 17th 2007. The outcome parameter was the performance by the echo-state network in predicting the need for dialysis between day 5 and day 10 of ICU admission. Patients with an ICU length of stay < 10 days or patients that received dialysis in the first five days of ICU admission were excluded. Performance by the echo-state network was then compared by means of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with results obtained by two other time series analysis methods by means of a support vector machine (SVM) and a naive Bayes algorithm (NB). Results: The AUC's in the three developed echo-state networks were 0.822, 0.818, and 0.817. These results were comparable to the results obtained by the SVM and the NB algorithm. Conclusions: This proof of concept study is the first to evaluate the performance of echo-state networks in an ICU environment. This echo-state network predicted the need for dialysis in ICU patients. The AUC's of the echo-state networks were good and comparable to the performance of other classification algorithms. Moreover, the echostate network was more easily configured than other time series modeling technologies.

NCC has been shown to return more robust classification than NBC. However, there are particular situations (which we precisely characterize in the paper) under which the extreme densities included by the IDM force NCC to become very indeterminate, although NBC is able to issue accurately classifications. In this paper, we propose two approaches which overcome this issue, by restricting the set of priors of the IDM. We analyze both approaches theoretically and experimentally.

We propose a novel spam email filtering approach based on network-level attributes (e.g. the IP sender geographic coordinates) that are more persistent in time when compared to message content. This approach was tested using two classifiers, Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM); and compared against bag-of-words models and eight blacklists. Several experiments were held with recent collected legitimate (ham) and non legitimate (spam) messages, in order to simulate distinct user profiles from two countries (USA and Portugal). Overall, the network-level based SVM model achieved the best discriminatory performance. Moreover, preliminary results suggests that such method is more robust to phishing attacks.

Applications of such a system includes quality assurance and estimating surface friction during manipulation tasks. A naive Bayes classifier is used to distinguish textures sensed by a bio-inspired artificial finger. The finger has randomly distributed strain gauges and Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) films embedded in silicone. Different textures induce different intensity of vibrations in the silicone. Textures can be distinguished by the presence of different frequencies in the signal. The data from the finger is pre-processed and the Fourier coefficients of the sensor outputs are used to learn a classifier for different textures. The performance of the classifier is evaluated against a naive time domain based learner. Preliminary results show that our classifier performs better.

For robust skin segmentation and detection, we investigate color classification based on random forest. A random forest is a statistical framework with a very high generalization accuracy and quick training times. The random forest approach is used with the IHLS color space for raw pixel based skin detection. We evaluate random forest based skin detection and compare it to Bayesian network, Multilayer Perceptron, SVM, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes and RBF network. Results on a database of 8991 images with manually annotated pixel-level ground truth show that with the IHLS color space, the random forest approach outperforms other approaches. We also show the effect of increasing the number of trees grown for random forest. With fewer trees we get faster training times and with 10 trees we get the highest F-score.

However, although the beneficial nature of including these relationships seems obvious, in practice finding good representations for feature relationships in video is difficult. We propose a simple and computationally efficient method for expressing pairwise relationships between quantized features that combines the power of discriminative representations with key aspects of Naive Bayes. We demonstrate how our technique can augment both appearance- and motion-based features, and that it significantly improves performance on both types of features.

The visual obstacle avoidance and corridor following behavior rely on the segmentation of the traversable floor region in the omnidirectional robocentric view. The image processing employs a supervised approach in which the segmentation optimal with respect to the appearance of the local environment is determined by cross validation over 3D scans captured by a photonic mixer device (PMD) camera. The range data in the front view provides the seeds and validation data to supervise the appearance based segmentation in the omniview. Segmentation relies on histogram backprojection which maintains separate appearance models for floor, obstacles and background. A naive Bayes classifier predicts the occupancy of the robots local environment by fusing the evidence provided by different segmentations and models. The classification error is analyzed on ground truth data generated by a PMD camera and manually segmented scenes. The scheme is highly robust with respect to ambiguous and misleading visual appearances of obstacles and floor, thus enabling the robot to navigate safely in unstructured environments of diverse appearance, texture and illumination. The proposed vision algorithm and the navigation behavior demonstrate a robust performance in extensive robotic experiments across several hours of autonomous operation.

We have visualized classification for example images by coloring class regions and verified if they overlap with labeled regions.			aswitonski@pjwstk.edu.pl; marcin.michalak@polsl.pl; hjosinski@pjwstk.edu.pl; kwojciechowski@pjwstk.edu.pl; kwojciechowski@pjwstk.edu.pl	Michalak, Marcin/E-9744-2013				Boser B.E., 1992, 5 ANN ACM WORKSH COL, P144; CAMPSVALLS G, 2005, IEEE T GEOSCIENCE RE, V43; COHEN WW, P 12 INT C MACH LEAR, P115; DERRODE S, 2003, P IEEE INT C IM PROC; Drucker H, 1997, ADV NEUR IN, V9, P155; Fan RE, 2008, J MACH LEARN RES, V9, P1871; Frank E., 1998, 15 INT C MACH LEARN, P144; Gat N., 2000, P SPIE INT SOC OPT E; Kohavi R, 1995, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V912, P174; MERCIER G., 2003, IEEE INT GEOSC REM S; Quinlan J.R., 1993, C4 5 PROGRAMS MACHIN; Soille P., 2003, MORPHOLOGICAL IMAGE; WITTEN LH, 2005, PRACTICAL MACHINE LE; Woolfe F., 1999, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V99	14	3	3	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743		978-3-642-15906-0	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2010	6375		II				325	333				9	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BUK23	WOS:000289590500040	
J	Krzysko, M; Wolynski, W				Krzysko, Miroslaw; Wolynski, Waldemar			New variants of pairwise classification	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Classification by pairwise coupling; Multi-class classifiers; Binary classifiers		Pairwise classification is the technique that deals with multi-class problems by converting them into a series of binary problems, one for each pair of classes. Typically, K-class classification rules tend to be easier to learn for K = 2 than for K > 2 - only one decision boundary requires attention. This paper presents new methods for obtaining class membership probability estimates for multi-class classification problems by coupling the probability estimates created by binary classifiers. Classifiers used include linear Bayes normal classifier, Parzen density based classifier, naive Bayes classifier, binary decision tree classifier and random neural net classifier. The accuracy of new pairwise classifiers is examined on some real data sets. The classification errors were estimated by stratified version of 10-fold cross-validation technique, i.e. the training examples were partitioned into 10 equal-sized blocks with similar class distributions as in the original set. The validation technique was repeated 10 times for each data set. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we propose LDACLM or Latent Dirichlet Allocation Category Language Model for text categorization and estimate parameters of models by variational inference. As a variant of Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model, LDACLM regards documents of category as Language Model and uses variational parameters to estimate maximum a posteriori of terms. In general, experiments show LDACLM model is effective and outperform Naive Bayes with Laplace smoothing and Rocchio algorithm but little inferior to SVM for text categorization.

We present an optimization using Supervised Model Construction which improves starter selection. Effectiveness has been evaluated using 12 UCI datasets and a clinical diabetes database. Experiments indicate that compared with ReliefF, the proposed method improved computation efficiency whilst maintaining the classification accuracy. In the clinical dataset (20,000 records with 47 features), feature selection via Supervised Model Construction (FSSMC) reduced the processing time by 80%, compared to ReliefF, and maintained accuracy for Naive Bayes, IB1 and C4.5 classifiers.

J	Langseth, H; Nielsen, TD				Langseth, Helge; Nielsen, Thomas D.			Latent classification models for binary data	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Classification; Binary images; Bayesian networks; Variational inference	NAIVE BAYES; CLASSIFIERS; ALGORITHMS	One of the simplest, and yet most consistently well-performing set of classifiers is the naive Bayes models (a special class of Bayesian network models). However, these models rely on the (naive) assumption that all the attributes used to describe an instance are conditionally independent given the class of that instance. To relax this independence assumption, we have in previous work proposed a family of models, called latent classification models (LCMs). LCMs are defined for continuous domains and generalize the naive Bayes model by using latent variables to model class-conditional dependencies between the attributes. In addition to providing good classification accuracy, the LCM has several appealing properties, including a relatively small parameter space making it less susceptible to over-fitting. In this paper we take a first step towards generalizing LCMs to hybrid domains, by proposing an LCM for domains with binary attributes. We present algorithms for learning the proposed model, and we describe a variational approximation-based inference procedure. Finally, we empirically compare the accuracy of the proposed model to the accuracy of other classifiers for a number of different domains, including the problem of recognizing symbols in black and white images.

Unsupervised training of Bayesian networks for data clustering	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						Bayesian networks; clustering; unsupervised training; classification expectation-maximization algorithm; machine learning	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; EM ALGORITHM; DEFECT CLASSIFICATION; CLASSIFIERS; DISTRIBUTIONS	This paper presents a new approach to the unsupervised training of Bayesian network classifiers. Three models have been analysed: the Chow and Liu (CL) multinets; the tree-augmented naive Bayes; and a new model called the simple Bayesian network classifier, which is more robust in its structure learning. To perform the unsupervised training of these models, the classification maximum likelihood criterion is used. The maximization of this criterion is derived for each model under the classification expectation-maximization ( EM) algorithm framework. To test the proposed unsupervised training approach, 10 well-known benchmark datasets have been used to measure their clustering performance. Also, for comparison, the results for the k-means and the EM algorithm, as well as those obtained when the three Bayesian network classifiers are trained in a supervised way, are analysed. A real-world image processing application is also presented, dealing with clustering of wood board images described by 165 attributes. Results show that the proposed learning method, in general, outperforms traditional clustering algorithms and, in the wood board image application, the CL multinets obtained a 12 per cent increase, on average, in clustering accuracy when compared with the k-means method and a 7 per cent increase, on average, when compared with the EM algorithm.

Nearly 90% of the cost is maintenance due to error correction, adaptation and mainly enhancements. As Lehman and Belady [Lehman, M. M., & Belady, L. A. (1985). Program evolution: Processes of software change. Academic Press Professional.] state that software will become increasingly unstructured as it is changed. One way to overcome this problem is refactoring. Refactoring is an approach which reduces the software complexity by incrementally improving internal software quality. Our motivation in this research is to detect the classes that need to be rafactored by analyzing the code complexity. We propose a machine learning based model to predict classes to be refactored. We use Weighted Naive Bayes with InfoGain heuristic as the learner and we conducted experiments with metric data that we collected from the largest GSM operator in Turkey. Our results showed that we can predict 82% of the classes that need refactoring with 13% of manual inspection effort on the average. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Since existing methods for estimation of class membership probability are designed for binary classification, in which only a single score outputted from a classifier can be used, an approach for multiclass classification requires both a decomposition of a multiclass classifier into binary classifiers and a combination of estimates obtained from each binary classifier to a target estimate. We propose a simple and general method for directly estimating class membership probability for any class in multiclass classification without decomposition and combination, using multiple scores not only for a predicted class but also for other proper classes. To make it possible to use multiple scores, we propose to modify or extend representative existing methods. As a non-parametric method, which refers to the idea of a binning method as proposed by Zadrozny et al., we create an "accuracy table" by a different method. Moreover we smooth accuracies on the table with methods such as the moving average to yield reliable probabilities (accuracies). As a parametric method, we extend Platt's method to apply a multiple logistic regression. On two different datasets (open-ended data from Japanese social surveys and the 20 Newsgroups) both with Support Vector Machines and naive Bayes classifiers, we empirically show that the use of multiple scores is effective in the estimation of class membership probabilities in multiclass classification in terms of cross entropy, the reliability diagram, the ROC curve and AUC (area under the ROC curve), and that the proposed smoothing method for the accuracy table works quite well. Finally, we show empirically that in terms of MSE (mean squared error), our best proposed method is superior to an expansion for multiclass classification of a PAV method proposed by Zadrozny et al., in both the 20 Newsgroups dataset and the Pendigits dataset, but is slightly worse than the state-of-the-art method, which is an expansion for multiclass classification of a combination of boosting and a PAV method, on the Pendigits dataset.

However, the most of these approaches have the same difficulty: the high dimensionality of the feature space. Many term selection methods have been proposed in the literature. Nevertheless, it is still unclear how the performance of naive Bayes anti-spam filters depend on the methods applied for reducing the dimensionality of the feature space. In this paper, we compare the performance of most popular methods used as term selection techniques, such as document frequency, information gain, mutual information, chi(2) statistic, and odds ratio used for reducing the dimensionality of the term space with four well-known different versions of naive Bayes spam filter.

J	Castillo, G; Gama, J				Castillo, Gladys; Gama, Joao			Adaptive Bayesian network classifiers	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article							DRIFT	This paper is concerned with adaptive learning algorithms for Bayesian network classifiers in a prequential (on-line) learning scenario. In this scenario, new data is available over time. An efficient supervised learning algorithm must be able to improve its predictive accuracy by incorporating the incoming data, while optimizing the cost of updating. However, if the process is not strictly stationary, the target concept could change over time. Hence, the predictive model should be adapted quickly to these changes. The main contribution of this work is a proposal of an unified, adaptive prequential framework for supervised learning called AdPreqFr4SL, which attempts to handle the cost-performance trade-off and deal with concept drift. Starting with the simple Naive Bayes, we scale up the complexity by gradually increasing the maximum number of allowable attribute dependencies, and then by searching for new dependences in the extended search space. Since updating the structure is a costly task, we use new data to primarily adapt the parameters. We adapt the structure only when is actually necessary. The method for handling concept drift is based on the Shewhart P-Chart. We experimentally prove the advantages of using the AdPreqFr4SL in comparison with its non-adaptive versions.

However, many of these tools are not equipped for coping with multiple residents in the same environment simultaneously. In this paper we investigate a first step in coping with multiple residents, that of attributing sensor events to individuals in a multi-resident environment. We discuss approaches that can be used to achieve this goal and we evaluate our implementations in the context of two physical smart environment testbeds. We also explore how learning resident identifiers can aid in performing other analyses on smart environment sensor data such as activity recognition.

The protein fold prediction problem can be expressed as a prediction problem that can be solved by machine learning techniques. In this paper, a new method based on ensemble of five classifiers (Naive Bayes, Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), LogitBoost and AdaBoost.M1) is proposed for the protein fold prediction problem. The dataset used in this experiment is from the standard damsel provided by Ding and Dubchak. Experimental results show that the proposed method enhanced the prediction accuracy up to 64% on an independent test damsel, which is the highest prediction accuracy in compare with other methods proposed by the works have done by literature.

Audio-Based Emotion Recognition in Judicial Domain: A Multilayer Support Vector Machines Approach	MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA MINING IN PATTERN RECOGNITION	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern Recognition	JUL 23-25, 2009	Leipzig, GERMANY					Thanks to the recent progresses in judicial proceedings management, especially related to the introduction of audio/video recording systems, semantic retrieval is a key challenge. In this context, emotion recognition engine, through the analysis of vocal signature of actors involved in judicial proceedings, could provide useful annotations for semantic retrieval of multimedia clips. With respect to the generation of semantic emotional tag judicial domain, two main contributions are given: (1) the construction of an Italian emotional database for Italian proceedings annotation; (2) the investigation of a hierarchical classification system, based on risk minimization method, able to recognize emotional states from vocal signatures. In order to estimate the degree of affection we compared the proposed classification method with SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive, Bayes highlighting in terms of classification accuracy, the the improvements given by a hierarchical learning approach.

On the influence of imputation in classification: practical issues	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						missing values; classification; imputation; Bayesian methods	MISSING VALUE ESTIMATION; EM ALGORITHM; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; BAYESIAN NETWORKS	The substitution of missing values, also called imputation, is an important data preparation task for many domains. Ideally, the substitution of missing values should not insert biases into the dataset. This aspect has been usually assessed by some measures of the prediction capability of imputation methods. Such measures assume the simulation of missing entries for some attributes whose values are actually known. These artificially missing values are imputed and then compared with the original values. Although this evaluation is useful, it does not allow the influence of imputed values in the ultimate modelling task (e.g. in classification) to be inferred. We argue that imputation cannot be properly evaluated apart from the modelling task. Thus, alternative approaches are needed. This article elaborates on the influence of imputed values in classification. In particular, a practical procedure for estimating the inserted bias is described. As an additional contribution, we have used such a procedure to empirically illustrate the performance of three imputation methods (majority, naive Bayes and Bayesian networks) in three datasets. Three classifiers (decision tree, naive Bayes and nearest neighbours) have been used as modelling tools in our experiments. The achieved results illustrate a variety of situations that can take place in the data preparation practice.

While KDE has been studied extensively in the context of accuracy of distribution estimation, it has not been studied extensively in the context of classification. This paper studies nine bandwidth selection schemes for kernel density estimation in Naive Bayesian classification context, using 52 machine learning benchmark datasets. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, it shows that, solve commonly used and very sophisticated bandwidth selection schemes do not give good performance in Naive Bayes. Surprisingly, some very simple bandwidth selection schemes give statistically significantly better performance. Second, it shows that kernel density estimation call achieve statistically significantly better classification performance than a, commonly used discretization method in Naive Bayes, but only when appropriate bandwidth selection schemes are applied. Third, this study gives bandwidth distribution patterns for the investigated bandwidth selection schemes.

Initially, content (videos, images and news) are presented in a random manner. Using cameras installed on the signs, the system observes the audience and detects if someone is watching the content (via face detection). The anonymous view time duration is then stored in a central database, together with date, time and sign location. When scheduling content, the signs calculate the expected view time for each content type depending on sign location and time using a Naive Bayes classifier. Content is then selected randomly, with the probability for each content weighted by the expected view time. The system has been deployed for two months on four digital signs in a university setting using semirealistic content & content types. We present a first evaluation of this approach that concentrates on major effects and results from interviews with 15 users.

Data mining techniques are being used to extract valuable information that can help in detecting intrusions. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of rule based classifiers like: JRip, RIDOR, NNge and Decision Table (DT) with Naive Bayes (NB) along with their ensemble approach. We also propose to use the Semi-Naive Bayesian approach (DTNB) that combines Naive Bayes with the induction of Decision Tables in order to enhance the performance of an intrusion detection system. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is faster, reliable, and accurate with low false positive rates, which are the essential features of an efficient network intrusion detection system.

Genre classification using chords and stochastic language models	CONNECTION SCIENCE			English	Article						genre classification; statistical text classification; chord progressions	PROBABILITIES	Music genre meta-data is of paramount importance for the organisation of music repositories. People use genre in a natural way when entering a music store or looking into music collections. Automatic genre classification has become a popular topic in music information retrieval research both, with digital audio and symbolic data. This work focuses on the symbolic approach, bringing to music cognition some technologies, like the stochastic language models, already successfully applied to text categorisation. The representation chosen here is to model chord progressions as n-grams and strings and then apply perplexity and naive Bayes classifiers, respectively, in order to assess how often those structures are found in the target genres. Some genres and sub-genres among popular, jazz, and academic music have been considered, trying to investigate how far can we reach using harmonic information with these models. The results at different levels of the genre hierarchy for the techniques employed are presented and discussed.

A Wrapper Method for Feature Selection in Multiple Classes Datasets	BIO-INSPIRED SYSTEMS: COMPUTATIONAL AND AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE, PT 1	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (IWANN 2009)	JUN 10-12, 2009	Salamanca, SPAIN					Feature selection algorithms should remove irrelevant and redundant features while maintaining or even improving performance, and thus contributing to enhance generalization in learning models. Feature selection methods can be mainly grouped into filters and wrappers. Most of the models built can deal more or less adequately with binary problems, but often under perform on multi-class tasks. In this article, a new wrapper method, called IAFN-FS (Incremental ANOVA and Functional Networks-Feature Selection) is described in its version for dealing with multiclass problems. In order to carry out the multiclass approach, two different alternatives were tried: (a) treating directly the multiclass problem, (b) dividing the original multiclass problem in several binary problems. In order to evaluate the performance of both approaches, a comparative study using several benchmark datasets, our two methods and other wrappers based in classical algorithms, such as C4.5 and Naive-Bayes, was carried out.

This is an extension of naive Bayes to imprecise probabilities that aims at delivering robust classifications also when dealing with small or incomplete data sets. Robustness is achieved by delivering set-valued classifications (that is, returning multiple classes) on the instances for which (i) the learning set is not informative enough to smooth the effect of choice of the prior density or (ii) the uncertainty arising from missing data prevents the reliable indication of a single class.

Most studies use readability formulas, which ignore vocabulary, and conclude that online health information is too difficult. We developed a vocabularly-based, naive Bayes classifier to distinguish between three difficulty levels in text. It proved 98% accurate in a 250-document evaluation. We compared our classifier with readability formulas for 90 new documents with different origins and asked representative human evaluators, an expert and a consumer, to judge each document. Average readability grade levels for educational and commercial pages was 10th grade or higher, too difficult according to current literature. In contrast, the classifier showed that 70-90% of these pages were written at an intermediate, appropriate level indicating that vocabulary usage is frequently appropriate in text considered too difficult by readability formula evaluations. The expert considered the pages more difficult for a consumer than the consumer did.

The descriptors ranged from structural keys to topological to electronic. A variety of classification schemes were examined in terms of their ability to point out which descriptors are important for predicting the cytochrome P450 specificity for a substrate. Results illustrate the relative effectiveness of the various kinds of descriptors and classification methods, as well as the value of using as well-defined data set as possible.

J	Markov, A; Last, M; Kandel, A				Markov, A.; Last, M.; Kandel, A.			The hybrid representation model for web document classification	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							TEXT CATEGORIZATION; ALGORITHM	Most Web content categorization methods are based on the vector space model of information retrieval. One of the most important advantages of this representation model is that it can be used by both instance-based and model-based classifiers. However, this popular method of document representation does not capture important structural information, such as the order and proximity of word occurrence or the location of a word within the document. It also makes no use of the markup information that can easily-be extracted from the Web document HTML tags. A recently developed graph-based Web document representation model can preserve Web document structural information. It was shown to outperform the traditional vector representation using the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classification algorithm. The problem, however, is that the eager (model-based) classifiers cannot work with this representation directly. In this article, three new hybrid approaches to Web document classification are presented, built upon both graph and vector space representations, thus preserving the benefits and overcoming the limitations of each. The hybrid methods presented here are compared to vector-based models using the C4.5 decision tree and the probabilistic Naive Bayes classifiers on several benchmark Web document collections. The results demonstrate that the hybrid methods presented in this article outperform, in most cases, existing approaches in terms of classification accuracy, and in addition, achieve a significant reduction in the classification time.

Modeling intra-tumor protein expression heterogeneity in tissue microarray experiments	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						biomarker; empirical Bayes; joint modeling; mixed effects; tissue microarray; varying replicate number (VRN)	PROSTATE-CANCER RECURRENCE; LONGITUDINAL DATA; SURVIVAL-DATA; ERROR; PATTERNS; ARRAYS	Tissue microarrays (TMAs) measure tumor-specific protein expression via high-density immunohistochemical staining assays. They provide a proteomic platform for validating cancer biomarkers emerging from large-scale DNA microarray studies. Repeated observations within each tumor result in substantial biological and experimental variability. This variability is usually ignored when associating the TMA expression data with patient survival outcome. It generates biased estimates of hazard ratio in proportional hazards models. We propose a Latent Expression Index (LEI) as a surrogate protein expression estimate in a two-stage analysis. Several estimators of LEI are compared: an empirical Bayes, a full Bayes, and a varying replicate number estimator. In addition, we jointly model survival and TMA expression data via a shared random effects model. Bayesian estimation is carried out using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Simulation studies were conducted to compare the two-stage methods and the joint analysis in estimating the Cox regression coefficient. We show that the two-stage methods reduce bias relative to the naive approach, but still lead to under-estimated hazard ratios. The joint model consistently outperforms the two-stage methods in terms of both bias and coverage property in various simulation scenarios. In case studies using prostate cancer TMA data sets, the two-stage methods yield a good approximation in one data set whereas an insufficient one in the other. A general advice is to use the joint model inference whenever results differ between the two-stage methods and the joint analysis. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Martin-Galiano, AJ; Smialowski, P; Frishman, D				Martin-Galiano, Antonio J.; Smialowski, Pawel; Frishman, Dmitrij			Predicting experimental properties of integral membrane proteins by a naive Bayes approach	PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							STRUCTURAL GENOMICS; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; TARGET SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; EXPRESSION; PROTEOMICS; TOPOLOGY; STRATEGY; DATABASE; PROLINE	Integral membrane proteins (iMPs) are challenging targets for structure determination because of the substantial experimental difficulties involved in their sample preparation. Accordingly, success rates of large-scale structural genomics consortia are much lower for this class of molecules compared to globular targets, underscoring the pressing need for predictive strategies to identify iMPs that are more likely to overcome laboratory bottlenecks. On the basis of the target status information available in the TargetDB repository, we describe the first large-scale analysis of experimental behavior of iMPs. Using information on recalcitrant and propagating iMP targets as negative and positive sets, respectively, we present naive Bayes classifiers capable of predicting, from sequence alone, those proteins that are more amenable to cloning, expression, and solubilization studies. Protein sequences are represented in the space of 72 features, including amino acid composition, occurrence of amino acid groups, ratios between residue groups, and hydrophobicity measures. Taking into account unequal representation of main taxonomic groups in the TargetDB, sequence database had a beneficial effect on the prediction results. The classifiers achieve accuracies of 70%, 63-70%, and 61% in predicting the amenability of iMPs for cloning expression, and solubilization, respectively, thus making them useful tools in target selection for structure determination. Our assessment of prediction results clearly demonstrates that classifiers based on single features do not possess acceptable discriminative power and that the experimental behavior of iMPs is imprinted in their primary sequence through relationships between a restricted set of key properties. In most cases, sets of 1020 protein features were found actually relevant, most notably, the content of isoleucine, valine, and positively-charged residues.

A knowledge-based artificial neural network classifier for pulmonary embolism diagnosis	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						KBANN; knowledge-based artificial neural network; PIOPED; pulmonary embolism	VENTILATION-PERFUSION; LUNG SCINTIGRAMS; CRITERIA	. This paper aims to demonstrate that knowledge-based hybrid learning algorithms are positioned to offer better performance in comparison with purely empirical machine learning algorithms for the automatic classification task associated with the diagnosis of a medical condition described as pulmonary embolism (PE). The main premise is that there exists substantial and significant specialized knowledge in the domain of PE, which can readily be leveraged for bootstrapping a knowledge-based hybrid classifier that employs both the explanation-based and the empirical learning. The modified prospective investigation of pulmonary embolism diagnosis (PIOPED) criteria, which represent the preeminent collective experiential knowledge base among nuclear radiologists as a diagnosis procedure for PE, are conveniently defined in terms of a set of if-then rules. As such, it lends itself to being captured into a knowledge base through instantiating a knowledge-based hybrid learning algorithm. This study shows the instantiation of a knowledge-based artificial neural network (KBANN) classifier through the modified PIOPED criteria for the diagnosis of PE. The development effort for the KBANN that captures the rule base associated with the PIOPED criteria as well as further refinement of the same rule base through highly specialized domain expertise is presented. Through a testing dataset generated with the help of nuclear radiologists, performance of the instantiated KBANN is profiled. Performances of a set of empirical machine learning algorithms, which are configured as classifiers and include the naive Bayes, the Bayesian Belief network, the multilayer perceptron neural network, the C4.5 decision tree algorithm, and two meta learners with boosting and bagging, are also profiled on the same dataset for the purpose of comparison with that of the KBANN. Simulation results indicate that the KBANN can effectively model and leverage the PIOPED knowledge base and its further refinements through the domain expertise, and exhibited enhanced performance compared to those of purely empirical learning based classifiers.

We consider Dash and Cooper's BMA applied to naive Bayesian networks, replacing the single prior over the naive models by a credal set; this models a condition close to prior ignorance about the models, which leads to credal model averaging (CMA). CMA returns an indeterminate classification, i.e., multiple classes, on the instances for which the learning set is not informative enough to smooth the effect of the choice of the prior. We give an algorithm to compute exact credal model averaging for naive networks. Extensive experiments show that indeterminate classification preserve the reliability of CMA on the instances which are classified in a prior-dependent way by BMA.

Here, sex identification is taken as a base study in information mining in chat mediums. In order to do this, a simple discrimination function and semantic analysis method are proposed for sex identification in Turkish chat mediums. Then, the proposed sex identification method is compared with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) methods. Finally, results show that the proposed system has achieved accuracy over 90% in sex identification.

J	Miller, DJ; Zhang, YX; Kesidis, G				Miller, David J.; Zhang, Yanxin; Kesidis, George			Decision aggregation in distributed classification by a transductive extension of maximum entropy/improved iterative scaling	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							COMBINING MULTIPLE CLASSIFIERS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; ENSEMBLE CLASSIFICATION; EM ALGORITHM; NETWORKS; EXPERTS	In many ensemble classification paradigms, the function which combines local/base classifier decisions is learned in a supervised fashion. Such methods require common labeled training examples across the classifier ensemble. However, in some scenarios, where an ensemble solution is necessitated, common labeled data may not exist: (i) legacy/proprietary classifiers, and (ii) spatially distributed and/or multiple modality sensors. In such cases, it is standard to apply fixed (untrained) decision aggregation such as voting, averaging, or naive Bayes rules. In recent work, an alternative transductive learning strategy was proposed. There, decisions on test samples were chosen aiming to satisfy constraints measured by each local classifier. This approach was shown to reliably correct for class prior mismatch and to robustly account for classifier dependencies. Significant gains in accuracy over fixed aggregation rules were demonstrated. There are two main limitations of that work. First, feasibility of the constraints was not guaranteed. Second, heuristic learning was applied. Here, we overcome these problems via a transductive extension of maximum entropy/improved iterative scaling for aggregation in distributed classification. This method is shown to achieve improved decision accuracy over the earlier transductive approach and fixed rules on a number of UC Irvine datasets.

Olex-GA relies on an efficient several-rules-per-individual binary representation and uses the F-measure as the fitness function. The proposed approach is tested over the standard test sets REUTERS-21578 and OHSUMED and compared against several classification algorithms (namely, Naive Bayes, Ripper, C4.5, SVM). Experimental results demonstrate that it achieves very good performance on both data collections, showing to be competitive with (and indeed outperforming in some cases) the evaluated classifiers.

Each skin lesion is represented by a histogram of codewords or clusters identified from a training data set. Classification results using Naive Bayes classification and Support Vector Machines are reported. The best performance obtained is 82.21% on a dataset of 100 skin lesion images. Furthermore, since in melanoma screening false negative errors have a much higher impact and associated cost than false positive ones, we use the Neyman-Pearson score in our model selection scheme.

J	Shi, XJ; Manduchi, R				Shi, Xiaojin; Manduchi, Roberto			On the Bayes fusion of visual features	IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING			English	Article						image classification; Bayes fusion; color; texture	VARIANCE; BIAS; CLASSIFIERS; RETRIEVAL	We consider the problem of image classification when more than one visual feature is available. In such cases, Bayes fusion offers an attractive solution by combining the results of different classifiers (one classifier per feature). This is the general form of the so-called "naive Bayes" approach. This paper compares the performance of Bayes fusion with respect to Bayesian classification, which is based the joint feature distribution. It is well-known that the latter has lower bias than the former, unless the features are conditionally independent, in which case the two coincide. However, as originally noted by Friedman, the low variance associated with naive Bayes estimation may mitigate the effect of its inherent bias. Indeed, in the case of small training samples, naive Bayes may outperform Bayes classification in terms of error rate. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we present a detailed analysis of the error rate of Bayes fusion assuming that the statistical description of the data is known. Second, we provide a qualitative justification of the small sample effect on the classifier's performance based on the bias/variance theory. Third, we present experimental results on three image data sets using color and texture features. Our experiments highlight the relationship between the error rate of the Bayes and the Bayes fusion classifiers as a function of the training sample size. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We constructed a database A 248 syndromes, each syndrome having an estimated probability of producing any of 85 symptoms, with some two-way, three-way, and five-way probabilities reflecting correlations among symptoms. Using these multiway probabilities in conjunction with an iterative proportional fitting algorithm allows; estimation of full conditional probabilities. Combining these conditional probabilities with misdiagnosis error rates and incidence rates via Bayes theorem, the probability of each syndrome is estimated. We tested a prototype of computer-aided differential diagnosis (CADDY) on simulated data and on more than 100 real cases, including West Nile Virus, Q fever, SARS, anthrax, plague, tularaemia and toxic shock cases. We conclude that: (1) it is important to determine whether the unrecorded positive status of a symptom means that the status is negative or that the status is unknown; (2) inclusion of misdiagnosis error rates produces more realistic results; (3) the naive Bayes classifier, which assumes all symptoms behave independently, is slightly outperformed by CADDY, which includes available multi-symptom information on correlations; as more information regarding symptom correlations becomes available, the advantage of CADDY over the naive Bayes classifier should increase; (4) overlooking low-probability, high-con sequence events is less likely if the standard output summary is augmented with a list of rare syndromes that are consistent with observed symptoms, and (5) accumulating patient-level probabilities across a larger population can aid in biosurveillance for disease outbreaks.

In this paper, we introduce conditional naive-Bayes (CNB) models, which generalize naive-Bayes mixture models to naturally handle sparsity by conditioning the model on observed features. Further, we present latent Dirichlet conditional naive-Bayes (LD-CNB) models, which constitute a family of powerful hierarchical Bayesian models for latent structure discovery from sparse data. The proposed family of models are quite general and can work with arbitrary regular exponential family conditional distributions. We present a variational inference based EM algorithm for learning along with special case analyses for Gaussian and discrete distributions. The efficacy of the proposed models are demonstrated by extensive experiments on a wide variety of different datasets.

The experiments were carried out using both a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier and a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The considered features range from single words to n-grams and sentence length. The obtained results show that it is possible to identify the funny quotes even with the simplest features (bag of words); the bayesian classifier performed better than the SVM. However, the size of the corpus size is too small to support definitive assertions.

Comparing the effectiveness of different algorithms requires reliable procedures for accurately assessing the performance (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) of the resulting predictive classifiers. The difficulty of this task is compounded by the use of different data selection and evaluation procedures and in some cases, even different definitions for the same performance measures. We explore the problem of assessing the performance of predictive classifiers trained on macromolecular sequence data, with an emphasis on cross-validation and data selection methods. Specifically, we compare sequence-based and window-based cross-validation procedures on three sequence-based prediction tasks: identification of glycosylation sites, RNA-Protein interface residues, and Protein-Protein interface residues from amino acid sequence. Our experiments with two representative classifiers (Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine) show that sequence-based and windows-based cross-validation procedures and data selection methods can yield different estimates of commonly used performance measures such as accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. We argue that the performance estimates obtained using sequence-based cross-validation provide more realistic estimates of performance than those obtained using window-based cross-validation.

ADVANCES IN INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS VII, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis	SEP 06-08, 2007	Ljubljana, SLOVENIA				TEXT CATEGORIZATION; CLASSIFICATION	We are concerned with the problem of learning classification rules in text categorization where many authors presented Support Vector Machines (SVM) as leading classification method. Number of studies, however, repeatedly pointed out that in some situations SVM is outperformed by simpler methods such as naive Bayes or nearest-neighbor rule. In this paper, we aim at developing better understanding of SVM behaviour in typical text categorization problems represented by sparse bag of words feature spaces. We study in details the performance and the number of support vectors when varying the training set size, the number of features and, unlike existing studies, also SVM free parameter C, which is the Lagrange multipliers upper bound in SVM dual. We show that SVM solutions with small C are high performers. However, most training documents are then bounded support vectors sharing a same weight C. Thus, SVM reduce to a nearest mean classifier-, this raises an interesting question on SVM merits in sparse bag of words feature spaces. Additionally, SVM suffer from performance deterioration for particular training set size/number of features combinations.

Our proposed rule allows a "No Prediction" when the observation is too ambiguous to have confidence in a definite prediction. The motivation for making "No Prediction" is that in our microbial community profiling application, a wrong prediction can be worse than making no prediction at all. On the other hand, too many "No Predictions" have adverse implications as well. Consequently, our proposed rule incorporates this trade-off using a cost structure that weighs the penalty for not making a definite prediction against the penalty for making an incorrect definite prediction. We demonstrate that our proposed rule outperforms a naive neutral-zone rule that has been routinely used in biological applications similar to ours.

While computational analysis for the microarrays show good performance, it is still difficult to infer modules of multiple co-regulated genes. Here, we present a novel classification method to identify the gene modules associated with cancers from microarray data. The proposed approach is based on 'hypernetworks', a hypergraph model consisting of vertices and weighted hyperedges. The hypernetwork model is inspired by biological networks and its learning process is suitable for identifying interacting gene modules. Applied to the analysis of microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles on multiple human cancers, the hypernetwork classifiers identified cancer-related miRNA modules. The results show that our method performs better than decision trees and naive Bayes. The biological meaning of the discovered miRNA modules has been examined by literature search.

Fast categorization of web documents represented by graphs	ADVANCES IN WEB MINING AND WEB USAGE ANALYSIS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery on the Web	AUG 20, 2006	Philadelphia, PA				ALGORITHM	Most text categorization methods are based on the vector-space model of information retrieval. One of the important advantages of this representation model is that it can be used by both instance-based and model-based classifiers for categorization. However, this popular method of document representation does not capture important structural information, such as the order and proximity of word occurrence or the location of a word within the document. It also makes no use of the mark-up information that is available from web document HTML tags. A recently developed graph-based representation of web documents can preserve the structural information. The new document model was shown to outperform the traditional vector representation, using the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classification algorithm. The problem, however, is that the eager (model-based) classifiers cannot work with this representation directly. In this chapter, three new, hybrid approaches to web document categorization are presented, built upon both graph and vector space representations, thus preserving the benefits and overcoming the limitations of each. The hybrid methods presented here are compared to vector-based models using two model-based classifiers (C4.5 decision-tree algorithm and probabilistic Naive Bayes) and several benchmark web document collections. The results demonstrate that the hybrid methods outperform, in most cases, existing approaches in terms of classification accuracy, and in addition, achieve a significant increase in the categorization speed.

The exploitation of two sources of randomness, random inputs (bagging) and random features, make RF accurate classifiers in several domains. We hypothesize that methods other than classification or regression trees could also benefit from injecting randomness. This paper generalizes the RF framework to other multiclass classification algorithms like the well-established MultiNomial Logit (MNL) and Naive Bayes (NB). We propose Random MNL (RMNL) as a new bagged classifier combining a forest of MNLs estimated with randomly selected features. Analogously, we introduce Random Naive Bayes (RNB). We benchmark the predictive performance of RF, RMNL and RNB against state-of-the-art SVM classifiers. RF, RMNL and RNB outperform SVM. Moreover, generalizing RF seems promising as reflected by the improved predictive performance of RMNL.

In addition, several Bayesian multi-net models: TAN multi-net, GBN multi-net and the model developed by Gurwicz and Lerner, TAN-Based Bayesian Class-Matched multi-net (tBCM(2)) (see [1]) are applied to the classification of multispectral data. A comparison of the results obtained with the different classifiers is done.

The growing amount of stored documents increases the need for effective and timely retrieval of information. We developed a multi-label text classification system to categorize free text medical documents (e.g. discharge letters, clinical findings, reports) written in German into predefined classes. A random sample of 1,500 free text medical documents Was retrieved from a general hospital information system and was manually assigned to I to 8 categories by a domain expert. This sample was used to train and evaluate the performance of 4 classification schemes: Naive Bayes, k-NN, SVM, and J48. Additional tests of the effect of text preprocessing were done. In our study, preprocessing improved the performance, and best results were obtained by J48 classification.

The approximated classifier is expected to have worse performance, here measured by the probability of correct classification. We present an analysis valid in general, and easily computable formulas for estimating the degradation in probability of correct classification when compared to the optimal classifier. An example of an approximation is the Naive Bayes classifier. We show that the performance of the Naive Bayes depends on the degree of functional dependence between the features and labels. We provide a sufficient condition for zero loss of performance, too.

Horizon detection using machine learning techniques	ICMLA 2006: 5th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications, Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications	DEC 14-16, 2006	Orlando, FL	Assoc Machine Learning & Applicat, Calif State Univ Bakersfield, Armstrong Atlantic State Univ, Florida Int Univ, IEEE, Univ Louisville				Detecting a horizon in an image is an important part of many image related applications such as detecting ships on the horizon, flight control, and port security. Most of the existing solutions for the problem only use image processing methods to identify a horizon line in an image. This results in good accuracy for many cases and is fast in computation. However, for some images with difficult environmental conditions like a foggy or cloudy sky these image processing methods are inherently inaccurate in identifidng the correct horizon. This paper investigates how to detect the horizon line in a set of images using a machine learning approach. The performance of the SVM, J48, and Naive Bayes classifiers, used for the problem, has been compared Accuracy of 90-99% in identifying horizon was achieved on image data set of 20 images.

The task of searching for a specific identity is difficult because multiple identity representations may exist due to issues related to unintentional errors and intentional deception. We propose a Naive Bayes identity matching model that improves existing techniques in terms of effectiveness. Experiments show that our proposed model performs significantly better than the exact-match based technique and achieves higher precision than the record comparison technique. In addition. Our model greatly reduces the efforts of manually labeling training instances by employing a semi-supervised learning approach. This training method outperforms both fully Supervised and unsupervised learning. With a training dataset that only contains 30% labeled instances. Our model achieves a performance comparable to that of a fully supervised learning.

The aim is to model surface errors, which are stretched across one or more surface segments because of their strongly varying size. Due to scale on the surface, the reflection property across the intact surface changes and intensity imaging fails. Light sectioning is used to acquire the surface range data. The steel block is vibrating on the conveyor during data acquisition, which complicates robust feature extraction. After depth map recovery and feature extraction, segments of the surface are classified using CHMMs. The CHMM achieves a recognition rate of 98.57%. We compare the CHMM approach to the naive Bayes classifier, the Hidden Markov Model, the k-nearest neighbor classifier, and to the Support Vector Machine.

J	Egmont-Petersen, M; Feelders, A; Baesens, B				Egmont-Petersen, M; Feelders, A; Baesens, B			Confidence intervals for probabilistic network classifiers	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Workshop on Computational Management Science Economics, Finance and Engineering	2003	Cyprus, TURKEY				NEURAL-NETWORK; IMAGES	Probabilistic networks (Bayesian networks) are suited as statistical pattern classifiers when the feature variables are discrete. It is argued that their white-box character makes them transparent, a requirement in various applications such as, e.g., credit scoring. In addition, the exact error rate of a probabilistic network classifier can be computed without a dataset. First, the exact error rate for probabilistic network classifiers is specified. Secondly, the exact sampling distribution for the conditional probability estimates in a probabilistic network classifier is derived. Each conditional probability is distributed according to the bivariate binomial distribution. Subsequently, an approach for computing the sampling distribution and hence confidence intervals for the posterior probability in a probabilistic network classifier is derived. Our approach results in parametric bootstrap confidence intervals. Experiments with general probabilistic network classifiers, the Naive Bayes classifier and tree augmented Naive Bayes classifiers (TANs) show that our approximation performs well. Also simulations performed with the Alarm network show good results for large training sets. The amount of computation required is exponential in the number of feature variables. For medium and large-scale classification problems, our approach is well suited for quick simulations. A running example from the domain of credit scoring illustrates how to actually compute the sampling distribution of the posterior probability. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mitra, SK; Lee, TW; Goldbaum, M				Mitra, SK; Lee, TW; Goldbaum, M			A Bayesian network based sequential inference for diagnosis of diseases from retinal images	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Bayesian network; naive Bayes classifier	GRAPHICAL ASSOCIATION MODELS; HIDDEN-VARIABLES; CLASSIFIERS	We propose a system that learns from the STARE (STructured Analysis of REtina) database and exploits the experience of ophthalmologists to assist in decision-making regarding the presence or absence of retinal diseases. The developed system automatically detects diseases given a description (a set of manifestations) of a retinal image. The manifestations in the retinal image are usually fed sequentially into the system where the manifestation dependences and order must be learned by the system. We apply naive Bayes classifier which is a simple case of Bayesian network to learn the conditional probabilities and to establish an approximate lookup table for sequential manifestation input. The system interacts with the ophthalmologist in determining the sequence of manifestations for inferring the correct disease. The overall performance of the system is found to be satisfactory and useful by ophthalmologists. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this context, computer-based tools, mainly the techniques from Machine Learning (NIL), have became essential considering the large volume of data. We present an empirical comparison of individual machine learning techniques (k-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks) and ensemble approaches (Bagging and Boosting) to the task of protein structural class prediction.

INDUS employs ontologies and inter-ontology mappings, to enable a user or an application to view a collection of such data sources (regardless of location, internal structure and query interfaces) as though they were a collection of tables structured according to an ontology supplied by the user. This allows INDUS to answer user queries against distributed, semantically heterogeneous data sources without the need for a centralized data warehouse or a common global ontology. We used INDUS framework to design algorithms for learning probabilistic models (e.g., Naive Bayes models) for predicting GO functional classification of a protein based on training sequences that are distributed among SWISSPROT and MIPS data sources. Mappings such as EC2GO and MIPS2GO were used to resolve the semantic differences between these data sources when answering queries posed by the learning algorithms. Our results show that INDUS can be successfully used for integrative analysis of data from multiple sources needed for collaborative discovery in computational biology.

Many discretization methods have been developped, leading to precise and comprehensible evaluations of the amount of information contained in one single attribute with respect to the target one. In this paper, we discuss the multivariate notion of neighborhood, extending the univariate notion of interval. We propose an evaluation criterion of bipartitions, which is based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle [1], and apply it recursively. The resulting discretization method is thus able to exploit correlations between continuous attributes. Its accuracy and robustness are evaluated on real and synthetic data sets.

The method employs pairs of support vectors of a linear SVM-RFE classifier for generating a sequence of new SVM classifiers, called local support classifiers. This sequence is used in two Bayesian learning techniques: as ensemble of classifiers in Optimal Bayes, and as attributes in Naive Bayes. The resulting classifiers are applied to four publically available gene expression datasets from leukemia, ovarian, lymphoma, and colon cancer data, respectively. The results indicate that the proposed approach improves significantly the predictive performance of the baseline SVM classifier, its stability and robustness, with satisfactory results on all datasets. In particular, perfect classification is achieved on the leukemia and ovarian cancer datasets.

This is an important problem in developing generally applicable methods in machine learning and data mining for classification and prediction. This paper intorduces a new technique for discretization based on successive pseudo deletion of instances to reduce the conflicting instances, i.e., by reduction of noise in the database. Such successive pseudo deletions in the database are performed by introducing threshold points on maximum information gain boundary points of the continuous attributes.

In this paper, different feature extraction techniques as means of (1) dimensionality reduction, and (2) constructive induction are analyzed with respect to the performance of a classifier. Three commonly used classifiers are taken for the analysis: kNN, Naive Bayes and C4.5 decision tree. One of the main goals of this paper is to show the importance of the use of class information in feature extraction for classification and (in)appropriateness of random projection or conventional PCA to feature extraction for classification for some data. sets. Two eigenvector-based approaches that take into account the class information are analyzed. The first approach is parametric and optimizes the ratio of between-class variance to the within-class variance of the transformed data. The second approach is a nonparametric modification of the first one based on the local calculation of the between-class covariance matrix. In experiments on benchmark data sets these two approaches are compared with each other, with conventional PCA, with random projection and with plain classification without feature extraction for each classifier.

Each of them has its advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we propose a novel cost-sensitive learning model, a hybrid cost-sensitive decision tree, called DTNB, to reduce the minimum total cost, which integrates the advantages of cost-sensitive decision tree and of the cost-sensitive naive Bayes together. We empirically evaluate it over various test strategies, and our experiments show that our DTNB outperforms cost-sensitive decision and the cost-sensitive naive Bayes significantly in minimizing the total cost of tests and misclassification based on the same sequential test strategies, and single batch strategies.

An extensive experimental study is organized, the most extensive so far in the literature, based on widely accepted benchmarking e-mail data sets, comparing the proposed methodology with the Naive Bayes spam filter as well as with the Boosting tree methodology, the linear models based classification (classification via regression) and the nonlinear models based classification using simple neural network models, including Multilayer Perceptrons. Moreover, several feature extraction approaches based on information theory are evaluated. It is shown that the Committee Machines mail categorization performance is compared very favorably to the other rival methods performance, including the Bayes spam filter which is the most widely used approach in the e-mail services market. It is, also, found that the proposed information theoretic Boolean features present a remarkably high spam categorization performance compared to their analog counterparts performance.

J	Pernkopf, F				Pernkopf, F			Detection of surface defects on raw steel blocks using Bayesian network classifiers	PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						surface inspection; range imaging; Bayesian network classifier; feature selection; light sectioning	VISUAL INSPECTION; FEATURE-SELECTION	This paper proposes an approach that detects surface defects with three-dimensional characteristics on scale-covered steel blocks. The surface reflection properties of the flawless surface changes strongly. Light sectioning is used to acquire the surface range data of the steel block. These sections are arbitrarily located within a range of a few millimeters due to vibrations of the steel block on the conveyor. After the recovery of the depth map, segments of the surface are classified according to a set of extracted features by means of Bayesian network classifiers. For establishing the structure of the Bayesian network, a floating search algorithm is applied, which achieves a good tradeoff between classification performance and computational efficiency for structure learning. This search algorithm enables conditional exclusions of previously added attributes and/or arcs from the network. The experiments show that the selective unrestricted Bayesian network classifier outperforms the naive Bayes and the tree-augmented naive Bayes decision rules concerning the classification rate. More than 98% of the surface segments have been classified correctly.

B	Davidson, I			AAAI	Davidson, I			An ensemble technique for stable learners with performance bounds	PROCEEDING OF THE NINETEENTH NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND THE SIXTEENTH CONFERENCE ON INNOVATIVE APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	19th National Conference on Artificial Intelligence/16th Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence	JUL 25-29, 2004	San Jose, CA	Amer Assoc Artificial Intelligence				Ensemble techniques such as bagging and DECORATE exploit the "instability" of learners, such as decision trees, to create a diverse set of models. However, creating a diverse set of models for stable learners such as naive Bayes is difficult as they are relatively insensitive to training data changes. Furthermore, many popular ensemble techniques do not have a rigorous underlying theory and often provide no insight into how many models to build. We formally define stable learner as having a second order derivative of the posterior density function and propose an ensemble technique specifically for stable learners. Our ensemble technique, bootstrap model averaging, creates a number of bootstrap samples from the training data, builds a model from each and then sums the joint instance and class probability over all models built, We show that for stable learners our ensemble technique for infinite bootstrap samples approximates posterior model averaging (aka the optimal Bayes classifier (OBC)). For finite bootstrap samples we estimate the increase over the OBC error using Chebychev bounds. We empirically illustrate our approach's usefulness for several stable learners and verify our bound's correctness.

The naive Bayesian classifier is taken as a starting point and correlations are reduced through joining of highly correlated attributes. Our technique differs from related work in its use of kernel-functions that systematically include continuous attributes rather than relying on discretization as a preprocessing step. This retains distance information within the attribute domains and ensures that attributes are joined based on their correlation for the particular values of the test sample. We implement a kernel-based semi-naive Bayesian classifier using P-Trees and demonstrate that it generally outperforms the naive Bayesian classifier as well as a discrete semi-naive Bayesian classifier.

In recent years, data in some applications has increased in both the number of instances and features. It is in this context that we introduce a novel approach to reduce both instance and feature space through Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for the classification of Emphysema in High Resolution Computer Tomography (HRCT) images. The technique was tested successfully on 60 HRCT scans having, Emphysema using three different classifiers (Naive Bayes, C4.5 and Seeded K Means). The results were also compared against "density mask", a standard approach used for Emphysema detection in medical image analysis. In addition, the results were visually validated by radiologists.

In our approach, applicable to the two-class problems, the feature strength is inversely proportional to the p-value of the null hypothesis that its class-conditional densities, p(X\Y = 0) and p(X\Y = 1), are identical. To estimate the p-values, we use Fisher's permutation test combined with the four simple filtering criteria in the roles of test statistics: sample mean difference, symmetric Kullback-Leibler distance, information gain, and chi-square statistic. The experimental results of our study, performed using naive Bayes classifier and support vector machines, strongly indicate that the permutation test improves the above-mentioned filters and can be used effectively when sample size is relatively small and number of features relatively large.

It works as a pre-processing step in which the numeric target value is discretized into a set of intervals. We had applied this approach to the Hidden Markov Model for Regression (HMMR) which was successfully compared to the Naive Bayes for Regression and two traditional forecasting methods, Box-Jenkins and Winters. In this work, to further improve these results, we apply three discretization methods to HMMR using ten time series data sets. The experimental results showed that one of the discretization methods improved the results in most of the data sets, although each method improved the results in at least one data set. Therefore, it would be better to have a search algorithm to automatically find the optimal number and width of the intervals.

J	Soonthornphisaj, N; Kijsirikul, B				Soonthornphisaj, N; Kijsirikul, B			Iterative cross-training: An algorithm for learning from unlabeled Web pages	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							TEXT CATEGORIZATION; EM	The article presents a new learning method, called iterative cross-training (ICT), for classifying Web pages in three classification problems, i.e., (1) classification of Thai/non-Thai Web pages, (2) classification of course/non-course home pages, and (3) classification of university-related Web pages. Given domain knowledge or a small set of labeled data, our method combines two classifiers that are able to use effectively unlabeled examples to iteratively train each other. We compare ICT against the other learning methods: a supervised word segmentation classifier, a supervised naive Bayes classifier, and a co-training-style classifier. The experimental results on three classification problems show that ICT gives better performance than those of the other classifiers. One of the advantages of ICT is that it needs only a small set of prelabeled data or no prelabeled data in the case that domain knowledge is available. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this work we report on several advances we have made in building a system for classification of facial expressions from continuous video input. We introduce and test different Bayesian network classifiers for classifying expressions from video. In particular we use Naive-Bayes classifiers and to learn the dependencies among different facial motion features we use Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN) classifiers. We also investigate a neural network approach. Further, we propose an architecture of hidden Markov models (HMMs) for automatically segmenting and recognizing human facial expression from video sequences. We explore both person-dependent and person-independent recognition of expressions and compare the different methods.

Despite this in practice often violated assumption, these simple classifiers have been found efficient, effective, and robust to noise. Discretization of continuous attributes in naive Bayesian classifiers has achieved a lot of attention recently. Continuous attributes need not necessarily be discretized, but it unifies their handling with nominal attributes and can lead to improved classifier performance. We show that optimal partitioning results from decision tree learning carry over to Naive Bayes as well. In particular, it sets decision boundaries on borders of segments with equal class frequency distribution. An optimal univariate discretization with respect to the Naive Bayes rule can be found in linear time but, unfortunately, optimal multivariate optimization is intractable.

A recent study of human gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) with mutations in the KIT gene, Cancer Res. 61 (2001) 8624 exemplifies a common type of investigation. cDNA microarrays were used to generate measurements for 1987 clones in two types of tissues: 13 KIT mutation-positive GISTs and 6 spindle cell tumours from locations outside the gastrointestinal tract. Statistical problems associated with such two-class, high-dimensional profiling data include simultaneous classification and relevant feature identification, probabilistic clustering and protein sequence family modelling. Here, the GIST data were reexamined using specific solutions to these problems, namely sparse hyperplanes, naive Bayes models and profile hidden Markov models respectively. The integrated analysis of molecular profiling and sequence data highlighted 6 clones that may be of clinical and experimental interest. The protein encoded by one of these putative biomarkers defined a novel protein family present in diverse eucarya. The family may be involved in chromosome segregation and/or stability. One family member is a potential biomarker identified recently from a retrospective analysis of transcript profiles for sporadic breast cancer samples from patients with poor and good prognosis, Signal Process.

The Bayesian treatment of unknown chances involves computing, from a second order prior distribution and the data likelihood, a posterior distribution of the chances. A common treatment of incomplete data is to assume ignorability and determine the chances by the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The two different methods above are well established but typically separated. This paper joins the two approaches in the case of Dirichlet priors, and derives efficient approximations for the mean, mode and the (co)variance of the chances and the mutual information. Furthermore, we prove the unimodality of the posterior distribution, whence the important property of convergence of EM to the global maximum in the chosen framework. These results are applied to the problem of selecting features for incremental learning and naive Bayes classification. A fast filter based on the distribution of mutual information is shown to outperform the traditional filter based on empirical mutual information on a number of incomplete real data sets.

In order to resolve this problem, this paper suggests Bayesian document classification method through mining and refining of association word. Apriori algorithm extracts characteristic of test document in form of association words that reflects semantic relation and it mines association words from learning documents. If association word from learning documents is mined only with Apriori algorithm, inappropriate association word is included within them. Accordingly it has disadvantage of lack of accuracy in document classification. In order to complement the disadvantage, we adopt method to refine association words through use of genetic algorithm. Naive Bayes classifier classifies test documents based on refined association words.

Our approach combines a color-based skin detection technique, a face candidate selection scheme using a geometric face model and color-based eye detection, and a face/nonface classification method based on the naive Bayes model. The proposed approach eliminates the computation-intensive step of window-scanning commonly adopted in holistic face detection approaches. With the proposed approach, we also address two important problems in face detection, namely coping with in-plane rotation and detecting faces of different sizes.

In the collaborative filtering task we can find algorithms such as the naive Bayes classifier or some of its variants. However, the results of these classifiers can be improved, as we demonstrate through experimental results, with our new semi naive Bayes approach based on intervals.

Our approach is based on applying a clustering algorithm to each subset of examples that belong to the same class, and to consider each cluster as a class of its own. Experiments on 26 real-world datasets show a significant improvement in performance when the class decomposition process is applied, particularly when the mean number of clusters per class is large.

In this paper, we explore novel techniques for optimizing queries that apply mining models to relational data. For such queries, we use the internal structure of the mining model to automatically derive traditional database predicates. We present algorithms for deriving such predicates for some popular discrete mining models: derision trees, naive Bayes, and clustering. Our experiments on Microsoft SQL Server 2000 demonstrate that these derived predicates can significantly reduce the cost of evaluating such queries.

For example, one may want to classify an image of a certain office as man-made - as opposed to outdoor - scene, even if no image of a similar office exists in the training set. This is accomplished by using local features, and using the naive Bayes classifier The application presented here is classification of paintings; after the system is presented with a sample of paintings of various artists, it tries to determine who was the painter who painted it. The result is local - each small image block is assigned a painter, and a majority vote determines the painter. The results tire roughly visually consistent with human perception of various artists' style.

The PBN is designed to be used for classification tasks, and accordingly the algorithm constructs an approximate Markov blanket around a classification node. Initial experiments have compared the performance of the PBN algorithm with Naive Bayes, Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes and a general Bayesian network algorithm (K2). The results indicate that PBN performs better than other Bayesian network classification structures on some problem domains.

The approach is based on terms and one of the difficulties is extracting a feature set appropriate for the domain. This paper addresses the medical news-filtering problem using a machine learning approach. We describe the application of two supervised machine learning techniques, Decision Trees and Naive Bayes, to automatically construct classifiers on the basis of a training set, in which news articles have been pre-classified by a medical expert and four other human readers. The goal is to classify the news articles into three groups: non-medical, medical intended for experts, and medical intended for other readers. While the general accuracy of the machine learning approach is around 78%, the accuracy of distinguishing non-medical articles from medical ones is shown to be 92%.

In this paper, we put forward a genetic algorithm approach for classification problems. Binary coding is adopted in which an individual in a population consists of a fixed number of rules that stand for a solution candidate. The evaluation function considers four important factors which are error rate, entropy measure, rule consistency and hole ratio, respectively. Adaptive asymmetric mutation is applied by the self-adaptation of mutation inversion probability from 1-0 (0-1). The generated rules are not disjoint but can overlap. The final conclusion for prediction is based on the voting of rules and the classifier gives all rules equal weight for their votes. Based on three databases, we compared our approach with several other traditional data mining techniques including decision trees, neural networks and naive bayes learning. The results show that our approach outperformed others on both the prediction accuracy and the standard deviation.

Recent research reduces this complexity by modeling local structure in the probability tables. We examine the use of log-linear local models. While log-linear models in this context are not new (Whittaker, 1990; Buntine, 1991; Neal, 1992; Heckerman and Meek, 1997), it is generally subsumed under a naive Bayes model. We describe an alternative using a Minimum Message Length (MML) (Wallace and Freeman, 1987) metric for the selection of local models with causal independence, which we term a first-order model (FOM). We also combine FOMs and full conditional models on a node-by-node basis.

We present in this paper a new method that outperforms the prediction accuracy of each medical standard method by combining them using Machine Learning (ML) inspired classification approaches. We have used different Machine Learning algorithms to compare the accuracy of our new method with other existing approaches used by ML community. The new method is an hybrid made between the Nearest Neighbour and the Naive Bayes classification methods. Experimental results show that this new approach is better than any standard method used in the prediction of survival of ICU patients, and better than the combination of these medical approaches done by using standard ML algorithms.

In this study we adopt the powerful probabilistic framework of Bayesian Networks (BN) for the induction of decision tables. We discuss the simplest BN model, the Naive Bayes and extend it to the Two-Stage Naive Bayes, We show that reversal of edges in Naive Bayes and Two-stage Naive Bayes results in simple decision table and hierarchical decision table respectively, We induce these graphical models for dementia severity staging using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDRS) database from the University of California, Irvine, Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. These induced models capture the two-stage methodology clinicians use in computing the global CDR score by first computing the six category scores of memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care, and then the global CDRS. The induced Two-Stage models also attain a clinically acceptable performance when compared to domain experts and could serve as useful guidelines for dementia severity staging.

Design To detect clinical events, we used rules and Conditional Random Fields. We built Random Forest models to identify event modality and polarity. To identify temporal expressions we built on the HeidelTime system. To detect temporal relations, we systematically studied their breakdown into distinct situations; we designed an oracle method to determine the most prominent situations and the most suitable associated classifiers, and combined their results. Results We achieved F-measures of 0.8307 for event identification, based on rules, and 0.8385 for temporal expression identification. In the temporal relation task, we identified nine main situations in three groups, experimentally confirming shared intuitions: within-sentence relations, section-related time, and across-sentence relations. Logistic regression and Naive Bayes performed best on the first and third groups, and decision trees on the second. We reached a 0.6231 global F-measure, improving by 7.5 points our official submission. Conclusions Carefully hand-crafted rules obtained good results for the detection of events and temporal expressions, while a combination of classifiers improved temporal link prediction. The characterization of the oracle recall of situations allowed us to point at directions where further work would be most useful for temporal relation detection: within-sentence relations and linking History of Present Illness events to the admission date. We suggest that the systematic situation breakdown proposed in this paper could also help improve other systems addressing this task.

Highly parallel assays of tissue-specific enhancers in whole Drosophila embryos	NATURE METHODS			English	Article							CIS-REGULATORY MODULES; GENE-EXPRESSION; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; MESODERM DEVELOPMENT; PHAGE PHI-C31; LAME DUCK; PROMOTERS; INTEGRASE; IDENTIFICATION; DISSECTION	Transcriptional enhancers are a primary mechanism by which tissue-specific gene expression is achieved. Despite the importance of these regulatory elements in development, responses to environmental stresses and disease, testing enhancer activity in animals remains tedious, with a minority of enhancers having been characterized. Here we describe 'enhancer-FACS-seq' (eFS) for highly parallel identification of active, tissue-specific enhancers in Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Analysis of enhancers identified by eFS as being active in mesodermal tissues revealed enriched DNA binding site motifs of known and putative, previously uncharacterized mesodermal transcription factors. Naive Bayes classifiers using transcription factor binding site motifs accurately predicted mesodermal enhancer activity. Application of eFS to other cell types and organisms should accelerate the cataloging of enhancers and understanding how transcriptional regulation is encoded in them.

For that purpose, many prediction methods for protein complexes from protein-protein interactions have been developed such as MCL, MCODE, RNSC, PCP, RRW, and NWE. These methods have dealt with only complexes with size of more than three because the methods often are based on some density of subgraphs. However, heterodimeric protein complexes that consist of two distinct proteins occupy a large part according to several comprehensive databases of known complexes. In this paper, we propose several feature space mappings from protein-protein interaction data, in which each interaction is weighted based on reliability. Furthermore, we make use of prior knowledge on protein domains to develop feature space mappings, domain composition kernel and its combination kernel with our proposed features. We perform ten-fold cross-validation computational experiments. These results suggest that our proposed kernel considerably outperforms the naive Bayes-based method, which is the best existing method for predicting heterodimeric protein complexes.

Allergens are small antigens that commonly provoke an IgE antibody response. There are two types of bioinformatics-based allergen prediction. The first approach follows FAO/WHO Codex alimentarius guidelines and searches for sequence similarity. The second approach is based on identifying conserved allergenicity-related linear motifs. Both approaches assume that allergenicity is a linearly coded property. In the present study, we applied ACC pre-processing to sets of known allergens, developing alignment-independent models for allergen recognition based on the main chemical properties of amino acid sequences. Results: A set of 684 food, 1,156 inhalant and 555 toxin allergens was collected from several databases. A set of non-allergens from the same species were selected to mirror the allergen set. The amino acids in the protein sequences were described by three z-descriptors (z(1), z(2) and z(3)) and by auto-and cross-covariance (ACC) transformation were converted into uniform vectors. Each protein was presented as a vector of 45 variables. Five machine learning methods for classification were applied in the study to derive models for allergen prediction. The methods were: discriminant analysis by partial least squares (DA-PLS), logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB) and k nearest neighbours (kNN). The best performing model was derived by kNN at k = 3. It was optimized, cross-validated and implemented in a server named AllerTOP, freely accessible at http://www.pharmfac.net/allertop. AllerTOP also predicts the most probable route of exposure. In comparison to other servers for allergen prediction, AllerTOP outperforms them with 94% sensitivity. Conclusions: AllerTOP is the first alignment-free server for in silico prediction of allergens based on the main physicochemical properties of proteins. Significantly, as well allergenicity AllerTOP is able to predict the route of allergen exposure: food, inhalant or toxin.

J	Dejaeger, K; Verbraken, T; Baesens, B				Dejaeger, Karel; Verbraken, Thomas; Baesens, Bart			Toward Comprehensible Software Fault Prediction Models Using Bayesian Network Classifiers	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Software fault prediction; Bayesian networks; classification; comprehensibility	KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; LEARNING ALGORITHM; DEFECT PREDICTION; METRICS; CLASSIFICATION; CRITIQUE; INDUCTION; SELECTION; MODULES; SYSTEMS	Software testing is a crucial activity during software development and fault prediction models assist practitioners herein by providing an upfront identification of faulty software code by drawing upon the machine learning literature. While especially the Naive Bayes classifier is often applied in this regard, citing predictive performance and comprehensibility as its major strengths, a number of alternative Bayesian algorithms that boost the possibility of constructing simpler networks with fewer nodes and arcs remain unexplored. This study contributes to the literature by considering 15 different Bayesian Network (BN) classifiers and comparing them to other popular machine learning techniques. Furthermore, the applicability of the Markov blanket principle for feature selection, which is a natural extension to BN theory, is investigated. The results, both in terms of the AUC and the recently introduced H-measure, are rigorously tested using the statistical framework of Demsar. It is concluded that simple and comprehensible networks with less nodes can be constructed using BN classifiers other than the Naive Bayes classifier. Furthermore, it is found that the aspects of comprehensibility and predictive performance need to be balanced out, and also the development context is an item which should be taken into account during model selection.

The recognition of MAs is an essential step in the diagnosis and grading of diabetic retinopathy. The proposed method realizes MA detection through the analysis of directional cross-section profiles centered on the local maximum pixels of the preprocessed image. Peak detection is applied on each profile, and a set of attributes regarding the size, height, and shape of the peak are calculated subsequently. The statistical measures of these attribute values as the orientation of the cross-section changes constitute the feature set that is used in a naive Bayes classification to exclude spurious candidates. We give a formula for the final score of the remaining candidates, which can be thresholded further for a binary output. The proposed method has been tested in the Retinopathy Online Challenge, where it proved to be competitive with the state-of-the-art approaches. We also present the experimental results for a private image set using the same classifier setup.

Document-level sentiment classification: An empirical comparison between SVM and ANN	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Sentiment classification; Opinion mining; Text classification; Artificial Neural Networks; Support Vector Machines; Comparative study	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; FEEDFORWARD NEURAL-NETWORKS; ALGORITHM; REVIEWS	Document-level sentiment classification aims to automate the task of classifying a textual review, which is given on a single topic, as expressing a positive or negative sentiment. In general, supervised methods consist of two stages: (i) extraction/selection of informative features and (ii) classification of reviews by using learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB). SVM have been extensively and successfully used as a sentiment learning approach while Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have rarely been considered in comparative studies in the sentiment analysis literature. This paper presents an empirical comparison between SVM and ANN regarding document-level sentiment analysis. We discuss requirements, resulting models and contexts in which both approaches achieve better levels of classification accuracy. We adopt a standard evaluation context with popular supervised methods for feature selection and weighting in a traditional bag-of-words model. Except for some unbalanced data contexts, our experiments indicated that ANN produce superior or at least comparable results to SVM's. Specially on the benchmark dataset of Movies reviews, ANN outperformed SVM by a statistically significant difference, even on the context of unbalanced data. Our results have also confirmed some potential limitations of both models, which have been rarely discussed in the sentiment classification literature, like the computational cost of SVM at the running time and ANN at the training time.

In wireless sensor networks, the cognitive radio technology enables sensor nodes to occupy licensed band in opportunistic manner and introduces advantages of improving spectrum utilization and increasing system throughput. By considering the opportunistic spectrum access nature, in this paper, we aim to provide a stable path selection scheme for cognitive radio sensor networks. The proposed routing protocol utilizes priori delivery information and derives a novel routing metric for the optimal path selection. The routing metric is derived from naive Bayes inference and used to indicate the path stability by means of delivery probability. We show through extensive simulations that the proposed routing protocol is efficient to find the most probable delivery path and increase the system throughput.

Thus, understanding proteinprotein interactions (PPIs) is essential to decipher biological functions in a living cell. To predict large-scale PPIs, effective and efficient computational approaches are desirable to integrate heterogeneous data sources provided by advanced technologies. In this paper, we extend our previous work on a Bayesian classifier for human PPI predictions from model organisms, by introducing a tree-augmented naive Bayes (TAN) classifier. TAN maintains the simplicity and robustness of a naive Bayes classifier while allows for the dependence among variables. Our empirical results show that by integrating features extracted from microarray expression measurements, Gene Ontology values, and orthologous scores, TAN achieves higher classification accuracy than the manually constructed Bayesian network classifier and naive Bayes. For human PPI prediction, TAN obtains 88% sensitivity while keeping a reasonable 70% specificity on testing samples.

Automated detection of diabetes using higher order spectral features extracted from heart rate signals	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						ECG; HRV; higher order spectra; diabetes; Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy; bispectrum; entropy; classifier	RATE-VARIABILITY; CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY; QT INTERVAL; CLASSIFICATION; ECG; HYPERGLYCEMIA; ARRHYTHMIA; TRANSFORM; DYNAMICS; TIME	Diabetes Mellitus, often referred to as diabetes, is a chronic disease that affects a vast majority of world population. The percentage of people affected is increasing every year. Diabetes is very difficult to cure. It can only be kept under control. In this scenario, diagnosis of diabetes is of great importance. In this work, we used Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signals obtained from ECG signals for the purpose of diagnosis of diabetes. We employed signal processing methods to extract features from the HRV signal. Since HRV signals are of nonlinear nature, we made use of Higher Order Spectrum (HOS) based features for analysis. In this paper, we have extracted the HOS features from HRV signals corresponding to normal and diabetic subjects. These selected features were fed independently to seven classifiers namely Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes classifier (NBC), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Fuzzy classifier and Decision Tree (DT) classifier. The performance of these classifiers was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve measures. We observed that the GMM classifier presented the highest accuracy of 90.5%, while the other classifiers presented accuracies in the range of 86.5% to 71.4%. Thus, the proposed Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) technique has the ability to detect diabetes efficiently by analyzing the subtle changes in ECG signals that are indicative of the presence of diabetes in a patient. Also, we have proposed unique bispectrum and bicoherence plots for normal and diabetes heart rate signals.

In the proposed scheme, traffic flows are described using the discretized statistical features and flow correlation information is modeled by bag-of-flow (BoF). We solve the BoF-based traffic classification in a classifier combination framework and theoretically analyze the performance benefit. Furthermore, a new BoF-based traffic classification method is proposed to aggregate the naive Bayes (NB) predictions of the correlated flows. We also present an analysis on prediction error sensitivity of the aggregation strategies. Finally, a large number of experiments are carried out on two large-scale real-world traffic datasets to evaluate the proposed scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can achieve much better classification performance than existing state-of-the-art traffic classification methods.

Development and evaluation of a Naive Bayesian model for coding causation of workers' compensation claims	JOURNAL OF SAFETY RESEARCH			English	Article						Data-mining; Text-mining; Bayes; Accident narratives; Text classification	INJURY NARRATIVES	Introduction: Tracking and trending rates of injuries and illnesses classified as musculoskeletal disorders caused by ergonomic risk factors such as overexertion and repetitive motion (MSDs) and slips, trips, or falls (STFs) in different industry sectors is of high interest to many researchers. Unfortunately, identifying the cause of injuries and illnesses in large datasets such as workers' compensation systems often requires reading and coding the free form accident text narrative for potentially millions of records. Method: To alleviate the need for manual coding, this paper describes and evaluates a computer auto-coding algorithm that demonstrated the ability to code millions of claims quickly and accurately by learning from a set of previously manually coded claims. Conclusions: The auto-coding program was able to code claims as a musculoskeletal disorders, SIP or other with approximately 90% accuracy. Impact on industry: The program developed and discussed in this paper provides an accurate and efficient method for identifying the causation of workers' compensation claims as a SIT or MSD in a large database based on the unstructured text narrative and resulting injury diagnoses. The program coded thousands of claims in minutes. The method described in this paper can be used by researchers and practitioners to relieve the manual burden of reading and identifying the causation of claims as a SIT or MSD. Furthermore, the method can be easily generalized to code/classify other unstructured text narratives. National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Bertke, S. J.; Meyers, A.

In gene expression data sets, the correlation between genes can be high when they share the same biological pathway. Moreover, the gene expression data sets may contain outliers due to either chemical or electrical reasons. A good gene selection method should take group effects into account and be robust to outliers. In this paper, we propose a Laplace naive Bayes model with mean shrinkage (LNB-MS). The Laplace distribution instead of the normal distribution is used as the conditional distribution of the samples for the reasons that it is less sensitive to outliers and has been applied in many fields. The key technique is the L-1 penalty imposed on the mean of each class to achieve automatic feature selection. The objective function of the proposed model is a piecewise linear function with respect to the mean of each class, of which the optimal value can be evaluated at the breakpoints simply. An efficient algorithm is designed to estimate the parameters in the model. A new strategy that uses the number of selected features to control the regularization parameter is introduced. Experimental results on simulated data sets and 17 publicly available cancer data sets attest to the accuracy, sparsity, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed algorithm. Many biomarkers identified with our method have been verified in biochemical or biomedical research. The analysis of biological and functional correlation of the genes based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms shows that the proposed method guarantees the selection of highly correlated genes simultaneously.

In this article, an automatic whole breast lesion detection system based on the naive Bayes classifier using the PC-based US system Terason t3000 (Terason Ultrasound, Burlington, MA, USA) with a hand-held probe is proposed. To easily retrieve the US images for any regions of the breast, a clock-based storing system is proposed to record the scanned US images. A computer-aided detection (CAD) system is also developed to save the physicians' time for a huge volume of scanned US images. The pixel classification of the US is based on the naive Bayes classifier for the proposed lesion detection system. The pixels of the US are classified into two types: lesions or normal tissues. The connected component labeling is applied to find the suspected lesions in the image. Consequently, the labeled two-dimensional suspected regions are separated into two clusters and further checked by two-phase lesion selection criteria for the determination of the real lesion, while reducing the false-positive rate. The free-response operative characteristics (FROC) curve is used to evaluate the detection performance of the proposed system. According to the experimental results of 31 cases with 33 lesions, the proposed system yields a 93.4% (31/33) sensitivity at 4.22 false positives (FPs) per hundred slices. Moreover, the speed for the proposed detection scheme achieves 12.3 frames per second (fps) with an Intel Dual-Core Quad 3 GHz processor and can be also effectively and efficiently used for other screening systems.

The stages of the algorithm are scan period estimation, preprocessing (normalization, resampling, averaging), feature extraction, and classification. Naive Bayes (NB), decision-tree (DT), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are used to classify five different ASTs in simulation and real experiments. Classifiers are compared based on their accuracy, noise robustness, and computational complexity. DT classifiers are found to outperform the others.

Automated, highly-accurate, bug assignment using machine learning and tossing graphs	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Bug assignment; Bug tossing; Machine learning; Empirical studies		Empirical studies indicate that automating the bug assignment process has the potential to significantly reduce software evolution effort and costs. Prior work has used machine learning techniques to automate bug assignment but has employed a narrow band of tools which can be ineffective in large, long-lived software projects. To redress this situation, in this paper we employ a comprehensive set of machine learning tools and a probabilistic graph-based model (bug tossing graphs) that lead to highly-accurate predictions, and lay the foundation for the next generation of machine learning-based bug assignment. Our work is the first to examine the impact of multiple machine learning dimensions (classifiers, attributes, and training history) along with bug tossing graphs on prediction accuracy in bug assignment. We validate our approach on Mozilla and Eclipse, covering 856,259 bug reports and 21 cumulative years of development. We demonstrate that our techniques can achieve up to 86.09% prediction accuracy in bug assignment and significantly reduce tossing path lengths. We show that for our data sets the Naive Bayes classifier coupled with product-component features, tossing graphs and incremental learning performs best. Next, we perform an ablative analysis by unilaterally varying classifiers, features, and learning model to show their relative importance of on bug assignment accuracy. Finally, we propose optimization techniques that achieve high prediction accuracy while reducing training and prediction time. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Note on Naive Bayes Based on Binary Descriptors in Cheminformatics	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							DISCRIMINATION; CLASSIFIER; DISCOVERY	A plethora of articles on naive Bayes classifiers, where the chemical compounds to be classified are represented by binary valued (absent or present type) descriptors, have appeared in the cheminformatics literature over the past decade. The principal goal of this paper is to describe how a naive Bayes classifier based on binary descriptors (NBCBBD) can be employed as a feature selector in an efficient manner suitable for cheminformatics. In the process, we point out a fact well documented in other disciplines that NBCBBD is a linear classifier and is therefore intrinsically suboptimal for classifying compounds that are nonlinearly separable in their binary descriptor space. We investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm on classifying a subset of the MDDR data set, a standard molecular benchmark data set, into active and inactive compounds.

J	Magis, AT; Price, ND				Magis, Andrew T.; Price, Nathan D.			The top-scoring 'N' algorithm: a generalized relative expression classification method from small numbers of biomolecules	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Classification; Top-scoring pair; Relative expression; Cross validation; Support vector machine; Graphics processing unit; Microarray	GENE-EXPRESSION; PROSTATE-CANCER; PROCESSING UNITS; PREDICTION; TUMOR; CELL; DIAGNOSIS; PATTERNS	Background: Relative expression algorithms such as the top-scoring pair (TSP) and the top-scoring triplet (TST) have several strengths that distinguish them from other classification methods, including resistance to overfitting, invariance to most data normalization methods, and biological interpretability. The top-scoring 'N' (TSN) algorithm is a generalized form of other relative expression algorithms which uses generic permutations and a dynamic classifier size to control both the permutation and combination space available for classification. Results: TSN was tested on nine cancer datasets, showing statistically significant differences in classification accuracy between different classifier sizes (choices of N). TSN also performed competitively against a wide variety of different classification methods, including artificial neural networks, classification trees, discriminant analysis, k-Nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, and support vector machines, when tested on the Microarray Quality Control II datasets. Furthermore, TSN exhibits low levels of overfitting on training data compared to other methods, giving confidence that results obtained during cross validation will be more generally applicable to external validation sets. Conclusions: TSN preserves the strengths of other relative expression algorithms while allowing a much larger permutation and combination space to be explored, potentially improving classification accuracies when fewer numbers of measured features are available.

To fully capture the genetic biomarkers that jointly explain the heritability component of a disease, thus, all SNPs from a genome-wide association study should be analyzed simultaneously. Results: In this paper, we present Bag of Naive Bayes (BoNB), an algorithm for genetic biomarker selection and subjects classification from the simultaneous analysis of genome-wide SNP data. BoNB is based on the Naive Bayes classification framework, enriched by three main features: bootstrap aggregating of an ensemble of Naive Bayes classifiers, a novel strategy for ranking and selecting the attributes used by each classifier in the ensemble and a permutation-based procedure for selecting significant biomarkers, based on their marginal utility in the classification process. BoNB is tested on the Wellcome Trust Case-Control study on Type 1 Diabetes and its performance is compared with the ones of both a standard Naive Bayes algorithm and HyperLASSO, a penalized logistic regression algorithm from the state-of-the-art in simultaneous genome-wide data analysis. Conclusions: The significantly higher classification accuracy obtained by BoNB, together with the significance of the biomarkers identified from the Type 1 Diabetes dataset, prove the effectiveness of BoNB as an algorithm for both classification and biomarker selection from genome-wide SNP data.

J	Marques, AI; Garcia, V; Sanchez, JS				Marques, A. I.; Garcia, V.; Sanchez, J. S.			Exploring the behaviour of base classifiers in credit scoring ensembles	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Finance; Credit scoring; Classifier ensemble	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; PREDICTION; BANKRUPTCY; MODEL	Many techniques have been proposed for credit risk assessment, from statistical models to artificial intelligence methods. During the last few years, different approaches to classifier ensembles have successfully been applied to credit scoring problems, demonstrating to be more accurate than single prediction models. However, it is still a question what base classifiers should be employed in each ensemble in order to achieve the highest performance. Accordingly, the present paper evaluates the performance of seven individual prediction techniques when used as members of five different ensemble methods. The ultimate aim of this study is to suggest appropriate classifiers for each ensemble approach in the context of credit scoring. The experimental results and statistical tests show that the C4.5 decision tree constitutes the best solution for most ensemble methods, closely followed by the multilayer perceptron neural network and logistic regression, whereas the nearest neighbour and the naive Bayes classifiers appear to be significantly the worst.

In this paper, the thermogravimetric (TG) curves of 49 wood samples are used to classify them in 7 predetermined species. Different functional and multivariate statistical supervised classification methods are used for this task: a nonparametric Nadaraya-Watson kernel functional estimator (K-NFDA), using the complete TG curves, and multivariate supervised classification approaches, such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Naive Bayes (NBC), Neural Networks (NN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Before applying the multivariate techniques, the TG curves are discretized using principal component analysis (PCA) or fitting a four-component generalized logistic model. The results show that the classical method of LDA using the logistic parameters had the best performance, although high correct classification percentages were also obtained with the rest of the approaches. The work is completed with a comprehensive simulation study, comparing the classification techniques in different scenarios. Artificial TG curves are generated using the logistic model and additional conclusions on wood classification are established. Due to the heterogeneity of wood, this simulation study is very useful to describe worst-case scenarios and to assess more accurately the proposed classification methodologies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Li, CQ; Li, HW				Li, Chaoqun; Li, Hongwei			A Modified Short and Fukunaga Metric based on the attribute independence assumption	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Naive Bayes; Attribute independence assumption; Short and Fukunaga Metric; Value Difference Metric; Distance-related algorithms	BAYESIAN CLASSIFIER; LEARNING ALGORITHMS	It is well known that the naive Bayesian classifier assumes the attribute independence given the class. According to our observation, some distance functions also assume the attribute independence, such as Value Difference Metric (VDM). Short and Fukunaga Metric (SFM) is another widely used distance function, which does not assume the attribute independence. In this paper, we investigate the attribute independence assumption in VDM, and propose a Modified Short and Fukunaga Metric (MSFM) based on the attribute independence assumption. We find that MSFM is surprisingly similar to VDM. In fact, based on some assumptions, our MSFM can be regarded as a logarithmic modification of VDM. That is to say, in some sense, a logarithmic modification of SFM is equivalent to a logarithmic modification of VDM. Our experimental results on a large number of UCI benchmark datasets show that MSFM significantly outperforms SFM and SF2LOG (another improved version of SFM), and almost ties VDM.

J	Wang, D; Liu, Y				Wang, Dong; Liu, Yang			A cross-corpus study of subjectivity identification using unsupervised learning	NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING			English	Article								In this study, we investigate using unsupervised generative learning methods for subjectivity detection across different domains. We create an initial training set using simple lexicon information and then evaluate two iterative learning methods with a base naive Bayes classifier to learn from unannotated data. The first method is self-training, which adds instances with high confidence into the training set in each iteration. The second is a calibrated EM (expectation-maximization) method where we calibrate the posterior probabilities from EM such that the class distribution is similar to that in the real data. We evaluate both approaches on three different domains: movie data, news resource, and meeting dialogues, and we found that in some cases the unsupervised learning methods can achieve performance close to the fully supervised setup. We perform a thorough analysis to examine factors, such as self-labeling accuracy of the initial training set in unsupervised learning, the accuracy of the added examples in self-training, and the size of the initial training set in different methods. Our experiments and analysis show inherent differences across domains and impacting factors explaining the model behaviors.

In this paper, we proposed a new feature selection algorithm, named CMFS, which comprehensively measures the significance of a term both in inter-category and intra-category. We evaluated CMFS on three benchmark document collections, 20-Newsgroups. Reuters-21578 and WebKB, using two classification algorithms, Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The experimental results, comparing CMFS with six well-known feature selection algorithms, show that the proposed method CMFS is significantly superior to Information Gain (IC), Chi statistic (CHI), Document Frequency (DF), Orthogonal Centroid Feature Selection (OCFS) and DIA association factor (DIA) when Nave Bayes classifier is used and significantly outperforms IC, DF, OCFS and DIA when Support Vector Machines are used.

J	Kukreja, M; Johnston, SA; Stafford, P				Kukreja, Muskan; Johnston, Stephen Albert; Stafford, Phillip			Comparative study of classification algorithms for immunosignaturing data	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Immunosignature; Random peptide microarray; Data mining; Classification algorithms; Naive Bayes	MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON; FEATURE-SELECTION; ERROR ESTIMATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; CANCER; VALIDATION; PEPTIDES; FEATURES	Background: High-throughput technologies such as DNA, RNA, protein, antibody and peptide microarrays are often used to examine differences across drug treatments, diseases, transgenic animals, and others. Typically one trains a classification system by gathering large amounts of probe-level data, selecting informative features, and classifies test samples using a small number of features. As new microarrays are invented, classification systems that worked well for other array types may not be ideal. Expression microarrays, arguably one of the most prevalent array types, have been used for years to help develop classification algorithms. Many biological assumptions are built into classifiers that were designed for these types of data. One of the more problematic is the assumption of independence, both at the probe level and again at the biological level. Probes for RNA transcripts are designed to bind single transcripts. At the biological level, many genes have dependencies across transcriptional pathways where co-regulation of transcriptional units may make many genes appear as being completely dependent. Thus, algorithms that perform well for gene expression data may not be suitable when other technologies with different binding characteristics exist. The immunosignaturing microarray is based on complex mixtures of antibodies binding to arrays of random sequence peptides. It relies on many-to-many binding of antibodies to the random sequence peptides. Each peptide can bind multiple antibodies and each antibody can bind multiple peptides. This technology has been shown to be highly reproducible and appears promising for diagnosing a variety of disease states. However, it is not clear what is the optimal classification algorithm for analyzing this new type of data. Results: We characterized several classification algorithms to analyze immunosignaturing data. We selected several datasets that range from easy to difficult to classify, from simple monoclonal binding to complex binding patterns in asthma patients. We then classified the biological samples using 17 different classification algorithms. Using a wide variety of assessment criteria, we found 'Naive Bayes' far more useful than other widely used methods due to its simplicity, robustness, speed and accuracy. Conclusions: 'Naive Bayes' algorithm appears to accommodate the complex patterns hidden within multilayered immunosignaturing microarray data due to its fundamental mathematical properties.

J	Maji, P; Das, C				Maji, Pradipta; Das, Chandra			Relevant and Significant Supervised Gene Clusters for Microarray Cancer Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NANOBIOSCIENCE			English	Article						Classification; feature selection; gene clustering; microarray analysis; mutual information	EXPRESSION DATA; PATTERNS; SELECTION; TUMOR	An important application of microarray data in functional genomics is to classify samples according to their gene expression profiles such as to classify cancer versus normal samples or to classify different types or subtypes of cancer. One of the major tasks with gene expression data is to find co-regulated gene groups whose collective expression is strongly associated with sample categories. In this regard, a gene clustering algorithm is proposed to group genes from microarray data. It directly incorporates the information of sample categories in the grouping process for finding groups of co-regulated genes with strong association to the sample categories, yielding a supervised gene clustering algorithm. The average expression of the genes from each cluster acts as its representative. Some significant representatives are taken to form the reduced feature set to build the classifiers for cancer classification. The mutual information is used to compute both gene-gene redundancy and gene-class relevance. The performance of the proposed method, along with a comparison with existing methods, is studied on six cancer microarray data sets using the predictive accuracy of naive Bayes classifier, K-nearest neighbor rule, and support vector machine. An important finding is that the proposed algorithm is shown to be effective for identifying biologically significant gene clusters with excellent predictive capability.

In silico predictive models permit inexpensive, rapid "virtual screening" to prioritize selection of compounds for experimental testing. Both experimental and in silico screening can be used to test compounds for desirable or undesirable properties. Prior work on prediction of mutagenicity has primarily involved identification of toxicophores rather than whole-molecule predictive models. In this work, we examined a range of in silico predictive classification models for prediction of mutagenic properties of compounds, including methods such as J48 and SMO which have not previously been widely applied in cheminformatics. Results: The Bursi mutagenicity data set containing 4337 compounds (Set 1) and a Benchmark data set of 6512 compounds (Set 2) were taken as input data set in this work. A third data set (Set 3) was prepared by joining up the previous two sets. Classification algorithms including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, J48 and SMO with 10 fold cross-validation and default parameters were used for model generation on these data sets. Models built using the combined performed better than those developed from the Benchmark data set. Significantly, Random Forest outperformed other classifiers for all the data sets, especially for Set 3 with 89.27% accuracy, 89% precision and ROC of 95.3%. To validate the developed models two external data sets, AID1189 and AID1194, with mutagenicity data were tested showing 62% accuracy with 67% precision and 65% ROC area and 91% accuracy, 91% precision with 96.3% ROC area respectively. A Random Forest model was used on approved drugs from DrugBank and metabolites from the Zinc Database with True Positives rate almost 85% showing the robustness of the model. Conclusion: We have created a new mutagenicity benchmark data set with around 8,000 compounds. Our work shows that highly accurate predictive mutagenicity models can be built using machine learning methods based on chemical descriptors and trained using this set, and these models provide a complement to toxicophores based methods. Further, our work supports other recent literature in showing that Random Forest models generally outperform other comparable machine learning methods for this kind of application.

FEATURE SELECTIONS FOR HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION IN SMART HOME ENVIRONMENTS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Activity recognition; Naive Bayes classifier; Hidden Markov model; Viterbi algorithm; Smart home	PATTERNS	In this paper, three probabilistic models are applied to represent and recognize human activities from observed sensor sequences: Naive Bayes classifier, forward procedure of a Hidden Markov Model and Viterbi algorithm based on a Hidden Markov Model. A variety of different feature selection methods is tested in order to reduce the dimensionality of the learning problem. The results show that the activity recognition performance measures of the three algorithms have a strong relationship with the dataset features that are utilized. Larger time feature values and smaller length size feature values will generate better results, relatively.

Efforts to predict antigenicity have relied on a few computational algorithms predicting signal peptide sequences (SignalP), transmembrane domains, or subcellular localization (pSort). An empirical protein microarray approach was developed to scan the entire proteome of any infectious microorganism and empirically determine immunoglobulin reactivity against all the antigens from a microorganism in infected individuals. The current database from this activity contains quantitative antibody reactivity data against 35,000 proteins derived from 25 infectious microorganisms and more than 30 million data points derived from 15,000 patient sera. Interrogation of these data sets has revealed ten proteomic features that are associated with antigenicity, allowing an in silico protein sequence and functional annotation based approach to triage the least likely antigenic proteins from those that are more likely to be antigenic. The first iteration of this approach applied to Brucella melitensis predicted 37% of the bacterial proteome containing 91% of the antigens empirically identified by probing proteome microarrays. In this study, we describe a naive Bayes classification approach that can be used to assign a relative score to the likelihood that an antigen will be immunoreactive and serodiagnostic in a bacterial proteome. This algorithm predicted 20% of the B. melitensis proteome including 91% of the serodiagnostic antigens, a nearly twofold improvement in specificity of the predictor. These results give us confidence that further development of this approach will lead to further improvements in the sensitivity and specificity of this in silico predictive algorithm.

Early prediction of this undesirable outcome can help in selecting candidates with increased chance of success, thus, reducing attrition at all stages of drug development. The ensemble modelling of mixed features was used for the development of a model to classify the metabolic activation of chemicals into covalently reactive species. The effects of the quality of base classifiers and performance measure for sorting were examined. An ensemble model of 13 naive Bayes classifiers was built from a diverse set of 1,479 compounds. The ensemble model was validated internally with five-fold cross validation and it has achieved sensitivity of 67.4% and specificity of 93.4% when tested on the training set. The final ensemble model was made available for public use.

It determines the treatment that will be applied further. In current practice, urologists use the pathological stage predictions provided in Partin tables to support their decisions. However. Partin tables are based on logistic regression (LR) and built from US data. Our objective is to investigate a range of both predictive methods and of predictive variables for pathological stage prediction and assess them with respect to their predictive quality based on UK data. Methods and material: The latest version of Partin tables was applied to a large scale British dataset in order to measure their performances by mean of concordance index (c-index). The data was collected by the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) and gathered records from over 1700 patients treated with prostatectomy in 57 centers across UK. The original methodology was replicated using the BAUS dataset and evaluated using concordance index. In addition, a selection of classifiers, including, among others. LR, artificial neural networks and Bayesian networks (BNs) was applied to the same data and compared with each other using the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Subsets of the data were created in order to observe how classifiers perform with the inclusion of extra variables. Finally a local dataset prepared by the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary was used to study the effect on predictive performance of using different variables. Results: Partin tables have low predictive quality (c-index = 0.602) when applied on UK data for comparison on patients with organ confined and extra prostatic extension conditions, patients at the two most frequently observed pathological stages. The use of replicate lookup tables built from British data shows an improvement in the classification, but the overall predictive quality remains low (c-index = 0.610). Comparing a range of classifiers shows that BNs generally outperform other methods. Using the four variables from Partin tables, naive Bayes is the best classifier for the prediction of each class label (AUC = 0.662 for OC). When two additional variables are added, the results of LR (0.675), artificial neural networks (0.656) and BN methods (0.679) are overall improved. BNs show higher AUCs than the other methods when the number of variables raises Conclusion: The predictive quality of Partin tables can be described as low to moderate on UK data. This means that following the predictions generated by Partin tables, many patients would received an inappropriate treatment, generally associated with a deterioration of their quality of life. In addition to demographic differences between UK and the original US population, the methodology and in particular LR present limitations. BN represents a promising alternative to LR from which prostate cancer staging can benefit. Heuristic search for structure learning and the inclusion of more variables are elements that further improve BN models quality. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, a biomedical system based on Learning Vector Quantization Neural Network (LVQ NN) has been developed in order to classify the internal carotid artery Doppler signals obtained from the 191 subjects, 136 of them had suffered from internal carotid artery stenosis and rest of them had been healthy subject. The system is composed of feature extraction and classification parts, basically. In the feature extraction stage, power spectral density (PSD) estimates of internal carotid artery Doppler signals were obtained by using Burg autoregressive (AR) spectrum analysis technique in order to obtain medical information. In the classification stage, LVQ NN was used classify features from Burg AR method. In experiments, LVQ NN based method reached 97.91% classification accuracy with 5 fold Cross Validation (CV) technique. In addition, the classification performance of the LVQ NN was compared with some methods such as Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) NN, Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), decision tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with sensitivity and specificity statistical parameters. The classification results showed that the LVQ NN method is effective for classification of internal carotid artery Doppler signals.

J	Zheng, F; Webb, GI; Suraweera, P; Zhu, LG				Zheng, Fei; Webb, Geoffrey I.; Suraweera, Pramuditha; Zhu, Liguang			Subsumption resolution: an efficient and effective technique for semi-naive Bayesian learning	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Classification; Naive Bayes; Semi-naive Bayes; Feature selection; AODE	CLASSIFIERS; MODELS	Semi-naive Bayesian techniques seek to improve the accuracy of naive Bayes (NB) by relaxing the attribute independence assumption. We present a new type of semi-naive Bayesian operation, Subsumption Resolution (SR), which efficiently identifies occurrences of the specialization-generalization relationship and eliminates generalizations at classification time. We extend SR to Near-Subsumption Resolution (NSR) to delete near-generalizations in addition to generalizations. We develop two versions of SR: one that performs SR during training, called eager SR (ESR), and another that performs SR during testing, called lazy SR (LSR). We investigate the effect of ESR, LSR, NSR and conventional attribute elimination (BSE) on NB and Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE), a powerful alternative to NB. BSE imposes very high training time overheads on NB and AODE accompanied by varying decreases in classification time overheads. ESR, LSR and NSR impose high training time and test time overheads on NB. However, LSR imposes no extra training time overheads and only modest test time overheads on AODE, while ESR and NSR impose modest training and test time overheads on AODE. Our extensive experimental comparison on sixty UCI data sets shows that applying BSE, LSR or NSR to NB significantly improves both zero-one loss and RMSE, while applying BSE, ESR or NSR to AODE significantly improves zero-one loss and RMSE and applying LSR to AODE significantly improves zero-one loss. The Friedman test and Nemenyi test show that AODE with ESR or NSR have a significant zero-one loss and RMSE advantage over Logistic Regression and a zero-one loss advantage over Weka's LibSVM implementation with a grid parameter search on categorical data. AODE with LSR has a zero-one loss advantage over Logistic Regression and comparable zero-one loss with LibSVM. Finally, we examine the circumstances under which the elimination of near-generalizations proves beneficial.

The purpose of this study is to propose a two-stage clustering-classification model through (1) initially integrating the RFM attribute and K-means algorithm for clustering the TCS patients and (2) then integrating the global discretization method and the rough set theory for classifying hospitalized departments and optimizing health care services. To assess the performance of the proposed model, a dataset was used from a representative hospital (termed Hospital-A) that was extracted from a database from an empirical study in Taiwan comprised of 183,947 samples that were characterized by 44 attributes during 2008. The proposed model was compared with three techniques, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Multilayer Perceptron, and the empirical results showed significant promise of its accuracy. The generated knowledge-based rules provide useful information to maximize resource utilization and support the development of a strategy for decision-making in hospitals. From the findings, 75 patients in the TCS, three hospital departments, and specific diagnostic items were discovered in the data for Hospital-A. A potential determinant for gender differences was found, and the age attribute was not significant to the hospital departments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we work on the approach of instance weighting and propose an improved naive Bayes algorithm by discriminative instance weighting. We called it Discriminatively Weighted Naive Bayes. In each iteration of it, different training instances are discriminatively assigned different weights according to the estimated conditional probability loss. The experimental results based on a large number of UCI data sets validate its effectiveness in terms of the classification accuracy and AUC. Besides,the experimental results on the running time show that our Discriminatively Weighted Naive Bayes performs almost as efficiently as the state-of-the-art Discriminative Frequency Estimate learning method, and significantly more efficient than Boosted Naive Bayes. At last, we apply the idea of discriminatively weighted learning in our algorithm to some state-of-the-art naive Bayes text classifiers, such as multinomial naive Bayes, complement naive Bayes and the one-versus-all-but-one model, and have achieved remarkable improvements.

J	Kumar, G; Kumar, K				Kumar, Gulshan; Kumar, Krishan			An information theoretic approach for feature selection	SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS			English	Article						feature selection; mutual information; redundancy; relevance	MUTUAL INFORMATION; INTRUSION DETECTION; REDUNDANCY; RELEVANCE	Feature selection methods play a significant role during classification of data having high dimensions of features. The methods select most relevant subset of features that describe data appropriately. Mutual information (MI) based upon information theory is one of the metrics used for measuring relevance of features. This paper analyses various feature selection methods for (1) reduction in number of features; (2) performance of Naive Bayes classification model trained on reduced set of features. Research gaps identified are: (1) computation of MI from the whole sample space instead of unclassified sample subspace; (2) consideration of relevance of features only or tradeoff between relevance and redundancy, but class conditional interaction of features is ignored. In this paper, we propose a general evaluation function using MI for feature selection. The proposed evaluation function is implemented which use dynamically computed MI values from unclassified instances. Effectiveness of the proposed feature selection method is done empirically by comparing classification results using KDD 1999 benchmarked dataset of intrusion detection. The results indicate practicability and effectiveness of the proposed method for applications concerned with high accuracy and stability of predictions. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Apart from factors like usability, integration with work-flow and natural language processing, lack of decision accuracy of the tools has hindered their utility. Hence, research to develop accurate algorithms for medical decision support tools, is required. Pioneering research in last two decades, has demonstrated the utility of fuzzy set theory for medical domain. Recently, Wagholikar and Deshpande proposed a fuzzy relation based method (FR) for medical diagnosis. In their case studies for heart and infectious diseases, the FR method was found to be better than naive bayes (NB). However, the datasets in their studies were small and included only categorical symptoms. Hence, more evaluative studies are required for drawing general conclusions. In the present paper, we compare the classification performance of FR with NB, for a variety of medical datasets. Our results indicate that the FR method is useful for classification problems in the medical domain, and that FR is marginally better than NB. However, the performance of FR is significantly better for datasets having high proportion of unknown attribute values. Such datasets occur in problems involving linguistic information, where FR can be particularly useful. Our empirical study will benefit medical researchers in the choice of algorithms for decision support tools.

However, there are two challenges in those systems: the energy consumption due to the wireless transmission and the classifier design because of the dynamic feature vector. This paper proposes a multi-sensor fusion framework, which consists of the sensor selection module and the hierarchical classifier. The sensor selection module adopts the convex optimization to select the sensor subset in real time. The hierarchical classifier combines the Decision Tree classifier with the Naive Bayes classifier. The dataset collected from 8 subjects, who performed 8 scenario activities, was used to evaluate the proposed system. The results show that the proposed system can obviously reduce the energy consumption while guaranteeing the recognition accuracy.

FT-IR spectroscopy could identify variability at the molecular level in biological specimens. It is a rapid and noninvasive method, which could be used intraoperatively to modify surgical procedures. The aim of this paper is to identify and separate cancer from colitis in endoscopic colon biopsies through the use of FT-IR spectroscopy. A total of 88 endoscopic colon samples, including 41 cases of colitis and 47 cases of colon cancer, were obtained. Specimens were placed on an ATR accessory linked to FT-IR spectrometer with a MCT detector for greater stability and sensitivity. Later, specimens were sent for the histological examination as the reference in the spectral analysis. 41 colitis and 47 cancer specimens were compared. Spectra preprocessed with smoothing and normalization were used for discrimination analysis. PCA was processed to simplify the spectrum data set. Naive Bayes classifier model was constructed for diagnostic classification. Leave-one-out cross-validation method was utilized to assess the discrimination results. The sensitivity of FT-IR detection for cancer achieves 97.6%. The results showed that colon cancer could be distinguished from colitis with high accuracy using FT-IR spectroscopy and chemometrics.

The proposed approach abstracts the lower structural property of the tactile image by analyzing the covariance between pressure values and their locations on the sensor and identifies three orthogonal principal axes of the pressure distribution. Classifying contact shapes based on the principal axes allows the results to be invariant to the rotation of the contact shape. A naive Bayes classifier is implemented to classify the shape and pose of the local contact shapes. Using an off-shelf low resolution tactile array sensor which comprises of 5x9 pressure elements, an overall accuracy of 97.5% has been achieved in classifying six primitive contact shapes. The proposed method is very computational efficient (total classifying time for a local contact shape = 576 mu s (1736 Hz)). The test results demonstrate that the proposed method is practical to be implemented on robotic hands equipped with tactile array sensors for conducting manipulation tasks where real-time classification is essential.

The differentiation of syndrome (ZHENG) is the criterion of diagnosis and therapeutic in TCM. Therefore, syndrome prediction in silico can be improving the performance of treatment. In this paper, we present a Bayesian network framework to construct a high-confidence syndrome predictor based on the optimum subset, that is, collected by Support Vector Machine (SVM) feature selection. Syndrome of CAD can be divided into asthenia and sthenia syndromes. According to the hierarchical characteristics of syndrome, we firstly label every case three types of syndrome (asthenia, sthenia, or both) to solve several syndromes with some patients. On basis of the three syndromes' classes, we design SVM feature selection to achieve the optimum symptom subset and compare this subset with Markov blanket feature select using ROC. Using this subset, the six predictors of CAD's syndrome are constructed by the Bayesian network technique. We also design Naive Bayes, C4.5 Logistic, Radial basis function (RBF) network compared with Bayesian network. In a conclusion, the Bayesian network method based on the optimum symptoms shows a practical method to predict six syndromes of CAD in TCM.

J	Maji, P				Maji, Pradipta			Mutual Information-Based Supervised Attribute Clustering for Microarray Sample Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Microarray analysis; attribute clustering; gene selection; mutual information; classification	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; SUBSET-SELECTION; CANCER CLASSIFICATION; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; PATTERNS; PROFILES; DISEASE; TISSUES; TUMOR	Microarray technology is one of the important biotechnological means that allows to record the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously within a number of different samples. An important application of microarray gene expression data in functional genomics is to classify samples according to their gene expression profiles. Among the large amount of genes presented in gene expression data, only a small fraction of them is effective for performing a certain diagnostic test. Hence, one of the major tasks with the gene expression data is to find groups of coregulated genes whose collective expression is strongly associated with the sample categories or response variables. In this regard, a new supervised attribute clustering algorithm is proposed to find such groups of genes. It directly incorporates the information of sample categories into the attribute clustering process. A new quantitative measure, based on mutual information, is introduced that incorporates the information of sample categories to measure the similarity between attributes. The proposed supervised attribute clustering algorithm is based on measuring the similarity between attributes using the new quantitative measure, whereby redundancy among the attributes is removed. The clusters are then refined incrementally based on sample categories. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with that of existing supervised and unsupervised gene clustering and gene selection algorithms based on the class separability index and the predictive accuracy of naive bayes classifier, K-nearest neighbor rule, and support vector machine on three cancer and two arthritis microarray data sets. The biological significance of the generated clusters is interpreted using the gene ontology. An important finding is that the proposed supervised attribute clustering algorithm is shown to be effective for identifying biologically significant gene clusters with excellent predictive capability.

Its performance in network reconstruction depends on a structure learning algorithm. REVEAL (REVerse Engineering ALgorithm) is one of the algorithms implemented for learning DBN structure and used to reconstruct gene regulatory networks (GRN). However, the two-stage temporal Bayes network (2TBN) structure of DBN that specifies correlation between time slices cannot be obtained by score metrics used in REVEAL. Methods: In this paper, we study a more sophisticated score function for DBN first proposed by Nir Friedman for stationary DBNs structure learning of both initial and transition networks but has not yet been used for reconstruction of GRNs. We implemented Friedman's Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) score function, modified K2 algorithm to learn Dynamic Bayesian Network structure with the score function and tested the performance of the algorithm for GRN reconstruction with synthetic time series gene expression data generated by GeneNetWeaver and real yeast benchmark experiment data. Results: We implemented an algorithm for DBN structure learning with Friedman's score function, tested it on reconstruction of both synthetic networks and real yeast networks and compared it with REVEAL in the absence or presence of preprocessed network generated by Zou&Conzen's algorithm. By introducing a stationary correlation between two consecutive time slices, Friedman's score function showed a higher precision and recall than the naive REVEAL algorithm. Conclusions: Friedman's score metrics for DBN can be used to reconstruct transition networks and has a great potential to improve the accuracy of gene regulatory network structure prediction with time series gene expression datasets.

This method is highly sensitive resulting in overall auto-rater agreement of 93%, comparable to an inter-rater agreement between two human scorers (92%), with high sensitivity and specificity values for wake (94% and 96%), NREM sleep (94% and 97%) and REM sleep (89% and 97%) states. In addition to baseline sleep-wake conditions, the performance of the naive Bayes classifier was assessed in sleep deprivation and drug infusion experiments, as well as in aged and transgenic animals using multiple EEC derivations. 24-h recordings from 30 different animals were used, with approximately 5% of the data manually scored as training data for the classification algorithm.

An Analysis of Argentina's Infamous Decade Using Supervised Machine Learning	POLITICAL ANALYSIS			English	Article							BENFORDS LAW; ELECTORAL FRAUD; DISTRIBUTIONS; CONSEQUENCES; CLASSIFIER; OPTIMALITY; SYSTEMS; BAYES	In this paper, we introduce an innovative method to diagnose electoral fraud using vote counts. Specifically, we use synthetic data to develop and train a fraud detection prototype. We employ a naive Bayes classifier as our learning algorithm and rely on digital analysis to identify the features that are most informative about class distinctions. To evaluate the detection capability of the classifier, we use authentic data drawn from a novel data set of district-level vote counts in the province of Buenos Aires (Argentina) between 1931 and 1941, a period with a checkered history of fraud. Our results corroborate the validity of our approach: The elections considered to be irregular (legitimate) by most historical accounts are unambiguously classified as fraudulent (clean) by the learner. More generally, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of generating and using synthetic data for training and testing an electoral fraud detection system.

SF is an hybrid approach combining some features from both Collaborative (CF) and Content-Based Filtering (CBF). It allows for the use of social networks to personalize and tailor the set of filters that serve as input to the filtering. A comparison is performed against the commonly used Naive Bayes CBF algorithm. Several experiments were held with the well-known Enron data, under both fixed and incremental symbiotic groups. We show that our system is competitive in performance and is robust against both dictionary and focused contamination attacks. Moreover, it can be implemented and deployed with few effort and low communication costs, while assuring privacy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The damage from corrosion can lead to an unexpected plant shutdown and to the exposure of people and the environment to chemicals. Due to changes within and on the surface of materials subjected to corrosion, energy is released in the form of acoustic waves. This acoustic activity can be captured and used for corrosion monitoring in chemical process installations. Wavelet packet coefficients extracted from the acoustic activity have been considered to determine whether corrosion occurs, and to identify the type of corrosion process, at least for the most important corrosion processes in the chemical process industry. Feature subset selection is then applied to these wavelet coefficients to achieve a much higher accuracy in the identification of different corrosion processes than when no feature subset selection is applied to the acoustic waves. However, due to the statistical dependencies that potentially exist between the wavelet coefficients, the latter should not be selected independently from each other. Local discriminant basis selection algorithms do not take the statistical dependencies between wavelet coefficients into account. In this paper, we have used several mutual information-based approaches that take these dependencies into account and compared them to the wavelet-specific local discriminant basis selection algorithm. Furthermore, a hybrid filter-wrapper genetic algorithm, which uses a relevance-redundancy approach as a local search procedure, was designed. The highest classification accuracies are obtained with the hybrid filter-wrapper genetic algorithm, for all classifiers used in this paper. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm easily outperformed one of the most commonly used classifiers in chemometrics: partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). A naive Bayes classifier that uses the features selected by the hybrid filter-wrapper genetic algorithm was able to identify the absence of corrosion, uniform corrosion, pitting and stress corrosion cracking, with an accuracy of up to 87.20%.

Collocation analysis for UMLS knowledge-based word sense disambiguation	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article								Background: The effectiveness of knowledge-based word sense disambiguation (WSD) approaches depends in part on the information available in the reference knowledge resource. Off the shelf, these resources are not optimized for WSD and might lack terms to model the context properly. In addition, they might include noisy terms which contribute to false positives in the disambiguation results. Methods: We analyzed some collocation types which could improve the performance of knowledge-based disambiguation methods. Collocations are obtained by extracting candidate collocations from MEDLINE and then assigning them to one of the senses of an ambiguous word. We performed this assignment either using semantic group profiles or a knowledge-based disambiguation method. In addition to collocations, we used second-order features from a previously implemented approach. Specifically, we measured the effect of these collocations in two knowledge-based WSD methods. The first method, AEC, uses the knowledge from the UMLS to collect examples from MEDLINE which are used to train a Naive Bayes approach. The second method, MRD, builds a profile for each candidate sense based on the UMLS and compares the profile to the context of the ambiguous word. We have used two WSD test sets which contain disambiguation cases which are mapped to UMLS concepts. The first one, the NLM WSD set, was developed manually by several domain experts and contains words with high frequency occurrence in MEDLINE. The second one, the MSH WSD set, was developed automatically using the MeSH indexing in MEDLINE. It contains a larger set of words and covers a larger number of UMLS semantic types. Results: The results indicate an improvement after the use of collocations, although the approaches have different performance depending on the data set. In the NLM WSD set, the improvement is larger for the MRD disambiguation method using second-order features. Assignment of collocations to a candidate sense based on UMLS semantic group profiles is more effective in the AEC method. In the MSH WSD set, the increment in performance is modest for all the methods. Collocations combined with the MRD disambiguation method have the best performance. The MRD disambiguation method and second-order features provide an insignificant change in performance. The AEC disambiguation method gives a modest improvement in performance. Assignment of collocations to a candidate sense based on knowledge-based methods has better performance. Conclusions: Collocations improve the performance of knowledge-based disambiguation methods, although results vary depending on the test set and method used. Generally, the AEC method is sensitive to query drift. Using AEC, just a few selected terms provide a large improvement in disambiguation performance. The MRD method handles noisy terms better but requires a larger set of terms to improve performance.

Statistical modeling for the detection, localization and extraction of text from heterogeneous textual images using combined feature scheme	SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING			English	Article						Text extraction; Non sub sampled Contourlet Transform; Gray level run length matrix; Caption text; Scene text; Document image	CONTOURLET TRANSFORM; CLASSIFICATION; VIDEO	Discriminating between the text and non text regions of an image is a complex and challenging task. In contrast to Caption text, Scene text can have any orientation and may be distorted by the perspective projection. Moreover, it is often affected by variations in scene and camera parameters such as illumination, focus, etc. These variations make the design of unified text extraction from various kinds of images extremely difficult. This paper proposes a statistical unified approach for the extraction of text from hybrid textual images (both Scene text and Caption text in an image) and Document images with variations in text by using carefully selected features with the help of multi level feature priority (MLFP) algorithm. The selected features are combinedly found to be the good choice of feature vectors and have the efficacy to discriminate between text and non text regions for Scene text, Caption text and Document images and the proposed system is robust to illumination, transformation/perspective projection, font size and radially changing/angular text. MLFP feature selection algorithm is evaluated with three common ML algorithms: a decision tree inducer (C4.5), a naive Bayes classifier, and an instance based K-nearest neighbour learner and effectiveness of MLFP is shown by comparing with three feature selection methods with benchmark dataset. The proposed text extraction system is compared with the Edge based method, Connected component method and Texture based method and shown encouraging result and finds its major application in preprocessing for optical character recognition technique and multimedia processing, mobile robot navigation, vehicle license detection and recognition, page segmentation and text-based image indexing, etc.	[Gopalan, Chitrakala] Anna Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Easwari Engn Coll, Madras 600025, Tamil Nadu, India; [Manjula, D.] Anna Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Madras 600025, Tamil Nadu, India	Gopalan, C (reprint author), Anna Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Easwari Engn Coll, Madras 600025, Tamil Nadu, India.	ckgops@gmail.com; manju@annauniv.edu					AHA DW, 1991, MACH LEARN, V6, P37, DOI 10.1023/A:1022689900470; Chen N, 2007, INT J DOC ANAL RECOG, V10, P1, DOI 10.1007/s10032-006-0020-2; da Cunha AL, 2006, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V15, P3089, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2006.877507; Do MN, 2005, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V14, P2091, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2005.859376; Galloway MM, 1975, COMPUTER GRAPHICS IM, V4, P172, DOI DOI 10.1016/S0146-664X(75)80008-6; Gllavata J., 2003, P 3 INT S IM SIGN PR, V2, P611; GNITECKI J, 2001, P 26 C IEEE ENG MED, P3844; Gopalan C, 2008, INT J COMPUT SCI ENG, V2, P202; GUPTA SC, 1970, FUNDAMENTALS MATH ST, pCH2; Guyon I., 2003, Journal of Machine Learning Research, V3, DOI 10.1162/153244303322753616; HARALICK RM, 1973, IEEE T SYST MAN CYB, VSMC3, P610, DOI 10.1109/TSMC.1973.4309314; JEONG KY, 1999, IMAGE PROCESSING, V3, P319; Jiang RJ, 2007, J ZHEJIANG UNIV-SC A, V8, P568, DOI 10.1631/jzus.2007.A0568; John G.

We performed a comparison of somatic, germline, shared (found in both soma and germline) and somatic recurrent mutational spectra for 17 human tumor suppressor genes, which focused upon missense single base-pair substitutions and microdeletions/microinsertions. Somatic and germline mutational spectra were similar in relation to C.G>T.A transitions but differed with respect to the frequency of A.T>G.C, A.T>T.A, and C.G>A.T substitutions. Shared missense mutations were characterized by higher mutability rates, greater physicochemical differences between wild-type and mutant residues, and a tendency to occur in evolutionarily conserved residues and within CpG/CpHpG oligonucleotides. Mononucleotide runs (>= 4 bp) were identified as hotspots for shared microdeletions/microinsertions. Both germline and somatic microdeletions/microinsertions were found to be significantly over-represented within the "indel-hotspot" motif, GTAAGT. Using a naive Bayes' classifier trained to discriminate between five missense mutation groups, 63% of mutations in our dataset were on average correctly recognized. Applying this classifier to an independent dataset of probable driver mutations, we concluded that similar to 50% of these somatic missense mutations possess features consistent with their being either shared or recurrent, suggesting that a disproportionate number of such lesions are likely to be drivers of tumorigenesis.

J	Choi, K; Kim, S				Choi, Kwangmin; Kim, Sun			Building interacting partner predictors using co-varying residue pairs between histidine kinase and response regulator pairs of 48 bacterial two-component systems	PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						two-component systems; mutual information; molecular co-evolution; machine learning	INFORMATION-THEORETIC ANALYSIS; MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENTS; PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION SYSTEMS; RHODOBACTER-SPHAEROIDES; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; CHEMOTAXIS; CHEA; SPECIFICITY; COVARIANCE	The two-component system (TCS) is a signal transduction system that involves a histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR). Although up to hundreds of TCSs may operate in parallel in a bacterial cell, the high-fidelity of a TCS signaling is well maintained, minimizing irrelevant crosstalk between TCSs. When a HK gene and a RR gene in a given TCS system exist in neighboring positions, it is almost certain that their protein products (i.e., HK and RR) are interacting partners. However, large bacterial genomes often have multiple HK genes and/or cognate RR genes that are not neighboring positions. In many partially assembled genomes, some HK genes and RR genes belong to different contigs. In these cases, it is not clear which HK(s) and RR(s) interact. By combining information-theoretic and graph-theoretic approaches, we developed a computational method identifying co-evolving residue pairs between HKs and cognate RRs and predicting the interacting HK: RR pairs for each TCS. In addition, we built a TCSppWWW webserver (http://compath.org/platcom/tcs) that takes query sequences of pairing candidates and predicts their HK: RR pairing using precomputed models. The current release of TCSppWWW provides predictors for 48 TCSs using over 20,000 protein sequences from about 900 bacterial genomes. Three different types of predictors using Random Forest, RBF Network, and Naive Bayes are provided. Once a set of HK and RR candidate sequences are submitted, TCSppWWW aligns query sequences to the precomputed multiple sequence alignment of HK: RR pairs, extracts co-evolving column positions, then returns prediction results with prediction margin and additional information.

J	Dash, SK; Reddy, KS; Pujari, AK				Dash, Subrat Kumar; Reddy, Krupa Sagar; Pujari, Arun K.			Adaptive Naive Bayes method for masquerade detection	SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS			English	Article						intrusion detection; masquerade detection; adaptive Naive Bayes; deferred detection; machine learning	INTRUSION DETECTION; COMPUTER INTRUSION; UNIX COMMANDS; MODEL	Recently, researchers have proposed efficient detection mechanisms for masquerade attacks. Most of these techniques use machine learning methods to learn the behavioral patterns of users and to check if an observed behavior conforms to the learnt behavior of a user. Masquerade attack is detected when the observed behavior, reportedly of a specific user, does not match with the learnt pattern of this user's past data. A major shortcoming in this process is that the user may legitimately deviate temporarily from its past behavior. If the deviation is large and near-permanent, it is desirable that such deviations are captured in a detection mechanism. We propose, in this paper, a method that takes into consideration this aspect of user behavior while detecting masquerade attacks. Our scheme is based on the premise that the commands used by a legitimate user or an attacker may differ from the trained signature. But the deviation of the legitimate user is momentary whereas that of an attacker persists longer. By introducing this novel concept in the detection mechanism, the performance improves.

Improving the performance of Naive Bayes multinomial in e-mail foldering by introducing distribution-based balance of datasets	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						E-mail foldering; Text categorization; Imbalanced data; Naive Bayes multinomial; Classification	TEXT CLASSIFICATION	E-mail foldering or e-mail classification into user predefined folders can be viewed as a text classification/categorization problem. However, it has some intrinsic properties that make it more difficult to deal with, mainly the large cardinality of the class variable (i.e. the number of folders), the different number of e-mails per class state and the fact that this is a dynamic problem, in the sense that e-mails arrive in our mail-folders following a time-line. Perhaps because of these problems, standard text-oriented classifiers such as Naive Bayes Multinomial do no obtain a good accuracy when applied to e-mail corpora. In this paper, we identify the imbalance among classes/folders as the main problem, and propose a new method based on learning and sampling probability distributions. Our experiments over a standard corpus (ENRON) with seven datasets (e-mail users) show that the results obtained by Naive Bayes Multinomial significantly improve when applying the balancing algorithm first. For the sake of completeness in our experimental study we also compare this with another standard balancing method (SMOTE) and classifiers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Chandra, B; Gupta, M				Chandra, B.; Gupta, Manish			Robust approach for estimating probabilities in Naive-Bayes Classifier for gene expression data	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Classification; Naive-Bayes; Gene expression data	MICROARRAY DATA; CANCER; ALGORITHMS	Naive-Bayes Classifier (NBC) is widely used for classification in machine learning. It is considered as the first choice for many classification problems because of its simplicity and classification accuracy as compared to other supervised learning methods. However, for high dimensional data like gene expression data, it does not perform well due to two major limitations i.e. underflow and overfitting. In order to address the problem of underflow, the existing approach adopted is to add the logarithms of probabilities rather than multiplying probabilities and the estimate approach is used for providing solution to overfitting problem. However, in practice for gene expression data, these approaches do not perform well. In this paper, a novel approach has been proposed to overcome the limitations using a robust function for estimating probabilities in Naive-Bayes Classifier. The proposed method not only resolves the limitation of NBC but also improves the classification accuracy for gene expression data. The method has been tested over several benchmark gene expression datasets of high dimension. Comparative results of proposed Robust Naive-Bayes Classifier (R-NBC) and existing NBC for gene expression data have also been illustrated to highlight the effectiveness of the R-NBC. Simulation study has also been performed to depict the robustness of the R-NBC over the existing approaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As such, there is an increasing demand to develop and adapt cheminformatics algorithms and tools in order to predict molecular and pharmacological properties on the basis of these large data sets. In this manuscript, we report a novel machine-learning-based ligand classification algorithm, named Ligand Classifier of Adaptively Boosting Ensemble Decision Stumps (LiCABEDS), for data-mining and modeling of large chemical data sets to predict pharmacological properties in an efficient and accurate manner. The performance of LiCABEDS was evaluated through predicting GPCR ligand functionality (agonist or antagonist) using four different molecular fingerprints, including Maccs, FP2, Unity, and Molprint 2D fingerprints. Our studies showed that LiCABEDS outperformed two other popular techniques, classification tree and Naive Bayes classifier, on all four types of molecular fingerprints. Parameters in LiCABEDS, including the number of boosting iterations, initialization condition, and a "reject option" boundary, were thoroughly explored and discussed to demonstrate the capability of handling imbalanced data sets, as well as its robustness and flexibility. In addition, the detailed mathematical concepts and theory are also given to address the principle behind statistical prediction models. The LiCABEDS algorithm has been implemented into a user-friendly software package that is accessible online at http://www.cbligand.org/LiCABEDS/.

Machine Learning Methods Predict Locomotor Response to MK-801 in Mouse Models of Down Syndrome	JOURNAL OF NEUROGENETICS			English	Article						behavior prediction; Down syndrome; Naive Bayes; Ts1Cje; Ts65Dn	DENDRITIC SPINE DEVELOPMENT; EXCHANGE FACTOR TIAM1; HUMAN-CHROMOSOME-21; PHOSPHORYLATION; NETWORKS; TS65DN; PROTEINS; KINASE; RAC1	Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy of human chromosome 21 (HSA21), is a common genetic cause of cognitive impairment. This disorder results from the overexpression of HSA21 genes and the resulting perturbations in many molecular pathways and cellular processes. Knowledge-based identification of targets for pharmacotherapies will require defining the most critical protein abnormalities among these many perturbations. Here the authors show that using the Ts65Dn and Ts1Cje mouse models of DS, which are trisomic for 88 and 69 reference protein coding genes, respectively, a simple linear Naive Bayes classifier successfully predicts behavioral outcome (level of locomotor activity) in response to treatment with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801. Input to the Naive Bayes method were simple protein profiles generated from cortex and output was locomotor activity binned into three levels: low, medium, and high. When Feature Selection was used with the Naive Bayes method, levels of three HSA21 and two non-HSA21 protein features were identified as making the most significant contributions to activity level. Using these five features, accuracies of up to 88% in prediction of locomotor activity were achieved. These predictions depend not only on genotype-specific differences but also on within-genotype individual variation in levels of molecular and behavioral parameters. With judicious choice of pathways and components, a similar approach may be useful in analysis of more complex behaviors, including those associated with learning and memory, and may facilitate identification of novel targets for pharmacotherapeutics.

In this paper, we proposed a novel algorithm called FFDC, which chooses Naive Bayes as the underlying supervised learner in the semi-supervised learning framework. Based on the conditional independence assumption of Naive Bayes, the information gain of Information theory is redefined to quantitatively measure the information implicated in unlabeled data. And functional dependency rules of probability are deduced based on Armstrong's axioms, which can be used to find and delete redundant attributes. Thus the computational complexity while modeling will be reduced exponentially. Empirical studies on a set of natural domains show that FFDC has clear advantages with respect to generalization and probabilistic performance.

For instance, in text classification and information retrieval problems, we have large collections of documents. Each text is usually represented by a bag-of-words or similar representation, with a large number of features (terms). Many of these features may be irrelevant (or even detrimental) for the learning tasks. This excessive number of features carries the problem of memory usage in order to represent and deal with these collections, clearly showing the need for adequate techniques for feature representation, reduction, and selection, to both improve the classification accuracy and the memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a combined unsupervised feature discretization and feature selection technique. The experimental results on standard datasets show the efficiency of the proposed techniques as well as improvement over previous similar techniques.

Active learning using a Variational Dirichlet Process model for pre-clustering and classification of underwater stereo imagery	2011 IEEE/RSJ INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND SYSTEMS	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	SEP 25-30, 2011	San Francisco, CA	IEEE, Robot Soc Japan (RSJ), BOSCH, HONDA, KUKA, SRI Int, ABB, Willow Garage, ALDEBARAN, Google, INTUITIVE Surg, SCHUNK, IEEE Ind Elect Soc (IES), Soc Instrument & Control Engineers (SICE), New Technol Fdn (NTF), IEEE Robot & Automat Soc (RAS), Inst Control, Robto & Syst (ICROS)			SURFACE-TOPOGRAPHY; SCALE	This paper demonstrates an implementation of pool-based active learning through uncertainty sampling using a Variational Dirichlet Process (VDP) model. The VDP is used for both pre-clustering and classification, and is extended to incorporate fixed labels from an oracle (human annotator). Three different uncertainty sampling techniques are explored least confident sampling, margin sampling and entropy based sampling. Clustering with the VDP is done in a completely unsupervised manner, without the need to specify the number of clusters. This appears particularly useful in improving the results when there are only few labelled samples, or if the cost of labelling is high. Results are shown for a toy dataset and the performance is compared to similar implementations using an Expectation Maximisation model (EM) and a Naive Bayes classifier (NB). The VDP active learning framework is tested on a stereo image dataset obtained by an autonomous underwater vehicle that covers several linear kilometres and consists of thousands of stereo image pairs. Our results show that combining an active learning strategy with the VDP significantly reduces the number of labelled images required to achieve a desired level of accuracy.

In this system, four sensors are attached to the waist, chest, thigh, and side of the body. In the study we present two solutions for factors that affect the activity recognition accuracy: the calibration drift and the sensor orientation changing. The datasets used to evaluate this system were collected from 8 subjects who were asked to perform 8 scripted normal activities of daily living (ADL), three times each. The Naive Bayes classifier using multi-sensor fusion is adopted and achieves 70.88%-97.66% recognition accuracies for 1-4 sensors.

Our method is based on three steps : 1) We automatically label the five lumbar intervertebral discs in a sagittal MRI slice using a probabilistic model and then extract an ROI for each disc using an Active Shape Model. 2) We generate relevant intensity and texture features from each disc ROI. 3) We construct five different classifiers ( SVM, PCA+LDA, PCA+Naive Bayes, PCA+QDA, PCA+SVM) and combine them in a majority voting scheme. We perform 5-fold cross-validation experiments and achieve an accuracy of 94.85%, specificity of 95.9% and sensitivity of 92.45% for 35 clinical cases i.e. a total of 175 lumbar intervertebral discs.

As a precious outcome, a successful segmentation may lead to the improvement of automatic screening systems. Namely, the detection of the vessels helps the localization of other anatomical parts and lesions besides the vascular disorders. In this paper, we recommend a novel approach for the segmentation of the vascular system in retina images, based on Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF). We extend the optimization problem of HMRF models considering the tangent vector field of the image to enhance the connectivity of the vascular system consisting of elongated structures. To enhance the probability estimation during the solution of the Hidden Markov problem, the Averaged One-Dependence Estimator (AODE) is used instead of the commonly used naive Bayes estimators, since AODE uses a weaker assumption than total independence of features. The advantages of our method is discussed through a quantitative analysis on a publicly available database.

Consequently, tool support for the person reporting the bug in the form of a recommender or verification system is desirable. In previous work we made a first step towards such a tool: we demonstrated that text mining can predict the severity of a given bug report with a reasonable accuracy given a training set of sufficient size. In this paper we report on a follow-up study where we compare four well-known text mining algorithms (namely, Naive Bayes, Naive Bayes Multinomial, K-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machines) with respect to accuracy and training set size. We discovered that for the cases under investigation (two open source systems: Eclipse and GNOME) Naive Bayes Multinomial performs superior compared to the other proposed algorithms.

Classification of Postural Profiles among Mouth-breathing Children by Learning Vector Quantization	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Neural networks (computer); clinical decision support systems; posture and mouth breathing	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; CHEST-WALL; ALGORITHMS; DIAGNOSIS	Background: Mouth breathing is a chronic syndrome that may bring about postural changes. Finding characteristic patterns of changes occurring in the complex musculoskeletal system of mouth-breathing children has been a challenge. Learning vector quantization (LVQ) is an artificial neural network model that can be applied for this purpose. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to apply LVQ to determine the characteristic postural profiles shown by mouth-breathing children, in order to further understand abnormal posture among mouth breathers. Methods: Postural training data on 52 children (30 mouth breathers and 22 nose breathers) and postural validation data on 32 children (22 mouth breathers and 10 nose breathers) were used. The performance of LVQ and other classification models was compared in relation to self-organizing maps, back-propagation applied to multilayer perceptrons, Bayesian networks, naive Bayes, 148 decision trees, k*, and k-nearest-neighbor classifiers. Classifier accuracy was assessed by means of leave-one-out cross-validation, area under ROC curve (AUC), and inter-rater agreement (Kappa statistics). Results: By using the LVQ model, five postural profiles for mouth-breathing children could be determined. LVQ showed satisfactory results for mouth-breathing and nose-breathing classification: sensitivity and specificity rates of 0.90 and 0.95, respectively, when using the training dataset, and 0.95 and 0.90, respectively, when using the validation dataset. Conclusions: The five postural profiles for mouth-breathing children suggested by LVQ were incorporated into application software for classifying the severity of mouth breathers' abnormal posture.

This project aims to help patients with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy achieve and maintain good blood glucose control. Over the course of seven years and three clinical research studies, a series of defining cases altered the research and development path. Each of these cases suggested a new, unanticipated research direction or clinical application. New AI technologies, including naive Bayes classification and support vector regression, were incorporated. New medical research into glycemic variability and blood glucose prediction was undertaken. The CBR research paradigm has provided a strong framework for medical research as well as for artificial intelligence (AI) research. This new work has the potential to positively impact the health and wellbeing of patients with diabetes. This paper shares the 4DSS project experience.

J	Paoin, W				Paoin, W.			Lessons Learned from Data Mining of WHO Mortality Database	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Mortality statistics; data mining; classification; clustering; association analysis	CONVERGENCE; DIVERGENCE; SET	Objectives: The objectives of this research were to test the ability of classification algorithms to predict the cause of death in the mortality data with unknown causes, to find association between common causes of death, to identify groups of countries based on their common causes of death, and to extract knowledge gained from data mining of the World Health Organization mortality database. Methods: The WEKA software version 3.5.3 was used for classification, clustering and association analysis of the World Health Organization mortality database which contained 1,109,537 records. Three major steps were performed: Step 1 - preprocessing of data to convert all records into suitable formats for each type of analysis algorithm; Step 2 - analyzing data using the C4.5 decision tree and Naive Bayes classification algorithm, K-means clustering algorithm and Apriori association analysis algorithm; Step 3 - interpretation of results and hypothesis testing after clustering analysis. Results: Using a C4.5 decision tree classifier to predict cause of death, we obtained 440 leaf nodes that correctly classify death instances with an accuracy of 40.06%. Naive Bayes classification algorithm calculated probability of death from each disease that correctly classify death instances with an accuracy of 28.13%. K means clustering divided the data into four clusters with 189, 59, 65, 144 country-years in each cluster. A Chi-square was used to test discriminate disease differences found in each cluster which had different diseases as predominant causes of death. Apriori association analysis produced association rules of linkage among cancer of the lung, hypertension and cerebrovascular diseases. These were found in the top five leading causes of death with 99-100% confidence level. Conclusion: Classification tools produced the poorest results in predicting cause of death. Given the inadequacy of variables in the WHO database, creation of a classification model to predict specific cause of death was impossible. Clustering and association tools yielded interesting results that could be used to identify new areas of interest in mortality data analysis. This can be used in data mining analysis to help solve some quality problems in mortality data.

The former are often characterized by locally discriminative texture cues (e.g., instances with prominent brand names and logos), and the latter by salient global shape properties (plates, bowls, pots). We describe experiments with both types of cues, combining a template-and-deformable-parts detector to capture overall shape properties with a local feature Naive-Bayes nearest neighbor model to capture local texture properties. We base our implementation on the recently introduced Kinect sensor, which provides reliable depth estimates of indoor scenes. Depth cues provide segmentation and size constraints to our method. Depth affinity is used to modify the appearance term in a segmentation-based proposal step, and size priors are imposed on object classes to prune false positives. We address the complexity of scanning window HOG search using multi-class pruning schemes, first applying a generic object detection scheme to prune unlikely windows, and then focusing only on the most likely class per remaining window. Our method is able to handle relatively cluttered scenes involving multiple objects with varying levels of surface texture, and can efficiently employ multi-class scanning window search.

Distributed Classification for Pocket Data Mining	FOUNDATIONS OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	19th International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems (ISMIS)	JUN 28-30, 2011	Warsaw, POLAND		Warsaw Univ Technol, Inst Comp Sci			Distributed and collaborative data stream mining in a mobile computing environment is referred to as Pocket Data Mining PDM. Large amounts of available data streams to which smart phones can subscribe to or sense, coupled with the increasing computational power of handheld devices motivates the development of PDM as a decision making system. This emerging area of study has shown to be feasible in an earlier study using technological enablers of mobile software agents and stream mining techniques [1]. A typical PDM process would start by having mobile agents roam the network to discover relevant data streams and resources. Then other (mobile) agents encapsulating stream mining techniques visit the relevant nodes in the network in order to build evolving data mining models. Finally, a third type of mobile agents roam the network consulting the mining agents for a final collaborative decision, when required by one or more users. In this paper, we propose the use of distributed Hoeffding trees and Naive Bayes classifiers in the PDM framework over vertically partitioned data streams. Mobile policing, health monitoring and stock market analysis are among the possible applications of PDM. An extensive experimental study is reported showing the effectiveness of the collaborative data mining with the two classifiers.

Four human subjects undergoing presurgical brain mapping and seizure foci localization participated in this study. Electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals were recorded while the subjects performed simple language tasks involving semantic information processing, such as a picture naming task where subjects named pictures of objects belonging to different semantic categories. Robust high-gamma band (60-120Hz) activation was observed at the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and the posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) with a temporal sequence corresponding to speech production and perception. Furthermore, Gaussian Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine classifiers, two commonly used machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition, were able to predict the semantic category of an object using cortical activity captured by ECoG electrodes covering the frontal, temporal and parietal cortices. These findings have implications for both basic neuroscience research and development of semantic-based brain-computer interface systems (BCI) that can help individuals with severe motor or communication disorders to express their intention and thoughts.

J	Yang, QL; Shao, JM; Scholz, M; Plant, C				Yang, Qinli; Shao, Junming; Scholz, Miklas; Plant, Claudia			Feature selection methods for characterizing and classifying adaptive Sustainable Flood Retention Basins	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Sustainable flood risk management; Flood control; Classification; Information gain; Mutual information; Relief	MUTUAL INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION	The European Union's Flood Directive 2007/60/EC requires member states to produce flood risk maps for all river basins and coastal areas at risk of flooding by 2013. As a result, flood risk assessments have become an urgent challenge requiring a range of rapid and effective tools and approaches. The Sustainable Flood Retention Basin (SFRB) concept has evolved to provide a rapid assessment technique for impoundments, which have a pre-defined or potential role in flood defense and diffuse pollution control. A previous version of the SFRB survey method developed by the co-author Scholz in 2006 recommends gathering of over 40 variables to characterize an SERB. Collecting all these variables is relatively time-consuming and more importantly, these variables are often correlated with each other. Therefore, the objective is to explore the correlation among these variables and find the most important variables to represent an SFRB. Three feature selection techniques (Information Gain, Mutual Information and Relief) were applied on the SFRB data set to identify the importance of the variables in terms of classification accuracy. Four benchmark classifiers (Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbours, C4.5 Decision Tree and Naive Bayes) were subsequently used to verify the effectiveness of the classification with the selected variables and automatically identify the optimal number of variables. Experimental results indicate that our proposed approach provides a simple, rapid and effective framework for variable selection and SFRB classification. Only nine important variables are sufficient to accurately classify SFRB. Finally, six typical cases were studied to verify the performance of the identified nine variables on different SFRB types. The findings provide a rapid scientific tool for SFRB assessment in practice. Moreover, the generic value of this tool allows also for its wide application in other areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Fan, LW; Poh, KL; Zhou, P				Fan, Liwei; Poh, Kim-Leng; Zhou, Peng			Partition-conditional ICA for Bayesian classification of microarray data	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Independent component analysis; Microarray data; Naive Bayes; Feature extraction; Mutual information	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ECG BEAT CLASSIFICATION; NAIVE BAYES; FEATURE-SELECTION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; EXPRESSION DATA	Accurate classification of microarray data is very important for medical decision making. Past studies have shown that class-conditional independent component analysis (CC-ICA) is capable of improving the performance of naive Bayes classifier in microarray data analysis. However, when a microarray dataset has a small number of samples for some classes, the application of CC-ICA may become infeasible. This paper extends CC-ICA and proposes a partition-conditional independent component analysis (PC-ICA) method for naive Bayes classification of microarray data. Compared to ICA and CC-ICA, PC-ICA represents an in-between concept for feature extraction. Our experimental results on two microarray datasets show that PC-ICA is more effective than ICA in improving the performance of naive Bayes classification of microarray data. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ordonez, C				Ordonez, Carlos			Statistical Model Computation with UDFs	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						DBMS; SQL; statistical model; UDF	RELATIONAL DBMS; DATABASES; SQL	Statistical models are generally computed outside a DBMS due to their mathematical complexity. We introduce techniques to efficiently compute fundamental statistical models inside a DBMS exploiting User-Defined Functions (UDFs). Specifically, we study the computation of linear regression, PCA, clustering, and Naive Bayes. Two summary matrices on the data set are mathematically shown to be essential for all models: the linear sum of points and the quadratic sum of cross products of points. We consider two layouts for the input data set: horizontal and vertical. We first introduce efficient SQL queries to compute summary matrices and score the data set. Based on the SQL framework, we introduce UDFs that work in a single table scan: aggregate UDFs to compute summary matrices for all models and a set of primitive scalar UDFs to score data sets. Experiments compare UDFs and SQL queries (running inside the DBMS) with C++ (analyzing exported files). In general, UDFs are faster than SQL queries and not much slower than C++. Considering export times, C++ is slower than UDFs and SQL queries. Statistical models based on precomputed summary matrices are computed in a few seconds. UDFs scale linearly and only require one table scan, highlighting their efficiency.

Aligned octapeptide substrates of 498 proteases taken from the MEROPS peptidase database were used for the in silica analysis. A multiple-category naive Bayes model, trained on the two-dimensional chemical features of the substrates, was able to classify the substrates of 365 (73%) proteases and elucidate statistically significant chemical features for each of their specific substrate positions. The positional awareness of the method allows us to identify the most similar substrate positions between proteases. Our analysis reveals that proteases from different families, based on the traditional classification (aspartic, cysteine, serine, and metallo), could have substrates that differ at the cleavage site (P1-P1') but are similar away from it. Caspase-3 (cysteine protease) and granzyme B (serine protease) are previously known examples of cross-family neighbors identified by this method. To assess whether peptide substrate similarity between unrelated proteases could reliably translate into the discovery of low molecular weight synthetic inhibitors, a lead discovery strategy was tested on two other cross-family neighbors-namely cathepsin L2 and matrix metallo proteinase 9, and calpain 1 and pepsin A. For both these pairs, a naive Bayes classifier model trained on inhibitors of one protease could successfully enrich those of its neighbor from a different family and vice versa, indicating that this approach could be prospectively applied to lead discovery for a novel protease target with no known synthetic inhibitors.

This has led to the application of many well-established supervised learning (SL) algorithms in an attempt to provide more accurate and automatic diagnosis class (cancer/non cancer) prediction. Virtually all research on SL addresses the task of learning to classify complete domain instances. However, in some research situations we often have to classify instances given incomplete vectors, which can affect the predictive accuracy of learned classifiers. The task of learning an accurate incomplete data classifier from instances raises a number of new issues some of which have not been properly addressed by bioinformatics research. Thus, an effective missing value estimation method is required for improving predictive accuracy. Results: The essence of the approach is the proposal that prediction using supervised learning can be improved in probabilistic terms given incomplete microarray data. This imputation approach is based on the a priori probability of each value determined from the instances at that node of a decision tree (PDT) that have specified values. The proposed approach exploits the total probability and Bayes' theorems and it has three versions. We evaluate our approach with other supervised learning techniques including C5.0, classification and regression trees (CART), k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), linear discrimination (LD) naive Bayes classifier (NBC), Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER) and support vector machines (SVMs), from the point of view of their effect or tolerance of incomplete test data. Eight cancer related gene expression datasets are utilized for this task. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the efficiency and the robustness of the proposed algorithm.

J	Markley, SC; Miller, DJ				Markley, Scott C.; Miller, David J.			Joint Parsimonious Modeling and Model Order Selection for Multivariate Gaussian Mixtures	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Bayesian information criterion (BIC); generalized Expectation-maximization (GEM) algorithm; Multivariate Gaussian mixture model (GMM); unsupervised learning	EM ALGORITHM; ANALYZERS	Multivariate Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are widely for density estimation, model-based data clustering, and statistical classification. A difficult problem is estimating the model order, i.e., the number of mixture components, and model structure. Use of full covariance matrices, with number of parameters quadratic in the feature dimension, entails high model complexity, and thus may underestimate order, while naive Bayes mixtures may introduce model bias and lead to order overestimates. We develop a parsimonious modeling and model order and structure selection method for GMMs which allows for and optimizes over parameter tying configurations across mixture components applied to each individual parameter, including the covariates. We derive a generalized Expectation-Maximization algorithm for [(Bayesian information criterion (BIC)-based] penalized likelihood minimization. This, coupled with sequential model order reduction, forms our joint learning and model selection. Our method searches over a rich space of models and, consistent with minimizing BIC, achieves fine-grained matching of model complexity to the available data. We have found our method to be effective and largely robust in learning accurate model orders and parameter-tying structures for simulated ground-truth mixtures. We compared against naive Bayes and standard full-covariance GMMs for several criteria: 1) model order and structure accuracy (for synthetic data sets); 2) test set log-likelihood; 3) unsupervised classification accuracy; and 4) accuracy when class-conditional mixtures are used in a plug-in Bayes classifier. Our method, which chooses model orders intermediate between standard and naive Bayes GMMs, gives improved accuracy with respect to each of these performance measures.

However, these estimates are usually modified by application of a heuristic parameter smoothing technique to avoid (over-fitted) null estimates. In this work, we advocate the reduction of the parameter domain instead of parameter smoothing. This leads to a constrained domain maximum likelihood estimation problem for which we provide an iterative algorithm that solves it optimally.

The number of every text feature in the source code of a module is counted and used as data for training detection models. In this paper, we prepared a naive Bayes classifier and a logistic regression model as detection models. To show the effectiveness of our approaches, we conducted experiments with five open source projects and compared them with a well-known metrics set, thereby achieving higher detection results. The results imply that large-scale text features are useful in constructing practical detection models, and measuring sophisticated metrics is not always necessary for detecting fault-prone modules.

First, eight directional search was applied in order to extract regions of interests (ROIs). Then, 3D feature extraction was performed which includes 3D connected component labeling, straightness calculation, thickness calculation, determining the middle slice, vertical and horizontal widths calculation, regularity calculation, and calculation of vertical and horizontal black pixel ratios. To make a decision for each ROI, feed forward neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM), na < ve Bayes (NB) and logistic regression (LR) methods were used. These methods were trained and tested via k-fold cross validation, and results were compared. To test the performance of the proposed system, 11 cases, which were taken from Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) dataset, were used. ROC curves were given for all methods and 100% detection sensitivity was reached except na < ve Bayes.

We use mixtures of truncated exponentials (MTEs) to represent the joint distribution in the induced networks. We consider two particular Bayesian network structures, the so-called naive Bayes and TAN, which have been successfully used as regression models when learning from complete data. We propose an iterative procedure for inducing the models, based on a variation of the data augmentation method in which the missing values of the explanatory variables are filled by simulating from their posterior distributions, while the missing values of the response variable are generated using the conditional expectation of the response given the explanatory variables. We also consider the refinement of the regression models by using variable selection and bias reduction. We illustrate through a set of experiments with various databases the performance of the proposed algorithms.

J	Liang, H; Yan, YH; Zhang, H				Liang, Han; Yan, Yuhong; Zhang, Harry			LEARNING DECISION TREES WITH LOG CONDITIONAL LIKELIHOOD	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Classification; log conditional likelihood; probability estimation tree; discriminative learning; AUC		In machine learning and data mining, traditional learning models aim for high classification accuracy. However, accurate class probability prediction is more desirable than classification accuracy in many practical applications, such as medical diagnosis. Although it is known that decision trees can be adapted to be class probability estimators in a variety of approaches, and the resulting models are uniformly called Probability Estimation Trees (PETs), the performances of these PETs in class probability estimation, have not yet been investigated. We begin our research by empirically studying PETs in terms of class probability estimation, measured by Log Conditional Likelihood (LCL). We also compare a PET called C4.4 with other representative models, including Naive Bayes, Naive Bayes Tree, Bayesian Network, KNN and SVM, in LCL. From our experiments, we draw several valuable conclusions. First, among various tree-based models, C4.4 is the best in yielding precise class probability prediction measured by LCL. We provide an explanation for this and reveal the nature of LCL. Second, compared with non tree-based models, C4.4 also performs best. Finally, LCL does not dominate another well-established relevant metric-AUC, which suggests that different decision-tree learning models should be used for different objectives. Our experiments are conducted on the basis of 36 UCI sample sets. We run all the models within a machine learning platform-Weka. We also explore an approach to improve the class probability estimation of Naive Bayes Tree. We propose a greedy and recursive learning algorithm, where at each step, LCL is used as the scoring function to expand the decision tree. The algorithm uses Naive Bayes created at leaves to estimate class probabilities of test samples. The whole tree encodes the posterior class probability in its structure. One benefit of improving class probability estimation is that both classification accuracy and AUC can be possibly scaled up. We call the new model LCL Tree (LCLT). Our experiments on 33 UCI sample sets show that LCLT outperforms all state-of-the-art learning models, such as Naive Bayes Tree, significantly in accurate class probability prediction measured by LCL, as well as in classification accuracy and AUC.

The environment may change over time due to some contextual or definitional changes. The environment may change with location. It would be surprising if the performance of common classifiers did not degrade with these changes. The question, we address here, is whether or not some types of classifier are inherently more immune than others to these effects. In this study, we simulate the changing of environment by reducing the influence on the class of the most significant attributes. Based on our analysis, K-Nearest Neighbor and Artificial Neural Networks are the most robust learners, ensemble algorithms are somewhat robust, whereas Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and particularly Decision Trees are the most affected.

This work also aims to optimize the EEG signal analysis through the improvement of classifiers and, eventually, of the BCI performance. In this paper a novel exploratory approach for data mining of EEG signal based on continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) and wavelet coherence (WC) statistical analysis is introduced and applied. The CWT allows the representation of time-frequency patterns of the signal's information content by WC qualiatative analysis. Results suggest that the proposed methodology is capable of identifying regions in time-frequency spectrum during the specified task of BCI. Furthermore, an example of a region is identified, and the patterns are classified using a Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC). This innovative characteristic of the process justifies the feasibility of the proposed approach to other data mining applications.

In this paper we compare the effectiveness of two GP classification strategies. The first uses the standard (zero) class-threshold, while the second uses the "best" class-threshold determined dynamically on a solution-by-solution basis during evolution. These two strategies are evaluated using five different GP fitness across across a range of binary class imbalance problems, and the GP approaches are compared to other popular learning algorithms, namely, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines. Our results suggest that there is no overall difference between the two strategies, and that both strategies can evolve good solutions in binary classification when used in combination with an effective fitness function.

To date a number of recommendation algorithms have been proposed, where collaborative filtering and content-based filtering are the two most famous and adopted recommendation techniques. Collaborative filtering recommender systems recommend items by identifying other users with similar taste and use their opinions for recommendation; whereas content-based recommender systems recommend items based on the content information of the items. These systems suffer from scalability, data sparsity, over specialization, and cold-start problems resulting in poor quality recommendations and reduced coverage. Hybrid recommender systems combine individual systems to avoid certain aforementioned limitations of these systems. In this paper, we proposed a unique switching hybrid recommendation approach by combining a Naive Bayes classification approach with the collaborative filtering. Experimental results on two different data sets, show that the proposed algorithm is scalable and provide better performance in terms of accuracy and coverage than other algorithms while at the same time eliminates some recorded problems with the recommender systems.

This paper shows the applicability of naive Bayesian classifiers to two major problems in intrusion detection: the detection of elementary attacks and the detection of coordinated ones. We propose two models starting with stating the problems and defining the variables necessary for model building using naive Bayesian networks. In addition to the fact that the construction of such models is simple and efficient, the performance of naive Bayesian networks on a representative data is competing with the most efficient state of the art classification tools. We show how the decision rules used in naive Bayesian classifiers can be improved to detect new attacks and new anomalous activities. We experimentally show the effectiveness of these improvements on a recent Web-based traffic. Finally, we propose a naive Bayesian network-based approach especially designed to detect coordinated attacks and provide experimental results showing the effectiveness of this approach.

J	Kovacevic, A; Devedzic, V; Pocajt, V				Kovacevic, Ana; Devedzic, Vladan; Pocajt, Viktor			Using data mining to improve digital library services	ELECTRONIC LIBRARY			English	Article						Digital libraries; Databases; Serbia; Data handling; Service delivery	RECOMMENDATION	Purpose This paper aims to propose a solution for recommending digital library services based on data mining techniques (clustering and predictive classification). Design/methodology/approach - Data mining techniques are used to recommend digital library services based on the user's profile and search history. First, similar users were clustered together, based on their profiles and search behavior. Then predictive classification for recommending appropriate services to them was used. It has been shown that users in the same cluster have a high probability of accepting similar services or their patterns. Findings - The results indicate that k-means clustering and Naive Bayes classification may be used to improve the accuracy of service recommendation. The overall accuracy is satisfying, while average accuracy depends on the specific service. The results were better for frequently occurring services. Research limitations/implications - Datasets were used from the KOBSON digital library. Only clustering and predictive classification was applied. If the correlation between the service and the institution were higher, it would have better accuracy. Originality/value - The paper applied different and efficient data mining techniques for clustering digital library users based on their profiles and their search behavior, i.e. users' interaction with library services, and obtain user patterns with respect to the library services they use. A digital library may apply this approach to offer appropriate services to new users more easily. The recommendations will be based on library items that similar users have already found useful.

We propose an coarse indoor localization approach that exploits the ubiquity of smart phones with embedded sensors. GPS is used to find the building in which the user is present. The Accelerometers are used to recognize the user's dynamic activities (going up or down stairs or an elevator) to determine his/her location within the building. We demonstrate the ability to estimate the floor-level of a user. We compare two techniques for activity classification, one is naive Bayes classifier and the other is based on dynamic time warping.

Rather than relying on elementary measurements or a fixed set of moments, the SDE measures global distribution information and, as such, has more discriminative power in classifying distributions. Based on functional images, which are subject to noise and segmentation inaccuracies, heart wall motion analysis is acknowledged as a difficult problem and, therefore, incorporation of prior knowledge is desirable to enhance the accuracy. Given noisy data and nonlinear dynamic model to describe the myocardial motion, unscented Kalman filter, a recursive nonlinear Bayesian filter, is devised in this study so as to estimate LV cavity points. Subsequently, a naive Bayes classifier algorithm is constructed from the SDEs of different features in order to automatically detect abnormal functional regions of the myocardium. Using 90x20 segmented LV cavities of short-axis magnetic resonance images obtained from 30 subjects, the experimental analysis carried over 480 myocardial segments demonstrates that the proposed method perform significantly better than other recent methods, and can lead to a promising diagnostic support tool to assist clinicians.

WIL aims at fostering learning at the workplace, during work, for enhancing task performance. A key challenge for enabling task-specific, contextualized, personalized learning and work support is to automatically detect the user's task. In this paper we utilize our ontology-based user task detection approach for studying the factors influencing task detection performance. We describe three laboratory experiments we have performed in two domains including over 40 users and more than 500 recorded task executions. The insights gained from our evaluation are: (i) the J48 decision tree and Naive Bayes classifiers perform best, (ii) six features can be isolated, which provide good classification accuracy, (iii) knowledge-intensive tasks can be classified as well as routine tasks and (iv) a classifier trained by experts on standardized tasks can be used to classify users' personal tasks.

In the beginning, a sequence of temporal silhouettes of the moving human body parts are extracted from a video clip (i.e., an action snippet). Next, each action snippet is temporally split into several time-slices represented by fuzzy intervals. As shape features, a variety of descriptors both boundary-based (Fourier descriptors, Curvature features) and region-based (Moments. Moment-based features) are then extracted from the silhouettes at each time-slice. Finally, an NB (Naive Bayes) classifier is learned in the feature space for activity classification. The performance of the method was evaluated on the KTH dataset and the obtained results are quite encouraging and show that an accuracy on par with or exceeding that of existing methods is achievable. Further the simplicity and computational efficiency of the features employed allow the method to achieve real-time performance, and thus it can provide latency guarantees to real-time applications.

It usually employs a supervised learning strategy, where we first build a classification model using pre-classified documents and then use this model to classify unseen documents. The majority of supervised algorithms consider that all documents provide equally important information. However, in practice, a document may be considered more or less important to build the classification model according to several factors, such as its timeliness, the venue where it was published in, its authors, among others. In this paper, we are particularly concerned with the impact that temporal effects may have on ADC and how to minimize such impact. In order to deal with these effects, we introduce a temporal weighting function (TWF) and propose a methodology to determine it for document collections. We applied the proposed methodology to ACM-DL and Medline and found that the TWF of both follows a lognormal. We then extend three ADC algorithms (namely kNN, Rocchio and Naive Bayes) to incorporate the TWF. Experiments showed that the temporally-aware classifiers achieved significant gains, outperforming (or at least matching) state-of-the-art algorithms.

There has been a dramatic increase in the number of new packers and variants of existing ones combined with packers employing increasingly sophisticated anti-unpacker tricks and obfuscation methods. This makes it difficult, costly and time-consuming for antivirus (AV) researchers to carry out the traditional static packer identification and classification methods which are mainly based on the packer's byte signature. In this paper(1), we present a simple, yet fast and effective packer classification framework that applies pattern recognition techniques on automatically extracted randomness profiles of packers. This system can be run without AV researcher's manual input. We test various statistical classification algorithms, including k-Nearest Neighbor, Best-first Decision Tree, Sequential Minimal Optimization and Naive Bayes. We test these algorithms on a large data set that consists of clean packed files and 17,336 real malware samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our packer classification system achieves extremely high effectiveness (> 99%). The experiments also confirm that the randomness profile used in the system is a very strong feature for packer classification. It can be applied with high accuracy on real malware samples.

In the paper, it is proposed the agent-based recommender system, which, for each new learner, suggests the student group of similar profiles and consequently indicates suitable learning resources. It is assumed that learners may be characterized by cognitive styles, usability preferences or historical behavior, represented by nominal values. It is considered to build recommendations by using Naive Bayes algorithm. The performance of the technique is validated on the basis of data of learners described by cognitive traits such as dominant learning style dimensions. Tests are done for real data of different groups of similar students as well as of individual learners.

The proposed estimator shrinks both means and variances, and is thus called the double shrinkage estimator. Extensive numerical studies indicate that the double shrinkage estimator has lower Bayes risk than the estimator which shrinks the means alone, and the naive estimator which has no shrinkage at all. We further use a spike-in data set to assess different estimating procedures. It turns out that our proposed estimator performs the best and is thus strongly recommended for applications.

J	Techo, J; Nattee, C; Theeramunkong, T				Techo, Jakkrit; Nattee, Cholwich; Theeramunkong, Thanaruk			A Corpus-Based Approach for Automatic Thai Unknown Word Recognition Using Boosting Techniques	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						unknown word recognition; word boundary detection; data mining; machine learning; ensemble learning	ALGORITHMS	While classification techniques can be applied for automatic unknown word recognition in a language without word boundary, it faces with the problem of unbalanced datasets where the number of positive unknown word candidates is dominantly smaller than that of negative candidates. To solve this problem. this paper presents a corpus-based approach that introduces a so-called group-based ranking evaluation technique into ensemble learning in order to generate a sequence of classification models that later collaborate to select the most probable unknown word from multiple candidates. Given a classification model, the group-based ranking evaluation (GRE) is applied to construct a training dataset for learning the succeeding model, by weighing each of its candidates according to their ranks and correctness when the candidates of an unknown word are considered as one group. A number of experiments have been conducted on a large Thai medical text to evaluate performance of the proposed group-based ranking evaluation approach, namely V-GRE. compared to the conventional naive Bayes classifier and our vanilla version without ensemble learning. As the result, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 90.93 +/- 0.50% when the first rank is selected while it gains 97.26 +/- 0.26% when the top-ten candidates are considered, that is 8.45% and 6.79% improvement over the conventional record-based naive Bayes classifier and the vanilla version. Another result on applying only best features show 93.93 +/- 0.22% and lip to 98.85 +/- 0.15% accuracy for top-1 and top-10, respectively. They are 3.97% and 9.78% improvement over naive Bayes and the vanilla version. Finally. an error analysis is given.

J	Boulle, M				Boulle, Marc			A Parameter-Free Classification Method for Large Scale Learning	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						large scale learning; naive Bayes; Bayesianism; model selection; model averaging	BAYES; DISCRETIZATION; ATTRIBUTES	With the rapid growth of computer storage capacities, available data and demand for scoring models both follow an increasing trend, sharper than that of the processing power. However, the main limitation to a wide spread of data mining solutions is the non-increasing availability of skilled data analysts, which play a key role in data preparation and model selection. In this paper, we present a parameter-free scalable classification method, which is a step towards fully automatic data mining. The method is based on Bayes optimal univariate conditional density estimators, naive Bayes classification enhanced with a Bayesian variable selection scheme, and averaging of models using a logarithmic smoothing of the posterior distribution. We focus on the complexity of the algorithms and show how they can cope with data sets that are far larger than the available central memory. We finally report results on the Large Scale Learning challenge, where our method obtains state of the art performance within practicable computation time.

A Communication Perspective on Automatic Text Categorization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data communications; text processing; data compaction and compression; clustering; classifier design and evaluation; feature evaluation and selection		The basic concern of a Communication System is to transfer information from its source to a destination some distance away. Textual documents also deal with the transmission of information. Particularly, from a text categorization system point of view, the information encoded by a document is the topic or category it belongs to. Following this initial intuition, a theoretical framework is developed where Automatic Text Categorization (ATC) is studied under a Communication System perspective. Under this approach, the problematic indexing feature space dimensionality reduction has been tackled by a two-level supervised scheme, implemented by a noisy terms filtering and a subsequent redundant terms compression. Gaussian probabilistic categorizers have been revisited and adapted to the concomitance of sparsity in ATC. Experimental results pertaining to 20 Newsgroups and Reuters-21578 collections validate the theoretical approaches. The noise filter and redundancy compressor allows an aggressive term vocabulary reduction ( reduction factor greater than 0.99) with a minimum loss ( lower than 3 percent) and, in some cases, gain ( greater than 4 percent) of final classification accuracy. The adapted Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier reaches classification results similar to those obtained by state-of-the-art Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

In a paper by Bickel and Levina (2004), it is recommended to use naive-Bayes classifiers, that is, to treat the features as if they are statistically independent. Consider now a sparse setup, where only a few of the features are informative for classification. Fan and Fan (2008), suggested a variable selection and classification method, called FAIR. The FAIR method improves the design of naive-Bayes classifiers in sparse setups. The improvement is due to reducing the noise in estimating the features' means. This reduction is since that only the means of a few selected variables should be estimated. We also consider the design of naive Bayes classifiers. We show that a good alternative to variable selection is estimation of the means through a certain non parametric empirical Bayes procedure. In sparse setups the empirical Bayes implicitly performs an efficient variable selection. It also adapts very well to non sparse setups, and has the advantage of making use of the information from many "weakly informative" variables, which variable selection type of classification procedures give up on using. We compare our method with FAIR and other classification methods in simulation for sparse and non sparse setups, and in real data examples involving classification of normal versus malignant tissues based on microarray data.

J	Chang, M; Poon, CK				Chang, Matthew; Poon, Chung Keung			Using phrases as features in email classification	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Document classification; Email; Resemblance; Nearest-neighbour; Naive Bayes		In this paper, we report our experience on the use of phrases as basic features in the email classification problem. We performed extensive empirical evaluation using our large email collections and tested with three text classification algorithms, namely, a naive Bayes classifier and two k-NN classifiers using TF-IDF weighting and resemblance respectively. The investigation includes studies on the effect of phrase size, the size of local and global sampling, the neighbourhood size, and various methods to improve the classification accuracy. We determined suitable settings for various parameters of the classifiers and performed a comparison among the classifiers with their best settings. Our result shows that no classifier dominates the others in terms of classification accuracy. Also, we made a number of observations on the special characteristics of emails. In particular, we observed that public emails are easier to classify than private ones. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Kriegler, E				Kriegler, Elmar			Updating under unknown unknowns: An extension of Bayes' rule	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						Bayesian updating; Prediction; Model accuracy; epsilon-Contamination model; Auto-regressive process	PHYSICAL SYSTEMS	Developing models to describe observable systems is a challenge because it can be difficult to assess and control the discrepancy between the two entities. We consider the situation of an ensemble of candidate models claiming to accurately describe system features of interest, and ask the question how beliefs about the accuracy of these models can be updated in the light of observations. We show that naive Bayesian updating of these beliefs can lead to spurious results, since the application of Bayes' rule presupposes the existence of at least one accurate model in the ensemble. We present a framework in which this assumption can be dropped. The basic idea is to extend Bayes' rule to the exhaustive, but unknown space of all models, and then contract it again to the known set of models by making best/worst case assumptions for the remaining space. We show that this approach leads to an epsilon-contamination model for the posterior belief, where the epsilon-contamination is updated along with the distribution of belief across available models. In essence, the epsilon-contamination provides an additional test on the accuracy of the overall model ensemble compared to the data, and will grow rapidly if the ensemble fails such a test. We demonstrate Our concept with an example Of auto-regressive processes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Gu, P; Zhu, QS; Zhang, C				Gu, Ping; Zhu, QingSheng; Zhang, Cheng			A multi-view approach to semi-supervised document classification with incremental Naive Bayes	COMPUTERS & MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery/3rd International Conference on Natural Computation	AUG 24-27, 2007	Haikou, PEOPLES R CHINA			Co-training; Multi-view; Semi-supervised learning; Semantic; Active learning		Many semi-supervised learning algorithms only consider the distribution of word frequency, ignoring the semantic and syntactic information underlying the documents. In this paper, we present a new multi-view approach for semi-supervised document classification by incorporating both semantic and syntactic information. For this purpose, a co-training style algorithm, Co-features, is proposed. In the phase of active querying, we assign a weight to each sample document according to its uncertainty factor. Then the most informative samples are selected and labeled by other "teachers". In contrast to batch training mode, we developed an incremental Naive Bayes update method, which allows for more efficient training even with a large pool of unlabeled data. Experimental results show that our algorithm works successfully on the datasets Reuters-21578 and WebKB, and is superior to Co-testing in the learning efficiency. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yang, CC; Liu, N				Yang, Christopher C.; Liu, Nan			Web Site Topic-Hierarchy Generation Based on Link Structure	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								Navigating through hyperlinks within a Web site to look for information from one of its Web pages without the support of a site map can be inefficient and ineffective. Although the content of a Web site is usually organized with an inherent structure like a topic hierarchy, which is a directed tree rooted at a Web site's homepage whose vertices and edges correspond to Web pages and hyperlinks, such a topic hierarchy is not always available to the user. In this work, we studied the problem of automatic generation of Web sites' topic hierarchies. We modeled a Web site's link structure as a weighted directed graph and proposed methods for estimating edge weights based on eight types of features and three learning algorithms, namely decision trees, naive Bayes classifiers, and logistic regression. Three graph algorithms, namely breadth-first search, shortest-path search, and directed minimum-spanning tree, were adapted to generate the topic hierarchy based on the graph model. We have tested the model and algorithms on real Web sites. It is found that the directed minimum-spanning tree algorithm with the decision tree as the weight learning algorithm achieves the highest performance with an average accuracy of 91.9%.

To solve this issue, Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Content-Based Filtering (CBF) solutions have been adopted. We propose a new CBF-CF hybrid approach called Symbiotic Data Mining (SDM), which aims at aggregating distinct local filters in order to improve filtering at a personalized level using collaboration while preserving privacy We apply SDM to spam e-mail detection and compare it with a local CBF filter (i.e. Naive Bayes). Several experiments were conducted by using a novel corpus based on the well known Enron datasets mixed with recent Spain. The results show that the symbiotic strategy is competitive in performance when compared to CBF and also more robust to contamination attacks.

Several supervised learning algorithms have been successfully adapted for the multiple-instance learning settings. We explore the adaptation of the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier and the utilization of its sufficient statistics for developing novel multiple-instance learning methods. Specifically, we introduce MICCLLR (multiple-instance class conditional log likelihood ratio), a method for mapping each bag of instances as a single meta-instance using class conditional log likelihood ratio statistics such that any supervised base classifier can be applied to the meta data. The results of our experiments with MICCLLR using different base classifiers suggest that no single base classifier consistently outperforms other base classifiers on all data sets. We show that a substantial improvement in performance is obtained using ail ensemble of MICCLLR. classifiers trained using different base learners. We also show that an extra gain in classification accuracy is obtained by applying AdaBoost.M1 to weak MICCLLR, classifiers. Overall, our results suggest that the predictive performance of the three proposed variants of MICCLLR are competitive to some of the state-of-the-art MIL methods.

In this work, we develop a general approach to supervised learning by leveraging higher-order dependencies between features. We introduce a novel Bayesian framework for Classification named Higher Order Naive Bayes (HONB). Unlike approaches that assume data instances are independent, HONB leverages co-occurrence relations between feature values across different instances. Additionally, we generalize our framework by developing a novel data-driven space transformation that allows any classifier operating in vector spaces to take advantage of theses higher-order co-occurrence relations. Results obtained on several benchmark text corpora demonstrate that higher-order approaches achieve significant improvements in classification accuracy over the baseline (first-order) methods.

HODE: Hidden One-Dependence Estimator	SYMBOLIC AND QUANTITATIVE APPROACHES TO REASONING WITH UNCERTAINTY, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	10th European Conference on Symbolic and Quantitative Approaches to Reasoning with Uncertainty	JUL 01-03, 2009	Verona, ITALY	Inst Biomed Engn, Italian Natl Res Council, Univ Verona, Dept Comp Sci, Fdn Arena Verona		AODE; SPODE; ODE; Bayesian Networks; Bayesian Classifiers; Classification	NAIVE BAYES	Among the several attempts to improve the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier, the Aggregating One-Dependence Estimators (AODE) has proved to be one of the most attractive, considering not only the low error it provides but also its efficiency. AODE estimates the corresponding parameters for every SPODE (Superparent-One-Dependence Estimators) rising each attribute of the database as the superparent, and uniformly averages them all. Nevertheless, AODE Iraq properties that can be improved. Firstly, the need to store all the models constructed leads to a high demand on space and hence, to the impossibility of dealing with problems of high dimensionality; secondly, even though it is fast, the computational time required for the training and the classification time is quadratic in the number of attributes. This is specially significant in the classification time, as it is frequently carried out in real time. In this paper, we propose the HODE classifier as an alternative approach to AODE in order to alleviate its problems by estimating a new variable (the hidden variable) as a superparent besides the class, whose main objective is to gather all the dependences existing in the AODE models. The results obtained show that this new algorithm provides similar results in terms of accuracy with a reduction in classification time and space complexity.

We designed and implemented a prototype for the classification of the Video ASR data. Our approach was to regard the task as text classification problem. We used terms from Wikipedia, categories as training data for our text classifiers. For the text classification the Naive-Bayes and kNN classifier from the WEKA toolkit were used. We submitted experiments for classification task 1 and 2. For the translation of the feeds to English (translation task) Google's AJAX language API was used. Although our experiments achieved only low precision of 10 to 15 percent, we assume those results will be useful in a combined setting with the retrieval approach that was widely used. Interestingly, we could not improve the quality of the classification by using the provided metadata.

Transductive learning (TL) or semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a suitable framework for learning-based interactive segmentation given the scarce label problem. In this paper we present extended work on Bayesian transduction and regularized conditional mixtures for interactive segmentation 131. We present a Markov random field model integrating a semi-parametric conditional mixture model within a Bayesian transductive learning and inference setting. The model allows efficient learning and inference in a semi-supervised setting given only minimal approximate label information. Preliminary experimental results on multimodal images of retinal disorders such as drusen, geographic atrophy (GA), and choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) with exudates and sub-retinal fibrosis show promising segmentation performance.

There are two kinds of assessment methods: offline and online. The main requirements related to online training assessment methodologies applied to virtual reality systems are the low computational complexity and the high accuracy. In the literature it can be found several approaches for general cases which can satisfy such requirements. An inconvenient about those approaches is related to an unsatisfactory solution for specific cases, as in some medical procedures, where there are quantitative and qualitative information available to perform the assessment. In this paper, we present an approach to online training assessment based on a Modified Naive Bayes which can manipulate qualitative and quantitative variables simultaneously. A special medical case was simulated in a bone marrow harvest simulator. The results obtained were satisfactory and evidenced the applicability of the method.

And they are all around us. To potentially replace some of their diminished memory and problem-solving abilities, Erroneous-Plan Recognition (EPR) aims to detect defects or faults in the execution of correct plans by the dementia patient, and send timely audio and visual prompts to the dementia patient and caregiver in order to correct these faults. The scope of this work is for the patient who lives alone in a smart home. One challenge is that the definition of plan can be very subjective. It is necessary to regard a plan as an Activity of Daily Living (ADL), choose the ADLs to monitor, and deploy available sensors to acquire data. With the sensor data, there can be activity recognition, followed by plan recognition. Another challenge is the highly random and erroneous behaviour of dementia patients. Multiple, sequential, and independent layers of error detection can be arranged in a prioritised manner to detect specific errors first, and provide an error probability if no specific errors are detected. On the whole, most of the EPR results are very good as they are at least 0.9, indicating that the data is linearly separable. The 2-layer EPR system, which uses the blacklist and whitelist as Layer 1 and naive Bayes classifier as Layer 2, is significantly more accurate than each individual layer. In fact, 5 out of 6 actors have an accuracy above 0.9. With the encouraging results, there will be more technical and domain challenges which we can address in the near future.			cwphua@i2r.a-star.edu.sg; sffoo@i2r.a-star.edu.sg; biswas@i2r.a-star.edu.sg; andrei@i2r.a-star.edu.sg; apwaung@i2r.a-star.edu.sg; mjay@i2r.a-star.edu.sg; wmhuang@i2r.a-star.edu.sg; mhthat@i2r.a-star.edu.sg; xuduangui@gmail.com; alvinchukw@gmail.com					AIELLO M, 2004, DIT04109 U TRENT; Amft O, 2007, IFMBE PROC, V13, P242; BAUM C, 1993, AM J OCCUP THER, V47, P431; Boger J, 2005, IJCAI 2005, P1293; Bookman A., 2007, FAMILY CAREGIVER HDB; Bouchard B., 2006, J COMPUTERS, V1, P53; Bouchard B, 2007, APPL ARTIF INTELL, V21, P623, DOI 10.1080/08839510701492579; Carberry S, 2001, USER MODEL USER-ADAP, V11, P31, DOI 10.1023/A:1011118925938; FEKI M, 2009, MODEL ALGORITHMIC FR; Ferri CP, 2005, LANCET, V366, P2112; HOEY J, 2007, P ICVS07; John G.H., 1995, ESTIMATING CONTINUOU, P338; Kaminka GA, 2002, J ARTIF INTELL RES, V17, P83; KAUTZ H, 2002, P AAAI02 WORKSH AUT; KAUTZ H, 2003, FDN ASSISTED COGNITI; Luhr S., 2007, Pervasive and Mobile Computing, V3, DOI 10.1016/j.pmcj.2006.08.002; Majumder A., 2008, P 2008 ACM SIGMOD IN, P161, DOI 10.1145/1376616.1376635; McDowell I., 1996, MEASURING HLTH GUIDE; PFAHRINGER B, 2008, COLLECTIVE CLASSIFIE; Poupart P., 2005, THESIS U TORONTO TOR; Roy P, 2007, PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE/WIC/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT AGENT TECHNOLOGY (IAT 2007), P131, DOI 10.1109/IAT.2007.17; Sipser M., 1997, INTRO THEORY COMPUTA; Tolstikov A, 2008, 2008 10TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON E-HEALTH NETWORKING, APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES, P35, DOI 10.1109/HEALTH.2008.4600106; Yang J, 2008, COMPUTER, V41, P102, DOI 10.1109/MC.2008.106; Zaffalon M, 2003, ARTIF INTELL MED, V29, P61, DOI [10.1016/S0933-3657(03)00046-0, 10.1016/S0933-3657(03)0046-0]; Zhu X., 2005, 1530 U WISC MAD	26	2	2	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-1-4244-5013-8				2009							21	28		10.1109/HEALTH.2009.5406183		8	Medical Informatics	Medical Informatics	BTL55	WOS:000287219300004

We present the extension made to the original algorithm as well as its evaluation on eight protein function hierarchical classification datasets. The achieved results are positive and show that the proposed global model is better than using a local model approach.

This approach applies an ensemble learning technique to generate a model for classifying unknown word candidates using features obtained from a corpus. We propose a technique called "group-based evaluation by ranking". It clusters the unknown word ments on real-world data to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The experiments compared the accuracy of our technique with an ordinary naive Bayes technique. Our technique achieves the accuracy 90.93 +/- 0.50% when the first rank is selected and 97.90 +/- 0.26% when the candidates up to the tenth rank are considered. This is 6.79% to 8.45% improvement.

Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) is a relatively new method for monitoring gene expression levels and is expected to contribute significantly to the progress in cancer treatment by enabling an automatic, precise and early diagnosis. A promising application of SAGE gene expression data is classification of cancers. In this paper, we build three event models (the multivariate Bernoulli model, the multinomial model and the normalized multinomial model) for SAGE gene expression profiles. The event models based methods are compared with the standard Naive Bayes method. Both binary classification and multicategory classification are investigated. Experiments results on several SAGE datasets show that event models are better than standard Naive Bayes in general. Normalized Information Gain (NIG), an extension of Information Gain (IG), is proposed for gene selection. The impact of gene correlation on the classification performance is investigated.

Automated kerogen classification in microscope images of dispersed kerogen preparation	MATHEMATICAL GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						kerogen recognition; machine learning; image processing; transmitted light microscopy	SEDIMENTARY ORGANIC-MATTER; PALYNOLOGICAL PREPARATIONS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; FLOW-CYTOMETRY; THIN-SECTIONS; IDENTIFICATION; MICROFOSSILS	We develop the classification part of a system that analyses transmitted light microscope images of dispersed kerogen preparation. The system automatically extracts kerogen pieces from the image and labels each piece as either inertinite or vitrinite. The image pre-processing analysis consists of background removal, identification of kerogen material, object segmentation, object extraction (individual images of pieces of kerogen) and feature calculation for each object. An expert palynologist was asked to label the objects into categories inertinite and vitrinite, which provided the ground truth for the classification experiment. Ten state-of-the-art classifiers and classifier ensembles were compared: Naive Bayes, decision tree, nearest neighbour, the logistic classifier, multilayered perceptron (MLP), support vector machines (SVM), AdaBoost, Bagging, LogitBoost and Random Forest. The logistic classifier was singled out as the most accurate classifier, with an accuracy greater than 90. Using a 10 times 10-fold cross-validation provided within the Weka software, we found that the logistic classifier was significantly better than five classifiers (p < 0.05) and indistinguishable from the other four classifiers. The initial set of 32 features was subsequently reduced to 6 features without compromising the classification accuracy. A further evaluation of the system alerted us to the possible sensitivity of the classification to the ground truth that might vary from one human expert to another. The analysis also revealed that the logistic classifier made most of the correct classifications with a high certainty.	[Kuncheva, L. I.; Charles, J. J.; Lim, I.

Four traditional feature selection methods in text categorization domain, Information Gain, Gain Ratio, Chi Squared, and ReliefF, are also used for performance comparison. Three classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes and a novel classifier-Locally Weighted learning with Naive Bayes (LWNB) are discussed in this paper. Four popular datasets are employed as the benchmark corpora in our experiments to examine the capabilities of these five feature selection methods and the three classifiers. In our simulations, we discover that the LWNB improves the Naive Bayes and gain higher prediction results by learning local models, and its performance is sometimes better than that of the SVM. Our study also shows the INTERACT can result in better performances of classifiers than the other four traditional methods for the spam email filtering.

Because the experimental determination of B-cell epitopes is time-consuming and expensive, there is an argent need for computational methods for reliable identification of putative B-cell epitopes from antigenic sequences. In this study, we explore the utility of evolutionary profiles derived from antigenic sequences in improving the performance (of machine learning methods for protective linear B-cell epitope prediction. Specifically, we compare propensity scale based methods with a Naive Bayes classifier using three different representations of the classifier input: amino acid identities, position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) profiles, and dipeptide composition. We find that in predicting protective linear B-cell epitopes, a Naive Bayes classifier trained using PSSM profiles significantly outperforms the propensity scale based methods as well as the Naive Bayes classifiers trained using the amino acid identify or dipeptide composition representations of input data.

Our approach learns feature weights by optimizing an objective loss function directly related to the classification error rate of the topic identification system. Topic identification experiments are performed on spoken conversations from the Fisher corpus. Features drawn from both word and phone lattices generated via automatic speech recognition are investigated. Under various different conditions, our new feature weighting scheme reduces our classification error rate between 9% and 23% relative to our baseline naive Bayes system using feature selection.

EEG signals are digitally sampled and then transformed by three different feature extraction methods including nonparametric weighted feature extraction (NWFE), principal component analysis (PCA), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), which were also used to reduce the feature dimension and project the measured EEG signals to a feature space spanned by their eigenvectors. After that, the mapped data could be classified with fewer features and their classification results were compared by utilizing two different classifiers including k nearest neighbor classification (KNNC) and naive bayes classifier (NBC). Experimental data were collected from 6 subjects and the results show that NWFE+NBC gives the best classification accuracy ranging from 71%similar to 77%, which is over 10%similar to 24% higher than LDA+KNN1. It also demonstrates the feasibility of detecting and analyzing single-trial EEG signals that represent operators' cognitive states and responses to task events.

Specifically, we evaluate the performance of the MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP), the Linear classifier, the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), the Naive Bayes classifier and the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The performance of the classification algorithms is evaluated under different traffic conditions and mobility patterns for the Black Hole, Forging, Packet Dropping, and Flooding attacks. The results indicate that Support Vector Machines exhibit high accuracy for almost all simulated attacks and that Packet Dropping is the hardest attack to detect.

The number of clinical documents alone may approach 100 for a patient that has a 3-year-old brain tumor. The neuroradiologist's evaluation of a patient's brain tumor involves examining the current imaging exam and checking for previous imaging exams that may occur pre- or post-treatment. The goal of this research is to develop an effective method to review all of the pertinent patient information from the medical record. We have designed and developed a medical system that incorporates Hospital Information Systems, Radiology Information Systems, and Picture Archiving and Communications Systems information. Our research improves clinical review of patient's data by organizing image display, removing unnecessary documents, and mining for key clinical scenarios that are important in the assessment and care of brain-tumor patients.

It connects two key components in the multimedia semantic ecosystem: multimedia lexicon and semantic concept detection. This paper aims to answer two questions related to multi-concept learning: does a large-scale lexicon help concept detection? how many concepts are enough? Our study on a large-scale lexicon shows that more concepts indeed help improve detection performance. The gain is statistically significant with more than 40 concepts and saturates at over 200. We also compared a few different modeling choices for multi-concept detection: generative models such as Naive Bayes performs robustly across lexicon choices and sizes, discriminative models such as logistic regression and SVM performs comparably on specially selected concept sets, yet tend to over-fit on large lexicons.

Bayesian analysis of frequency of allelic loss data	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Hidden Markov model; instability-selection model; loss of heterozygosity; Markov chain Monte Carlo; tumor-suppressor genes	BREAST-CANCER; PROBABILISTIC FUNCTIONS; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; LOCATION; LINKAGE	One objective of allelic-loss studies is to identify chromosomal locations that may harbor tumor-suppressor genes. An instability-selection model has been developed for allelic-loss data in which the loss events are available for each tumor and each marker (allelotypes). In performing pooled analyses of published allelic-loss experiments, however, only summaries of the frequency of allelic loss (EAL) may be available. The instability-selection model can be applied to these summary data, but naive computational approaches are prohibitive. A hidden Markov model (HMM) maximum likelihood approach has recently been proposed for EAL data, but the computation remains challenging. Moreover, precise methods for hypothesis testing and location inference are not available. We propose an alternative Bayesian treatment of the instability-selection model for FAL data. Advantages of the Bayesian approach include the availability of (1) natural imputation approaches to handle missing data, (2) hypothesis testing using Bayes factors, and (3) interpretable posterior intervals for tumor-suppressor locations. We apply our Bayesian approach to four previously reported allelic-loss studies.

J	Pechsiri, C; Kawtrakul, A				Pechsiri, Chaveevan; Kawtrakul, Asanee			Mining causality for explanation knowledge from text	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						elementary discourse unit; explanation knowledge; causality; causality boundary		Mining causality is essential to provide a diagnosis. This research aims at extracting the causality existing within multiple sentences or EDUs (Elementary Discourse Unit). The research emphasizes the use of causality verbs because they make explicit in a certain way the consequent events of a cause, e.g., "Aphids suck the sap from rice leaves. Then leaves will shrink. Later, they will become yellow and dry.". A verb can also be the causal-verb link between cause and effect within EDU(s), e.g., "Aphids suck the sap from rice leaves causing leaves to be shrunk" ("causing" is equivalent to a causal-verb link in Thai). The research confronts two main problems: identifying the interesting causality events from documents and identifying their boundaries. Then, we propose mining on verbs by using two different machine learning techniques, Naive Bayes classifier and Support Vector Machine. The resulted mining rules will be used for the identification and the causality extraction of the multiple EDUs from text. Our multiple EDUs extraction shows 0.88 precision with 0.75 recall from Naive Bayes classifier and 0.89 precision with 0.76 recall from Support Vector Machine.

For various diseases, including cancer, appropriate antigen sets have already been detected in blood sera of patients. Typically, a large number of sera from diseased and unaffected persons is screened for the antigens of interest. Sophisticated statistical learning approaches are trained on the resulting data set to classify sera as either tumor or normal sera. We developed a web-based application, called 'Seroreactivity Profile Classification Service' (SePaCS) that enables clinical groups to carry out analyzes of training sets and predictions of unclassified seroreactivity profiles with minimal effort. SePaCS provides a broad range of classification methods: four versions of a Naive Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Machines with a radial basis function kernel, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Diagonal Discriminant Analysis. The computed results are summarized in a PDF file. We demonstrate the functionality of SePaCS exemplarily for meningioma, a generally benign intracranial tumor. As a second example, we evaluated SePaCS on glioma, a malignant brain tumor. SePaCS is freely available at http://www.bioinf.uni-sb.de/sepacs.

J	Chen, Y; Liginlal, D				Chen, Ye; Liginlal, Divakaran			Bayesian networks for knowledge-based authentication	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						security; knowledge-based authentication; metrics; Bayesian networks; information theory; entropy; simulation	SUBJECTIVE-PROBABILITY; DIAGNOSIS; ENTROPY; GAMES	Knowledge-based authentication (KBA) has gained prominence as a user authentication method for electronic transactions. This paper presents a Bayesian network model of KBA grounded in probabilistic reasoning and information theory. The probabilistic semantics of the model parameters naturally lead to the definitions of two key KBA metrics-guessability and memorability. The statistical modeling approach allows parameter estimation using methods such as the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). The information-theoretic view helps to derive the closed-form solutions to estimating the guessability and guessing entropy metrics. The results related to KBA metrics and the models under different attacking strategies and factoid distributions are unified under a game-theoretic framework that yields lower and upper bounds of optimal guessability. The paper also proposes a methodology for implementing a Bayesian network-based KBA system. Further, an empirical evaluation of the relative merits of two Bayesian network structures for KBA, the Naive Bayes (NB) and the Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), confirms the hypothesis that the TAN structure is superior in terms of authentication accuracy and error rates. The results of the theoretical analysis and the empirical study provide insights into the KBA design problem and establish a foundation for future research in the KBA area.

A Naive-Bayes classifier for damage detection in engineering materials	MATERIALS & DESIGN			English	Article								This paper is intended to introduce the Bayesian network in general and the Naive-Bayes classifier in particular as one of the most successful classification systems to simulate damage detection in engineering materials. A method for feature subset selection has also been introduced too. The method is based on mean and maximum values of the amplitudes of waves after dividing them into folds then grouping them by a clustering algorithm (e.g. k-means algorithm). The Naive-Bayes classifier and the feature sub-set selection method were analyzed and tested on two sets of data. The data sets were conducted based on artificial damages created in quasi isotopic laminated composites of the AS4/3501-6 graphite/epoxy system and ball bearing of the type 6204 with a steel cage. The Naive-Bayes classifier and the proposed feature subset selection algorithm have been shown as efficient techniques for damage detection in engineering materials. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering that learning an unrestricted network is unfeasible the proposed classifier is confined to be consistent with the breadth-first search order of an optimal TAN. We propose an efficient algorithm to learn such classifiers for any score that decompose over the network structure, including the well known scores based on information theory and Bayesian scoring functions. We show that the induced classifier always scores better than or the same as the NB and TAN classifiers. Experiments on modeling transcription factor binding sites show that, in many cases, the improved scores translate into increased classification accuracy.

Consequently, its effectiveness may decrease in the presence of interdependent attributes. In spite of this, in recent years, Naive Bayes classifier is worked for a privilege position due to several reasons [1]. We present DGW (Dependency Guided Wrapper), a, wrapper that uses information about dependences to transform the data representation to improve the Naive Bayes classification. This paper presents experiments comparing the performance and execution time of 12 DGW variations against 12 previous approaches, as constructive induction of cartesiau product attributes, and wrappers that perform a search for optimal subsets of attributes. Experimental results show that DGW generates a new data representatiou that allows the Naive Bayes to obtain better accuracy more times than any other wrapper tested. DGW variations also obtain the best possible accuracy more often than the state of the art wrappers while often spending less time in the attribute subset search process.

Predicting the political sentiment of web log posts using supervised machine learning techniques coupled with feature selection	ADVANCES IN WEB MINING AND WEB USAGE ANALYSIS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery on the Web	AUG   20, 2006	Philadelphia, PA			sentiment classification; blogs; web logs; Naive Bayes; Support Vector Machines; WEKA; feature selection		As the number of web logs dramatically grows, readers are turning to them as an important source of information. Automatic techniques that identify the political sentiment of web log posts will help bloggers categorize and filter this exploding information source. In this paper we illustrate the effectiveness of supervised learning for sentiment classification on web log posts. We show that a Naive Bayes classifier coupled with a forward feature selection technique can on average correctly predict a posting's sentiment 89.77% of the time with a standard deviation of 3.01. It significantly outperforms Support Vector Machines at the 95% confidence level with a confidence interval of [1.5, 2.7]. The feature selection technique provides on average an 11.84% and a 12.18% increase for Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines results respectively. Previous sentiment classification research achieved an 81% accuracy using Naive Bayes and 82.9% using SVMs on a movie domain corpus.

This paper presents a comparative study of three preprocessing procedures, namely Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and class-conditional ICA, for Naive Bayes classifier. It is found that all the three procedures keep improving the performance of the Naive Bayes classifier with the increase of the number of attributes. Although class-conditional ICA has been-found to be superior to PCA and ICA in most cases, it may not be suitable for the case where the sample size for each class is not large enough.

In recent years, many data mining algorithms have been enhanced with privacy-preserving feature: decision tree induction, frequent itemset counting, association analysis, k-means clustering, support vector machine, Naive Bayes classifier, Bayesian networks, and so on. In this paper, we propose a protocol for privacy-preserving self-organizing map for vertically partitioned data involving two parties. Self-organizing map (SOM) is a widely used algorithm for transforming data sets to a lower dimensional space to facilitate visualization. The challenges in preserving data privacy in SOM axe (1) to securely discover the winner neuron from data privately held by two parties; (2) to securely update weight vectors of neurons; and (3) to securely determine the termination status of SOM. We propose protocols to address the above challenges. We prove that these protocols are correct and privacy-preserving. Also, we prove that the intermediate results generated by these protocols do not violate the data privacy of the participating parties.

In many cases, we can estimate probabilities by the fraction of times the events is observed to occur over the total number of opportunities. However, when the training examples are not enough, this probability estimation method inevitably suffers from the zero-frequency problem. To avoid this practical problem, Laplace estimate is usually used to estimate probabilities. Just as we all know, m-estimate is another probability estimation method. Thus, a natural question is whether a Bayesian network classifier with m-estimate can perform even better. Responding to this question, we single out a special m-estimate method and empirically investigate its effect on various Bayesian network classifiers, such as Naive Bayes (NB), Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE), and Hidden Naive Bayes (HNB). Our experiments show that the classifiers with our m-estimate perform better than the ones with Laplace estimate.

For example, Naive Bayes can benefit from this processing. A commonly-used supervised discretization method is Fayyad and Irani's recursive entropy-based splitting of a value range. The technique uses MDL as a model selection criterion to decide whether to accept the proposed split. We argue that theoretically the method is not always close to ideal for this application. Empirical experiments support our finding. We give a statistical rule that does not use the ad-hoc rule of Fayyad and Irani's approach to increase its performance. This rule, though, is quite time consuming to compute. We also demonstrate that a very simple Bayesian method performs better than MDL as a model selection criterion.
