In all these cases, the representation is based on the "Bag of words" model. This model doesn't capture the actual semantic meaning of a word in a particular document. Semantics are better captured by proximity of words and their occurrence in the document. We propose a new "Bag of Phrases" model to capture this discriminative power of phrases for text classification. We present a novel algorithm to extract phrases from the corpus using the well known topic model, Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA), and to integrate them in vector space model for classification. Experiments show a better performance of classifiers with the new Bag of Phrases model against related representation models.	[Gujraniya, Deepak; Murty, M.

Only few works report the performance of appearance-based methods applied to generic object recognition. This paper offers a comparison study to extend our understanding in this regard. The appearance features considered include those extracted by PCA, DCT, and Gabor Transformation, and the classifiers include kNN, LDA, Naive Bayes, artificial neutral networks and support vector machines. We assume that the objects in the training data can be segmented manually, but those in the test data must be segmented automatically. Therefore, a view-based segmentation approach is proposed to meet this requirement. Experiments were conducted on the COIL-100 database to specify which pair of appearance feature and classifier yields the best performance.

The system exploits "objectness" and perceptual organization to estimate general properties of real-world objects such as convexity, symmetry, well-defined boundary, visual contrast and cohesiveness. The measures of these properties are given as input to a naive Bayes classifier, which is trained to distinguish objects of interest from false positives. The system was trained and tested on two "real-life" environments (underwater and vehicular monitoring) and the results showed an increase of the performance of four state-of-art motion detection algorithms of about 15%. We also tested our approach on the CAVIAR dataset and although the system was not trained on that specific object class (people) it was able to increase the object detection performance of about 10%.

To date, there has been a substantial amount of research studies, which focus on activity recognition using accelerometer and gyroscope-based sensors. However, many of these studies adopt a single sensor approach and focus on proposing novel features combined with complex classifiers to improve the overall recognition accuracy. In addition, the implementation of the advance feature extraction algorithms and the complex classifiers may exceed the computing ability of most current ambulatory monitoring sensor platforms. This study proposes a method to adopt multiple accelerometer-based sensors on different body locations to cope with this challenge. The objective of this method is to achieve higher recognition accuracy with "light-weight" signal processing algorithms. For choosing the suitable classifier for this multi-sensor system, a comparison of the popular classifiers is presented with the same settings. Eight subjects were recruited to perform eight normal scripted activities in different life scenarios, and each repeated three times. Thus a total of 192 activities were recorded. These activities, then, were segmented and annotated in the laboratory. The collected dataset was used to compare and analyze the following classifiers: the Naive Bayes classifier, the Decision Tree classifier, the Artificial Neural Networks classifier, the K-Nearest Neighbor classifier and The Support Vector Machines classifier. The comparison focuses on both recognition accuracy and execution time.

In this paper, the authors describe a method of accurately detecting human activity using a smartphone accelerometer paired with a dedicated chest sensor. A series of trials were carried out in Ireland, initially involving N = 6 individuals to test the feasibility of the system, before a final trial with N = 24 subjects took place in the Netherlands. The protocol used and analysis of some 1400 minutes of recorded datum from this latter trial are described in detail throughout this paper. The design, implementation, testing and validation of a custom mobility classifier is also discussed. Offline analysis using machine learning algorithms, including C4.5, CART, SVM, Multi-Layer Perceptrons, and Naive Bayes was carried out. Methods were also deployed which allow existing fixed position based algorithms to function in an orientation independent manner. Analysis of collected datum indicate that accelerometers placed in these locations, are capable of recognising activities including sitting, standing, lying, walking, running and cycling with accuracies as high as 98%.

In recent years, Support Vector Machines (SVM) is gaining popularity as an efficient data classification algorithm and is being widely used in many machine vision applications due to its good data generalization performance. The present paper describes the development of multi-class SVM classifier employing one-versus-one max-wins voting method and using Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Linear kernels. The developed classifiers have been applied for color-based classification of apple fruits into three pre-defined classes and their performance is compared with conventional K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Naive Bayes classifiers. The multi-class SVM classifier with RBF kernel has shown superior classification performance.	[Prakash, J.

COMP-AODE improves classification performance over the well-known AODE [10] model. COMP-AODE assumes a uniform prior over the SPODEs; we then develop the credal classifier COMP-AODE*, substituting the uniform prior by a set of priors. COMP-AODE* returns more classes when the classification is prior-dependent, namely if the most probable class varies with the prior adopted over the SPODEs. COMP-AODE* achieves higher classification utility than both COMP-AODE and AODE.

However, keywords may not be sufficiently representative for the main topic of a web page. When searching for a topic, users input their desirable topic in terms of keywords. Keyword-based search engines will return pages that contain the keywords even though these pages are not about the topic. This limits the efficiency of these engines as they may return undesirable result. In this paper, we present an approach to improve the quality of search engines by focusing on web pages related to specific topics. Our system includes three main components: a crawler for gathering web pages, a classifier for classifying web pages by topics, and a hyperlink filter (or distiller) for filtering hyperlinks. We propose Naive Bayes algorithms for classifier and distiller to enhance the accuracy of the system. We also implement and examine the efficiency of our system by gathering web pages in two topics: Artificial Intelligence and Motorcycle. The result shows that our crawler achieves performance improvements in efficiency over the ones that search by keywords.

Existing online tracking algorithms often update models with samples from observations in recent frames. While much success has been demonstrated, numerous issues remain to be addressed. First, while these adaptive appearance models are data-dependent, there does not exist sufficient amount of data for online algorithms to learn at the outset. Second, online tracking algorithms often encounter the drift problems. As a result of self-taught learning, these mis-aligned samples are likely to be added and degrade the appearance models. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective and efficient tracking algorithm with an appearance model based on features extracted from the multi-scale image feature space with data-independent basis. Our appearance model employs non-adaptive random projections that preserve the structure of the image feature space of objects. A very sparse measurement matrix is adopted to efficiently extract the features for the appearance model. We compress samples of foreground targets and the background using the same sparse measurement matrix. The tracking task is formulated as a binary classification via a naive Bayes classifier with online update in the compressed domain. The proposed compressive tracking algorithm runs in real-time and performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms on challenging sequences in terms of efficiency, accuracy and robustness.

Our approach is distinguished from other LDA based approaches in that we identify the summary topics which best describe a given document and only extract sentences from those paragraphs within the document which are highly correlated given the summary topics. This ensures that our summaries always highlight the crux of the document without paying any attention to the grammar and the structure of the documents. Finally, we evaluate our summaries on the DUC 2002 Single document summarization data corpus using ROUGE measures. Our summaries had higher ROUGE values and better semantic similarity with the documents than the DUC summaries.	[Nagesh, Karthik; Murty, M.

Whether the target research is in medicine, agriculture, business, or industry; the necessity for analysing large amount of data is needed. In Addition to that, finding the most excellent feature selection technique that best satisfies a certain learning algorithm could bring the benefit for researchers. Therefore, we proposed a new method for diagnosing some diseases based on a combination of learning algorithm tools and feature selection techniques. The idea is to obtain a hybrid approach that combines the best performing learning algorithms and the best performing feature selection techniques in regards to three well-known datasets. Experimental result shows that co-ordination between correlation based feature selection method along with Naive Bayse learning algorithm can produce promising results.

Therefore, studying emotion is indispensable. This paper aims at finding the relationships between EEG signals and human emotions based on emotion recognition experiments that are conducted using the commercial Emotiv EPOC headset to record EEG signals while participants are watching emotional movies.

However, a single palmprint texture representation may not be sufficient for reliable recognition. Therefore, in this paper we propose a computational model for palmprint recognition/identification by fusing different categories of feature-level representations using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network. Features are extracted using Gabor filters and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space by selecting the most relevant features for recognition. The proposed model has shown promising results in comparison with naive Bayes, rule based and K* algorithm.

Data bases of previous measurements can be used to train classifiers that categorize newly incoming data. However, the large size of the training set can yield high classification times, e.g. for approaches that rely on nearest neighbors or kernel density estimation. Anytime algorithms circumvent this problem since they can be interrupted at will while their performance increases with additional computation time. Two important quality criteria for anytime classifiers are high accuracies for arbitrary time allowances and monotonic increase of the accuracy over time. The Bayes tree has been proposed as a naive Bayesian approach to anytime classification based on kernel density estimation. However, the employed decision process often results in an oscillating accuracy performance over time. In this paper we propose the BT* method and show in extensive experiments that it outperforms previous methods in both monotonicity and anytime accuracy and yields near perfect results on a wide range of domains.

J	Rowe, M; Stankovic, M				Rowe, Matthew; Stankovic, Milan			Aligning tweets with events: Automation via semantics	SEMANTIC WEB			English	Article						Social Web; semantic Web; machine learning; twitter		Microblogging platforms, such as Twitter, now provide web users with an on-demand service to share and consume fragments of information. Such fragments often refer to real-world events (e.g., shows, conferences) and often refer to a particular event component (such as a particular talk), providing a bridge between the real and virtual worlds. The utility of tweets allows companies and organisations to quickly gauge feedback about their services, and provides event organisers with information describing how participants feel about their event. However, the scale of the Web, and the sheer number of Tweets which are published on an hourly basis, makes manually identifying event tweets difficult. In this paper we present an automated approach to align tweets with the events which they refer to. We aim to provide alignments on the sub-event level of granularity. We test two different machine learning-based techniques: proximity-based clustering and classification using Naive Bayes. We evaluate the performance of our approach using a dataset of tweets collected from the Extended Semantic Web Conference 2010. The best F-0.2 scores obtained in our experiments for proximity-based clustering and Naive Bayes were 0.544 and 0.728 respectively.

Next, the SMS (Short Message Service) Spam in the mobile communication is studied as a two-phase uncertainty problem and a TPD of spam based algorithm is applied to make the spam filtering. The algorithm is combined the Naive Bayes based algorithm with the measure to the n-dimensional distance ratio mean function.

The study proposes a novel procedure to assess the patient's HD-quality, including five facets: (1) Delete the unrelated attributes and missing values. (2) Employ expert granularity to cut decision-attributed Kt/V (where K is the dialyzer clearance coefficient of urea nitrogen, t is the time for dialysis and V is the urea nitrogen volume of distribution in the body). (3) Use information-gain to select features, to reduce the total number of attributes to 17. (4) Utilize multiple regression to test the degree of co-linearity and select features, the dimension of dataset is reduced to 8 attributes and 2737 records. (5) Finally, the rules of HD-quality and accuracy performance are generated by granular rough set theory. In performance comparison, the decision tree (DT-C4.5), the Naive Bayes (NB) probabilistic model and Artificial Neural Networks-Multilayer Perceptrons (ANN-MLP) are employed to compare with the proposed procedure in accuracy. The results can assist doctors to reduce the time of diagnosis and to achieve dose of fitness-based dialysis for the patients. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kim, S; Yoon, J; Seo, J; Park, S				Kim, Seonho; Yoon, Juntae; Seo, Jungyun; Park, Seog			Improving Korean verb-verb morphological disambiguation using lexical knowledge from unambiguous unlabeled data and selective web counts	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						POS tagging; Verb-verb morphological disambiguation; Unlabeled corpora; Automatic annotation; Web counts; Hard example-based selective sampling		This paper deals with verb-verb morphological disambiguation of two different verbs that have the same inflected form. The verb-verb morphological ambiguity (VVMA) is one of the critical Korean parts of speech (POS) tagging issues. The recognition of verb base forms related to ambiguous words highly depends on the lexical information in their surrounding contexts and the domains they occur in. However, current probabilistic morpheme-based PUS tagging systems cannot handle VVMA adequately since most of them have a limitation to reflect a broad context of word level, and they are trained on too small amount of labeled training data to represent sufficient lexical information required for VVMA disambiguation. In this study, we suggest a classifier based on a large pool of raw text that contains sufficient lexical information to handle the VVMA. The underlying idea is that we automatically generate the annotated training set applicable to the ambiguity problem such as VVMA resolution via unlabeled unambiguous instances which belong to the same class. This enables to label ambiguous instances with the knowledge that can be induced from unambiguous instances. Since the unambiguous instances have only one label, the automatic generation of their annotated corpus are possible with unlabeled data. In our problem, since all conjugations of irregular verbs do not lead to the spelling changes that cause the VVMA, a training data for the VVMA disambiguation are generated via the instances of unambiguous conjugations related to each possible verb base form of ambiguous words. This approach does not require an additional annotation process for an initial training data set or a selection process for good seeds to iteratively augment a labeling set which are important issues in bootstrapping methods using unlabeled data. Thus, this can be strength against previous related works using unlabeled data. Furthermore, a plenty of confident seeds that are unambiguous and can show enough coverage for learning process are assured as well. We also suggest a strategy to extend the context information incrementally with web counts only to selected test examples that are difficult to predict using the current classifier or that are highly different from the pre-trained data set. As a result, automatic data generation and knowledge acquisition from unlabeled text for the VVMA resolution improved the overall tagging accuracy (token-level) by 0.04%. In practice, 9-10% out of verb-related tagging errors are fixed by the VVMA resolution whose accuracy was about 98% by using the Naive Bayes classifier coupled with selective web counts.

J	Ballabio, C; Sterlacchini, S				Ballabio, Cristiano; Sterlacchini, Simone			Support Vector Machines for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping: The Staffora River Basin Case Study, Italy	MATHEMATICAL GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Support Vector Machines; Landslide susceptibility mapping; Spatial prediction; Cross-validation	SPATIAL PREDICTION; SOIL PROPERTIES; GENE SELECTION; MODELS; HAZARD; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION; TOPOGRAPHY; REGRESSION; GIS	The aim of this study is the application of support vector machines (SVM) to landslide susceptibility mapping. SVM are a set of machine learning methods in which model capacity matches data complexity. The research is based on a conceptual framework targeted to apply and test all the procedural steps for landslide susceptibility modeling from model selection, to investigation of predictive variables, from empirical cross-validation of results, to analysis of predicted patterns. SVM were successfully applied and the final susceptibility map was interpreted via success and prediction rate curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, to support the modeling results and assess the robustness of the model. SVM appeared to be very specific learners, able to discriminate between the informative input and random noise. About 78% of occurrences was identified within the 20% of the most susceptible study area for the cross-validation set. Then the final susceptibility map was compared with other maps, addressed by different statistical approaches, commonly used in susceptibility mapping, such as logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and naive Bayes classifier. The SVM procedure was found feasible and able to outperform other techniques in terms of accuracy and generalization capacity. The over-performance of SVM against the other techniques was around 18% for the cross-validation set, considering the 20% of the most susceptible area. Moreover, by analyzing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, SVM appeared to be less prone to false positives than the other models. The study was applied in the Staffora river basin (Lombardy, Northern Italy), an area of about 275 km(2) characterized by a very high density of landslides, mainly superficial slope failures triggered by intense rainfall events.

This study sought to propose a new method of predicting the growth of human neurons using 1 907 sets of data in human brain pyramidal neurons obtained from the website of NeuroMorpho.Org. First, we analyzed neurons in a morphology field and used an expectation-maximization algorithm to specify the neurons into six clusters. Second, naive Bayes classifier was used to verify the accuracy of the expectation-maximization algorithm. Experiment results proved that the cluster groups here were efficient and feasible. Finally, a new method to rank the six expectation-maximization algorithm clustered classes was used in predicting the growth of human pyramidal neurons.

Vinitha			Wavelet-Based Energy Features for Glaucomatous Image Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Biomedical optical imaging; data mining; feature extraction; glaucoma; image texture; wavelet transforms	AUTOMATED DIAGNOSIS; DISEASE	Texture features within images are actively pursued for accurate and efficient glaucoma classification. Energy distribution over wavelet subbands is applied to find these important texture features. In this paper, we investigate the discriminatory potential of wavelet features obtained from the daubechies (db3), symlets (sym3), and biorthogonal (bio3.3, bio3.5, and bio3.7) wavelet filters. We propose a novel technique to extract energy signatures obtained using 2-D discrete wavelet transform, and subject these signatures to different feature ranking and feature selection strategies. We have gauged the effectiveness of the resultant ranked and selected subsets of features using a support vector machine, sequential minimal optimization, random forest, and naive Bayes classification strategies. We observed an accuracy of around 93% using tenfold cross validations to demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods.

J	Jiang, LX; Zhang, H; Cai, ZH; Wang, DH				Jiang, Liangxiao; Zhang, Harry; Cai, Zhihua; Wang, Dianhong			Weighted average of one-dependence estimators	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						naive Bayes; averaged one-dependence estimators; attribute weighting; classification; data mining	ROC CURVE; AREA	Naive Bayes (NB) is a probability-based classification model which is based on the attribute independence assumption. However, in many real-world data mining applications, its attribute independence assumption is often violated. Responding to this fact, researchers have made a substantial amount of effort to improve the classification accuracy of NB by weakening its attribute independence assumption. For a recent example, averaged one-dependence estimators (AODE) is proposed, which weakens its attribute independence assumption by averaging all models from a restricted class of one-dependence classifiers. However, all one-dependence classifiers in AODE have same weights and are treated equally. According to our observation, different one-dependence classifiers should have different weights. Therefore, in this article, we proposed an improved model called weighted average of one-dependence estimators (WAODE) by assigning different weights to these one-dependence classifiers. In our WAODE, four different weighting approaches are designed and thus four different versions are created. For simplicity, we respectively denote them by WAODE-MI, WAODE-ACC, WAODE-CLL and WAODE-AUC. The experimental results on a large number of UCI datasets published on the main website of Weka platform show that our WAODE significantly outperform AODE.

DETECTION OF HUANGLONGBING DISEASE IN CITRUS USING FLUORESCENCE SPECTROSCOPY	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						Bagged decision tree classifier; Citrus leaves; Fluorescence sensing; Huanglongbing; Naive-Bayes classifier	MULTISPECTRAL FLUORESCENCE; CLASSIFICATION; REFLECTANCE; STRESS; PLANTS	Huanglongbing (HLB) is an important citrus disease greatly affecting the citrus industry in Florida and other parts of the world. Early disease detection would control the spread of this disease through the application of suitable management measures. This study evaluates the application of fluorescence sensing for HLB detection of citrus leaves. A commercial handheld fluorescence sensor was used to collect yellow, red, and far-red fluorescence at ultraviolet (UV), blue, green, and red excitations from healthy, nutrient-deficient, and HLB-infected leaves of two different sweet orange cultivars, Hamlin and Valencia. Evaluation of the fluorescence sensing was performed under laboratory (controlled) and field conditions. The Naive-Bayes and the bagged decision tree classifiers were trained and tested to assess their performance in classifying the healthy and stressed (nutrient-deficient) leaves. Results revealed that the Naive-Bayes classifier yielded high classification accuracy under laboratory conditions (higher than 85%), while the bagged decision tree classifier yielded high overall classification accuracy under both laboratory and field conditions (higher than 94%). The bagged decision tree classifier performed better than the Naive-Bayes classifier; resulting in higher classification accuracy, although the computation time was at least 10 times greater than that of the Naive-Bayes classifier. In addition, feature extraction using forward feature selection indicated that fluorescence features such as yellow fluorescence (UV excitation) and simple fluorescence ratio (green excitation) contributed toward differentiating healthy leaves from nutrient-deficient and HLB-infected leaves.

This paper presents a novel Bayesian model named NB-TAN (NT), which utilizes the conditional independence assumption of Naive Bayes while trying to maintain the inter-dependencies between attributes. Thus a good tradeoff between model complexity and learnability can be realized in practice. Canonical cover is utilized to divide attributes into several related groups and extraneous attributes can be found. This helps to reduce the computational complexity and improve the robustness of the classifier.

Boosting algorithm can generate multiple classifiers by serialization through adjustment of sample weight; Bagging can generate multiple classifiers by parallelization. Different algorithms are composed of different loss and different integration mode, through integration of Bagging and Boosting algorithm and naive Bayes algorithm, the Bagging NB and Ada Boost NB algorithms are constructed. Through experiment contrast of UCI data set, the result shows Bagging NB algorithm is relatively stable, it can produce the sorting result superior than that of NB algorithm, AdaBoost NB algorithm is greatly affected by the singular value in data distribution, the result with foundation of NB algorithm is relatively poor on part of data set, and that might have negative influence on the classifier algorithm.

The differentiation of syndrome (ZHENG) is the criterion of diagnosis and therapeutic in TCM. Therefore, syndrome prediction in silico can be improving the performance of treatment. In this paper, we present a Bayesian network framework to construct a high-confidence syndrome predictor based on the optimum subset, that is, collected by Support Vector Machine (SVM) feature selection. Syndrome of CAD can be divided into asthenia and sthenia syndromes. According to the hierarchical characteristics of syndrome, we firstly label every case three types of syndrome (asthenia, sthenia, or both) to solve several syndromes with some patients. On basis of the three syndromes' classes, we design SVM feature selection to achieve the optimum symptom subset and compare this subset with Markov blanket feature select using ROC. Using this subset, the six predictors of CAD's syndrome are constructed by the Bayesian network technique. We also design Naive Bayes, C4.5 Logistic, Radial basis function (RBF) network compared with Bayesian network. In a conclusion, the Bayesian network method based on the optimum symptoms shows a practical method to predict six syndromes of CAD in TCM.

J	Prabhakara, S; Acharya, R				Prabhakara, Shruthi; Acharya, Raj			Unsupervised Two-Way Clustering of Metagenomic Sequences	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICINE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							PHYLOGENETIC CLASSIFICATION; DNA FRAGMENTS; FREQUENCIES; ALGORITHM; SIGNATURE; GENOMES; READS	A major challenge facing metagenomics is the development of tools for the characterization of functional and taxonomic content of vast amounts of short metagenome reads. The efficacy of clustering methods depends on the number of reads in the dataset, the read length and relative abundances of source genomes in the microbial community. In this paper, we formulate an unsupervised naive Bayes multispecies, multidimensional mixture model for reads from a metagenome. We use the proposed model to cluster metagenomic reads by their species of origin and to characterize the abundance of each species. We model the distribution of word counts along a genome as a Gaussian for shorter, frequent words and as a Poisson for longer words that are rare. We employ either a mixture of Gaussians or mixture of Poissons to model reads within each bin. Further, we handle the high-dimensionality and sparsity associated with the data, by grouping the set of words comprising the reads, resulting in a two-way mixture model. Finally, we demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of this method on simulated and real metagenomes. Our method can accurately cluster reads as short as 100 bps and is robust to varying abundances, divergences and read lengths.

Thus, theoretical models can help as prediction tools. Graph theory representation is one option because it permits us to numerically describe any real system such as the protein macromolecules by transforming real properties into molecular graph topological indices. This study proposes a new classification model for proteins linked with human colon cancer by using spiral graph topological indices of protein amino acid sequences. The best quantitative structure-disease relationship model is based on eleven Shannon entropy indices. It was obtained with the Naive Bayes method and shows excellent predictive ability (90.92%) for new proteins linked with this type of cancer. The statistical analysis confirms that this model allows diagnosing the absence of human colon cancer obtaining an area under receiver operating characteristic of 0.91. The methodology presented can be used for any type of sequential information such as any protein and nucleic acid sequence.

Automated Classification of Free-text Pathology Reports for Registration of Incident Cases of Cancer	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Medical Informatics; neoplasm; pathology; free text; automated classification	MEDICAL INFORMATICS; HIGH AGREEMENT; LOW KAPPA; RETRIEVAL; BIOINFORMATICS; PARADOXES	Objective: Our study aimed to construct and evaluate functions called "classifiers", produced by supervised machine learning techniques, in order to categorize automatically pathology reports using solely their content. Methods: Patients from the Poitou-Charentes Cancer Registry having at least one pathology report and a single non-metastatic invasive neoplasm were included. A descriptor weighting function accounting for the distribution of terms among targeted classes was developed and compared to classic methods based on inverse document frequencies. The classification was performed with support vector machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes classifiers. Two levels of granularity were tested for both the topographical and the morphological axes of the ICD-03 code. The ability to correctly attribute a precise ICD-03 code and the ability to attribute the broad category defined by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) for the multiple primary cancer registration rules were evaluated using F1-measures. Results: 5121 pathology reports produced by 35 pathologists were selected. The best performance was achieved by our class-weighted descriptor, associated with a SVM classifier. Using this method, the pathology reports were properly classified in the IARC categories with F1-measures of 0.967 for both topography and morphology. The ICD-03 code attribution had lower performance with a 0.715 F1-measure for topography and 0.854 for morphology. Conclusion: These results suggest that free-text pathology reports could be useful as a data source for automated systems in order to identify and notify new cases of cancer. Future work is needed to evaluate the improvement in performance obtained from the use of natural language processing, including the case of multiple tumor description and possible incorporation of other medical documents such as surgical reports.

Ultrasound images of 266 masses were analyzed quantitatively for shape, echogenicity, margin characteristics, and texture features. These features along with patient age, race, and mammographic BI-RADS category were used to train Naive Bayes and logistic regression classifiers to diagnose lesions as malignant or benign. ROC analysis was performed using all of the features and using only a subset that maximized information gain. Performance was determined by the area under the ROC curve, Az, obtained from leave-one-out cross validation. Naive Bayes showed significant variation (Az 0.733 +/- 0.035 to 0.840 +/- 0.029, P < 0.002) with the choice of features, but the performance of logistic regression was relatively unchanged under feature selection (Az 0.839 +/- 0.029 to 0.859 +/- 0.028, P = 0.605). Out of 34 features, a subset of 6 gave the highest information gain: brightness difference, margin sharpness, depth-to-width, mammographic BI-RADs, age, and race. The probabilities of malignancy determined by Naive Bayes and logistic regression after feature selection showed significant correlation (R-2 = 0.87, P < 0.0001). The diagnostic performance of Naive Bayes and logistic regression can be comparable, but logistic regression is more robust. Since probability of malignancy cannot be measured directly, high correlation between the probabilities derived from two basic but dissimilar models increases confidence in the predictive power of machine learning models for characterizing solid breast masses on ultrasound.

So we use bayesian text classification model as key technology for topic tracking and vector space model as topic pre-process model to develop a topic tracking system. The experimental results show that the system has good performance. Therefore, the Naive Bayes text classification model as key technology for topic tracking to deal with topic tracking problems is effective.

The goal is to collect interaction data during a realistic simulation of procedures in order to provide to trainees feedback about their skills. In this paper, we present a new approach to online training assessment based on Fuzzy Gaussian Naive Bayes (FGNB) for modeling and classification of simulation in M pre-defined classes, which is a generalization of Gaussian Bayes Networks. The results obtained showed that FGNB presents significant better assessment when compared to other two methods.

Exploring the CAESAR Database Using Dimensionality Reduction Techniques	EVOLUTIONARY AND BIO-INSPIRED COMPUTATION: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS VI	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Evolutionary and Bio-Inspired Computation - Theory and Applications VI	APR 25-26, 2012	Baltimore, MD	SPIE		CAESAR; Diffusion map; Isomap; gender classification		The Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource (CAESAR) database containing over 40 anthropometric measurements on over 4000 humans has been extensively explored for pattern recognition and classification purposes using the raw, original data [1-4]. However, some of the anthropometric variables would be impossible to collect in an uncontrolled environment. Here, we explore the use of dimensionality reduction methods in concert with a variety of classification algorithms for gender classification using only those variables that are readily observable in an uncontrolled environment. Several dimensionality reduction techniques are employed to learn the underlining structure of the data. These techniques include linear projections such as the classical Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and non-linear (manifold learning) techniques, such as Diffusion Maps and the Isomap technique. This paper briefly describes all three techniques, and compares three different classifiers, Naive Bayes, Adaboost, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), for gender classification in conjunction with each of these three dimensionality reduction approaches.

It introduces dependency-based feature selection which, to our knowledge, is used for the first time in conjunction with the Naive Bayes model acting as clustering technique. Construction of the dependency-based semantic space required for the proposed task is discussed. The resulting disambiguation method, representing an extension of the method introduced in [15], lies at the border between unsupervised and knowledge-based techniques. Syntactic knowledge provided by dependency relations (and exemplified in the case of adjectives) is hereby compared to semantic knowledge offered by the semantic network WordNet (and examined in [15]). Our conclusion is that the Naive Bayes model reacts well in the presence of syntactic knowledge of this type and that dependency-based feature selection is a reliable alternative to the WordNet-based semantic one.

FT-IR spectroscopy could identify variability at the molecular level in biological specimens. It is a rapid and noninvasive method, which could be used intraoperatively to modify surgical procedures. The aim of this paper is to identify and separate cancer from colitis in endoscopic colon biopsies through the use of FT-IR spectroscopy. A total of 88 endoscopic colon samples, including 41 cases of colitis and 47 cases of colon cancer, were obtained. Specimens were placed on an ATR accessory linked to FT-IR spectrometer with a MCT detector for greater stability and sensitivity. Later, specimens were sent for the histological examination as the reference in the spectral analysis. 41 colitis and 47 cancer specimens were compared. Spectra preprocessed with smoothing and normalization were used for discrimination analysis. PCA was processed to simplify the spectrum data set. Naive Bayes classifier model was constructed for diagnostic classification. Leave-one-out cross-validation method was utilized to assess the discrimination results. The sensitivity of FT-IR detection for cancer achieves 97.6%. The results showed that colon cancer could be distinguished from colitis with high accuracy using FT-IR spectroscopy and chemometrics.

Most of the work in this area geared for English text, whereas few researches have been conducted on Arabic text. However, the nature of Arabic text is different than English text; pre-processing of Arabic text are more challenging. In this paper an experimental study was conducted on three techniques for Arabic text classification; these techniques, Discriminative Multinominal Naive Bayes (DMNB), Naive Bayesian (NB) and IBK Algorithms, The paper aimed to assess the accuracy for each classifier and to determine which classifier is more accurate for Arabic text classification based on stop words elimination. The accuracy for each classifier is measured by Percentage split method (holdout), and K-fold cross validation methods, along with the time needed to classify Arabic text.

However the analysis of speech at the acoustic level could be not enough to determine the emotion of a user speaking in a realistic scenario. In this paper we analysed the spontaneous speech recordings of the FAU Aibo Corpus at the acoustic and linguistic levels to extract two sets of acoustic and linguistic features. The acoustic set was reduced by a greedy procedure selecting the most relevant features to optimize the learning stage. We experimented with three classification approaches: Naive-Bayes, a support vector machine and a logistic model tree, and two fusion schemes: decision-level fusion, merging the hard-decisions of the acoustic and linguistic classifiers by means of a decision tree; and feature-level fusion, concatenating both sets of features before the learning stage. Despite the low performance achieved by the linguistic data, a dramatic improvement was achieved after its combination with the acoustic information, improving the results achieved by this second modality on its own. The results achieved by the classifiers using the parameters merged at feature level outperformed the classification results of the decision-level fusion scheme, despite the simplicity of the scheme.

J	He, JZ; Zhang, Y; Li, X; Shi, P				He, Jiazhen; Zhang, Yang; Li, Xue; Shi, Peng			Learning naive Bayes classifiers from positive and unlabelled examples with uncertainty	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE			English	Article						positive unlabelled learning; uncertain data; naive Bayes; positive naive Bayes	MINING FREQUENT ITEMSETS; ALGORITHM; GRAPH	Traditional classification algorithms require a large number of labelled examples from all the predefined classes, which is generally difficult and time-consuming to obtain. Furthermore, data uncertainty is prevalent in many real-world applications, such as sensor network, market analysis and medical diagnosis. In this article, we explore the issue of classification on uncertain data when only positive and unlabelled examples are available. We propose an algorithm to build naive Bayes classifier from positive and unlabelled examples with uncertainty. However, the algorithm requires the prior probability of positive class, and it is generally difficult for the user to provide this parameter in practice. Two approaches are proposed to avoid this user-specified parameter. One approach is to use a validation set to search for an appropriate value for this parameter, and the other is to estimate it directly. Our extensive experiments show that the two approaches can basically achieve satisfactory classification performance on uncertain data. In addition, our algorithm exploiting uncertainty in the dataset can potentially achieve better classification performance comparing to traditional naive Bayes which ignores uncertainty when handling uncertain data.

First, a landslide inventory map showing the locations of 118 landslides was constructed from various sources. The landslide inventory was then randomly partitioned into 70% for training the models and 30% for the model validation. Second, ten landslide conditioning factors were selected (i.e., slope angle, slope aspect, relief amplitude, lithology, soil type, land use, distance to roads, distance to rivers, distance to faults, and rainfall). Using these factors, landslide susceptibility indexes were calculated using SVM, DT, and NB models. Finally, landslide locations that were not used in the training phase were used to validate and compare the landslide susceptibility maps. The validation results show that the models derived using SVM have the highest prediction capability. The model derived using DT has the lowest prediction capability. Compared to the logistic regression model, the prediction capability of the SVM models is slightly better. The prediction capability of the DT and NB models is lower.

However, evaluation of such properties using experimental means is time-consuming and costly. Thus, researchers are investigating the potential of using Quantitative Nanostructure-Activity Relationship (QNAR) models to predict the properties of nanoparticles prior to their synthesis. In this study, we developed a reliable, user-friendly and freely-accessible QNAR model to predict the cellular uptake of 105 nanoparticles with a single metal core by pancreatic cancer cells. Four modelling methods, namely Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, k nearest neighbour and support vector machine, were used to develop candidate models. A final consensus model was then developed using the top 5 candidate models. Validation of the final consensus model was done using a rigorous process by repeating the entire model development process five times using different combinations of training and validation sets. The final consensus model had a sensitivity of 86.7 to 98.2% and specificity of 67.3 to 76.6%. The majority of the wrong predictions were due to nanoparticles which had O-C-O-C-O bonding. Descriptors that were included in the final consensus models were mainly related to lipophilicity and hydrogen bonding. With the recent advances in QNAR methodology and its encouraging prediction toward virtual nanoparticles, the full potential of QNAR modelling should be exploited in the future to provide critical support to experimental studies over the design of nanomaterials.

J	La, L; Guo, Q; Yang, DQ; Cao, QM				La, Lei; Guo, Qiao; Yang, Dequan; Cao, Qimin			Multiclass Boosting with Adaptive Group-Based kNN and Its Application in Text Categorization	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; ADABOOST; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM	AdaBoost is an excellent committee-based tool for classification. However, its effectiveness and efficiency in multiclass categorization face the challenges from methods based on support vector machine (SVM), neural networks (NN), naive Bayes, and k-nearest neighbor (kNN). This paper uses a novel multi-class AdaBoost algorithm to avoid reducing the multi-class classification problem to multiple two-class classification problems. This novel method is more effective. In addition, it keeps the accuracy advantage of existing AdaBoost. An adaptive group-based kNN method is proposed in this paper to build more accurate weak classifiers and in this way control the number of basis classifiers in an acceptable range. To further enhance the performance, weak classifiers are combined into a strong classifier through a double iterative weighted way and construct an adaptive group-based kNN boosting algorithm (AGkNN-AdaBoost). We implement AGkNN-AdaBoost in a Chinese text categorization system. Experimental results showed that the classification algorithm proposed in this paper has better performance both in precision and recall than many other text categorization methods including traditional AdaBoost. In addition, the processing speed is significantly enhanced than original AdaBoost and many other classic categorization algorithms.

Discretization methods entail an unavoidable loss of information. Nonetheless, a number of studies have shown that appropriate discretization can outperform straightforward use of common, but often unrealistic parametric distribution (e. g. Gaussian). Previous studies have shown the Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE) classifier and its variant Hybrid AODE (HAODE, which deals with numeric and discrete variables) to be robust towards the discretization method applied. However, all the discretization techniques taken into account so far formed non-overlapping intervals for a numeric attribute. We argue that the idea of non-disjoint discretization, already justified in Naive Bayes classifiers, can also be profitably extended to AODE and HAODE, albeit with some variations; and our experimental results seem to support this hypothesis, specially for the latter.

S	Suzuki, I			IEEE	Suzuki, Izumi			Proposal of Fuzzy Coverage Region Classifier as an Extension of the Naive Bayes Classifier and Improvement of its Zero-one Loss	2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUZZY SYSTEMS (FUZZ-IEEE)	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)	JUN 10-15, 2012	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	IEEE		naive Bayes classifier; fuzzy classifier; aggregation		A new classifying rule using a fuzzy coverage region classifier is introduced in this paper. The rule enables us to formally alter conditional probability distributions to improve the zero-one loss (misclassification rate) of the naive Bayes classifier. Altering the probability distribution is a justifiable variation for defining a fuzzy set from the probability distribution. By using this approach, the range for altering the probability distribution is identified, for example: the value of a distribution function is allowed to replace its value to the power of 1/p, where p is approximately 1 to infinity. Optimizing the parameters of p in each feature and each class to minimize the zero-one loss improves the performance of the fuzzy coverage region classifier (or that of the naive Bayes classifier). Also, it is suggested that the performance of the non-fuzzy coverage region classifier is hardly influenced by the bias of training data, if the training data only covers the range of the class object.

Since most mechanical equipment operates under some sort of stress or load, it tends to deteriorate or degrade over time, thus possibly resulting in discrete degradation states (damage degrees), ranging from perfect functioning to complete failure. This multi-state deterioration is the motivation for using condition monitoring tools for the purpose of modeling, diagnosis, prognosis, and condition-based maintenance. Most mechanical equipment is subject to multiple independent failure modes and degradation processes. Rather than independently diagnosing and prognosing the health condition of the equipment for a single failure mode, it is important to investigate how multi-dimensional condition monitoring information can be used for recognition purposes of the state of the health of equipment with multiple independent failure modes. This paper focuses on a non-repairable piece of equipment with multiple independent failure modes, in which the state of the equipment for each single failure mode is not directly observable and only incomplete information is available through condition monitoring. The main objective of this paper is to develop a method to obtain an observation probability matrix which can be used as the main tool for damage degree classification of each failure mode. An observation probability matrix represents the statistical relationship between the actual health state (damage degree and failure mode) of the equipment and the condition monitoring information. This observation probability matrix is an input for such methods, as hidden Markov models, hidden Semi-Markov models, and Naive Bayes classifiers. We modify the Naive Bayes classifier to use this observation probability matrix for classification. The result of this paper is applied for damage degree classification of a planetary gearbox, which is subject to multiple failure modes.

Support vector machine (SVM) is a kind of structural risk minimization based learning algorithms. As a popular machine learning algorithm, SVM has been widely used in many fields such as information retrieval and text classification in the last decade. In this paper, SVM is introduced to classify the agricultural data. An experimental evaluation of different methods is carried out on the public agricultural dataset. Experimental results show that the SVM algorithm outperforms two popular algorithms, i.e., naive bayes and artificial neural network in terms of the F-1 measure.

The proposed approach abstracts the lower structural property of the tactile image by analyzing the covariance between pressure values and their locations on the sensor and identifies three orthogonal principal axes of the pressure distribution. Classifying contact shapes based on the principal axes allows the results to be invariant to the rotation of the contact shape. A naive Bayes classifier is implemented to classify the shape and pose of the local contact shapes. Using an off-shelf low resolution tactile array sensor which comprises of 5x9 pressure elements, an overall accuracy of 97.5% has been achieved in classifying six primitive contact shapes. The proposed method is very computational efficient (total classifying time for a local contact shape = 576 mu s (1736 Hz)). The test results demonstrate that the proposed method is practical to be implemented on robotic hands equipped with tactile array sensors for conducting manipulation tasks where real-time classification is essential.

The ensemble classifier is constructed by incorporating hard and fuzzy classification techniques such as fuzzy c-means clustering and naive Bayes classification. The fuzzy c-means clustering works the preprocessing step, which generates a fuzzy partition based on a given propositional function to augment the above ensemble classifier. This strategy would work better than a conventional hard classifier without fuzzy classification. Our experimental results show the newly hybrid classifier has improved the accuracy and stability of classification, and its classification performance is much closer to that of the tree augment naive Bayes classifier. In a word, the mathematical work performed in the newly hybrid classifier is not only theoretically admirable, but it also works in many practical applications.

These methods usually assume a small number of classes, typically less than ten, and reach their limit in case of too many classes. In this paper, we extend discretization and value grouping methods, based on the partitioning of both the input and class variables. The best joint partitioning is searched by maximizing a Bayesian model selection criterion. We show how to exploit this preprocessing method as a preparation for the naive Bayes classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate the benefits of the approach in the case of hundreds of classes.

Fortunately, there are different approaches able to automatically detect and remove most of those messages, and the best-known ones are based on machine learning techniques, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and Support Vector Machines. However, there are several different models of Naive Bayes filters, something the spam literature does not always acknowledge. In this chapter, we present and compare seven different versions of Naive Bayes classifiers, the well-known linear Support Vector Machine and a new method based on the Minimum Description Length principle. Furthermore, we have conducted an empirical experiment on six public and real non-encoded datasets. The results indicate that the proposed filter is easy to implement, incrementally updateable and clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art spam filters.

Recognizing each web service intelligently becomes the key of efficiently using Internet. And the first step of recognization is to classify the web services accurately. To classify a huge amount of web services becomes a difficulty job. Therefore, in order to support applications of web services more effectively, an automatic web service classification method is needed. In this paper, the common WSDL files are regarded as the study object. Since web service is described by WSDL, the traditional document classification method cannot be applied directly. In the paper, a new method is proposed which applies automatic web service semantic annotation and uses three classification method: Naive Bayes, SVM and REPTree, furthermore ensemble learning is applied. According to the experiment done on 951 WSDL files and 19 categories, the accuracy was 87.39%	[Li Yuan-jie; Cao Jian] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China	Li, YJ (reprint author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.	yuan8753jie@gmail.com; cao-jian@sjtu.edu.cn					[Anonymous], 2004, OWL SERVICES COALITI; Crosso M., 2008, INTELIGENCIA ARTIFIC, V12, P25; Dumais S., 1998, Proceedings of the 1998 ACM CIKM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, DOI 10.1145/288627.288651; Hu L., 2008, MODELING SEMANTIC WE, P165; Joachims T., 1998, MACHINE LEARNING ECM, V1398, P137, DOI 10.1007/BFb0026683; Levy R., 2006, P 5 INT C LANG RES E, P2231; Rohde D.L.T., 2005, TGREP2 USER MANUAL; Santorini Beatrice, 1990, MSCIS9047 U PENNS DE; Schapire RE, 2000, MACH LEARN, V39, P135, DOI 10.1023/A:1007649029923; Zhang J., 2008, WEB SERVICE CLASSIFI	10	1	1	0	2	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	2164-7062		978-0-7695-4676-6	IEEE SYM PARA DISTR			2012							2274	2279		10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.280		6	Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BCA26	WOS:000309409400292

If they had a tool that could accurately and expeditiously detect these anomalies, they would prevent many of the serious problems caused by them. We conducted experiments in order to study the relationship between interval-based features of network traffic and several types of network anomalies by using two famous machine learning algorithms: the naive Bayes and k-nearest neighbor. Our findings will help researchers and network administrators to select effective interval-based features for each particular type of anomaly, and to choose a proper machine learning algorithm for their own network system.

Spam is therefore regarded as one of the prominent security threats in modern organizations. Security controls, such as spam filtering techniques, have become increasingly important to protect information and information assets. In this paper the performance of a Generalized Additive Neural Network on a publicly available e-mail corpus is investigated in the context of statistical spam filtering. The neural network is compared to a Naive Bayesian classifier and a Memory-based technique. Generalized Additive Neural Networks have a number of advantages compared to neural networks in general. An automated construction algorithm performs feature and model selection simultaneously and produces results which can be interpreted by a graphical method. This algorithm is powerful, effective and performs highly accurate compared to other non-linear model selection methods. The paper also considers the impact of different feature set sizes using cost-sensitive measures. These criteria are sensitive to the cost difference between two common types of errors made by filtering systems. Experiments show better performance compared to the Naive Bayes and Memory-based classifiers where legitimate e-mails are assigned the same cost as spams. This result suggests Generalized Additive Neural Networks may be utilized to flag spam e-mails in order to prioritize the reading of messages.

Traditionally, most classification models are built by supervised learning procedure, which leads to high rate of misclassification when test samples are significantly more than the training samples. This paper proposed to learn Bayesian classifier by using a semi-supervised procedure, which exploits the inter-relations among attributes mined from all test and training samples together to relax the conditional independent assumption of Naive Bayes(NB). Experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

Unlike regression models, the proposed model takes into account both the nonlinearity and the interaction between the variables. The conditional probability distributions of excess returns for the largest 1500 U.S. stocks are numerically estimated using only historical price and volume data. The probability distributions are then used to calculate the expected returns as a function of 20 variables. The model predictions are tested with a market neutral portfolio comprised of 21 long and 21 short stocks with an average turnover of one month.

In data mining, dimensionality reduction in data preprocessing plays a vital role for improving the performance of the machine learning algorithms. Many techniques have been proposed by researchers to achieve dimensionality reduction. Beside the contribution of feature subset selection in dimensionality reduction gives a significant improvement in accuracy, it reduces the false prediction ratio and reduces the time complexity for building the learning model in machine learning algorithm as the result of removing redundant and irrelevant attributes from the original dataset. This study analyzes the performance of these Cfs, Consistency and Filtered attribute subset evaluators in view of dimensionality reduction with the wide range of test datasets and learning algorithms namely probability-based Naive Bayes, tree-based C4.5(J48) and instance-based IB1.

Application of Data Mining to Candidate Screening	2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMMUNICATION CONTROL AND COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES (ICACCCT)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Advanced Communication Control and Computing Technologies (ICACCCT)	AUG 23-25, 2012	Ramanathapuram, INDIA	IEEE	Syed Ammal Engn Coll		CLASSIFICATION	Classification models are supervised learning methods used for predicting the value of a categorical target attribute. These models use a set of examples, called the training set, to learn to predict the target class of a future example whose class is unknown. The development of learning algorithms capable of learning from past experience is an important step in emulating inductive learning in humans. Classification finds application in many domains, of which selection of customers for a marketing campaign, fraud detection, diagnosis of diseases, image recognition, and spam e-mail filtering are just a few examples. In this paper, we present a comparative study of the application of the Naive Bayes and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classification methods to the problem of screening candidates for a vacant position in an organization. The observable attributes of a candidate profile are first established. In the training phase, a training set of example profiles is used for learning the classification rules of the organization. In the test phase, the accuracy of the classification model is assessed by classifying example profiles not included in the training set, but for which the target class is already known. In the prediction phase, a profile whose target class is not known is classified. We present the results of the comparison of the Naive Bayes method with the kNN method.

ELM randomly chooses hidden nodes and analytically determines the output weights of SLFNs. A detailed analysis of different activation functions with varying number of hidden neurons is carried out using Stat log-Heart dataset. The evaluation results indicate that ELM produces better classification accuracy with reduced training time. Its performance has been compared with other methods such as the Naive Bayes, AWAIS, C4.5, and Logistic Regression algorithms sited in the previous literature.	[Subbulakshmi, C.

IIvotes incorporates the SPIDER method for selective data pre-processing into the adaptive Ivotes ensemble. Such an integration is aimed at improving balance between sensitivity and specificity (evaluated by the G-mean measure) for the minority class in comparison with single classifiers also combined with SPIDER. Using SPIDER to pre-process specific learning samples inside the ensemble improves sensitivity of derived component classifiers. At the same time the controlling mechanism of IIvotes ensures that overall accuracy (and thus specificity) is kept at a reasonable level. The new proposed IIvotes ensemble was thoroughly evaluated in a series of experiments where we tested it with symbolic (decision trees and rules) and non-symbolic (Naive Bayes) component classifiers. The results confirmed that combining SPIDER with an ensemble improved the performance (in terms of the G-mean measures) in comparison to a single classifier with SPIDER for all tested types of classifiers and two SPIDER pre-processing options (weak and strong amplification). These advantages were especially evident for decision trees and rules where differences between single and ensemble classifiers with SPIDER were more significant for both pre-processing options than for Naive Bayes. Moreover, the results demonstrated advantages of using a special abstaining classification strategy inside IIvotes rule ensembles, where component rule-based classifiers may refrain from predicting a class when in doubt. Abstaining rule ensembles performed much better with regard to G-mean than their non-abstaining variants.

Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor for Image Classification	2012 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION (CVPR)	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)	JUN 16-21, 2012	Providence, RI	IEEE				We present Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor, an improvement to the NBNN image classification algorithm that increases classification accuracy and improves its ability to scale to large numbers of object classes. The key observation is that only the classes represented in the local neighborhood of a descriptor contribute significantly and reliably to their posterior probability estimates. Instead of maintaining a separate search structure for each class's training descriptors, we merge all of the reference data together into one search structure, allowing quick identification of a descriptor's local neighborhood. We show an increase in classification accuracy when we ignore adjustments to the more distant classes and show that the run time grows with the log of the number of classes rather than linearly in the number of classes as did the original. Local NBNN gives a 100 times speed-up over the original NBNN on the Caltech 256 dataset. We also provide the first head-to-head comparison of NBNN against spatial pyramid methods using a common set of input features. We show that local NBNN outperforms all previous NBNN based methods and the original spatial pyramid model. However, we find that local NBNN, while competitive with, does not beat state-of-the-art spatial pyramid methods that use local soft assignment and max-pooling.

Data streams are the order of the day input sources. In general, data streams exhibit a peculiar behavior of drifting the concepts as time passes by. Here is a study of GP Classifier on Concept Drifting Data Streams. GP classifier performance is compared to that of other state-of-the-art data mining and stream classification approaches. Boosting is a machine learning meta-algorithm for performing supervised learning. A weak learner is defined to be a classifier which is only slightly correlated with the true classification. In contrast, a strong learner is a classifier that is arbitrarily well-correlated with the true classification. Boosting combines a set of weak learners to create a strong learner. It is observed that the Boosting GP approach is beating Boosting Naive Bayes classification on Concept Drifting Data Streams. Hence it is found that GP is a competent algorithm for Concept Drifting Data Stream classification.	[Kumar, Dirisala J.

Sharing spectrum resources more efficiently, self organization, and interference mitigation are just a few examples. For many CR applications, a primary goal is to decentralize and distribute network functions among participant nodes. As a consequence, any given node in a CR network may be required to coordinate with not only its peers, but also with a number of unknown transmitters. Thus, it is desirable that individual nodes be capable of predicting future states of non-peer transmitters in order to better optimize their own operation. In this paper we introduce methods for identifying cognitive behavior in an unknown transmitter and predicting likely future states based on physical spectrum observations. We discuss the problem in the context of our Universal DSA Network Simulation (UDNS) and present two behavior classification algorithms used to this end.

Users on social networking sites spend lots of time generating large quantities of various personal content items (eg. diaries, albums, and comments) and browsing these varieties of content everyday. However, existing social networking sites do not provide effective access control mechanisms to assure the privacy of user-generated content. A user's personal content on social networking sites may be exposed to other users without any access control. This paper presents iSac, a novel intimacy-based social access control mechanism on social networking sites. iSac allows a user to make his access control policy on social networking sites according to intimacy degrees of him with respect to other users. iSac will first outline a user's activity profile according to his atomic social activities with respect to his seed friends. Then we adopt Naive-Bayes algorithm to calculate the intimacy degrees and rankings of all the user's friends. A content owner can make his access control policy by assigning a range of intimacy degrees. Users whose intimacy degrees are in the acceptable range can visit the content owner's personal content. Our experiments which use data collected from RenRen in China prove that iSac can effectively differentiate a user's friends by intimacy degrees so as to provide a novel access control mechanism with an improved granularity.

Yet, the Naive Bayes' application, and even the augmented Naive Bayes', to classifier-structure learning, has been vulnerable to certain limits, which explains the practitioners' resort to other more sophisticated types of algorithms. Consequently, the use of such algorithms has paved the way for raising the problem of super-exponential increase in computational complexity of the Bayesian classifier learning structure, with the increasing number of descriptive variables. In this context, the present work's major objective lies in setting up a further solution whereby a remedy can be conceived for the intricate algorithmic complexity imposed during the learning of Bayesian classifiers' structure with the use of sophisticated algorithms. Noteworthy, the present paper's framework is organized as follows. We start, in the first place, by to propose a novel approach designed to reduce the algorithmic complexity without engendering any loss of information when learning the structure of a Bayesian classifier. We, then, go on to test our approach on a car diagnosis and a Lymphography diagnosis databases. Ultimately, an exposition of our conducted work's interests will be a closing step to this work.

The protocol consists of three main steps: identification of potential positive selection regions via F-ST extremity measurement, SNP screening via two-stage attribute selection and classification model construction using a Naive Bayes classifier. The two-stage attribute selection is composed of a newly developed round robin Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU) ranking technique and a wrapper embedded with a Naive Bayes classifier. The protocol has been applied to the HapMap Phase II data. Two AIM panels, which consist of 10 and 16 SNPs that lead to complete classification between CEU, CHB, JPT and YRI populations, are identified. Moreover, the panels are at least four times smaller than those reported in previous studies. The results suggest that the protocol could be useful in a scenario involving a larger number of populations.

Unfortunately, one good set of features is sometimes not fit to all learning algorithms. To confirm that learning algorithm selection does not weights system accuracy user has to validate that the given dataset is a feature-oriented dataset. Thus, in this study we propose a simple verification procedure based on multi objective approach by means of elitist Non-dominated Sorting in Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). The way NSGA-II performs in this work is quite similar to the feature selection procedure except on interpretation of the results i.e. set of optimal solutions. Two conflicting minimization elements namely classification error and number of used features are taken as objective functions. A case study of fatigue segment classification was chosen for the purpose of this study where simulations were repeated using four single classifiers such as Naive-Bayes, k nearest neighbours, decision tree and radial basis function. The proposed procedure demonstrates that only two features are needed for classifying a fatigue segment task without having to place concern on learning algorithm	[Osman, M. H.; Nopiah, Z.

In intrusion detection systems, feature selection plays an important role in a sense of improving classification performance and reducing the computational complexity. In this paper, we focus on improving identification of major network attacks like DoS, R2L and Probe using various feature selection techniques (IG, CHI2 and OCFS). This research work explored the possibility of employing a variety of classifiers, but limited to J48, Naive Bayes and AdaBoost. Empirical evaluations were completed based on a standard network intrusion data set (KDDCUP99). The Experimental results show that the feature selection approach gives considerable increase of performance in detecting network intrusions as compared to normal approach.

Thus, ensemble of classifiers has emerged as one of the hot topics in multiclass classification tasks for imbalance problem for data mining and machine learning domain. Ensemble learning is an effective technique that has increasingly been adopted to combine multiple learning algorithms to improve overall prediction accuraciesand may outperform any single sophisticated classifiers. In this paper, an ensemble learner called a Direct Ensemble Classifier for Imbalanced Multiclass Learning (DECIML) that combines simple nearest neighbour and Naive Bayes algorithms is proposed. A combiner method called OR-tree is used to combine the decisions obtained from the ensemble classifiers. The DECIML framework has been tested with several benchmark dataset and shows promising results.

J	Hu, F; Wang, GY				Hu, Feng; Wang, Guoyin			Knowledge Reduction Based on Divide and Conquer Method in Rough Set Theory	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							DISCERNIBILITY MATRIX; ALGORITHMS	The divide and conquer method is a typical granular computing method using multiple levels of abstraction and granulations. So far, although some achievements based on divided and conquer method in the rough set theory have been acquired, the systematic methods for knowledge reduction based on divide and conquer method are still absent. In this paper, the knowledge reduction approaches based on divide and conquer method, under equivalence relation and under tolerance relation, are presented, respectively. After that, a systematic approach, named as the abstract process for knowledge reduction based on divide and conquer method in rough set theory, is proposed. Based on the presented approach, two algorithms for knowledge reduction, including an algorithm for attribute reduction and an algorithm for attribute value reduction, are presented. Some experimental evaluations are done to test the methods on uci data sets and KDDCUP99 data sets. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed approaches are efficient to process large data sets with good recognition rate, compared with KNN, SVM, C4.5, Naive Bayes, and CART.

Object Surface Classificaiton based on Friction Properties for Intelligent Robotic Hands	2012 WORLD AUTOMATION CONGRESS (WAC)			English	Proceedings Paper	World Automation Congress (WAC)	JUN 24-28, 2012	Puerto Vallarta, MEXICO	TSI Enterprises Inc		firction; surface property; LuGre model	MODEL STRUCTURE; NEWTON METHOD; EXPLORATION; COMPENSATION; SYSTEMS	Object surface properties are among the most important information for intelligent robotic grasping and manipulation. This paper presents a new object surface classification approach based on frictional properties. The idea is to use a robotic finger to rub over an object surface with a low acceleration and identify the frictional properties using measured friction force and sliding velocity. A quasi-static LuGre model is used to characterise the relationship between friction force and sliding velocity, and the generalized Newton-Raphson method is applied to estimate unknown frictional coefficients of this model. Since the frictional coefficients of the quasi-static LuGre model are closely related to the material physical properties, object surfaces can be classified using a naive Bayes classifier with the identified frictional coefficients. Test results show that the proposed approach can achieve a high correctness in object surface classification.

In this paper, we propose a Cluster-based Regrouping approach (CR) which divides the whole training data into positive group and negative group by clustering through the outlier factor. As a result, the similar samples will be in the same group while the dissimilar samples will be in the different groups. Then the basic classifier is employed to build the models on both the positive group and the negative group respectively. When classifying the new object, the model used to evaluate will be chosen according to the type of the group which the new object is nearest. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieved promising performance in some cases by directly or indirectly reducing the class distribution skewness.

To overcome this problem, this paper proposed a feature selection which focuses on statistical pattern based on SVM Attribute. Experiments have shown that the determination of word importance may increase the speed of the classification algorithm and save their resource used significantly. The proposed method was studied by comparing classification performance among Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine. The results showed that Support Vector Machine was found to be the best algorithm with F-measure 93.6%. It is found that the feature selection can reduce dimensionality of data significantly.

The external quality assessment reports are represented in both structured and unstructured data. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of unstructured data, i.e., to automatically classify strength and weakness points. We propose and evaluate two different classification models: Flat Classification and Hierarchical Classification. Three algorithms, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Tree, were used in the experiments. The results showed that classification via the Hierarchical Classification model by using the SVM yielded the best performance. The classification of strength and weakness points yielded the F-measure equal to 0.843 and 0.893, respectively. The proposed approach can be applied as a decision support function for quality assessment in vocational education.

It generates the false identities in order to perform false transactions with other identities. The proposed method uses the concept of DHT and reputation management which provides efficient file searching. The self certification (RSA and MD5) is used for ensuring secure and timely availability of the reputation data of a peer to other peers. The reputations of the peers are used to determine whether a peer is a malicious peer or a good peer. Once the malicious peer is detected the transaction is aborted. The reputation of a given peer is attached to its identity. The identity certificates are generated using self-certification and all peers maintain their own (and hence trusted) certificate authority which issues the identity certificate(s) and digital signature to the peer.

First, all the characters in a document image will be isolated and some valid ones are selected. Using the valid characters, the document image will be vectorized to a 32-dimensional vector. Gaussian distribution function is used to calculate the probability of each dimension, and then the posterior probabilities of the query document image in each class are also calculated. Finally, the orientation of document is detected as the class with the highest probability.

In this work, we have used for analysis 50 thermograms (25 each of normal and abnormal). The main objective of this work is to evaluate the use of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and texture features extracted from thermograms in classifying normal and abnormal groups. One clinically significant texture and two DWT features were fed to Decision Tree (DT), Fuzzy Sugeno, Naive Bayes Classifier, K Nearest Neighbour, Gaussian Mixture Model and Probabilistic Neural Network classifiers to evaluate the best classifier. Our results show that, DT and fuzzy classifiers yielded a highest average accuracy of 93.30%, sensitivity of 86.70% and specificity of 100%. The proposed computer-aided diagnostic system can be used for an automatic classification of normal and abnormal breast thermograms which can aid the radiologists in their diagnosis.

This Classification helps in assigning the bugs to the specific team for Bug Fixing according to the nature of the bug. In this paper, we have proposed a data mining technique applying syntactic and semantic Feature Extraction to assist developers in bug Classification. Extracted features are organized into different feature groups then a specific preprocessing technique is applied to each feature group. The applied methods have reduced the noise in the bug data. compared to traditional approach of word frequency for text categorization. We have analyzed our approach on a. collection of bug reports collected from a networking based organization (CISCO). The experiments are performed using Naive Bayes Multinomial Model and Support Vector Machine on features obtained after preprocessing.	[Agrawal, Ruchi; Reddy, G.

Network security needs attention of computer science researchers. Intrusion Detection System is software / hardware which detects intruder in the network or host system. Classification plays an important role in Intrusion Detection System. Detection of anomaly or normal traffic is main working philosophy for such type of system. For detection of online traffic, learning of the system is required. In our paper, performance of Supervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning is compared in Intrusion Domain. NSL-KDD data is considered for our work. In that dataset for each object 41 conditional attributes and one decision class attribute are mentioned. Out of 41 attributes, 7 attributes arc discrete and 34 attributes are continuous. Using feature ranking method, number of discrete attributes are reduced and these reduced number of attributes are used for classification in Supervised Learning. Some Supervised Learning like CS-MC4, Decision List, ID3. Naive Bayes, C4.5, Rnd Tree are applied on this data set and compared this classification result with classification accuracy derived from Reinforcement Learning combined with Rough Set Theory classifier.

Accidents such as falling can be a serious problem for the elderly. An accurate automatic fall detection system can help elderly people be safe in every situation. In this paper a waist worn fall detection system has been proposed. A tri-axial accelerometer (ADXL345) was used to capture the movement signals of human body and detect events such as walking and falling to a reasonable degree of accuracy. A set of laboratory-based falls and activities of daily living (ADL) were performed by healthy volunteers with different physical characteristics. This paper presents the comparison of different machine learning classification algorithms using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) platform for classifying falling patterns from ADL patterns. The aim of this paper is to investigate the performance of different classification algorithms for a set of recorded acceleration data. The algorithms are Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayes, Decision tree, Support Vector Machine, ZeroR and OneR. The acceleration data with a total data of 6962 instances and 29 attributes were used to evaluate the performance of the different classification algorithm. Results show that the Multilayer Perceptron algorithm is the best option among other mentioned algorithms, due to its high accuracy in fall detection.

A Framework for Entity Resolution with Efficient Blocking	2012 IEEE 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION REUSE AND INTEGRATION (IRI)			English	Proceedings Paper	13th IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration (IEEE IRI) / DIM / WICSOC / IEEE EM- RITE / IRI-HI	AUG 08-10, 2012	Las Vegas, NV	IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Soc (IEEE SMC), Soc Informat Reuse & Integrat (SIRI), IEEE			LINKAGE	In applications of Web data integration, we frequently need to identify whether data objects in different data sources represent the same entity in the real world. This problem is known as entity resolution. In this paper, we propose a generic framework for entity resolution for relational data sets, called BARM, consisting of the Blocker, Attribute matchers and the Record Matcher. BARM is convenient for different blocking and matching algorithms to fit into it. For the blocker, we apply the SPectrAl Neighborhood (SPAN), a state-of-the-art blocking algorithm, to our data sets and show that SPAN is effective and efficient. For attribute matchers, we propose the Context Sensitive Value Matching Library (CSVML) for matching attribute values and also an approach to evaluate the goodness of matching functions. CSVML takes the meaning and context of attribute values into consideration and therefore has good performance, as shown in experimental results. We adopt Bayesian network as the record matcher in the framework and propose a method of inference from Bayesian network based on Markov blanket of the network. As a comparison, we also apply three other classifiers, including Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, and the Naive Bayes classifier to our data sets. Experiments show that Bayesian network is advantageous in the book domain.

The accumulation of stress will result in poor health condition to people. Effectively detecting the stress of human being in time provides a helpful way for people to better manage their stress. Much work has been done on recognizing the stress level of people by extracting features from the bio-signals acquired by physiological sensors. However, little work has been focused on the feature selection. In this paper, we propose a feature selection method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). After the features are selected, their effectiveness in terms of correct rate and computational time are evaluated using five classification algorithms, Linear Discriminant Function, C4.5 induction tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN). We use the driver stress database contributed by MIT Media lab for our experiments. Leaving one out as well as 10-fold data preparation approach is implemented as the cross validation method for our evaluation. Paired t-test is then performed to analyze and compare the experimental results, as well as for their statistical significance. Our study demonstrates the importance of feature selection and the effectiveness of the methods used in accurately classifying stress levels.

Tremendous effort, time and money have been spent to detect fraud where there are studies done on creating personalized model for each credit card holder to identify fraud. These studies claimed that each card holder carries different spending behavior which necessitates personalized model. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been any study conducted to verify this hypothesis. Hence, in this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of personalized models compared to the aggregated models in identify fraud for different individuals. For this purpose, we have collected some actual transactions and some other data through an online questionnaire. We have then constructed personalized and aggregated models. The performance of these models is evaluated using test data set to compare their accuracy in identifying fraud for different individuals. To our surprise, the experimental results show that aggregated models outperforms personalized models. Besides, we have also compared the performance of the random forest and Naive Bayes in creating the models for fraud detection.

The gait sequences are considered to be the 3rd-order tensors and its dimensionality is reduced by Multilinear Principal Component Analysis with different values of variation covered. Reduced gait descriptors are identified by the supervised classifiers: Naive Bayes and Nearest Neighbor. CASIA Gait Database 'dataset A' is chosen to verify the proposed method. The obtained results are promising. For the Naive Bayes and attributes discretization almost 99% of classification accuracy is achieved, which means only one misclassified gait out of eighty validated.

This can be achieved only when the institutions are capable of predicting the student's behavior, their attitude towards studies and also the outcome of their result in the forth coming examinations. This can be achieved through various data mining techniques like classification, clustering and rule based mining. Classification techniques like decision trees, Bayesian network and neural networks can be used to predict the student's outcome in the examination based on their attendance percentage, their marks in the internal examination, the historical data available in the form of their previously scored percentage etc. Bayesian classification technique is used to predict the student's outcome in the university examination based on the marks obtained by them in the internal examination. Bayes classification is used to predict the result of the student on an individual basis which has helped the tutor to identify the weak students in each subject. This result has helped the tutors to concentrate on those weak students and bring out better results. This prediction will also help the institution to reduce the drop out ratio and produce better results.	[Kumar, S. Anupama; Vijayalakshmi, M.

This sentiment is typically quantified in universal star ratings, which are not always available. We propose and compare the performance of several statistical methods of automatically classifying star ratings of reviews represented by means of a binary vector representation, with features signaling the presence of sentiment-carrying words. A nearest neighbor classifier maximizes recall, whereas a naive Bayes classifier excels in terms of precision, accuracy, and the root mean squared error of the assigned number of stars.

However, the behavior of this measurement is not very well. Therefore, we select the mutual information between the key word and the category, the length of it and the frequency of it as features of key words and figure out corresponding formula to measure the weights of key words. Our method is applied to our filtering system based on the Naive Bayes algorithm which is also improved by the Lidstone algorithm to solve the unseen feature words problem. The results of our experiment based on the dataset built by ourselves show that the comprehensive evaluation index of our improved algorithm demonstrated a 19.61% increase in overall rating, compared to the filtering system using key words frequencies as features.

Both perfect and nearly perfect binding of miRNAs through base complementary could cause translation inhibition. Identification of miRNAs in organisms has mostly been focused on precursors of miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). These pre-miRNAs are found only in non-coding regions. However, pseudo pre-miRNAs, which are RNA sequences in the coding region, can be folded as hairpin structures. The classification of real and pseudo miRNAs is more complicated for plants, when compared to animals, due to their wider diversity. This study aims to extract the features of pre-miRNAs for classifying real and pseudo pre-miRNAs in plants and compare classification performance of five different machine learning approaches. Stochastic-based Random Forest and Naive Bayes Classifier showed the best classification performance with over 90% accuracy using 10-fold cross-validation and over 85% accuracy using cross-dataset validation.

Three types of watermarks of various pixel-depths, including 1-bit, 2-bit, and 3-bit, are able to be embedded without prominently damaging the image quality. To achieve high marked image quality, the parallel-oriented high efficient Direct Binary Search (DBS) halftoning is adopted to cooperate with the proposed Orientation Modulation (OM) method. In the decoder, the Least-Mean-Square-trained (LMS-trained) filters are adopted to extract the features of marked images in the frequency domain, and the naive Bayes classifier is employed to analyze the extracted features and further decode the watermark information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DBS-based OM encoding scheme provides excellent image quality, high processing efficiency, and high robustness to adapt to practical printing application.

Knowledge of the socio-situational setting can be used to search for content recorded in a particular setting or to select context-dependent models in speech recognition. The dynamic Bayesian classifier has the advantage - compared to static classifiers such a naive Bayes and support vector machines - that it can continuously update the classification during a conversation. We experimented with several models that use lexical and part-of-speech information. Our results show that the prediction accuracy of the dynamic Bayesian classifier using the first 25% of a conversation is almost 98% of the final prediction accuracy, which is calculated on the entire conversation. The best final prediction accuracy, 88.85%, is obtained by bigram dynamic Bayesian classification using words and part-of-speech tags.

Most researches in traditional Naive Bayes classification focus on the improvement of the classification algorithm, ignoring the selection of training data which has a great effect on the performance of classifier. And so a method is proposed to optimize the selection of training data in this paper. Adopting this method, the noisy instances in training data are eliminated by user-defined effectiveness threshold, improving the performance of classifier. Experimental results on large-scale data show that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline classifier.

Multiple classifiers and sensor combinations were examined to identify the classifier with the best recognition performance for the static and dynamic activities. The Functional Trees classifier proved to provide the best results among the classifiers evaluated (Naive Bayes, Bayesian Networks, Support Vector Machines and Decision Trees [C4.5, Random Forest]) and was used to train the model which was implemented for the real time activity recognition on the smartphone. The identified patterns of daily physical activities were used to examine conformance with medical advice, regarding physical activity guidelines. An algorithm based on Skip Chain Conditional Random Fields, received as inputs the recognized activities and data retrieved from the GPS receiver of the smartphone to develop dynamic daily patterns that enhance prediction results. The presented platform can be extended to be used in the prevention of short-term complications of metabolic diseases such as diabetes.

Contribution of radar images for grassland management identification	REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XIV	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XIV part of the 19th International Symposium on Remote Sensing	SEP 24-26, 2012	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE, SELEX GALILEO, THALES		Remote Sensing; Time series; Agricultural practices; Classification; Temporal analysis	POLARIMETRIC SAR; CLASSIFICATION	This paper is concerned with the identification of grassland management using both optical and radar data. In that context, grazing, mowing and a mix of these two managements are commonly used by the farmers on grassland fields. These practices and their intensity of use have different environmental impact. Thus, the objectives of this study are, firstly, to identify grassland management practices using a time series of optical and radar imagery at high spatial resolution and, secondly, to evaluate the contribution of radar data to improve identification of farming practices on grasslands. Because of cloud coverage and revisit frequency of satellite, the number of available optical data is limited during the vegetation period. Thus, radar data can be considered as an ideal complement. The present study is based on the use of SPOT, Landsat and RADARSAT-2 data, acquired in 2010 during the growing period. After a pre-processing step, several vegetation indices, biophysical variables, backscattering coefficients and polarimetric discriminators were computed on the data set. Then, with the help of some statistics, the most discriminating variables have been identified and used to classify grassland fields. In addition, to take into account the temporal variation of variables, dedicated indexes as first and second order derivatives were used. Classification process was based on training samples resulting from field campaigns and computed according six methods: Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbor, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, the Naive Bayes Classifier and Linear Discriminant Analysis. Results show that combined use of optical and radar remote sensing data is not more efficient for grassland management identification.

In this paper, we aimed at developing an effective machine learning scheme which leverages structural magnetic resonance imaging features in order to identify and discriminate individuals affected by mild AD on a single subject basis. Selected features included one-and two-way combinations of subcortical and cortical volumes as well as cortical thickness and curvature of numerous brain regions which are known to be vulnerable to AD. Additionally, several feature combinations were fed into support vector machines (SVMs) as well as Naive Bayes classifiers in order to compare scheme accuracy. The most efficient combination of features and classification scheme, which employed both subcortical and cortical volumes feature vectors and a SVM classifier, was able to distinguish mild AD patients from healthy controls with 86% accuracy (82% sensitivity and 90% specificity). While this investigation is of preliminary nature, and further efforts are currently underway towards automated feature selection, best classifier determination and parameter optimization, our results appear very promising in terms of automated high-accuracy discrimination of disease stages which cannot easily be distinguished though routine clinical investigation.

However, there are two challenges in those systems: the energy consumption due to the wireless transmission and the classifier design because of the dynamic feature vector. This paper proposes a multi-sensor fusion framework, which consists of the sensor selection module and the hierarchical classifier. The sensor selection module adopts the convex optimization to select the sensor subset in real time. The hierarchical classifier combines the Decision Tree classifier with the Naive Bayes classifier. The dataset collected from 8 subjects, who performed 8 scenario activities, was used to evaluate the proposed system. The results show that the proposed system can obviously reduce the energy consumption while guaranteeing the recognition accuracy.

This paper presents the software system NEUROZONE composed of two main applications: first, it allows online recognition of brain structures by the analysis of signals from microelectrode recordings (MER), and second, it processes and analyses off-line databases allowing the inclusion of new trained classifiers for automatic identification. The software serves as a support to the analysis done by a medical specialist during surgery, and seeks to reduce the adverse side effects that may occur because of inadequate identification of the target areas. The software also allows the specialists to label recordings obtained during surgery, in order to generate a new off-line database or increase the amount of records in an already existing off-line database.

Muscle Categorization Using PDF Estimation and Naive Bayes Classification	2012 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	34th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS), CAS, SMC, PubMed, MEDLINE			PATTERN DISCOVERY; QUANTITATIVE ELECTROMYOGRAPHY; DECOMPOSITION	The structure of motor unit potentials (MUPs) and their times of occurrence provide information about the motor units (MUs) that created them. As such, electromyographic (EMG) data can be used to categorize muscles as normal or suffering from a neuromuscular disease. Using pattern discovery (PD) allows clinicians to understand the rationale underlying a certain muscle characterization; i.e. it is transparent. Discretization is required in PD, which leads to some loss in accuracy. In this work, characterization techniques that are based on estimating probability density functions (PDFs) for each muscle category are implemented. Characterization probabilities of each motor unit potential train (MUPT) are obtained from these PDFs and then Bayes rule is used to aggregate the MUPT characterization probabilities to calculate muscle level probabilities. Even though this technique is not as transparent as PD, its accuracy is higher than the discrete PD. Ultimately, the goal is to use a technique that is based on both PDFs and PD and make it as transparent and as efficient as possible, but first it was necessary to thoroughly assess how accurate a fully continuous approach can be. Using Gaussian PDF estimation achieved improvements in muscle categorization accuracy over PD and further improvements resulted from using feature value histograms to choose more representative PDFs; for instance, using log-normal distribution to represent skewed histograms.

In this study, we have investigated the use of free-text and coded data in Marshfield Clinic's EHR, individually and in combination for building machine learning based models to predict the first ever episode of atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter (AFF). We trained and evaluated our AFF models on the EHR data across different time intervals (1, 3, 5 and all years) prior to first documented onset of AFF. We applied several machine learning methods, including naive bayes, support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression and random forests for building AFF prediction models and evaluated these using 10-fold cross-validation approach. On text-based datasets, the best model achieved an F-measure of 60.1%, when applied exclusively to coded data. The combination of textual and coded data achieved comparable performance. The study results attest to the relative merit of utilizing textual data to complement the use of coded data for disease onset prediction modeling.

Monitoring systems have a high sensitivity in order to detect relevant changes in the patient state. However, multiple studies revealed a high rate of either false or clinically not relevant alarms. It was found that the high rate of false alarms has a negative impact on both patients and staff. In this study we apply data mining methods to reduce the false alarm rate of monitoring systems. We follow a multi-parameter approach where multiple signals of a monitoring system are used to classify given alarm situations. In particular we focus on five alarm types and let our system decide whether the triggered alarm is clinically relevant or can be considered as a false alarm. Several classification algorithms (Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, SVM, kNN and Multi-Layer Perceptron) were evaluated. For training and test sets a subset of the freely available MIMIC II database was used. Alarm-specific classification accuracy was between 78.56% and 98.84%. Suppression rates for false alarms were between 75.24% and 99.23%. Classification results strongly depend on available training data, which is still limited in the intensive care domain. However, this study shows that data mining methods are useful and applicable for alarm classification.

Exudates are among the early signs of this disease, so its proper detection is a very important task to prevent consequent effects. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for exudate detection. First, we identify possible regions containing exudates using grayscale morphology. Then, we apply an active contour based method to minimize the Chan-Vese energy to extract accurate borders of the candidates. To remove those false candidates that have sufficient strong borders to pass the active contour method we use a regionwise classifier. Hence, we extract several shape features for each candidate and let a boosted Naive Bayes classifier eliminate the false candidates. We considered the publicly available DiaretDB1 color fundus image set for testing, where the proposed method outperformed several state-of-the-art exudate detectors.

In this article, we propose to exploit this phenomenon in the data stream context by building an ensemble of Hoeffding trees that are each limited to a small subset of attributes. In this way, each tree is restricted to model interactions between attributes in its corresponding subset. Because it is not known a priori which attribute subsets are relevant for prediction, we build exhaustive ensembles that consider all possible attribute subsets of a given size. As the resulting Hoeffding trees are not all equally important, we weigh them in a suitable manner to obtain accurate classifications. This is done by combining the log-odds of their probability estimates using sigmoid perceptrons, with one perceptron per class. We propose a mechanism for setting the perceptrons' learning rate using the ADWIN change detection method for data streams, and also use ADWIN to reset ensemble members (i.e., Hoeffding trees) when they no longer perform well. Our experiments show that the resulting ensemble classifier outperforms bagging for data streams in terms of accuracy when both are used in conjunction with adaptive naive Bayes Hoeffding trees, at the expense of runtime and memory consumption. We also show that our stacking method can improve the performance of a bagged ensemble.

A document similarity function (NEBSim) based on NE co-occurrence has been developed to calculate the similarity between two documents given a specific NE mention in one of them. NEBsim is also used in conjunction with the traditional cosine similarity measure to learn a model for ranking. Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers are used to re-rank the retrieved documents. Our experiments, carried out on TAC-KBP 2011 data, show NEBsim achieves significant improvement in accuracy as compared with a cosine similarity approach. They also show that re-ranking using learn to rank techniques can significantly improve the accuracy at high ranks.

However, a major impediment to such knowledge sharing are the privacy concerns of software development organizations. This paper aims to provide defect data-set owners with an effective means of privatizing their data prior to release. We explore MORPH which understands how to maintain class boundaries in a data-set. MORPH is a data mutator that moves the data a random distance, taking care not to cross class boundaries. The value of training on this MORPHed data is tested via a 10-way within learning study and a cross learning study using Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression for ten object-oriented defect data-sets from the PROMISE data repository. Measured in terms of exposure of sensitive attributes, the MORPHed data was four times more private than the unMORPHed data. Also, in terms of the f-measures, there was little difference between the MORPHed and unMORPHed data (original data and data privatized by data-swapping) for both the cross and within study. We conclude that at least for the kinds of OO defect data studied in this project, data can be privatized without concerns for inference efficacy.

One of the most critical aspects in this context is the model for the conditional probability of ground motion given earthquake magnitude, source-site-distance and potentially additional parameters. These models are usually regression functions, including terms modelling interaction effects derived from expert knowledge. We show that the framework of Directed Graphical Models is an attractive alternative to the standard regression approach. We investigate Bayesian Networks, modelling the problem in a true multivariate way, and we look into Naive Bayes and Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes, where the target node coincides with the dependent variable in standard ground motion regression. Our approach gives rise to distribution-free learning when necessary, and we experiment with and introduce different discretization schemes to apply standard learning and inference algorithms to our problem at hand.

This paper specifically targets at extracting useful information from the accelerometer sensor data. The paper proposes the utilization of parallel computing using MapReduce on the cloud for training and recognizing human activities based on classifiers that can easily scale in performance and accuracy. The sensor data is extracted from the mobile, offloaded to the cloud and processed using three different classification algorithms, Iterative Dichotomizer 3, Naive Bayes Classifier and K-Nearest-Neighbors. The MapReduce based algorithms are mentioned in detail along with one of their performance on Amazon cloud. The recognized activities can be used in mobile applications like our Zompopo that utilizes the information in creating an intelligent calendar. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In industrial applications for example, the correct operation of equipment can be the point of interest while raw sampled data is of minor importance. Classification algorithms can be used to make state classifications based on the available data. The distributed nature of Wireless Sensor Networks is a complication that needs to be considered when implementing classification algorithms. In this work, we investigate the bottlenecks that limit the options for distributed execution of three widely used algorithms: Feed Forward Neural Networks, naive Bayes classifiers and decision trees. By analyzing theoretical boundaries and using simulations of various network topologies, we show that the naive Bayes classifier is the most flexible algorithm for distribution. Decision trees can be distributed efficiently but are unpredictable. Feed Forward Neural Networks show severe limitations. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Zwartjes, Ardjan; Havinga, Paul J.

Predicting the Priority of a Reported Bug using Machine Learning Techniques and Cross Project Validation	2012 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS DESIGN AND APPLICATIONS (ISDA)			English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA)	NOV 27-29, 2012	Kochi, INDIA	Machine Intelligence Res Labs (MIR Labs), IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc, Czechoslovakia Chapter, IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc, Spanish Chapter, IEEE, Cochin Univ Sci & Technol		Bug repositories; Bug priority; Triager; Classifiers; 10-fald Cross Validation; SVM; KNN; Naive Bares; Neural Net		In bug repositories, we receive a large number of bug reports on daily basis. Managing such a large repository is a challenging job. Priority of a bug tells that how important and urgent it is for us to fix. Priority of a bug can be classified into 5 levels from P1 to PS where P1 is the highest and PS is the lowest priority. Correct prioritization of bugs helps in bug fix scheduling/assignment and resource allocation. Failure of this will result in delay of resolving important bugs. This requires a bug prediction system which can predict the priority of a newly reported bug. Cross project validation is also an important concern in empirical software engineering where we train classifier on one project and test it for prediction on other projects. In the available literature, we found very few papers for bug priority prediction and none of them dealt with cross project validation. In this paper, we have evaluated the performance of different machine learning techniques namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Neural Network (NNet) in predicting the priority of the newly coming reports on the basis of different performance measures. We performed cross project validation for 76 cases of live data sets of open office and eclipse projects.

The method is divided into three stages: image processing, feature extraction and image classification. In the first stage we have used two image processing techniques in order to enhance their features. Then, the second stage reduces the dimensionality of the images and finds features using the statistical method of principal component analysis. Finally, in the third stage the images are classified using machine learning algorithms, particularly, the naive Bayes classifier, neural networks, k-nearest neighbors and support vector machines. In our experimental study we classify two types of retinopathy: non-proliferative and proliferative. Preliminary results show that k-nearest neighbors obtained the best result with 68.7% using f-measure as metric, for a data set of 151 images with different resolutions.

In this paper, we discuss some ways to give weights on features in the framework of naive Bayes classifier, that is, under independent assumption of features. Because no order exists in a categorical feature, we consider a histogram over possible values (bins) in the feature. Taking into the difference of number of samples falling in each bin, we propose two kinds of weights: 1) one is derived from the probability that the majority class takes the majority even in samples, and 2) another reflects the expected conditional entropy. With the latter entropy weight, it will be shown that more discriminative features gain higher weights and non-discriminative feature diminishes as the number of samples goes infinity. We reveal the properties of these two kinds of weights through artificial data and some real-life data.

There is an urgent need to find an efficient way to assess the extent and variability of the disease at a broad spatial scale. The aim of this study is to explore the utility of transformed high spatial resolution QuickBird imagery and artificial neural networks, for the detection and mapping of pitch canker disease. Several vegetation indices including the Tasseled Cap Transformation were used to discriminate between healthy and infected P. radiata tree crowns using a feed-forward neural network and a Naive Bayes classifier. The neural network model showed high discriminatory power with an overall accuracy of 82.15% and KHAT of 0.65. These results are promising for the future management of pitch canker disease at a landscape scale.

While variety of security techniques are being developed and a lot of research is going on intrusion detection, but the field lacks an integrated approach with high detection rate (recall) and precision for minority attacks namely R2L and U2R. However, the recall and precision goals are often conflicting and attacking them simultaneously may not work well, especially when some of the classes are rare. This paper presents a novel layered approach with multi-classifier by combining naive bayes classifier (NBC) and naive bayes tree (NBTree) to improve detection rate and precision of minority class without hurting the performance of majority class. We identify important reduced feature set for each attack separately, to form layered approach. The proposed approach scales up the recall and precision for major as well as minor attacks, and keeps the false positives at acceptable level in intrusion detection. (C) 2012 The Authors.

Efficient prediction of phishing websites using supervised learning algorithms	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEM DESIGN 2011	Procedia Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Communication Technology and System Design	DEC 07-09, 2011	Coimbatore, INDIA			Antiphishing; Classification; Machine learning; Phishing; Prediction; Supervised learning		Phishing is one of the luring techniques used by phishing artist in the intention of exploiting the personal details of unsuspected users. Phishing website is a mock website that looks similar in appearance but different in destination. The unsuspected users post their data thinking that these websites come from trusted financial institutions. Several antiphishing techniques emerge continuously but phishers come with new technique by breaking all the antiphishing mechanisms. Hence there is a need for efficient mechanism for the prediction of phishing website. This paper employs Machine-learning technique for modelling the prediction task and supervised learning algorithms namely Multi layer perceptron, Decision tree induction and Naive bayes classification are used for exploring the results. It has been observed that the decision tree classifier predicts the phishing website more accurately when comparing to other learning algorithms. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

They represent to the scientific and medical communities, a significant target for bioactive and drug discovery programs. The model of classification of enzymes and GPCR is characterized by its hierarchical structure in format of tree and this makes more difficult its prediction. In this work we propose an adapted version of Learning Classifier Systems (LCS) data mining algorithm which tends to be more efficient than statistical methods based on homology used in tool such as PSI-BLAST. Hence, a new global model approach, called HLCS (Hierarchical Learning Classifier System) is used to predict the function of enzymes and GPCR, respecting its organizational structure of classes throughout the model development. The HLCS is expressed as a set of IF-THEN classification rules, which have the advantage of representing comprehensible knowledge to biologist users. The HLCS is evaluated with eight datasets from enzymes and GPCR, and compared with a Global Naive Bayes algorithm, named GMNB. In the tests realized the HLCS outperformed the GMNB in the databases of the GPCR proteins group type.

Conventional methods of cancer prediction deal with single class by limiting the prognosis prediction to one response variable. The SEER Public Use cancer database has more prominent variables that support better prediction approach. The objective of this paper is to find the prominent labels from cancer databases and use them in a multi-class environment. The implementation consist of three phases namely, pre-processing, prominent label identification and multi-label classification. Breast, Colorectal and Respiratory Cancer Data sets have been used for the experimentation. Also random samples from all three data sets are generated to form a mixed cancer data. Patient survival, number of primaries and age at diagnosis are the prominent labels identified from others using the Decision tree, Naive Bayes and KNN algorithms. The three prominent labels have been tested using multi-label RAkEL algorithm to find the relations between them. The results of the empirical study are comparatively better than the traditional way of cancer prediction.	[Saleema, J.

DECOMPOSABLE NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER FOR PARTITIONED DATA	COMPUTING AND INFORMATICS			English	Article						Agents; decomposable algorithms; naive bayes classifier; vertical and horizontal partitions	DISTRIBUTED DATA; ALGORITHMS	Most learning algorithms are designed to work on a single dataset. However, with the growth of networks, data is increasingly distributed over many databases in many different geographical sites. These databases cannot be moved to other network sites due to security, size, privacy, or data ownership consideration. In this paper, we propose two decomposable versions of Naive Bayes Classifier for horizontally and vertically partitioned data. The goal of our algorithms is to achieve the learning objectives for any data distribution encountered across the network by exchanging minimum local summaries among the participating sites.

Fusion of Wavelet Transform Features for Reliable Fault Detection within an Ocean Turbine MCM System	PROCEEDINGS 18TH ISSAT INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RELIABILITY & QUALITY IN DESIGN			English	Proceedings Paper	18th ISSAT International Conference on Reliability and Quality in Design	JUL 26-28, 2012	Boston, MA	Int Soc Sci Appl Technol		Ocean turbine; condition monitoring; reliability; feature level fusion; wavelet transform	FEATURE-LEVEL; NAIVE BAYES; IDENTIFICATION	Through a case study involving experimental data, we demonstrate how feature level fusion can enable more reliable fault detection in a condition monitoring system for an ocean turbine. This study revolves around analyzing and interpreting vibration signals gathered from multiple accelerometers installed on various components of a dynamometer designed to test the drive train and generator of the turbine. We applied feature level fusion to combine these vibration readings, and then assessed the abilities of six well known machine learners to detect changes in state from the raw accelerometer data and from the fused data. Analysis of the performance of these classifiers showed more stable performances for the six classifiers in detecting the state of the machine from the fused data versus from the data from the individual sensor channels.

Higher-order relations in LSI capture "latent semantics". Inspired by this, a novel Bayesian framework for classification named Higher Order Naive Bayes (HONB), which can explicitly make use of these higher-order relations, has been introduced previously. We present a novel semantic smoothing method named Higher Order Smoothing (HOS) for the Naive Bayes algorithm. HOS is built on a similar graph based data representation of HONB which allows semantics in higher-order paths to be exploited. Additionally, we take the concept one step further in HOS and exploited the relationships between instances of different classes in order to improve the parameter estimation when dealing with insufficient labeled data. As a result, we have not only been able to move beyond instance boundaries, but also class boundaries to exploit the latent information in higher-order paths. The results of our extensive experiments demonstrate the value of HOS on several benchmark datasets.

However, due to characteristics of textual data, some algorithms for data categorization are not efficient for text categorization. Characteristics of textual data such as sparsity and high dimensionality sometimes impair the quality of general-purpose classifiers. Here, we propose a text classifier based on a bipartite heterogeneous network used to represent textual document collections. Such algorithm induces a classification model assigning weights to objects that represents terms of the textual document collection. The induced weights correspond to the influence of the terms in the classification of documents they appear. The least-mean-square algorithm is used in the inductive process. Empirical evaluation using a large amount of textual document collections shows that the proposed IMBHN algorithm produces significantly better results than the k-NN, C4.5, SVM and Naive Bayes algorithms.

Data mining, based on pattern recognition algorithms can be of significant help for power system analysis, as high definition data is often complex to comprehend. In this paper three pattern recognition algorithms are applied to perform the data mining tasks. The deployment is carried out firstly for fault data classification, secondly for checking which faults are occurring more frequently and thirdly for identifying the root cause of a fault by clustering the parameters behind each scenario. For such purposes three algorithms are chosen, k-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes and the k-means Clustering.

Several morphing strategies have been proposed as promising approaches, very few works, however, have investigated their impact on the actual traffic classification performance. This work sets out to fulfill this gap from an empirical study point of view. It takes into account different morphing strategies exerted on packet size and/or inter-arrival time. The results show that not all morphing strategies can effectively obfuscate traffic classification. Different morphing strategies perform distinctively, among which the integration of packet size and inter arrival time morphing is the best, and the packet size based method is the worst. The three classifiers also exhibit distinct robustness to the morphing, with C4.5 being the most robust and Naive Bayes being the weakest. In addition, our study shows that classifiers can learn nontrivial information merely from the traffic direction patterns, which partially explains the weakness of packet size based morphing methods.

The case study is about the diagnosis of the possibility of having Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) in a child. The age group selected for the study is in between 2 and 3 years. Pervasive developmental Disorder is a neuro disorder that affects the social functioning, behavioural functioning and communication in a child. Conventional diagnosis is based on the scores obtained on checklists like DSM-IV Criteria. As Bayesian reasoning uses probability inferences, it is usually applied on decision making systems. Here for the study a Naive Bayes probabilistic dichotomizer was implemented. This dichotomizer calculates the most probable output depending on the inputs given to it, by applying the Bayes rule. Since the classifier is considering only two classes, the classifier is called as dichotomizer. The minimum expected risk and positive discriminant functions are also calculated, which again supports the decision of Naive Bayes dichotomizer. Implementation of Maximum A Priori Hypothesis and Maximum Likelihood Hypothesis are also discussing on the case study for a comparison. The main goal of this research work was to study the application of some probabilistic reasoning techniques in clinical decision supporting systems, where classification is more important. Based on the implementation of our case study, the findings shown that Naive Bayes dichitomizer supported with minimum expected risk and positive discriminant function, classifies correctly in clinical decision supporting systems	[Pratap, Anju] SAINTGITS Coll Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Pathamuttom, Kerala, India	Pratap, A (reprint author), SAINTGITS Coll Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Pathamuttom, Kerala, India.	anjuprathap@gmail.com; kanimozhiselvi@kongu.ac.in					Alavala Chenna Kesava.

In this study, a two-stage falling down detection at night based on optical flow and motion histogram image (MHI) is proposed. Based on the thermal imager, the foreground pedestrian could be perfectly extracted. In the first stage, vertical optical flow feature is used to roughly detect the falling down event, then, in the second stage, vertical optical flow hybrid MHI feature is fed into the Naive Bayes classifier to verify the falling down event. The experimental results show that the detection rate is 98.6%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Compared to traditional methods, Bayesian networks are being increasingly used in software engineering because their use opens many possibilities. A main feature of Bayesian networks is their capability to combine data and expert knowledge. This paper seeks to reinforce the hypothesis that Bayesian networks are a competitive method for estimating software effort in terms of prediction accuracy. For this purpose a Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) and a forward StepWise Regression (SWR) models have been developed from a subset of the ISBSG dataset. Under homogeneous conditions we found similar results provided that the discretization of the continuous variables is thin enough.

Available continuous vital signs, in many cases result in few state changes in the temporal range of interest; this work applies validated systematic algorithms to a small set of vital signs data to identify patients at risk for mortality. Vital signs signals are used to train J48, naive bayes, decision stump and SMO models. The InfoGain features selection algorithm was used to extract the best features using full run time-series data and feature generation permitted the features to be trained/tested on sensor data of any size, which dramatically improved the prediction classification of the J48 algorithm. The evaluation of the models were done using leave-one-out cross validation. The quality of the classification was determined by the accuracy, precision and recall. Results show that the J48 algorithm coupled with feature selection is a simple method for the identification of patients at increased risk for mortality in trauma care.

Twenty one features are extracted from measurement of the voltage and frequency at the point of common coupling (PCC) in order to identify islanding occurrence with high accuracy. An IEEE 34-bus system was used in this paper to generate islanding and non-islanding training cases. Then a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was trained using the training cases in order to discriminate islanding and non-islanding cases. In order to test the accuracy of the Naive Bayesian Classifier, Cross-Validation was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed islanding detection technique. Accuracy of 100% was achieved using the proposed algorithm.	[Faqhruldin, Omar N.; El-Saadany, E.

This paper presents a novel haptic exploration strategy for recognizing the physical properties of unknown object surfaces using an intelligent finger. This developed intelligent finger is capable of identifying the contact location, normal and tangential force, and the vibrations generated from the contact in real time. In the proposed strategy, this finger gently slides along the surface with a short stroke while increasing and decreasing the sliding velocity. By applying a dynamic friction model to describe this contact, rich and accurate surface physical properties can be identified within this stroke. This allows different surface materials to be easily distinguished even if when they have very similar texture. Several supervised learning algorithms have been applied and compared for surface recognition based on the obtained surface properties. It has been found that the naive Bayes classifier is superior to radial basis function network and k-NN method, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 88.5% for distinguishing twelve different surface materials.

We have developed a human-imitated system for robotic fingertip to sense object's texture via sliding action. Design of the sensory skin was inspired by the localized displacement phenomenon of a sliding soft fingertip ([1]) to capture stick-slip events on the contact surface that mainly represent texture characteristics. The soft skin is knitted by electro-conductive tension-sensitive yarns, then covered over a hemispherical fingertip. The pile-shaped surface of the fabric sensor enhances tangential traction detection ability of the sensor, even though the normal load is also sensible. Our aim is to exploit this sensor in applications regarding relative sliding between the touched object and the surface of the sensor, such as slip detection ([2]), and surface identification in this paper. In surface encoding, we have experimentally investigated ability of the fabric sensor in recognition touched objects via multiple machine learning algorithms, such as naive Bayes, Multi-Layer Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with input extracted from autoregressive models, and ANN with input extracted from Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT), have been trained to distinguish three typical textures. As a result, we have found that the last method outperforms the remains with an average successful rate of 90%.

The method is based on the use of pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to combine the outputs of multiple edge detection algorithms. In this way, the limitations of the individual edge detectors can be overcome and performance enhancement is achieved. Two widely used classification algorithms, the Naive Bayes Classifier and the Multi-layer Perceptron, were selected for the learning task. The proposed system was evaluated on artificial and real images. A simple class labeling system based on the output of all edge detectors is suggested to provide controllability between detection sensitivity and noise resistance. Principal Component Analysis was performed to reduce computational burden and improve detection accuracy. The method is shown to achieve a practical compromise between detection sensitivity, computational complexity, and noise immunity.

Huge amount of test data was accumulated year by year. However, students and teachers are losing their patience towards such a kind of test because test data are not utilized very well to improve their fitness and health. One important reason is that statistical analysis is not suitable for huge data set. On the contrary, data mining is considered a prospective method. In this paper, we try to make grade prediction based on physical health data to help student choosing a suitable PE class, combining statistical analysis and data mining methods. A process including correlation analysis, clustering and naive bayes based classifying is designed to fulfill this task. Experimental result shows that predicting accuracy is fairly good.

This is to help academicians organize their research papers into predefined categories based on the documents' content similarity. This paper presents the Document Categorizer Agent based on ACM CCS (Association for Computing Machinery Computing Classification System). First, we studied the ACM categories hierarchy. Next, based on these categories, we retrieved our corpus from ACM DL (ACM Digital Library) to train our Categorizer Agent using a popular machine learning technique called Naive Bayes Classifier. We used two types of training data for the corpus namely, negative training data and positive training data. Next, these papers are categorized according to their content based on the same training data. We tested our Document Categorizer Agent on a number of academic papers to test its accuracy. The result we obtained showed promising results.

This paper presents an intelligent method for analyzing and classifying vulnerabilities based on text mining technology. The proposed mechanism can automatically classify vulnerabilities into different predefined categories and obtain valuable information from abundant vulnerability texts. A series of experiments on 1060 new reported vulnerabilities in last three years by CERT are performed to demonstrate the efficiency of this mechanism. The results generated by this study can be applied to detecting multistage attack, correlating intrusion alerts, and generating attack graph.

Anomaly based intrusion detection technique is one of the building blocks of such a foundation. In this paper, the attempt has been made to apply hybrid learning approach by combining k-Medoids based clustering technique followed by Naive Bayes classification technique. Because of the fact that k-Medoids clustering techniques represent the real world scenario of data distribution, the proposed enhanced approach will group the whole data into corresponding clusters more accurately than k-Means such that it results in a better classification.

Anomaly intrusion detection approaches have the advantage of detecting previously unknown or new attacks, but suffer from the possible high false alarms due to the problem of behavior drifting and the difficulty of building an adaptive model. In this paper, we propose a model based on the data mining technique - naive Bayes classification to classify an input event (system call sequences generated from privileged processes) as "normal" or "anomalous" to detect system anomalous behavior. The independent frequency of each system call from a process collected under the normal conditions is the basis for the classifier. The ratio of the probability of a sequence from a process and the probability NOT from the process serves as the input of a fuzzy system for the classification. Experimental results in a data set consisting of both normal and intrusion traces show that the model can successfully detect most of intrusion traces with a very low false alarm rate.

But the structure of HMM limits the usage of global knowledge including the sentiment analysis of the text, which has become an increasingly popular research topic in NLP now. In this paper, we propose a novel treatment of HMM model to use the result of sentimental subjectivity analysis in syntactic level task, i.e. part-of-speech (POS) tagging. The subjectivity information is introduced as a pre-classification procedure into the interval-type HMM. The subjectivity degree of the testing sentence is used as a combination factor to choose an appropriate value from the interval. Experiments results on public tagging data sets shows that the proposed approach enhanced the performance of POS tagging.

In order to assist the human's limited cognitive ability, we are trying to develop a human augmented cognition system that aims to provide the appropriate information actively corresponding to what user intents to do. In this paper, we mainly address the probabilistic human intention modeling for cognitive augmentation, and its overall process. The types of implicit intention such as navigational and informational intention can be predicted by using fixation count and length induced by eyeball movement. Also, the gradient of pupil size variation is used to detect the transition point between navigational intent and the informational intent. A Naive Bayes classifier is used as a tool for the extraction of query keywords to search and retrieve specific information from personalized knowledge database according to the successive series of attended objects according to a specific informational intent in a situation. The experimental results show that the probabilistic human intention model is suitable for achieving the ultimate purpose of the cognitive augmentation.

Several interesting works were performed to address different issues in Sentiment Analysis. Nevertheless, the problem of Unbalanced Data Sets was not enough tackled within this research area. This paper presents the study we have carried out to address the problem of unbalanced data sets in supervised sentiment classification in a multi-lingual context. We propose three different methods to under-sample the majority class documents. These methods are Remove Similar, Remove Farthest and Remove by Clustering. Our goal is to compare the effectiveness of the proposed methods with the common random under-sampling. We also aim to evaluate the behavior of the classifiers toward different under-sampling rates. We use three different common classifiers, namely Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines and k-Nearest Neighbors. The experiments are carried out on two Arabic data sets and an English data set. We show that the four under-sampling methods are typically competitive. Naive Bayes is shown as insensitive to unbalanced data sets. But Support Vector Machines seems to be highly sensitive to unbalanced data sets; k-Nearest Neighbors shows a slight sensitivity to imbalance in comparison with Support Vector Machines.

In this paper the effect of feature selection on the accuracy of NaiveBayes, Artificial Neural Network as Multilayer Perceptron, and J48 decision tree classifiers is presented. These classifiers are compared with fifteen real datasets which are pre-processed with feature selection methods. Up to 15.55% improvement in classification accuracy is observed, and Multilayer Perceptron appears to be the most sensitive classifier to feature selection.

Some meaningful discussions and analysis have been done by carrying out a series of experiments especially focusing on problems such as the effectiveness of the algorithm, the effects of image contrast stretching on vegetation detection, the generality problem of samples training and so on. By comparing with another detection method which is based on visual cognition features, it proves the availability and the validity of this method. Last, by applying the result of vegetation detection to landslide monitoring, we can effectively eliminate the vegetation's interference with landslide deformation monitoring. The experimental results show that the vegetation detection algorithm presented in this paper can almost extract the vegetation regions from close-range images and the result is satisfying.

The first method is the use of the entire new dataset. The second one is related to the consideration that each single classifier is able to select new samples starting from those on which it performs a miss-classification. Finally, by inspecting the multi expert system behavior, a sample misclassified by an expert, is used to update that classifier only if it produces a miss-classification by the ensemble of classifiers. This paper provides a comparison of three approaches under different conditions on two state of the art classifiers (SVM and Naive Bayes) by taking into account four different combination techniques. Experiments have been performed by considering the CEDAR (handwritten digit) database. It is shown how results depend by the amount of the new training samples, as well as by the specific combination decision schema and by classifiers in the ensemble.

The rationale of this approach follows from the observation that appropriately diverse classifiers make uncorrelated errors. Unfortunately, this theoretical assumption is not easy to satisfy in practical cases, thus reducing the performance obtainable with any combination strategy. In this paper we propose a new weighted majority vote rule which try to solve this problem by jointly analyzing the responses provided by all the experts, in order to capture their collective behavior when classifying a sample. Our rule associates a weight to each class rather than to each expert and computes such weights by estimating the joint probability distribution of each class with the set of responses provided by all the experts in the combining pool. The probability distribution has been computed by using the naive Bayes probabilistic model. Despite its simplicity, this model has been successfully used in many practical applications, often competing with much more sophisticated techniques. The experimental results, performed by using three standard databases of handwritten digits, confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.	[De Stefano, C.; Fontanella, F.; di Freca, A.

However the analysis of speech at the acoustic level could be not enough to determine the emotion of a user speaking in a realistic scenario. In this paper we analysed the spontaneous speech recordings of the FAU Aibo Corpus at the acoustic and linguistic levels to extract two sets of acoustic and linguistic features. The acoustic set was reduced by a greedy procedure selecting the most relevant features to optimize the learning stage. We experimented with three classification approaches: Naive-Bayes, a support vector machine and a logistic model tree, and two fusion schemes: decision-level fusion, merging the hard-decisions of the acoustic and linguistic classifiers by means of a decision tree; and feature-level fusion, concatenating both sets of features before the learning stage. Despite the low performance achieved by the linguistic data, a dramatic improvement was achieved after its combination with the acoustic information, improving the results achieved by this second modality on its own. The results achieved by the classifiers using the parameters merged at feature level outperformed the classification results of the decision-level fusion scheme, despite the simplicity of the scheme.

Today most of the intrusion detection approaches focused on the issues of feature selection or reduction, since some of the features are irrelevant and redundant which results lengthy detection process and degrades the performance of an intrusion detection system (IDS). The purpose of this study is to identify important reduced input features in building IDS that is computationally efficient and effective. For this we investigate the performance of three standard feature selection methods using Correlation-based Feature Selection, Information Gain and Gain Ratio. In this paper we propose method Feature Vitality Based Reduction Method, to identify important reduced input features. We apply one of the efficient classifier naive bayes on reduced datasets for intrusion detection. Empirical results show that selected reduced attributes give better performance to design IDS that is efficient and effective for network intrusion detection. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Even though there are Bayesian inference algorithms than can handle continuous variables, performance tends to be better when these variables are discretized that when they are assumed to follow a specific distribution. On the other hand, the choice of the discretization method and the number of discretized intervals may lead to significantly different estimating results. However, discretization issues are seldom mentioned in software engineering effort estimation models. Aim: This paper seeks to show that discretization issues are important in terms of prediction accuracy while building a Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) for estimating software effort. Method: For this purpose, a NBC model has been developed for software effort estimation based on ISBSG projects applying different discretization schemes (equal width intervals, equal frequency intervals, and k-means clustering) and using different number of intervals. Results: Regarding the NBC model built, the estimation accuracy of equal frequency discretization is only improved by k-means clustering with respect to Pred(0.25), although it reflects better the original distribution. Conclusions: Further experimentation should determine the potential of clustering methods already highlighted in other fields.

They are everywhere in most fields of society and have big impact on those around them. Although a lot of effort has been made on identifying important users, the efficient methods still need to be developed, especially for the web users from Sina microblog, which is the most popular social networking sites in China and has unique characteristics. In this paper, a machine learning-based method which only uses several attributes on Naive Bayes Classifiers (NBC) and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) was proposed to identify important users. Initial experiments indicate that our method is effective. The result of "high" category has more than 55% accuracy rate. We find the NBC can identify more important users while BPNN has higher accuracy rate. What's more, the numbers of follower and followings in Sina microblog is independent.

In this paper, we present a domain independent, statistical approach for automatic keyphrase extraction from audio transcripts of video lectures. We identify new features in audio transcripts, that capture key patterns characterizing keyphrases in lecture videos. A system for keyphrase extraction is designed that uses a supervised machine learning algorithm, based on a Naive-Bayes classifier to extract relevant keyphrases. Our extensive experimental studies show that our system extracts more relevant keywords than existing approaches. The paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed keyphrase extraction method for different categories of lectures. The extracted keyphrases are used further as features for automatic topic based segmentation of the video lectures. This process of automatic keyphrase extraction and segmentation results in a section-wise annotated video lecture which can be effectively viewed in a lecture browser.

One of the major learning disabilities found related to learners is the problem of reading which in turn affects the performance in mathematical domain. Solving math word problems is highly essential for learning the concepts of day to day activities. Training is an ideal remedy for helping people with learning disabilities. Also, estimating the difficulty level of questions and identifying the suitable questions of appropriate grade level are important tasks of training. This paper focuses on a novel application of Naive Bayes Classifier in classifying math word problems based on readability of the question.	[Nandhini, K.; Balasundaram, S.

This disease occurs when the diameter narrowing of one of the left anterior descending, left circumflex, or right coronary arteries is equal to or greater than 50 percent. Angiography is the principal diagnostic modality for the stenosis of heart vessels; however, because of its complications and costs, researchers are looking for alternative methods such as data mining. This study conducts data mining algorithms on the Z-Alizadeh Sani dataset which has been collected from 303 random visitors to Tehran's Shaheed Rajaei Cardiovascular, Medical and Research Center. In this paper, the reason of effectiveness of a preprocessing algorithm on the dataset is investigated. This algorithm which has been merely introduced in our previous works, extracts three new features from the dataset. These features are then used to enrich the primary dataset in order to achieve more accurate results. Moreover, despite the fact that misclassification of diseased patients has more side effects than that of healthy ones, to the best of our knowledge cost-sensitive algorithms have yet to be used in this field. Therefore, in this paper 10-fold cross validation on cost-sensitive algorithms along with base classifiers of Naive Bayes, Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and C4.5 were employed. As a result, the SMO algorithm has yield to very high sensitivity (97.22%) and accuracy (92.09%) rates, the likes of which have not been reported simultaneously in the existing literature.

However, the current BCI systems still have a very low accuracy on the recognition of facial expressions and thoughts. This makes it very difficult to use these devices to enable safe and robust commands of complex devices such as an Intelligent Wheelchair. This paper presents an approach to expand the use of a brain computer interface for driving an intelligent wheelchair by patients suffering from cerebral palsy. The approach was based on appropriate signal preprocessing based on Hjorth parameters, a forward approach for variable selection and several data mining algorithms for classification such as naive Bayes, neural networks and support vector machines. Experiments were performed using 30 individuals suffering from IV and V degrees of cerebral palsy on the Gross Motor Function (GMF) measure. The results achieved showed that the preprocessing and variable selection methods were effective enabling to improve the results of a commercial BCI product by 57%. With the developed system it was also possible for users to perform a circuit in a simulated environment using just facial expressions and thoughts.

Moreover, the significant of SFS short for 'sequential feature selection' is experimental explored along with Naive Bayes capability as classifier. Initial findings showed that classification task based on Naive Bayes is extremely competitive based on the highest accuracy rate attained specifically 93.75% through sequential feature selection and 84.38% otherwise. This finding confirmed that Naive Bayes precisely with SFS is among the most suitable classifier for detection of abnormal gait pattern in PD.

Most of the Current text classification techniques concentrated on centralized/hierarchical approach. Due to the limited computing resources, these approaches could not classify large amount of data. The hierarchical approaches are also less robust and vulnerable due to system failure. We present a distributed documents classification technique using Multi-Agent technology. Naive Bays Classifier is used in a distributed environment for document classification. Experimental results show that the proposed technique is more robust, efficient and effective.

However, the present article reports speaker identification task from film dialogue which includes textual features only. We have used a text corpus of film scripts, extracted from the IMSDb archive and annotated with speakers. As different characters in a script exhibit various linguistic styles while speaking, we have incorporated the stylistic features that are extracted from the turns of various characters. These features include frequency based information commonly used in author identification task as well as the part-of-speech (POS) information of turn text. The k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), Naive Bayes' (NB) and Conditional Random Field (CRF) classifiers have been employed for identifying the speakers from the dialogue scripts at turn levels. All the supervised classifiers outperform the baseline system that was developed using a simple randomization technique.

The feature selection methods referenced here improve the accuracy of majority classes and meanwhile decrease the accuracy in minority classes as the cost. As a result, it brings about the multi-class imbalance problem. In this paper, main contributions include two aspects below. 1) An evaluation criterion based on information theory was proposed to assess how much do one feature bias towards one class. 2) A new feature selection method named BFS was proposed to reduce features and alleviate multi-class imbalance. BFS was compared with fast correlation-based filter (FCBF) and full feature set using Naive Bayes and ten skewed datasets. The results show that 1) BFS is more advantage to maintain the balance of multi-class classification results than FCBF, such as the reduction of g-mean is just about 8% using BFS, 2) classification accuracy of Naive Bayes using BFS can achieve to 90%.

To address this issue, several coding support systems have been proposed across the literature. However, these systems are based on text processing methods that may be limited by poor text quality, ambiguity and lack of annotated resources. As electronic health record systems tend to implement more structured data formats, we propose a methodology for coding support based on structured clinical data collected during inpatient care from a semi-structured electronic health record. We follow a statistical learning paradigm and investigate several building blocks of the methodology to assess the feasibility of the approach. We present and discuss preliminary results obtained with real data extracted from an Internal Medicine department and identify several measures to further develop the methodology, model performance and generalizability.

Because of the presence of unreliable interactions in PPI networks, multi-functionality of proteins, and complex connectivity of the PPI network, the task is very challenging. In this study, we tackle the presence of unreliable interactions in protein complex using Genetic-Algorithm Fuzzy Naive Bayes (GAFNB) which takes unreliability into consideration. Many existing methods can provide lots of candidate subgraphs. So we focused on how to classify the protein complexes from the subgraphs by considering the fuzzy attribute of PPI. We experimented with two datasets of size 10,371 and 986, each containing 493 positive protein complexes from MIPS and TAP-MS datasets. We compared the performance of GAFNB with Naive Bayes (NB). Results show that GAFNB performed better which indicates that a fuzzy model is more suitable when unreliability is present. It is necessary to consider the unreliability in identifying protein complexes.

In the current scenario data is growing exponentially due to the rise of internet rich applications. One such source of information is the blogs. Blogs are web logs maintained by their authors that contain information related to a certain topic and also contain authors view about that topic. Micro blogs, on the other hands, are variations of blogs that contain smaller data as compared to blogs. In this project, Twitter, a micro blogging website has been targeted to gather information on certain trending topics. The information is in the form of tweets. A tweet is a post or an update on status on the Twitter website. These tweets are extracted using Twitter Search APIs. This data is then classified into different classes based on its content. Using the classified data, features are extracted from the tweets and suggestions are given to the users based on the trending topics.	[Tseng, Chris; Patel, Nishant; Paranjape, Hrishikesh; Lin, T.

Also, we introduce a fusion at classification level between these classifiers to get the most suitable multi-classifier approach for each data set. The experimental results show that in the classification using fusion of MLP and J48 with the PCA is superior to the other classifiers using WBC data set. The PCA is used in WBC dataset as a features reduction transformation method in which combines a set of correlated features. The selected attributes are: Uniformity of Cell Size, Mitoses, Clump thickness, Bare Nuclei, Single Epithelial cell size, Marginal adhesion, Bland Chromatin and Class. In WDBC data set the results show that the classification using SMO only or using fusion of SMO and MLP or SMO and IBK is superior to the other classifiers. In WPBC data set the results show that the classification using fusion of MLP, J48, SMO and IBK is superior to the other classifiers. All experiments are conducted in WEKA data mining tool.

Predicting the sentiment in sentences based on words: An Exploratory Study on ANEW and ANET	3RD IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COGNITIVE INFOCOMMUNICATIONS (COGINFOCOM 2012)			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Infocommunications (CogInfoCom)	DEC 02-05, 2012	Kosice, SLOVAKIA	IEEE				Current practices for sentiment prediction from text mostly involve words-in-a-bag approach that utilize techniques such as support vector machines or naive Bayes. In this study, ANET (Affective Norms for English Text) sentence ratings of pleasure and arousal are compared with ANEW (Affective Norms for English Words) word ratings using regression and single layer neural networks. The sentences in ANET are decomposed into their words to obtain valence and arousal ratings from ANEW. A stop list is formed for non-words as well as words that are not found in ANEW. Then we studied whether the sentence sentiment reflected in terms of valence and arousal can be predicted from the sentiment of words in the sentence. Using linear regression, we found that approximately 35% of the variance in ANET valence and arousal ratings can be explained by ANEW valence and arousal ratings. Furthermore, Pearson correlation coefficient for ANEW and ANET ratings are similar for both valence and arousal, and close to 0.6. We also trained neural networks to investigate if non-linear approximations improved prediction of sentence sentiments from the constituent words. Out of several feedforward neural network configurations, a network with 200 hidden layer nodes turned out to be capable of identifying sentence sentiments accurately: the words' valence and arousal values explained 88 % of the variance in the sentences' valence ratings and 91 % of the variance in the sentences' arousal ratings. This preliminary study indicates that a proper choice of neural network might be adequate to estimate sentiments of sentences from sentiments of words.

User Traffic Classification for Proxy-Server based Internet Access Control	6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS (ICSPCS'2012)			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)	DEC 12-14, 2012	Gold Coast, AUSTRALIA	IEEE, IEEE Commun Soc, Univ Nebraska, Peter Kiewit Inst		Internet access control; Abuse reduction; Fairness; Network Traffic Modelling; Proxy server	PRIORITY CONTROL; MANAGEMENT	In a LAN, Internet access should be managed weil for a better user experience. Those using a larger share of the bandwidth may be restricted during peak hours to enable others to use the Internet. This can be viewed as a problem of classifying the users based on their Internet usage into normal and high categories, following which control policies may be applied. For this purpose, a proxy-based mechanism has been proposed for classification of users according to the share of their Internet access. The advantage of this approach is that users sharing the same computer can be distinguished by the proxy server and appropriate control policies can be exercised. To understand user behaviour, data is collected at the proxy server in a campus LAN. Machine learning algorithms are then used to learn and characterise user behaviour. In particular, Naive Bayes' and Gaussian Mixture Model based classifiers are used. It is observed that the algorithms are able to scale in that users are clustered into two different groups. Performance evaluation on a held out data set indicates that users can be accurately distinguished 94.96% of the time. The algorithm is also practical since the time consuming task of model building need be done only once a month offiine, while the daily task of classification may be accomplished in a period of 20 mins for GMMs. It has also been shown how the user behavior of the two groups of users may be characterized. This would be a useful aid in the design of policies and algorithms for Internet access control.	[Sait, Saad Y.; Kumar, M.

This paper presents a generic classification model based on a rough set approach and decision rules. To increase the efficiency of the classification process, boolean reasoning discretization algorithm is used to discretize the data sets. The approach is tested by a comparatif study of three different classifiers (decision rules, naive bayes and k-nearest neighbor) over three distinct discretization techniques (equal bigning, entropy and boolean reasoning). The rough set reduction technique is applied to find all the reducts of the data which contains the minimal subset of attributes that are associated with a class label for prediction. In this paper we adopt the genetic algorithms approach to reach reducts. Finally, decision rules were used as a classifier to evaluate the performance of the predicted reducts and classes. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we present tests on breast cancer data set. The experimental results obtained, show that the overall classification accuracy offered by the employed rough set approach and decision rules is high compared with other classification techniques including Bayes and k-nearest neighbor.

The proposed hybrid approach refines the output of multiclass classification that is based on the usage of Naive Bayes classifier for automatically labeling images with a number of words. Each input image is segmented using the normalized cuts segmentation algorithm in order to create a descriptor for each segment. One Naive Bayes classifier is trained for all the classes. Particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed as a search strategy in order to identify an optimal weighting for classes probabilities from Naive Bayes classifier.

However, automatically predicting appropriate voices for storybook characters is both a non-trivial and largely unexplored problem. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for predicting the most appropriate voices for characters in children's stories based on salient character attributes. We use Mechanical Turk to identify the character attributes that are most salient in evoking the listeners' perception that a specific character should have a particular voice, and to label the voices in our collection with attribute tags. We model the attribute-to-voice relationship with Naive Bayes. The resulting system performs significantly above chance in an objective evaluation, demonstrating the viability of our approach.

Child-directed speech (CDS) is speech that is directed by caregivers towards infants. It is not uncommon for corpora used in child language development studies to have a combination of CDS and non-CDS. As the size of the corpora used in these studies grow, manual annotation of CDS becomes impractical. Our automatic CDS detector addresses this issue. The focus of this paper is to propose and evaluate different sets of features for the detection of CDS, using several off-the-shelf classifiers. First, we look at the performance of a set of acoustic features. We continue by combining these acoustic features with several linguistic and eventually contextual features. Using the full set of features, our CDS detector was able to correctly identify CDS with an accuracy of .88 and F1 score of .87 using Naive Bayes.

From the view of application, we can use mathematical models to forecast the update time of news reports, although it can not be completely accurate. In this paper, we proposed a combined predict algorithm for news update. Firstly, we applied the Exponential Smoothing method to our dataset. Secondly, we leveraged the Naive Bayes Model for prediction. Finally, we combined two methods for Combination Forecasting. Through the experiments, we show that Combination Forecasting method outperforms other methods while estimating localized rate of updates.

The analytical chain comprising a liquid chromatograph and a mass spectrometer in Selected Reaction Monitoring mode is modelled, integrating an implicit hierarchy. We solve the inverse problem by the means of full-Bayesian statistics, resorting to stochastic sampling algorithms for the numerical computations. We compare our joint Inversion-Classification to state-of-the-art methods (Naive Bayes, logistic regression, fuzzy c-means) using sequential estimations and show very encouraging results on simulated multi-class data.

That characterization consists of a high order dissimilarity called dissimilarity increment; this dissimilarity measure uses information from three points at a time, unlike typical distances which are pairwise measures. In practice, in this model, the likelihood of a point not only depends of its direct k neighbors, but also of the nearest neighbor of each one of its k neighbors. Experimental results show that the proposed classifier outperforms more traditional and simple classifiers like Naive Bayes and k-nearest neighbor classifiers. This improved performance is especially noticeable relative to k-NN when k is poorly chosen.

We have used both pre-existing data sets and our own dataset collection comprising of a large number of user reviews for Hindi movies. The Naive Bayes and SVM approaches were implemented in multiple folds. The results, in addition to presenting a detailed comparative view of these techniques, demonstrate that with suitable selection of features the Naive Bayes algorithm performs reasonably well and at times matches the popularly believed superior performance level of SVM, at least for sentiment analysis task. The SO-PMI-IR algorithm produces substantially accurate sentiment classification without the requirement of any prior training. The accuracy of SO-PMI-IR however depends on POS tags used as features and thresholding/aggregation schemes used.	[Waila, P.; Singh, M.

The system consisted of a CCD color camera with a high frame rate, two lamps, an incremental encoder and a data acquisition card. The system was implemented toward the development of an advanced citrus yield mapping system. Such yield mapping system is one of the viable precision technologies that allows the citrus grower to efficiently manage in-grove spatial variability of different factors such as soil type, soil fertility, moisture content, etc., and helps increase yield and profit. Thus, an image processing algorithm was developed to identify citrus fruit in images acquired in a commercial citrus grove located in Fort Basinger, Florida. Supervised machine learning algorithms, such as naive Bayes classifier, artificial neural network and decision tree, were utilized to implement fruit detection and segmentation. For the fruit mass estimation, an equation mapping fruit pixel area to fruit mass was established through a mass calibration process. Using the mapping equation, the fruit mass was estimated. The R-2 values in mass estimation using naive Bayes and artificial neural network yielded more than 0.92, whereas decision tree based mass estimation resulted in the R-2 of 0.804.	[Shin, J.

There are many supervised Machine Learning (ML) techniques that has been used to solve Text Categorization (TC) problem. The complex morphology of Arabic language and its large vocabulary size makes using these techniques difficult and costly in time and attempt. We have investigated Bayesian learning which is based on Bayesian theorem to deal with Arabic ATC problem. Bayesian learning classifiers that have been applied are Multivariate Guess Naive Bayes (MGNB), Flexible Bayes (FB), Multivariate Bernoulli Naive Bayes (MBNB), and Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB). For text representation in terms of word level N-Gram, 1-Gram, 2-Gram and 3-Gram have been used. For Arabic stemming, a simple stemmer called TREC-2002 Light Stemmer is used in the prototype. For feature selection we have used several feature selection techniques i.e. Chi-Square Statistic (CHI), Odd Ratio (OR), Mutual Information (MI), and GSS Coefficient (GSS). The results showed that FB outperforms MNB, MBNB, and MGNB. The experimental results of this work proved that using word level n-gram for ATC based on Bayesian learning leads to acceptable results.

Some brain diseases are caused by changing of the ventricle shape or volume. The ventricle shape and volume are used to diagnose patients who have brain diseases. This paper proposes an algorithm of digital image processing for segmentation of a ventricle from CT brain images. The process starts with normalizing the CT brain images and extracts the region of interest using profile of gray level. In the segmentation step, we apply Bayesian segmentation to classify intensities into 3 classes: white matter, gray matter, and CSF. The proposed algorithm segments the area of CSF that is obtained by the posterior probability from Bayes' rule. Finally, the ventricle is evaluated with the relatively ground truth from a neurologists. Our experimental results from the proposed algorithm reveal a low error of 3.14% and a standard deviation of 1.41.

In the process, the selection of a smaller set of independent features is a necessary, yet challenging, step for feature combination, situation analysis and decision making. In this paper, we investigate feature selection methods using both concepts of correlation and diversity. Six feature combination methods (C4.5, Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Function, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbors and Combinatorial Fusion) are applied to the selected features in the detection of the stress levels. Our results demonstrated that (a) diversity based feature selection is as good as correlation based selection across all six combination methods, and (b) combinatorial fusion method performs better than five other combination methods across all features selected by using both correlation and diversity.

The students normally make answers on questionnaire that are divided into types; close-end question and open-end question. The close-end question is simple answer as multi-choices that are easily processed by statistical evaluation. On the other hand, open-end question gives the person answering in phrases or statements that are recommended their teacher. The problem is mostly LMS ignored these open-end questions to overall analysis. Therefore, analysis and processing of these open-end questions are very importance and determined teaching. This research presents analysis model for teaching evaluation from answering and posting a comment to discussion in form of open-end question obtained from moodle LMS forum using data mining techniques. The techniques extract classification of attitudes that are defined positive and negative attitude from students to instructor for improvement of learning and teaching. These classification models are compared three algorithms; ID3, BFTree and Naive Bayes. The experimental results, the decision tree is achieved correctly classifier 80% compared with others.

Reports indicate that up to 90% of the World Wide Web email traffic is spam [1]. The contents are covering a wider range and are deviating from the conventional pharmaceuticals and adult content into more formal marketing campaigns. This illegal advertising is evolving into an underground market for bot masters who rent or sell spam agents. Progressively, spam campaigns engage new methods to ensure efficient mass delivery and dodge conventional spam detectors. They employ very complicated and vast infrastructure of Botnets and Fast Flux Networks to deliver as many emails as possible. The main concerns for spam detection process are detection and misclassification accuracies, and those remain a challenge because of the evolving techniques employed by spammers. In this paper we propose a bit-parallel string matching spam filtering system based on the improved Baez a-Yates and Navarro approximate string matching algorithm. This method has a low computational cost, is easy to implement, and has the potential to catch misspelled keywords. The proposed approach achieves 97.2% overall accuracy with a simple Naive Bayes classifier.

Previous work has proposed several bug fix-time prediction models that had taken into consideration various bug report attributes (e. g. severity, number of developers, dependencies) in order to know which bug to fix first and how long it will take to fix it. Our aim is to distinguish the very fast and the very slow bugs in order to prioritize which bugs to start with and which to exclude at the mean time respectively. We used the data of four systems taken from three large open source projects Mozilla, Eclipse, Gnome. We used naive Bayes classifier to compute our prediction model.

Textual posts express authors' opinions (with or against) or feeling (love, hate, optimism, pessimism, or anger). Such opinions are important for commercial and governmental organization since they help checking public opinion about a product, policy or an object in general. In this paper we present the application of two different approaches to classify Arabic Facebook posts. The first one depends on syntactic features, using common patterns used in different Arabic dialects to express opinions. These patterns achieved high accuracy in determining the polarity of a sentiment even when tested against new corpus. This approach acts on informal Arabic text, which has not been addressed before. Different setups were tried and the highest coverage and accuracy achieved were 49.5% and 83.4 % respectively. The second approach is an ordinary probabilistic model, Naive-Bayes classifier, that assumes the independence of features in determining the class the highest coverage achieved in this approach was 60.5% in the first setup and 91.2% when Naive search was used as a binary classifier to classify the posts as objective or subjective.

Improper execution could lead to very costly and difficult diagnosis of robot failures. In this paper a solution for the problem of dealing with noisy in robotics execution failures from a stochastic sampling (STOCHS) or probabilistic point of view is derived. Our experimental results show the STOCHS algorithm as more robust to noise compared to machine learning techniques (or classifiers) such as decision trees and naive Bayes classifier with the performance of RIPPER as substantially inferior.

Combined Naive Bayes and logistic regression for quantitative breast sonography	2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL ULTRASONICS SYMPOSIUM (IUS)	IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)	OCT 07-10, 2012	Dresden, GERMANY	IEEE		quantitative breast ultrasound; computer-aided diagnosis; breast cancer; machine learning	COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS; MASSES; BENIGN; LESIONS; NODULES	Sonography is commonly used as an adjunct to mammography for early detection of breast cancer. We are developing methods to classify solid breast masses in sonograms as malignant or benign. The goal of this study was to combine two independent probabilistic classifiers to improve computer-aided diagnosis of breast masses. Naive Bayes and logistic regression were used for supervised classification of masses from extracted morphological sonographic features, in combination with mammographic BI-RADS (categories 1 to 5) and patient age. Solid masses with biopsy-proven diagnoses were analyzed. Training and testing were performed using leave-one-out cross validation. Diagnostic performance was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). Agreement between predictions from the two classifiers was used to differentiate benign and malignant masses. The results show that logistic regression and Naive Bayes performed with ROC area of 0.902 +/- 0.023 and 0.865 +/- 0.027, respectively. The combined use of logistic regression and Naive Bayes demonstrated reduction in biopsies by 48%, with malignancy missed in 2% of cases (false negative rate of 6.4%).

In intelligent vehicles, ATR can be a solution to identify pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, etc. Typically radar ATR relies on classifying the characteristics of the target obtained from the backscattered signal. In this paper, we apply Matrix Pencil Method (MPM) to extract complex natural resonances (CNRs) from the late time part of the backscattered field, which is characteristic of the studied target and can be used for its recognition and identification. Next, we compare three classification methods of CNRs: support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Naive Bayes classification.	[Khodjet-Kesba, M.; Chahine, K.; Drissi, K.

There is an increasing interest in understanding the mechanism of action of co-regulator proteins, which do not bind DNA directly, but exert their effects by binding to transcription factors such as the estrogen receptor (ER). However, due to the nature of detecting indirect protein-DNA interaction, ChIP-seq signals from co-regulators can be relatively weak and thus biologically meaningful interactions remain difficult to identify. Results: In this study, we investigated and compared different statistical and machine learning approaches including unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised classification (self-training) approaches to integrate multiple types of genomic and transcriptomic information derived from our experiments and public database to overcome difficulty of identifying functional DNA binding sites of the co-regulator SRC-1 in the context of estrogen response. Our results indicate that supervised learning with naive Bayes algorithm significantly enhances peak calling of weak ChIP-seq signals and outperforms other machine learning algorithms. Our integrative approach revealed many potential ER alpha/SRC-1 DNA binding sites that would otherwise be missed by conventional peak calling algorithms with default settings. Conclusions: Our results indicate that a supervised classification approach enables one to utilize limited amounts of prior knowledge together with multiple types of biological data to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of the identification of DNA binding sites from co-regulator proteins.

Tactile Discrimination Using Active Whisker Sensors	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Bayesian methods; biomimetics; classification algorithms; robotics; sensor systems and applications; tactile sensors	ROUGHNESS DISCRIMINATION; RHYTHMIC WHISKING; RAT-VIBRISSAE; BEHAVIOR; CONTACT; SYSTEM; TOUCH; EXPLORATION; MOVEMENTS; ROBOT	We describe a novel, biomimetic tactile sensing system modeled on the facial whiskers (vibrissae) of animals such as rats and mice. The "BIOTACT Sensor" consists of a conical array of modular, actuated hair-like elements, each instrumented at the base to accurately detect deflections of the shaft by whisker-surface contacts. A notable characteristic of this array is that, like the biological sensory system it mimics, the whiskers are moved back-and-forth ("whisked") so as to make repeated, brief contacts with surfaces of interest. Furthermore, these movements are feedback-modulated in a manner intended to emulate some of the "active sensing" control strategies observed in whiskered animals. We show that accurate classification of surface texture using data obtained from whisking against three different surfaces is achievable using classifiers based on either naive Bayes or template methods. Notably, the performance of both these approaches to classify textures after training on as few as one or two surface contacts was improved when the whisking motion was controlled using a sensory feedback mechanism. We conclude that active vibrissal sensing could likewise be a useful sensory capacity for autonomous robots.	[Sullivan, J.

J	Alvares-Cherman, E; Metz, J; Monard, MC				Alvares-Cherman, Everton; Metz, Jean; Monard, Maria Carolina			Incorporating label dependency into the binary relevance framework for multi-label classification	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Machine learning; Multi-label classification; Binary relevance; Label dependency	CATEGORIZATION	In multi-label classification, examples can be associated with multiple labels simultaneously. The task of learning from multi-label data can be addressed by methods that transform the multi-label classification problem into several single-label classification problems. The binary relevance approach is one of these methods, where the multi-label learning task is decomposed into several independent binary classification problems, one for each label in the set of labels, and the final labels for each example are determined by aggregating the predictions from all binary classifiers. However, this approach fails to consider any dependency among the labels. Aiming to accurately predict label combinations, in this paper we propose a simple approach that enables the binary classifiers to discover existing label dependency by themselves. An experimental study using decision trees, a kernel method as well as Naive Bayes as base-learning techniques shows the potential of the proposed approach to improve the multi-label classification performance.

J	Jiang, LX				Jiang, Liangxiao			Learning Instance Weighted Naive Bayes from labeled and unlabeled data	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Semi-supervised learning; Unlabeled data; Naive Bayes; Instance Weighted Naive Bayes (IWNB); Class membership probability; Classification	CLASSIFICATION	In real-world data mining applications, it is often the case that unlabeled instances are abundant, while available labeled instances are very limited. Thus, semi-supervised learning, which attempts to benefit from large amount of unlabeled data together with labeled data, has attracted much attention from researchers. In this paper, we propose a very fast and yet highly effective semi-supervised learning algorithm. We call our proposed algorithm Instance Weighted Naive Bayes (simply IWNB). IWNB firstly trains a naive Bayes using the labeled instances only. And the trained naive Bayes is used to estimate the class membership probabilities of the unlabeled instances. Then, the estimated class membership probabilities are used to label and weight unlabeled instances. At last, a naive Bayes is trained again using both the originally labeled data and the (newly labeled and weighted) unlabeled data. Our experimental results based on a large number of UCI data sets show that IWNB often improves the classification accuracy of original naive Bayes when available labeled data are very limited.

Classification algorithms for predicting sleepiness and sleep apnea severity	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						correlation; distribution; mutual information	EPWORTH SLEEPINESS; HEART HEALTH; LATENCY TEST; DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; RISK-FACTORS; SCALE; ASSOCIATION; PREVALENCE; STROKE; ADULTS	Identifying predictors of subjective sleepiness and severity of sleep apnea are important yet challenging goals in sleep medicine. Classification algorithms may provide insights, especially when large data sets are available. We analyzed polysomnography and clinical features available from the Sleep Heart Health Study. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the apneahypopnea index were the targets of three classifiers: k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes and support vector machine algorithms. Classification was based on up to 26 features including demographics, polysomnogram, and electrocardiogram (spectrogram). Naive Bayes was best for predicting abnormal Epworth class (010 versus 1124), although prediction was weak: polysomnogram features had 16.7% sensitivity and 88.8% specificity; spectrogram features had 5.3% sensitivity and 96.5% specificity. The support vector machine performed similarly to naive Bayes for predicting sleep apnea class (05 versus >5): 59.0% sensitivity and 74.5% specificity using clinical features and 43.4% sensitivity and 83.5% specificity using spectrographic features compared with the naive Bayes classifier, which had 57.5% sensitivity and 73.7% specificity (clinical), and 39.0% sensitivity and 82.7% specificity (spectrogram). Mutual information analysis confirmed the minimal dependency of the Epworth score on any feature, while the apneahypopnea index showed modest dependency on body mass index, arousal index, oxygenation and spectrogram features. Apnea classification was modestly accurate, using either clinical or spectrogram features, and showed lower sensitivity and higher specificity than common sleep apnea screening tools. Thus, clinical prediction of sleep apnea may be feasible with easily obtained demographic and electrocardiographic analysis, but the utility of the Epworth is questioned by its minimal relation to clinical, electrocardiographic, or polysomnographic features.

J	Sanchis, A; Juan, A; Vidal, E				Sanchis, Alberto; Juan, Alfons; Vidal, Enrique			A Word-Based Naive Bayes Classifier for Confidence Estimation in Speech Recognition	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						Automatic speech recognition (ASR); confidence measures; naive Bayes; smoothing; posterior probabilities; word graphs	TRANSLATION; MODELS	Confidence estimation has been largely used in speech recognition to detect words in the recognized sentence that have been likely misrecognized. Confidence estimation can be seen as a conventional pattern classification problem in which a set of features is obtained for each hypothesized word in order to classify it as either correct or incorrect. We propose a smoothed naive Bayes classification model to profitably combine these features. The model itself is a combination of word-dependent (specific) and word-independent (generalized) naive Bayes models. As in statistical language modeling, the purpose of the generalized model is to smooth the (class posterior) estimates given by the specific models. Our classification model is empirically compared with confidence estimation based on posterior probabilities computed on word graphs. Empirical results clearly show that the good performance of word graph-based posterior probabilities can be improved by using the naive Bayes combination of features.

J	Kumar, G; Kumar, K				Kumar, Gulshan; Kumar, Krishan			An information theoretic approach for feature selection	SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS			English	Article						feature selection; mutual information; redundancy; relevance	MUTUAL INFORMATION; INTRUSION DETECTION; REDUNDANCY; RELEVANCE	Feature selection methods play a significant role during classification of data having high dimensions of features. The methods select most relevant subset of features that describe data appropriately. Mutual information (MI) based upon information theory is one of the metrics used for measuring relevance of features. This paper analyses various feature selection methods for (1) reduction in number of features; (2) performance of Naive Bayes classification model trained on reduced set of features. Research gaps identified are: (1) computation of MI from the whole sample space instead of unclassified sample subspace; (2) consideration of relevance of features only or tradeoff between relevance and redundancy, but class conditional interaction of features is ignored. In this paper, we propose a general evaluation function using MI for feature selection. The proposed evaluation function is implemented which use dynamically computed MI values from unclassified instances. Effectiveness of the proposed feature selection method is done empirically by comparing classification results using KDD 1999 benchmarked dataset of intrusion detection. The results indicate practicability and effectiveness of the proposed method for applications concerned with high accuracy and stability of predictions. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Jiang, LX; Cai, ZH; Wang, DH; Zhang, H				Jiang, Liangxiao; Cai, Zhihua; Wang, Dianhong; Zhang, Harry			Improving Tree augmented Naive Bayes for class probability estimation	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Naive Bayes; Tree Augmented Naive Bayes; Class probability estimation; Conditional log likelihood; Ensemble learning	ONE-DEPENDENCE ESTIMATORS; ROC CURVE; CLASSIFIERS; RANKING; AREA	Numerous algorithms have been proposed to improve Naive Bayes (NB) by weakening its conditional attribute independence assumption, among which Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN) has demonstrated remarkable classification performance in terms of classification accuracy or error rate, while maintaining efficiency and simplicity. In many real-world applications, however, classification accuracy or error rate is not enough. For example, in direct marketing, we often need to deploy different promotion strategies to customers with different likelihood (class probability) of buying some products. Thus, accurate class probability estimation is often required to make optimal decisions. In this paper, we investigate the class probability estimation performance of TAN in terms of conditional log likelihood (CLL) and present a new algorithm to improve its class probability estimation performance by the spanning TAN classifiers. We call our improved algorithm Averaged Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (ATAN). The experimental results on a large number of UCI datasets published on the main web site of Weka platform show that ATAN significantly outperforms TAN and all the other algorithms used to compare in terms of CLL.

The purpose of this study is to propose a two-stage clustering-classification model through (1) initially integrating the RFM attribute and K-means algorithm for clustering the TCS patients and (2) then integrating the global discretization method and the rough set theory for classifying hospitalized departments and optimizing health care services. To assess the performance of the proposed model, a dataset was used from a representative hospital (termed Hospital-A) that was extracted from a database from an empirical study in Taiwan comprised of 183,947 samples that were characterized by 44 attributes during 2008. The proposed model was compared with three techniques, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Multilayer Perceptron, and the empirical results showed significant promise of its accuracy. The generated knowledge-based rules provide useful information to maximize resource utilization and support the development of a strategy for decision-making in hospitals. From the findings, 75 patients in the TCS, three hospital departments, and specific diagnostic items were discovered in the data for Hospital-A. A potential determinant for gender differences was found, and the age attribute was not significant to the hospital departments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although the most common application of this system has been communicating language, the properties and constraints of the linguistic domain have not to date been exploited when decoding brain signals that pertain to language. We hypothesized that combining the standard stepwise linear discriminant analysis with a Naive Bayes classifier and a trigram language model would increase the speed and accuracy of typing with the P300 speller. With integration of natural language processing, we observed significant improvements in accuracy and 40-60% increases in bit rate for all six subjects in a pilot study. This study suggests that integrating information about the linguistic domain can significantly improve signal classification.

Linear classifiers are nearly optimal when hidden variables have diverse effects	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Learning theory; Bayes-optimal; Linear classification; Hidden variables	NAIVE BAYES; CLASSIFICATION; MODELS	We analyze classification problems in which data is generated by a two-tiered random process. The class is generated first, then a layer of conditionally independent hidden variables, and finally the observed variables. For sources like this, the Bayes-optimal rule for predicting the class given the values of the observed variables is a two-layer neural network. We show that, if the hidden variables have non-negligible effects on many observed variables, a linear classifier approximates the error rate of the Bayes optimal classifier up to lower order terms. We also show that the hinge loss of a linear classifier is not much more than the Bayes error rate, which implies that an accurate linear classifier can be found efficiently.

J	Webb, GI; Boughton, JR; Zheng, F; Ting, KM; Salem, H				Webb, Geoffrey I.; Boughton, Janice R.; Zheng, Fei; Ting, Kai Ming; Salem, Houssam			Learning by extrapolation from marginal to full-multivariate probability distributions: decreasingly naive Bayesian classification	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Bayesian learning; Classification learning; Probabilistic learning; Averaged one-dependence estimators; Naive Bayes; Semi-naive Bayesian learning; Learning without model selection; Ensemble learning; Feating	ONE-DEPENDENCE ESTIMATORS; PREDICTION	Averaged n-Dependence Estimators (AnDE) is an approach to probabilistic classification learning that learns by extrapolation from marginal to full-multivariate probability distributions. It utilizes a single parameter that transforms the approach between a low-variance high-bias learner (Naive Bayes) and a high-variance low-bias learner with Bayes optimal asymptotic error. It extends the underlying strategy of Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE), which relaxes the Naive Bayes independence assumption while retaining many of Naive Bayes' desirable computational and theoretical properties. AnDE further relaxes the independence assumption by generalizing AODE to higher-levels of dependence. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that the bias-variance trade-off for Averaged 2-Dependence Estimators results in strong predictive accuracy over a wide range of data sets. It has training time linear with respect to the number of examples, learns in a single pass through the training data, supports incremental learning, handles directly missing values, and is robust in the face of noise. Beyond the practical utility of its lower-dimensional variants, AnDE is of interest in that it demonstrates that it is possible to create low-bias high-variance generative learners and suggests strategies for developing even more powerful classifiers.

J	Bhatia, S; Mitra, P				Bhatia, Sumit; Mitra, Prasenjit			Summarizing Figures, Tables, and Algorithms in Scientific Publications to Augment Search Results	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Algorithms; Experimentation; Classification; document-element; summarization; synopses		Increasingly, special-purpose search engines are being built to enable the retrieval of document-elements like tables, figures, and algorithms [Bhatia et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2007; Hearst et al. 2007]. These search engines present a thumbnail view of document-elements, some document metadata such as the title of the papers and their authors, and the caption of the document-element. While some authors in some disciplines write carefully tailored captions, generally, the author of a document assumes that the caption will be read in the context of the text in the document. When the caption is presented out of context as in a document-element-search-engine result, it may not contain enough information to help the end-user understand what the content of the document-element is. Consequently, end-users examining document-element search results would want a short "synopsis" of this information presented along with the document-element. Having access to the synopsis allows the end-user to quickly understand the content of the document-element without having to download and read the entire document as examining the synopsis takes a shorter time than finding information about a document element by downloading, opening and reading the file. Furthermore, it may allow the end-user to examine more results than they would otherwise. In this paper, we present the first set of methods to extract this useful information (synopsis) related to document-elements automatically. We use Naive Bayes and support vector machine classifiers to identify relevant sentences from the document text based on the similarity and the proximity of the sentences with the caption and the sentences in the document text that refer to the document-element. We compare the two classification methods and study the effects of different features used. We also investigate the problem of choosing the optimum synopsis-size that strikes a balance between the information content and the size of the generated synopses. A user study is also performed to measure how the synopses generated by our proposed method compare with other state-of-the-art approaches.

Apart from factors like usability, integration with work-flow and natural language processing, lack of decision accuracy of the tools has hindered their utility. Hence, research to develop accurate algorithms for medical decision support tools, is required. Pioneering research in last two decades, has demonstrated the utility of fuzzy set theory for medical domain. Recently, Wagholikar and Deshpande proposed a fuzzy relation based method (FR) for medical diagnosis. In their case studies for heart and infectious diseases, the FR method was found to be better than naive bayes (NB). However, the datasets in their studies were small and included only categorical symptoms. Hence, more evaluative studies are required for drawing general conclusions. In the present paper, we compare the classification performance of FR with NB, for a variety of medical datasets. Our results indicate that the FR method is useful for classification problems in the medical domain, and that FR is marginally better than NB. However, the performance of FR is significantly better for datasets having high proportion of unknown attribute values. Such datasets occur in problems involving linguistic information, where FR can be particularly useful. Our empirical study will benefit medical researchers in the choice of algorithms for decision support tools.

In this paper, we work on the approach of instance weighting and propose an improved naive Bayes algorithm by discriminative instance weighting. We called it Discriminatively Weighted Naive Bayes. In each iteration of it, different training instances are discriminatively assigned different weights according to the estimated conditional probability loss. The experimental results based on a large number of UCI data sets validate its effectiveness in terms of the classification accuracy and AUC. Besides,the experimental results on the running time show that our Discriminatively Weighted Naive Bayes performs almost as efficiently as the state-of-the-art Discriminative Frequency Estimate learning method, and significantly more efficient than Boosted Naive Bayes. At last, we apply the idea of discriminatively weighted learning in our algorithm to some state-of-the-art naive Bayes text classifiers, such as multinomial naive Bayes, complement naive Bayes and the one-versus-all-but-one model, and have achieved remarkable improvements.

WEIGHTED NAIVE BAYES FOR TEXT CLASSIFICATION USING POSITIVE TERM-CLASS DEPENDENCY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS			English	Article						Text classification; text mining; naive Bayes; chi(2) statistic; performance analysis	FEATURE-SELECTION; CATEGORIZATION; CLASSIFIERS	Naive Bayes is a simple and efficient classification algorithm which performs well on text classification, which is also known as text categorization. Many researches have been done to improve the performance of the naive Bayes classifier by weighting the correlated terms, in order to relax the strong assumption of independence between terms. In this paper, we first introduce a new chi(2) statistical data, denoted by R-w,R-c, which can measure positive term-class dependency accurately, and then propose a new weighted naive Bayes classifier using R-w,R-c at the training phase. Experimental results with real data sets show that our weighted naive Bayes classifier has much better performance than the basic naive Bayes classifier in most cases.

J	Hausfeld, L; De Martino, F; Bonte, M; Formisano, E				Hausfeld, Lars; De Martino, Federico; Bonte, Milene; Formisano, Elia			Pattern analysis of EEG responses to speech and voice: Influence of feature grouping	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Machine learning; Classification; Audition; Speech	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; CLASSIFICATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; COMMUNICATION; RECORDINGS; ALGORITHMS; SELECTION	Pattern recognition algorithms are becoming increasingly used in functional neuroimaging. These algorithms exploit information contained in temporal, spatial, or spatio-temporal patterns of independent variables (features) to detect subtle but reliable differences between brain responses to external stimuli or internal brain states. When applied to the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, a choice needs to be made on how the input features to the algorithm are obtained from the signal amplitudes measured at the various channels. In this article, we consider six types of pattern analyses deriving from the combination of three types of feature selection in the temporal domain (predefined windows, shifting window, whole trial) with two approaches to handle the channel dimension (channel wise, multi-channel). We combined these different types of analyses with a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier and analyzed a multi-subject EEG data set from a study aimed at understanding the task dependence of the cortical mechanisms for encoding speaker's identity and speech content (vowels) from short speech utterances (Bonte, Valente, & Formisano, 2009). Outcomes of the analyses showed that different grouping of available features helps highlighting complementary (i.e. temporal, topographic) aspects of information content in the data. A shifting window/multi-channel approach proved especially valuable in tracing both the early build up of neural information reflecting speaker or vowel identity and the late and task-dependent maintenance of relevant information reflecting the performance of a working memory task. Because it exploits the high temporal resolution of EEG (and MEG), such a shifting window approach with sequential multi-channel classifications seems the most appropriate choice for tracing the temporal profile of neural information processing.

J	Javed, K; Babri, HA; Saeed, M				Javed, Kashif; Babri, Haroon A.; Saeed, Mehreen			Feature Selection Based on Class-Dependent Densities for High-Dimensional Binary Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Feature ranking; binary data; feature subset selection; two-stage feature selection; classification	MUTUAL INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION; REDUNDANCY; RELEVANCE	Data and knowledge management systems employ feature selection algorithms for removing irrelevant, redundant, and noisy information from the data. There are two well-known approaches to feature selection, feature ranking (FR) and feature subset selection (FSS). In this paper, we propose a new FR algorithm, termed as class-dependent density-based feature elimination (CDFE), for binary data sets. Our theoretical analysis shows that CDFE computes the weights, used for feature ranking, more efficiently as compared to the mutual information measure. Effectively, rankings obtained from both the two criteria approximate each other. CDFE uses a filtrapper approach to select a final subset. For data sets having hundreds of thousands of features, feature selection with FR algorithms is simple and computationally efficient but redundant information may not be removed. On the other hand, FSS algorithms analyze the data for redundancies but may become computationally impractical on high-dimensional data sets. We address these problems by combining FR and FSS methods in the form of a two-stage feature selection algorithm. When introduced as a preprocessing step to the FSS algorithms, CDFE not only presents them with a feature subset, good in terms of classification, but also relieves them from heavy computations. Two FSS algorithms are employed in the second stage to test the two-stage feature selection idea. We carry out experiments with two different classifiers (naive Bayes' and kernel ridge regression) on three different real-life data sets (NOVA, HIVA, and GINA) of the "Agnostic Learning versus Prior Knowledge" challenge. As a stand-alone method, CDFE shows up to about 92 percent reduction in the feature set size. When combined with the FSS algorithms in two-stages, CDFE significantly improves their classification accuracy and exhibits up to 97 percent reduction in the feature set size. We also compared CDFE against the winning entries of the challenge and found that it outperforms the best results on NOVA and HIVA while obtaining a third position in case of GINA.

In contrast to previous approaches, we maintain the normalization constraints on the parameters of the Bayesian network during optimization, i.e., the probabilistic interpretation of the model is not lost. This enables us to handle missing features in discriminatively optimized Bayesian networks. In experiments, we compare the classification performance of maximum margin parameter learning to conditional likelihood and maximum likelihood learning approaches. Discriminative parameter learning significantly outperforms generative maximum likelihood estimation for naive Bayes and tree augmented naive Bayes structures on all considered data sets. Furthermore, maximizing the margin dominates the conditional likelihood approach in terms of classification performance in most cases. We provide results for a recently proposed maximum margin optimization approach based on convex relaxation [1]. While the classification results are highly similar, our CG-based optimization is computationally up to orders of magnitude faster. Margin-optimized Bayesian network classifiers achieve classification performance comparable to support vector machines (SVMs) using fewer parameters. Moreover, we show that unanticipated missing feature values during classification can be easily processed by discriminatively optimized Bayesian network classifiers, a case where discriminative classifiers usually require mechanisms to complete unknown feature values in the data first.

Bayesian Processing of Context-Dependent Text: Reasons for Appointments Can Improve Detection of Influenza	MEDICAL DECISION MAKING			English	Article						Dependent Bayesian System; naive Bayes; text classification; reason for appointment; case definition; influenza	ELECTRONIC MEDICAL-RECORD; NARRATIVE REPORTS; CHIEF COMPLAINTS; CLASSIFICATION; SURVEILLANCE; ALGORITHMS; PNEUMONIA; SYSTEM	Objective. This article aims to examine whether words listed in reasons for appointments could effectively predict laboratory-verified influenza cases in syndromic surveillance systems. Methods. Data were collected from the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technological Application medical record system. We used 2 algorithms to combine the impact of words within reasons for appointments: Dependent (DBSt) and Independent (IBSt) Bayesian System. We used receiver operating characteristic curves to compare the accuracy of these 2 methods of processing reasons for appointments against current and previous lists of diagnoses used in the Department of Defense's syndromic surveillance system. Results. We examined 13,096 cases, where the results of influenza tests were available. Each reason for an appointment had an average of 3.5 words (standard deviation = 2.2 words). There was no difference in performance of the 2 algorithms. The area under the curve for IBSt was 0.58 and for DBSt was 0.56. The difference was not statistically significant (McNemar statistic = 0.0054; P = 0.07). Conclusions. These data suggest that reasons for appointments can improve the accuracy of lists of diagnoses in predicting laboratory-verified influenza cases. This study recommends further exploration of the DBSt algorithm and reasons for appointments in predicting likely influenza cases.

J	Dayanik, A				Dayanik, Aynur			Learning feature-projection based classifiers	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Classification learning; Inductive learning; Feature projections	ERYTHEMATO-SQUAMOUS DISEASES; NAIVE BAYES; DIFFERENTIAL-DIAGNOSIS; TEXT CLASSIFICATION	This paper aims at designing better performing feature-projection based classification algorithms and presents two new such algorithms. These algorithms are batch supervised learning algorithms and represent induced classification knowledge as feature intervals. In both algorithms, each feature participates in the classification by giving real-valued votes to classes. The prediction for an unseen example is the class receiving the highest vote. The first algorithm, OFP.MC, learns on each feature pairwise disjoint intervals which minimize feature classification error. The second algorithm. GFP.MC, constructs feature intervals by greedily improving the feature classification error. The new algorithms are empirically evaluated on twenty datasets from the UCI repository and are compared with the existing feature-projection based classification algorithms (FILIF, VFI5, CFP, k-NNFP, and NBC). The experiments demonstrate that the OFP.MC algorithm outperforms other feature-projection based classification algorithms. The GFP.MC algorithm is slightly inferior to the OFP.MC algorithm, but, if it is used for datasets with large number of instances, then it reduces the space requirement of the OFP.MC algorithm. The new algorithms are insensitive to boundary noise unlike the other feature-projection based classification algorithms considered here. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ma, Y; Luo, GC; Zeng, X; Chen, AG				Ma, Ying; Luo, Guangchun; Zeng, Xue; Chen, Aiguo			Transfer learning for cross-company software defect prediction	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Machine learning; Software defect prediction; Transfer learning; Naive Bayes; Different distribution	NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; METRICS; MODELS	Context: Software defect prediction studies usually built models using within-company data, but very few focused on the prediction models trained with cross-company data. It is difficult to employ these models which are built on the within-company data in practice, because of the lack of these local data repositories. Recently, transfer learning has attracted more and more attention for building classifier in target domain using the data from related source domain. It is very useful in cases when distributions of training and test instances differ, but is it appropriate for cross-company software defect prediction? Objective: In this paper, we consider the cross-company defect prediction scenario where source and target data are drawn from different companies. In order to harness cross company data, we try to exploit the transfer learning method to build faster and highly effective prediction model. Method: Unlike the prior works selecting training data which are similar from the test data, we proposed a novel algorithm called Transfer Naive Bayes (TNB), by using the information of all the proper features in training data. Our solution estimates the distribution of the test data, and transfers cross-company data information into the weights of the training data. On these weighted data, the defect prediction model is built. Results: This article presents a theoretical analysis for the comparative methods, and shows the experiment results on the data sets from different organizations. It indicates that TNB is more accurate in terms of AUC (The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), within less runtime than the state of the art methods. Conclusion: It is concluded that when there are too few local training data to train good classifiers, the useful knowledge from different-distribution training data on feature level may help. We are optimistic that our transfer learning method can guide optimal resource allocation strategies, which may reduce software testing cost and increase effectiveness of software testing process.

The aim is to classify eighteen classes of thalassaemia abnormality, which have a high prevalence in Thailand, and one control class by inspecting data characterised by a complete blood count (CBC) and haemoglobin typing. Two indices namely a haemoglobin concentration (HB) and a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are the chosen CBC attributes. On the other hand, known types of haemoglobin from six ranges of retention time identified via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are the chosen haemoglobin typing attributes. The stratified 10-fold cross-validation results indicate that the best classification performance with average accuracy of 93.23% (standard deviation = 1.67%) and 92.60% (standard deviation = 1.75%) is achieved when the naive Bayes classifier and the multilayer perceptron are respectively applied to samples which have been pre-processed by attribute discretisation. The results also suggest that the HB attribute is redundant. Moreover, the achieved classification performance is significantly higher than that obtained using only haemoglobin typing attributes as classifier inputs. Subsequently, the naive Bayes classifier and the multilayer perceptron are applied to an additional data set in a clinical trial which respectively results in accuracy of 99.39% and 99.71%. These results suggest that a combination of CBC and haemoglobin typing analysis with a naive Bayes classifier or a multilayer perceptron is highly suitable for automatic thalassaemia screening.

J	TeCho, J; Nattee, C; Theeramunkong, T				TeCho, Jakkrit; Nattee, Cholwich; Theeramunkong, Thanaruk			Boosting-based ensemble learning with penalty profiles for automatic Thai unknown word recognition	COMPUTERS & MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Boosting technique; Ensemble learning; Machine learning; Unknown word recognition; Word boundary detection; Text mining	CORPUS-BASED APPROACH; CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS; SEGMENTATION; TREES	A boosting-based ensemble learning can be used to improve classification accuracy by using multiple classification models constructed to cope with errors obtained from their preceding steps. This paper proposes a method to improve boosting-based ensemble learning with penalty profiles via an application of automatic unknown word recognition in Thai language. Treating a sequential problem as a non-sequential problem, the unknown word recognition is required to include a process to rank a set of generated candidates for a potential unknown word position. To strengthen the recognition process with ensemble classification, the penalty profiles are defined to make it more efficient to construct a succeeding classification model which tends to re-rank a set of ranked candidates into a suitable order. As an evaluation, a number of alternative penalty profiles are introduced and their performances are compared for the task of extracting unknown words from a large Thai medical text. Using the Naive Bayes as the base classifier for ensemble learning, the proposed method with the best setting achieves an accuracy of 90.19%, which is an accuracy gap of 12.88, 10.59, and 6.05 over conventional Naive Bayes, non-ensemble version, and the flat-penalty profile.

Due to a lack of comprehensive experimental data, high study cost and time-consuming, in silico approaches for assessing the biodegradable profiles of chemicals are encouraged and is an active current research topic. Here we developed in silico methods to estimate chemical biodegradability in the environment. At first 1440 diverse compounds tested under the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) protocol were used. Four different methods, namely support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, and C4.5 decision tree, were used to build the combinatorial classification probability models of ready versus not ready biodegradability using physicochemical descriptors and fingerprints separately. The overall predictive accuracies of the best models were more than 80% for the external test set of 164 diverse compounds. Some privileged substructures were further identified for ready or not ready biodegradable chemicals by combining information gain and substructure fragment analysis. Moreover, 27 new predicted chemicals were selected for experimental assay through the Japanese MITI test protocols, which validated that all 27 compounds were predicted correctly.

Yet, there are doubts whether sSBVS is suitable also for extrapolation, that is, for detecting molecules that are very different from those used for training. Herein, we evaluate the predictive power of classic virtual screening methods, namely, similarity searching using Tanimoto coefficient (MTC) and Naive Bayes (NB). As could be expected, these classic methods perform better in interpolation than in extrapolation tasks. Consequently, to enhance the predictive ability for extrapolation tasks, we introduce the Shadow approach, in which inclusion relations between substructures are considered, as opposed to the classic sSBVS methods that assume independence between substructures. Specifically, we discard contributions from substructures included in ("shaded" by) others which are, in turn, included in the molecule of interest. Indeed, the Shadow classifier significantly outperforms both MTC (pValue = 3.1 X 10(-16)) and NB (pValue = 3.5 X 10(-9)) in detecting hits sharing low similarity with the training active molecules.

Comparison of Random Forest and Pipeline Pilot Naive Bayes in Prospective QSAR Predictions	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							COMPOUND CLASSIFICATION; MOLECULAR DESCRIPTOR; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SIMILARITY; REGRESSION; MODELS; TOOL; SET; SELECTION	Random forest is currently considered one of the best QSAR methods available in terms of accuracy of prediction. However, it is computationally intensive. Naive Bayes is a simple, robust classification method. The Laplacian-modified Naive Bayes implementation is the preferred QSAR method in the widely used commercial chemoinformatics platform Pipeline Pilot. We made a comparison of the ability of Pipeline Pilot Naive Bayes (PLPNB) and random forest to make accurate predictions on 18 large, diverse in-house QSAR data sets. These include on-target and ADME-related activities. These data sets were set up as classification problems with either binary or multicategory activities. We used a time-split method of dividing training and test sets, as we feel this is a realistic way of simulating prospective prediction. PLPNB is computationally efficient. However, random forest predictions are at least as good and in many cases significantly better than those of PLPNB on our data sets. PLPNB performs better with ECFP4 and ECFP6 descriptors, which are native to Pipeline Pilot, and more poorly with other descriptors we tried.

J	Huang, X; Wang, HN; Li, LP				Huang, Xin; Wang, Hua-Ning; Li, Le-Ping			Ensemble prediction model of solar proton events associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections	RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						solar proton events; Sun: flares; Sun: coronal mass ejections; methods: statistical; ensemble learning	ENERGETIC PARTICLE EVENTS; ACCELERATION; SOHO	An ensemble prediction model of solar proton events (SPEs), combining the information of solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), is built. In this model, solar flares are parameterized by the peak flux, the duration and the longitude. In addition, CMEs are parameterized by the width, the speed and the measurement position angle. The importance of each parameter for the occurrence of SPEs is estimated by the information gain ratio. We find that the CME width and speed are more informative than the flare's peak flux and duration. As the physical mechanism of SPEs is not very clear, a hidden naive Bayes approach, which is a probability-based calculation method from the field of machine learning, is used to build the prediction model from the observational data. As is known, SPEs originate from solar flares and/or shock waves associated with CMEs. Hence, we first build two base prediction models using the properties of solar flares and CMEs, respectively. Then the outputs of these models are combined to generate the ensemble prediction model of SPEs. The ensemble prediction model incorporating the complementary information of solar flares and CMEs achieves better performance than each base prediction model taken separately.

Methods and materials: CT is widely considered an effective tool for evaluating patients with minor head trauma who have potentially suffered serious intracranial injury. However, its use poses possible harmful effects, particularly for children, due to exposure to radiation. Safety concerns, along with issues of cost and practice variability, have led to calls for the development of effective methods to decide when CT imaging is needed. Clinical decision rules represent such methods and are normally derived from the analysis of large prospectively collected patient data sets. The CATCH rule was created by a group of Canadian pediatric emergency physicians to support the decision of referring children with minor head injury to CT imaging. The goal of the CATCH rule was to maximize the sensitivity of predictions of potential intracranial lesion while keeping specificity at a reasonable level. After extensive analysis of the CATCH data set, characterized by severe class imbalance, and after a thorough evaluation of several data mining methods, we derived an ensemble of multiple Naive Bayes classifiers as the prediction model for CT imaging decisions. Results: In the first phase of the experiment we compared the proposed ensemble model to other ensemble models employing rule-, tree- and instance-based member classifiers. Our prediction model demonstrated the best performance in terms of AUC, G-mean and sensitivity measures. In the second phase, using a bootstrapping experiment similar to that reported by the CATCH investigators, we showed that the proposed ensemble model achieved a more balanced predictive performance than the CATCH rule with an average sensitivity of 82.8% and an average specificity of 74.4% (vs. 98.1% and 50.0% for the CATCH rule respectively). Conclusion: Automatically derived prediction models cannot replace a physician's acumen. However, they help establish reference performance indicators for the purpose of developing clinical decision rules so the trade-off between prediction sensitivity and specificity is better understood.

EFFICIENCY OF DISTINCT DATA MINING ALGORITHMS FOR CLASSIFYING STRESS LEVEL IN PIGLETS FROM THEIR VOCALIZATION	ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA			English	Article						vocal expression; well-being; level of pain; pig	SUS-SCROFA; CASTRATION; PIGS; PAIN	Among the challenges of pig farming in today's competitive market, there is factor of the product traceability that ensures, among many points, animal welfare. Vocalization is a valuable tool to identify situations of stress in pigs, and it can be used in welfare records for traceability. The objective of this work was to identify stress in piglets using vocalization, calling this stress on three levels: no stress, moderate stress, and acute stress. An experiment was conducted on a commercial farm in the municipality of Holambra, Sao Paulo State, where vocalizations of twenty piglets were recorded during the castration procedure, and separated into two groups: without anesthesia and local anesthesia with lidocaine base. For the recording of acoustic signals, a unidirectional microphone was connected to a digital recorder, in which signals were digitized at a frequency of 44,100 Hz. For evaluation of sound signals, Praat (R) software was used, and different data mining algorithms were applied using Weka (R) software. The selection of attributes improved model accuracy, and the best attribute selection was used by applying Wrapper method, while the best classification algorithms were the k-NN and Naive Bayes. According to the results, it was possible to classify the level of stress in pigs through their vocalization.						FAPESP	To FAPESP, for granting a scholarship.	CORDEIRO A. F.

Non-invasive automated 3D thyroid lesion classification in ultrasound: A class of ThyroScan (TM) systems	ULTRASONICS			English	Article						Computer Aided Diagnosis; Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound; High Resolution Ultrasound; Texture; Thyroid lesion	CONTRAST-ENHANCED ULTRASOUND; LOCAL BINARY PATTERNS; FRACTAL DIMENSION; TEXTURE CLASSIFICATION; NODULES; BENIGN; CARCINOMA; IMAGES; ELASTOGRAPHY; MALIGNANCY	Ultrasound-based thyroid nodule characterization into benign and malignant types is limited by subjective interpretations. This paper presents a Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) technique that would present more objective and accurate classification and further would offer the physician a valuable second opinion. In this paradigm, we first extracted the features that quantify the local changes in the texture characteristics of the ultrasound off-line training images from both benign and malignant nodules. These features include: Fractal Dimension (FD), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Fourier Spectrum Descriptor (FS), and Laws Texture Energy (LTE). The resulting feature vectors were used to build seven different classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Sugeno Fuzzy, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Network (RBPNN), and Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC). Subsequently, the feature vector-classifier combination that results in the maximum classification accuracy was used to predict the class of a new on-line test thyroid ultrasound image. Two data sets with 3D Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) and 3D High Resolution Ultrasound (HRUS) images of 20 nodules (10 benign and 10 malignant) were used. Fine needle aspiration biopsy and histology results were used to confirm malignancy. Our results show that a combination of texture features coupled with SVM or Fuzzy classifiers resulted in 100% accuracy for the HRUS dataset, while GMM classifier resulted in 98.1% accuracy for the CEUS dataset. Finally, for each dataset, we have proposed a novel integrated index called Thyroid Malignancy Index (TMI) using the combination of FD, LBP, LTE texture features, to diagnose benign or malignant nodules. This index can help clinicians to make a more objective differentiation of benign/malignant thyroid lesions. We have compared and benchmarked the system with existing methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Vijay			An enhanced ACO algorithm to select features for text categorization and its parallelization	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Bag of Words; Metaheuristic algorithms; Ant Colony Optimization; Heuristic information; Local search; CHIR; chi(2); Parallel algorithm; MapReduce; Distributed environment	ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM	Feature selection is an indispensable preprocessing step for effective analysis of high dimensional data. It removes irrelevant features, improves the predictive accuracy and increases the comprehensibility of the model constructed by the classifiers sensitive to features. Finding an optimal feature subset for a problem in an outsized domain becomes intractable and many such feature selection problems have been shown to be NP-hard. Optimization algorithms are frequently designed for NP-hard problems to find nearly optimal solutions with a practical time complexity. This paper formulates the text feature selection problem as a combinatorial problem and proposes an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to find the nearly optimal solution for the same. It differs from the earlier algorithm by Aghdam et al. by including a heuristic function based on statistics and a local search. The algorithm aims at determining a solution that includes 'n' distinct features for each category. Optimization algorithms based on wrapper models show better results but the processes involved in them are time intensive. The availability of parallel architectures as a cluster of machines connected through fast Ethernet has increased the interest on parallelization of algorithms. The proposed ACO algorithm was parallelized and demonstrated with a cluster formed with a maximum of six machines. Documents from 20 newsgroup benchmark dataset were used for experimentation. Features selected by the proposed algorithm were evaluated using Naive bayes classifier and compared with the standard feature selection techniques. It was observed that the performance of the classifier had been improved with the features selected by the enhanced ACO and local search. Error of the classifier decreases over iterations and it was observed that the number of positive features increases with the number of iterations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kang, H; Yoo, SJ; Han, D				Kang, Hanhoon; Yoo, Seong Joon; Han, Dongil			Senti-lexicon and improved Naive Bayes algorithms for sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Review						Sentiment analysis; Lexicon; Machine learning; Opinion mining; Restaurant review		The existing senti-lexicon does not sufficiently accommodate the sentiment word that is used in the restaurant review. Therefore, this thesis proposes a new senti-lexicon for the sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews. When classifying a review document as a positive sentiment and as a negative sentiment using the supervised learning algorithm, there is a tendency for the positive classification accuracy to appear up to approximately 10% higher than the negative classification accuracy. This creates a problem of decreasing the average accuracy when the accuracies of the two classes are expressed as an average value. In order to mitigate such problem, an improved Naive Bayes algorithm is proposed. The result of the experiment showed that when this algorithm was used and a unigrams + bigrams was used as the feature, the gap between the positive accuracy and the negative accuracy was narrowed to 3.6% compared to when the original Naive Bayes was used, and that the 28.5% gap was able to be narrowed compared to when SVM was used. Additionally, the use of this algorithm based on the senti-lexicon showed an accuracy that improved by a maximum of 10.2% in recall and a maximum of 26.2% in precision compared to when SVM was used, and by a maximum of 5.6% in recall and a maximum of 1.9% in precision compared to when Naive Bayes was used.

J	Zheng, F; Webb, GI; Suraweera, P; Zhu, LG				Zheng, Fei; Webb, Geoffrey I.; Suraweera, Pramuditha; Zhu, Liguang			Subsumption resolution: an efficient and effective technique for semi-naive Bayesian learning	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Classification; Naive Bayes; Semi-naive Bayes; Feature selection; AODE	CLASSIFIERS; MODELS	Semi-naive Bayesian techniques seek to improve the accuracy of naive Bayes (NB) by relaxing the attribute independence assumption. We present a new type of semi-naive Bayesian operation, Subsumption Resolution (SR), which efficiently identifies occurrences of the specialization-generalization relationship and eliminates generalizations at classification time. We extend SR to Near-Subsumption Resolution (NSR) to delete near-generalizations in addition to generalizations. We develop two versions of SR: one that performs SR during training, called eager SR (ESR), and another that performs SR during testing, called lazy SR (LSR). We investigate the effect of ESR, LSR, NSR and conventional attribute elimination (BSE) on NB and Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE), a powerful alternative to NB. BSE imposes very high training time overheads on NB and AODE accompanied by varying decreases in classification time overheads. ESR, LSR and NSR impose high training time and test time overheads on NB. However, LSR imposes no extra training time overheads and only modest test time overheads on AODE, while ESR and NSR impose modest training and test time overheads on AODE. Our extensive experimental comparison on sixty UCI data sets shows that applying BSE, LSR or NSR to NB significantly improves both zero-one loss and RMSE, while applying BSE, ESR or NSR to AODE significantly improves zero-one loss and RMSE and applying LSR to AODE significantly improves zero-one loss. The Friedman test and Nemenyi test show that AODE with ESR or NSR have a significant zero-one loss and RMSE advantage over Logistic Regression and a zero-one loss advantage over Weka's LibSVM implementation with a grid parameter search on categorical data. AODE with LSR has a zero-one loss advantage over Logistic Regression and comparable zero-one loss with LibSVM. Finally, we examine the circumstances under which the elimination of near-generalizations proves beneficial.

Most of the previous researches are based on well-structured datasets which are manually collected, structured and normalized by TCM experts. However, the obtained results of the former work could not be directly and effectively applied to clinical practice, because the raw free-text clinical records differ a lot from the well-structured datasets. They are unstructured and are denoted by TCM doctors without the support of authoritative editorial board in their routine diagnostic work. Therefore, in this paper, a novel framework of automatic diagnosis of TCM utilizing raw free-text clinical records for clinical practice is proposed and investigated for the first time. A series of appropriate methods are attempted to tackle several challenges in the framework, and the Naive Bayes classifier and the Support Vector Machine classifier are employed for TCM automatic diagnosis. The framework is analyzed carefully. Its feasibility is validated through evaluating the performance of each module of the framework and its effectiveness is demonstrated based on the precision, recall and F-Measure of automatic diagnosis results.

J	Mahowald, K				Mahowald, Kyle			A Naive Bayes classifier for Shakespeare's second-person pronoun	LITERARY AND LINGUISTIC COMPUTING			English	Article								In order to investigate in explicit detail the way that y- and th- pronouns alternate in the Shakespearean corpus, I have undertaken a collocational analysis of the full corpus of Shakespeare's 37 plays and found that (1) second-person pronouns can be disambiguated based on context alone, (2) y- pronouns seem to be used in more formal situations or when an inferior is addressing a social better, and (3) the th- pronoun is reserved for addressing peers, servants, or other familiar personages. Through the Python Natural Language Toolkit (Bird et al., 2009, Natural Language Processing with Python. Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly Media), I implemented a Naive Bayes classifier that in effect treats each occurrence of a second-person pronoun as a black box that must be resolved into either a y- pronoun or a th- pronoun based only on the surrounding words. Using tenfold cross-validation, the classifier achieves an accuracy of 78.3% when fellow th- and y- pronouns are excluded from the context and 88.0% when we allow fellow th- and y- pronouns to assist in classification. Most interesting, however, are the context words that prove most informative in categorizing the pronouns. Significantly, the words most useful in classifying a pronoun as a y- pronoun include high-register words such as lordship, madam, lords, and sir. After a group of conjugated second-person verbs like art and wert, the words most associated with th- pronouns are words such as torment, nuncle, lesser, and villain. The ability to discriminate between forms based only on context confirms the hypothesis that the two classes of second-person pronoun are indeed used distinctly in the Shakespearean corpus. The list of words most helpful in making that distinction strongly suggests a difference in formality. We can also gain additional insight into the plays by examining some of the unexpected words that collocate with either one form or the other.

To address such challenges, we develop a COst-sensitive Learning-based Positive Example Learning (COLPEL) technique, which constructs an automated classifier from a training sample comprised of positive examples and a much larger number of unlabeled examples. The proposed technique incorporates cost-proportionate rejection sampling to derive, from unlabeled examples, a subset that is likely to feature negative examples in the training sample. Our technique follows a committee machine approach and thereby constructs a set of classifiers that make joint product recommendations while mitigating the potential biases common to the use of a single classifier. We evaluate the proposed method with customers' book ratings collected from Amazon.com and include two prevalent techniques for benchmark purposes: namely, positive naive Bayes and positive example-based learning. According to our results, the proposed COLPEL technique outperforms both benchmarks, as measured by accuracy and positive and negative F1 scores. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Energy-Efficient Context Classification With Dynamic Sensor Control	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Classification; energy efficiency; hidden Markov model; optimization; partially observable Markov decision process; sensor selection; wearable platform	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; ACTIVITY RECOGNITION; WEARABLE SYSTEMS; CARE	Energy efficiency has been a longstanding design challenge for wearable sensor systems. It is especially crucial in continuous subject state monitoring due to the ongoing need for compact sizes and better sensors. This paper presents an energy-efficient classification algorithm, based on partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In every time step, POMDP dynamically selects sensors for classification via a sensor selection policy. The sensor selection problem is formalized as an optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize misclassification cost given some energy budget. State transitions are modeled as a hidden Markov model (HMM), and the corresponding sensor selection policy is represented using a finite-state controller (FSC). To evaluate this framework, sensor data were collected from multiple subjects in their free-living conditions. Relative accuracies and energy reductions from the proposed method are compared against naive Bayes (always-on) and simple random strategies to validate the relative performance of the algorithm. When the objective is to maintain the same classification accuracy, significant energy reduction is achieved.	[Au, Lawrence K.; Bui, Alex A.

J	Kose, C; Alp, I; Ikibas, C				Kose, Cemal; Alp, Ibrahim; Ikibas, Cevat			Statistical methods for segmentation and quantification of minerals in ore microscopy	MINERALS ENGINEERING			English	Article						Micrographic image analysis; Colour-based segmentation; Ore minerals; Optic microscopy; Naive Bayes	OPTICAL-IMAGE ANALYSIS; RETINAL FUNDUS IMAGES; TEXTURE CLASSIFICATION; AUTOMATED MINERALOGY; MACULAR DEGENERATION; LIBERATION ANALYSIS; COLOR IMAGES; FLOTATION; SIZE; DIAGNOSIS	Modern electronic image-processing techniques have enabled mineral processing engineers to automate the determination of minerals in ore samples. The automatic recognition and quantification of minerals by light microscopy is one of the most important problems in ore-processing systems because determining the amount and degree of liberation of the constituent minerals in ore is necessary for further processing. Measurement of the size and liberation degree of minerals is also required for automatic control of the grinding process. This paper suggests an automated method for segmenting and quantifying the size and amount of minerals in ore using micrographic images. A simple normalized colour-based statistical segmentation method is proposed to exploit the average value, standard deviation and distribution of RGB colour components of mineral patterns in an ore image. The method also determines the deviations of colour components of the minerals to improve the segmentation. A Naive Bayes classifier is also introduced for segmenting the minerals. The performance of method is examined using micrographs in variety of qualities. The method performs segmentation accuracy over 90%. Additionally, the success rates of the methods were found to be over 85% in measuring the grain sizes in a ground sample, and 86% in measuring liberation degrees of minerals after grinding process.

In this study, a biomedical system based on Learning Vector Quantization Neural Network (LVQ NN) has been developed in order to classify the internal carotid artery Doppler signals obtained from the 191 subjects, 136 of them had suffered from internal carotid artery stenosis and rest of them had been healthy subject. The system is composed of feature extraction and classification parts, basically. In the feature extraction stage, power spectral density (PSD) estimates of internal carotid artery Doppler signals were obtained by using Burg autoregressive (AR) spectrum analysis technique in order to obtain medical information. In the classification stage, LVQ NN was used classify features from Burg AR method. In experiments, LVQ NN based method reached 97.91% classification accuracy with 5 fold Cross Validation (CV) technique. In addition, the classification performance of the LVQ NN was compared with some methods such as Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) NN, Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), decision tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with sensitivity and specificity statistical parameters. The classification results showed that the LVQ NN method is effective for classification of internal carotid artery Doppler signals.

A Traffic Classification Agent for Virtual Networks Based on QoS Classes	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Traffic Classification; Service Level Agreements; Virtualization	OPENFLOW	Internet growth drives the emergence and usage of new applications, which have specific requirements for Quality of Service (QoS). Thus, differentiation of packets which belong to certain QoS classes becomes a crucial factor to ensure the desirable quality for the applications. Within this context, this paper proposes an agent for real-time traffic classification based on QoS classes for virtual network environments, which aims at forwarding the flow to the adequate virtual network according to the QoS class. The study was made using the Mininet emulator and the Openflow Protocol. And the study showed that the agent using the Naive Bayes method performs the more suitable classification in real time.

It determines the treatment that will be applied further. In current practice, urologists use the pathological stage predictions provided in Partin tables to support their decisions. However. Partin tables are based on logistic regression (LR) and built from US data. Our objective is to investigate a range of both predictive methods and of predictive variables for pathological stage prediction and assess them with respect to their predictive quality based on UK data. Methods and material: The latest version of Partin tables was applied to a large scale British dataset in order to measure their performances by mean of concordance index (c-index). The data was collected by the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) and gathered records from over 1700 patients treated with prostatectomy in 57 centers across UK. The original methodology was replicated using the BAUS dataset and evaluated using concordance index. In addition, a selection of classifiers, including, among others. LR, artificial neural networks and Bayesian networks (BNs) was applied to the same data and compared with each other using the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Subsets of the data were created in order to observe how classifiers perform with the inclusion of extra variables. Finally a local dataset prepared by the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary was used to study the effect on predictive performance of using different variables. Results: Partin tables have low predictive quality (c-index = 0.602) when applied on UK data for comparison on patients with organ confined and extra prostatic extension conditions, patients at the two most frequently observed pathological stages. The use of replicate lookup tables built from British data shows an improvement in the classification, but the overall predictive quality remains low (c-index = 0.610). Comparing a range of classifiers shows that BNs generally outperform other methods. Using the four variables from Partin tables, naive Bayes is the best classifier for the prediction of each class label (AUC = 0.662 for OC). When two additional variables are added, the results of LR (0.675), artificial neural networks (0.656) and BN methods (0.679) are overall improved. BNs show higher AUCs than the other methods when the number of variables raises Conclusion: The predictive quality of Partin tables can be described as low to moderate on UK data. This means that following the predictions generated by Partin tables, many patients would received an inappropriate treatment, generally associated with a deterioration of their quality of life. In addition to demographic differences between UK and the original US population, the methodology and in particular LR present limitations. BN represents a promising alternative to LR from which prostate cancer staging can benefit. Heuristic search for structure learning and the inclusion of more variables are elements that further improve BN models quality. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Answers. The dataset comprises 3.9 million questions and these questions are organized into more than 1,000 categories in a hierarchy. To the best knowledge, this is the first systematic evaluation of the performance of different classification methods on question topic classification as well as short texts. Specifically, we empirically evaluate the following in classifying questions into CQA categories: (a) the usefulness of n-gram features and bag-of-word features; (b) the performance of three standard classification algorithms (naive Bayes, maximum entropy, and support vector machines); (c) the performance of the state-of-the-art hierarchical classification algorithms; (d) the effect of training data size on performance; and (e) the effectiveness of the different components of CQA data, including subject, content, asker, and the best answer. The experimental results show what aspects are important for question topic classification in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

In this paper, we propose a novel method, that advances the state of the art of fusing image information from different views, based on a special class of probabilistic graphical models, called causal independence models. The strength of this method is its ability to systematically and naturally capture uncertain domain knowledge, while performing information fusion in a computationally efficient way. We examine the value of the method for mammographic analysis and demonstrate its advantages in terms of explicit knowledge representation and accuracy (increase of at least 6.3% and 5.2% of true positive detection rates at 5% and 10% false positive rates) in comparison with previous single-view and multi-view systems, and benchmark fusion methods such as naive Bayes and logistic regression.

J	Mahfouz, T; Kandil, A				Mahfouz, Tarek; Kandil, Amr			Litigation Outcome Prediction of Differing Site Condition Disputes through Machine Learning Models	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data analysis; Decision support systems; Dispute resolution; Artificial intelligence; Construction management; Litigation; Computer models	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CONSTRUCTION LITIGATION; DECISION TREES; NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; CLAIMS	The construction industry is one of the main sectors of the U.S. economy that has a major effect on the nation's growth and prosperity. The construction industry's contribution to the nation's economy is, however, impeded by the increasing number of disputes that unfold and oftentimes escalate as projects progress. The majority of construction disputes are resolved in courts unless project contracts call for alternate dispute resolution mechanisms. Despite the numerous advantages offered by the litigation process, the extra financial burdens and additional time required by this process makes litigation less desirable in resolving the disputes of a very dynamic construction industry. It is believed that construction litigation could be reduced or even avoided if parties have a realistic understanding of their actual legal position and the likely outcome of their case. Consequently, researchers in the artificial intelligence field have developed tools and methodologies for modeling judicial reasoning and predicting the outcomes of construction litigation cases. Despite the success of some of these systems, they were not on the basis of detailed analyses of legal concepts that govern litigation outcomes. In an attempt to provide a robust legal decision methodology for the construction industry, this paper develops an automated litigation outcome prediction method for differing site condition (DSC) disputes through machine learning (ML) models. To develop the proposed method, this paper compares the performance of three ML techniques, namely: support vector machines (SVMs), naive Bayes, and rule induction and neural network classifiers (decision trees, boosted decision trees, and the projective adaptive resonance theory). The models were trained and tested using 400 DSC cases filled in the period from 1912 to 2007. Model predictions are on the basis of significant legal factors that govern verdicts in DSC disputes in the construction industry. The third-degree SVM polynomial model performed the best among the nine ML models that were developed, and achieved a prediction precision of 98%. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000148.

Efforts to predict antigenicity have relied on a few computational algorithms predicting signal peptide sequences (SignalP), transmembrane domains, or subcellular localization (pSort). An empirical protein microarray approach was developed to scan the entire proteome of any infectious microorganism and empirically determine immunoglobulin reactivity against all the antigens from a microorganism in infected individuals. The current database from this activity contains quantitative antibody reactivity data against 35,000 proteins derived from 25 infectious microorganisms and more than 30 million data points derived from 15,000 patient sera. Interrogation of these data sets has revealed ten proteomic features that are associated with antigenicity, allowing an in silico protein sequence and functional annotation based approach to triage the least likely antigenic proteins from those that are more likely to be antigenic. The first iteration of this approach applied to Brucella melitensis predicted 37% of the bacterial proteome containing 91% of the antigens empirically identified by probing proteome microarrays. In this study, we describe a naive Bayes classification approach that can be used to assign a relative score to the likelihood that an antigen will be immunoreactive and serodiagnostic in a bacterial proteome. This algorithm predicted 20% of the B. melitensis proteome including 91% of the serodiagnostic antigens, a nearly twofold improvement in specificity of the predictor. These results give us confidence that further development of this approach will lead to further improvements in the sensitivity and specificity of this in silico predictive algorithm.

J	Savoy, J				Savoy, Jacques			Authorship Attribution Based on Specific Vocabulary	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Performance; Experimentation; Authorship attribution; text classifiaction; lexical statistics	CLASSIFICATION; TEXT; CATEGORIZATION; RETRIEVAL; GENRE; DELTA; STYLE	In this article we propose a technique for computing a standardized Z score capable of defining the specific vocabulary found in a text (or part thereof) compared to that of an entire corpus. Assuming that the term occurrence follows a binomial distribution, this method is then applied to weight terms (words and punctuation symbols in the current study), representing the lexical specificity of the underlying text. In a final stage, to define an author profile we suggest averaging these text representations and then applying them along with a distance measure to derive a simple and efficient authorship attribution scheme. To evaluate this algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness, we develop two experiments, the first based on 5,408 newspaper articles (Glasgow Herald) written in English by 20 distinct authors and the second on 4,326 newspaper articles (La Stampa) written in Italian by 20 distinct authors. These experiments demonstrate that the suggested classification scheme tends to perform better than the Delta rule method based on the most frequent words, better than the chi-square distance based on word profiles and punctuation marks, better than the KLD scheme based on a predefined set of words, and better than the naive Bayes approach.

FEATURE SELECTIONS FOR HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION IN SMART HOME ENVIRONMENTS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Activity recognition; Naive Bayes classifier; Hidden Markov model; Viterbi algorithm; Smart home	PATTERNS	In this paper, three probabilistic models are applied to represent and recognize human activities from observed sensor sequences: Naive Bayes classifier, forward procedure of a Hidden Markov Model and Viterbi algorithm based on a Hidden Markov Model. A variety of different feature selection methods is tested in order to reduce the dimensionality of the learning problem. The results show that the activity recognition performance measures of the three algorithms have a strong relationship with the dataset features that are utilized. Larger time feature values and smaller length size feature values will generate better results, relatively.

Early prediction of this undesirable outcome can help in selecting candidates with increased chance of success, thus, reducing attrition at all stages of drug development. The ensemble modelling of mixed features was used for the development of a model to classify the metabolic activation of chemicals into covalently reactive species. The effects of the quality of base classifiers and performance measure for sorting were examined. An ensemble model of 13 naive Bayes classifiers was built from a diverse set of 1,479 compounds. The ensemble model was validated internally with five-fold cross validation and it has achieved sensitivity of 67.4% and specificity of 93.4% when tested on the training set. The final ensemble model was made available for public use.

They function as messengers for transferring genetic information from DNA to proteins, as the primary genetic material in many viruses, as catalysts (ribozymes) important for protein synthesis and RNA processing, and as essential and ubiquitous regulators of gene expression in living organisms. Many of these functions depend on precisely orchestrated interactions between RNA molecules and specific proteins in cells. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which proteins recognize and bind RNA is essential for comprehending the functional implications of these interactions, but the recognition 'code' that mediates interactions between proteins and RNA is not yet understood. Success in deciphering this code would dramatically impact the development of new therapeutic strategies for intervening in devastating diseases such as AIDS and cancer. Because of the high cost of experimental determination of protein-RNA interfaces, there is an increasing reliance on statistical machine learning methods for training predictors of RNA-binding residues in proteins. However, because of differences in the choice of datasets, performance measures, and data representations used, it has been difficult to obtain an accurate assessment of the current state of the art in protein-RNA interface prediction. Results: We provide a review of published approaches for predicting RNA-binding residues in proteins and a systematic comparison and critical assessment of protein-RNA interface residue predictors trained using these approaches on three carefully curated non-redundant datasets. We directly compare two widely used machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) using three different data representations in which features are encoded using either sequence-or structure-based windows. Our results show that (i) Sequence-based classifiers that use a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM)-based representation (PSSMSeq) outperform those that use an amino acid identity based representation (IDSeq) or a smoothed PSSM (SmoPSSMSeq); (ii) Structure-based classifiers that use smoothed PSSM representation (SmoPSSMStr) outperform those that use PSSM (PSSMStr) as well as sequence identity based representation (IDStr). PSSMSeq classifiers, when tested on an independent test set of 44 proteins, achieve performance that is comparable to that of three state-of-the-art structure-based predictors (including those that exploit geometric features) in terms of Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), although the structure-based methods achieve substantially higher Specificity (albeit at the expense of Sensitivity) compared to sequence-based methods. We also find that the expected performance of the classifiers on a residue level can be markedly different from that on a protein level. Our experiments show that the classifiers trained on three different non-redundant protein-RNA interface datasets achieve comparable cross-validation performance. However, we find that the results are significantly affected by differences in the distance threshold used to define interface residues. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that protein-RNA interface residue predictors that use a PSSM-based encoding of sequence windows outperform classifiers that use other encodings of sequence windows. While structure-based methods that exploit geometric features can yield significant increases in the Specificity of protein-RNA interface residue predictions, such increases are offset by decreases in Sensitivity. These results underscore the importance of comparing alternative methods using rigorous statistical procedures, multiple performance measures, and datasets that are constructed based on several alternative definitions of interface residues and redundancy cutoffs as well as including evaluations on independent test sets into the comparisons.

In silico predictive models permit inexpensive, rapid "virtual screening" to prioritize selection of compounds for experimental testing. Both experimental and in silico screening can be used to test compounds for desirable or undesirable properties. Prior work on prediction of mutagenicity has primarily involved identification of toxicophores rather than whole-molecule predictive models. In this work, we examined a range of in silico predictive classification models for prediction of mutagenic properties of compounds, including methods such as J48 and SMO which have not previously been widely applied in cheminformatics. Results: The Bursi mutagenicity data set containing 4337 compounds (Set 1) and a Benchmark data set of 6512 compounds (Set 2) were taken as input data set in this work. A third data set (Set 3) was prepared by joining up the previous two sets. Classification algorithms including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, J48 and SMO with 10 fold cross-validation and default parameters were used for model generation on these data sets. Models built using the combined performed better than those developed from the Benchmark data set. Significantly, Random Forest outperformed other classifiers for all the data sets, especially for Set 3 with 89.27% accuracy, 89% precision and ROC of 95.3%. To validate the developed models two external data sets, AID1189 and AID1194, with mutagenicity data were tested showing 62% accuracy with 67% precision and 65% ROC area and 91% accuracy, 91% precision with 96.3% ROC area respectively. A Random Forest model was used on approved drugs from DrugBank and metabolites from the Zinc Database with True Positives rate almost 85% showing the robustness of the model. Conclusion: We have created a new mutagenicity benchmark data set with around 8,000 compounds. Our work shows that highly accurate predictive mutagenicity models can be built using machine learning methods based on chemical descriptors and trained using this set, and these models provide a complement to toxicophores based methods. Further, our work supports other recent literature in showing that Random Forest models generally outperform other comparable machine learning methods for this kind of application.

The sleep pattern is a significant aspect to evaluate the quality of sleep, and how to recognize elder's sleep pattern is an important issue for elder-care community. With the pressure sensor matrix to monitor the elder's sleep behavior in bed, this paper presents an unobtrusive sleep postures detection and pattern recognition approaches. Based on the proposed sleep monitoring system, the processing methods of experimental data and the classification algorithms for sleep pattern recognition are also discussed.

J	Moini, N; Boile, M; Theofanis, S; Laventhal, W				Moini, Nadereh; Boile, Maria; Theofanis, Sotiris; Laventhal, William			Estimating the determinant factors of container dwell times at seaports	MARITIME ECONOMICS & LOGISTICS			English	Article						container dwell time; Naive Bayes; decision tree; data mining; determinant factor; yard capacity		Numerous options are being considered in practice, and have been captured in theoretical research, for increasing container terminal capacity. These include new stacking and handling technologies, optimizing yard space allocation and creating empty container depots outside of terminals to mention a few. Among these, reducing the amount of time a container spends at the terminal, container dwell time (CDT), may prove to be one of the least costly solutions. For this strategy to be successful, it is essential that terminal operators be able to define factors impacting the CDT and estimate how long a container remains in the yard. This article attempts to identify determinant factors of CDT and delineates appropriate computational tools for estimating CDT based on a set of such factors on which terminal operators typically collect relevant data. The article compares the performance of three data mining algorithms to estimate CDT: Naive Bayes, decision tree and a NB-decision tree hybrid. Using the best performing model, sample terminal data is used to measure how changes in CDT determinant factors impact CDT, yard capacity and terminal revenue. The outcomes reveal that the impacts of changes in CDT determinant factors can be fairly considerable in order to affect terminal's capacity and revenue earned from demurrage fees.

TB-Lineage: An online tool for classification and analysis of strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex	INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Tuberculosis; Classification; Spoligotype; MIRU-VNTR; Spoligoforest; Lineage	DISCRIMINATORY POWER; GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION; SPOLIGOTYPES; POLYMORPHISM; REPRODUCIBILITY; DATABASE	This paper formulates a set of rules to classify genotypes of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) into major lineages using spoligotypes and MIRU-VNTR results. The rules synthesize prior literature that characterizes lineages by spacer deletions and variations in the number of repeats seen at locus MIRU24 (alias VNTR2687). A tool that efficiently and accurately implements this rule base is now freely available at http://tbinsight.cs.rpi.edu/run_tb_lineage.html. When MIRU24 data is not available, the system utilizes predictions made by a Naive Bayes classifier based on spoligotype data. This website also provides a tool to generate spoligoforests in order to visualize the genetic diversity and relatedness of genotypes and their associated lineages. A detailed analysis of the application of these tools on a dataset collected by the CDC consisting of 3198 distinct spoligotypes and 5430 distinct MIRU-VNTR types from 37,066 clinical isolates is presented. The tools were also tested on four other independent datasets. The accuracy of automated classification using both spoligotypes and MIRU24 is >99%, and using spoligotypes alone is >95%. This online rule-based classification technique in conjunction with genotype visualization provides a practical tool that supports surveillance of TB transmission trends and molecular epidemiological studies.

Evolution of mitochondrial-encoded cytochrome oxidase subunits in endothermic fish: The importance of taxon-sampling in codon-based models	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Regional endothermy; Evolution; Positive-selection; Taxon sampling; Lamnid sharks; Scombroids	MOLECULAR EVOLUTION; ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION; C-OXIDASE; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; TELEOST FISHES; LAMNID SHARKS; VERTEBRATES; METABOLISM; PRIMATES; MUSCLE	While endothermy is ubiquitous in birds and mammals, it is not exclusive to these most recently arisen vertebrate classes. The ability to warm specific organs and/or tissues above ambient temperature (regional endothermy) has evolved at least three times in phylogentically discrete fish lineages: lamnid sharks (Lamnidae), tunas (Scombridae) and billfishes (Istiophoridae and Xiphidae). Given the links between endothermy and metabolic rate, we looked for evidence of convergent molecular evolution in mtDNA-encoded cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunits in each of these discrete lineages. We found no evidence that the endothermic phenotype in fishes is driven or accompanied by molecular convergence. Though we found little evidence for positively-selected sites in any of the lineages in any subunit, the conclusions were sensitive to the choice of maximum-likelihood model. Several sites identified by Naive Empirical Bayes (NEB) were not found when Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) was employed. As well, conclusions were profoundly influenced by taxon-sampling. Several of the putative sites of positive selection in COX II were no longer apparent as we augmented taxon sampling. The lack of convergent molecular evolution in these remarkable taxa, combined with the profound influence of model choice and taxon sampling provide a cautionary note on the use of rates of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations (dN/dS) to explore questions of the evolution of physiological function.

J	Maji, P; Das, C				Maji, Pradipta; Das, Chandra			Relevant and Significant Supervised Gene Clusters for Microarray Cancer Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NANOBIOSCIENCE			English	Article						Classification; feature selection; gene clustering; microarray analysis; mutual information	EXPRESSION DATA; PATTERNS; SELECTION; TUMOR	An important application of microarray data in functional genomics is to classify samples according to their gene expression profiles such as to classify cancer versus normal samples or to classify different types or subtypes of cancer. One of the major tasks with gene expression data is to find co-regulated gene groups whose collective expression is strongly associated with sample categories. In this regard, a gene clustering algorithm is proposed to group genes from microarray data. It directly incorporates the information of sample categories in the grouping process for finding groups of co-regulated genes with strong association to the sample categories, yielding a supervised gene clustering algorithm. The average expression of the genes from each cluster acts as its representative. Some significant representatives are taken to form the reduced feature set to build the classifiers for cancer classification. The mutual information is used to compute both gene-gene redundancy and gene-class relevance. The performance of the proposed method, along with a comparison with existing methods, is studied on six cancer microarray data sets using the predictive accuracy of naive Bayes classifier, K-nearest neighbor rule, and support vector machine. An important finding is that the proposed algorithm is shown to be effective for identifying biologically significant gene clusters with excellent predictive capability.

They have to deal with the continual increase of information available on the web, and provide users with convenient access to such huge amounts of information. Furthermore, with this huge amount of information, a more complex challenge that continuously gets more and more difficult to illuminate is the spam in web pages. For several reasons, web spammers try to intrude in the search results and inject artificially biased results in favour of their websites or pages. Spam pages are added to the internet on a daily basis, thus making it difficult for search engines to keep up with the fast-growing and dynamic nature of the web, especially since spammers tend to add more keywords to their websites to deceive the search engines and increase the rank of their pages. In this research, we have investigated four different classification algorithms (naive Bayes, decision tree, SVM and K-NN) to detect Arabic web spam pages, based on content. The three groups of datasets used, with 1%, 15% and 50% spam contents, were collected using a crawler that was customized for this study. Spam pages were classified manually. Different tests and comparisons have revealed that the Decision Tree was the best classifier for this purpose.

Therefore, new computational tools are needed to facilitate assay design. In the isothermal EXPonential Amplification Reaction (EXPAR), template sequences with similar thermodynamic characteristics perform very differently. To understand what causes this variability, we characterized the performance of 384 template sequences, and used this data to develop two computational methods to predict EXPAR template performance based on sequence: a position weight matrix approach with support vector machine classifier, and RELIEF attribute evaluation with Naive Bayes classification. The methods identified well and poorly performing EXPAR templates with 67-70% sensitivity and 77-80% specificity. We combined these methods into a computational tool that can accelerate new assay design by ruling out likely poor performers. Furthermore, our data suggest that variability in template performance is linked to specific sequence motifs. Cytidine, a pyrimidine base, is over-represented in certain positions of well-performing templates. Guanosine and adenosine, both purine bases, are over-represented in similar regions of poorly performing templates, frequently as GA or AG dimers. Since polymerases have a higher affinity for purine oligonucleotides, polymerase binding to GA-rich regions of a single-stranded DNA template may promote non-specific amplification in EXPAR and other nucleic acid amplification reactions.

The discovery of CK2 inhibitors has thus attracted much attention in recent years. In this investigation, a hybrid virtual screening approach based on Bayesian classification model, pharmacophore hypothesis and molecular docking was proposed and employed to identify CK2 inhibitors. We first established a naive Bayes classification model of CK2 inhibitors/non-inhibitors and pharmacophore hypotheses of CK2 inhibitors. The docking parameters and scoring functions were also optimized in advance. The three virtual screening methods were sequentially used to screen two large chemical libraries, Specs and Enamine, for retrieving new CK2 inhibitors. Finally 30 compounds were selected from the final hits for in vitro CK2 kinase inhibitory assays. Five compounds with completely novel scaffolds showed a good inhibitory potency against CK2, which have good potentials for a future hit-to-lead optimization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Weights Space Exploration Using Genetic Algorithms for Meta-classifier in Text Document Classification	STUDIES IN INFORMATICS AND CONTROL			English	Article						Text Classification and Performance Evaluation; SVM; Meta-classification; Genetic Algorithms		Automatic document classification has become an important task because of the continually increasing number of text documents with the users have to deal with. The aim of this paper is to develop a non-adaptive meta-classifier for text documents that has an increased classification accuracy. The developed meta-classifier is based on combining some SVM classifiers and a Naive Bayes classifier. We proposed a new meta-classification method which takes into consideration the corresponding positions and confidence degrees obtained for all the classes. In this work we have tried to find, using Genetic Algorithms, the optimal weighting factors for the values returned by each classifier separately. Consequently, it is possible for the meta-classifier to select as the winner class, a class that is not hierarchized as the first one by any of the compounded classifiers. The experimental results have showed that the classification accuracy can be improved through the proposed method.

J	Ong, MS; Magrabi, F; Coiera, E				Ong, Mei-Sing; Magrabi, Farah; Coiera, Enrico			Automated identification of extreme-risk events in clinical incident reports	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							PATIENT SAFETY FOUNDATION; TEXT CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM; CATEGORIZATION; INFORMATION; CARE	Objectives To explore the feasibility of using statistical text classification to automatically detect extreme-risk events in clinical incident reports. Methods Statistical text classifiers based on Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms were trained and tested on clinical incident reports to automatically detect extreme-risk events, defined by incidents that satisfy the criteria of Severity Assessment Code (SAC) level 1. For this purpose, incident reports submitted to the Advanced Incident Management System by public hospitals from one Australian region were used. The classifiers were evaluated on two datasets: (1) a set of reports with diverse incident types (n=120); (2) a set of reports associated with patient misidentification (n=166). Results were assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curves. Results The classifiers performed well on both datasets. In the multi-type dataset, SVM with a linear kernel performed best, identifying 85.8% of SAC level 1 incidents (precision=0.88, recall=0.83, F-measure=0.86, AUC=0.92). In the patient misidentification dataset, 96.4% of SAC level 1 incidents were detected when SVM with linear, polynomial or radial-basis function kernel was used (precision=0.99, recall=0.94, F-measure=0.96, AUC=0.98). Naive Bayes showed reasonable performance, detecting 80.8% of SAC level 1 incidents in the multi-type dataset and 89.8% of SAC level 1 patient misidentification incidents. Overall, higher prediction accuracy was attained on the specialized dataset, compared with the multi-type dataset. Conclusion Text classification techniques can be applied effectively to automate the detection of extreme-risk events in clinical incident reports.

They were usually adapted to learning from censored survival data by using the information on observation time. This includes learning from parts of the data or interventions to the learning algorithms. Efficient models were established in various fields of clinical medicine and bioinformatics. In this paper, we propose a pre-processing method for adapting the censored survival data to be used with ordinary machine learning algorithms. This is done by pre-assigning censored instances a positive or negative outcome according to their features and observation time. The proposed procedure calculates the goodness of fit of each censored instance to both the distribution of positives and the spoiled distribution of negatives in the entire dataset and relabels that instance accordingly. We performed a thorough empirical testing of our method in a simulation study and on two real-world medical datasets, using the naive Bayes classifier and decision trees. When compared to one of the popular ML methods dealing with survival, our method provided good results, especially when applied to heavily censored data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A common criterion to decide on the number of selected genes is maximizing the accuracy, which risks overfitting and usually selects more genes than actually needed. We propose, relaxing the maximum accuracy criterion, to select the combination of attribute selection and classification algorithm that using less attributes has an accuracy not statistically significantly worst that the best. Also we give some advice to choose a suitable combination of attribute selection and classifying algorithms for a good accuracy when using a low number of gene expressions. We used some well known attribute selection methods (FCBF, ReliefF and SVM-RFE, plus a Random selection, used as a base line technique) and classifying techniques (Naive Bayes, 3 Nearest Neighbor and SVM with linear kernel) applied to 30 data sets involving different cancer types.

Based on a feature set derived from grey-level images, including first-order statistics, Haralick features, gradient features, semi-quantitative and quantitative (pharmacokinetic modelling) dynamic parameters, four kinds of classifiers were trained and compared : nonlinear support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbours and naive Bayes classifiers. A set of feature selection methods based on t-test, mutual information and minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevancy criteria were also compared. The aim was to discriminate between the relevant features as well as to create an efficient classifier using these features. The diagnostic performances of these different CADx schemes were evaluated based on a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The evaluation database consisted of 30 sets of multiparametric MR images acquired from radical prostatectomy patients. Using histologic sections as the gold standard, both cancer and nonmalignant (but suspicious) tissues were annotated in consensus on all MR images by two radiologists, a histopathologist and a researcher. Benign tissue regions of interest (ROIs) were also delineated in the remaining prostate PZ. This resulted in a series of 42 cancer ROIs, 49 benign but suspicious ROIs and 124 nonsuspicious benign ROIs. From the outputs of all evaluated feature selection methods on the test bench, a restrictive set of about 15 highly informative features coming from all MR sequences was discriminated, thus confirming the validity of the multiparametric approach. Quantitative evaluation of the diagnostic performance yielded a maximal area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.89 (0.81-0.94) for the discrimination of the malignant versus nonmalignant tissues and 0.82 (0.73-0.90) for the discrimination of the malignant versus suspicious tissues when combining the t-test feature selection approach with a SVM classifier. A preliminary comparison showed that the optimal CADx scheme mimicked, in terms of AUC, the human experts in differentiating malignant from suspicious tissues, thus demonstrating its potential for assisting cancer identification in the PZ.

A framework for personalized medicine: prediction of drug sensitivity in cancer by proteomic profiling	PROTEOME SCIENCE			English	Article							PROTEIN MICROARRAYS; CHALLENGES	Background: The goal of personalized medicine is to provide patients optimal drug screening and treatment based on individual genomic or proteomic profiles. Reverse-Phase Protein Array (RPPA) technology offers proteomic information of cancer patients which may be directly related to drug sensitivity. For cancer patients with different drug sensitivity, the proteomic profiling reveals important pathophysiologic information which can be used to predict chemotherapy responses. Results: The goal of this paper is to present a framework for personalized medicine using both RPPA and drug sensitivity (drug resistance or intolerance). In the proposed personalized medicine system, the prediction of drug sensitivity is obtained by a proposed augmented naive Bayesian classifier (ANBC) whose edges between attributes are augmented in the network structure of naive Bayesian classifier. For discriminative structure learning of ANBC, local classification rate (LCR) is used to score augmented edges, and greedy search algorithm is used to find the discriminative structure that maximizes classification rate (CR). Once a classifier is trained by RPPA and drug sensitivity using cancer patient samples, the classifier is able to predict the drug sensitivity given RPPA information from a patient. Conclusion: In this paper we proposed a framework for personalized medicine where a patient is profiled by RPPA and drug sensitivity is predicted by ANBC and LCR. Experimental results with lung cancer data demonstrate that RPPA can be used to profile patients for drug sensitivity prediction by Bayesian network classifier, and the proposed ANBC for personalized cancer medicine achieves better prediction accuracy than naive Bayes classifier in small sample size data on average and outperforms other the state-of-the-art classifier methods in terms of classification accuracy.

J	Kukreja, M; Johnston, SA; Stafford, P				Kukreja, Muskan; Johnston, Stephen Albert; Stafford, Phillip			Comparative study of classification algorithms for immunosignaturing data	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Immunosignature; Random peptide microarray; Data mining; Classification algorithms; Naive Bayes	MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON; FEATURE-SELECTION; ERROR ESTIMATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; CANCER; VALIDATION; PEPTIDES; FEATURES	Background: High-throughput technologies such as DNA, RNA, protein, antibody and peptide microarrays are often used to examine differences across drug treatments, diseases, transgenic animals, and others. Typically one trains a classification system by gathering large amounts of probe-level data, selecting informative features, and classifies test samples using a small number of features. As new microarrays are invented, classification systems that worked well for other array types may not be ideal. Expression microarrays, arguably one of the most prevalent array types, have been used for years to help develop classification algorithms. Many biological assumptions are built into classifiers that were designed for these types of data. One of the more problematic is the assumption of independence, both at the probe level and again at the biological level. Probes for RNA transcripts are designed to bind single transcripts. At the biological level, many genes have dependencies across transcriptional pathways where co-regulation of transcriptional units may make many genes appear as being completely dependent. Thus, algorithms that perform well for gene expression data may not be suitable when other technologies with different binding characteristics exist. The immunosignaturing microarray is based on complex mixtures of antibodies binding to arrays of random sequence peptides. It relies on many-to-many binding of antibodies to the random sequence peptides. Each peptide can bind multiple antibodies and each antibody can bind multiple peptides. This technology has been shown to be highly reproducible and appears promising for diagnosing a variety of disease states. However, it is not clear what is the optimal classification algorithm for analyzing this new type of data. Results: We characterized several classification algorithms to analyze immunosignaturing data. We selected several datasets that range from easy to difficult to classify, from simple monoclonal binding to complex binding patterns in asthma patients. We then classified the biological samples using 17 different classification algorithms. Using a wide variety of assessment criteria, we found 'Naive Bayes' far more useful than other widely used methods due to its simplicity, robustness, speed and accuracy. Conclusions: 'Naive Bayes' algorithm appears to accommodate the complex patterns hidden within multilayered immunosignaturing microarray data due to its fundamental mathematical properties.

J	Lord, D; Kuo, PF				Lord, Dominique; Kuo, Pei-Fen			Examining the effects of site selection criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of traffic safety countermeasures	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Regression-to-the-mean; Biased estimate; Safety index; Site selection effects; Before-after study; Empirical Bayes method	BIAS-BY-SELECTION; REGRESSION; ACCIDENTS; INJURIES	The primary objective of this paper is to describe how site selection effects can influence the safety effectiveness of treatments. More specifically, the goal is to quantify the bias for the safety effectiveness of a treatment as a function of different entry criteria as well as other factors associated with crash data, and propose a new method to minimize this bias when a control group is not available. The study objective was accomplished using simulated data. The proposed method documented in this paper was compared to the four most common types of before-after studies: the Naive, using a control group (CG), the empirical Bayes (EB) method based on the method of moment (EBMM), and the EB method based on a control group (EBCG). Five scenarios were examined: a direct comparison of the methods, different dispersion parameter values of the Negative Binomial model, different sample sizes, different values of the index of safety effectiveness (theta), and different levels of uncertainty associated with the index. Based on the simulated scenarios (also supported theoretically), the study results showed that higher entry criteria, larger values of the safety effectiveness, and smaller dispersion parameter values will cause a larger selection bias. Furthermore, among all methods evaluated, the Naive and the EBMM methods are both significantly affected by the selection bias. Using a control group, or the EBCG, can mutually eliminate the site selection bias, as long as the characteristics of the control group (truncated data for the CG method or the non-truncated sample population for the EBCG method) are exactly the same as for the treatment group. In practice, finding datasets for the control group with the exact same characteristics as for the treatment group may not always be feasible. To overcome this problem, the method proposed in this study can be used to adjust the Naive estimator of the index of safety effectiveness, even when the mean and dispersion parameter are not properly estimated.

J	Li, CQ; Li, HW				Li, Chaoqun; Li, Hongwei			A Modified Short and Fukunaga Metric based on the attribute independence assumption	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Naive Bayes; Attribute independence assumption; Short and Fukunaga Metric; Value Difference Metric; Distance-related algorithms	BAYESIAN CLASSIFIER; LEARNING ALGORITHMS	It is well known that the naive Bayesian classifier assumes the attribute independence given the class. According to our observation, some distance functions also assume the attribute independence, such as Value Difference Metric (VDM). Short and Fukunaga Metric (SFM) is another widely used distance function, which does not assume the attribute independence. In this paper, we investigate the attribute independence assumption in VDM, and propose a Modified Short and Fukunaga Metric (MSFM) based on the attribute independence assumption. We find that MSFM is surprisingly similar to VDM. In fact, based on some assumptions, our MSFM can be regarded as a logarithmic modification of VDM. That is to say, in some sense, a logarithmic modification of SFM is equivalent to a logarithmic modification of VDM.

J	Ali, W; Shamsuddin, SM; Ismail, AS				Ali, Waleed; Shamsuddin, Siti Mariyam; Ismail, Abdul Samad			Intelligent Naive Bayes-based approaches for Web proxy caching	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Web caching; Proxy server; Cache replacement; Classification; Naive Bayes classifier	PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; NETWORK CLASSIFIERS; NEURAL-NETWORK; PREDICTION; SYSTEM; MODEL	Web proxy caching is one of the most successful solutions for improving the performance of Web-based systems. In Web proxy caching, the popular Web objects that are likely to be revisited in the near future are stored on the proxy server, which plays the key roles between users and Web sites in reducing the response time of user requests and saving the network bandwidth. However, the difficulty in determining the ideal Web objects that will be re-visited in the future is still a problem faced by existing conventional Web proxy caching techniques. In this paper, a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier is used to enhance the performance of conventional Web proxy caching approaches such as Least-Recently-Used (LRU) and Greedy-Dual-Size (GDS). NB is intelligently incorporated with conventional Web proxy caching techniques to form intelligent and effective caching approaches known as NB-GDS, NB-LRU and NB-DA. Experimental results have revealed that the proposed NB-GDS, NB-LRU and NB-DA significantly improve the performances of the existing Web proxy caching approaches across several proxy datasets.

Automated diagnosis of epileptic EEG using entropies	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Epilepsy; Preictal; Entropy; EEG; Feature extraction; Classifiers	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; HIGHER-ORDER SPECTRA; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; SEIZURE DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SIGNALS; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; DYNAMICS	Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by the presence of recurring seizures. Like many other neurological disorders, epilepsy can be assessed by the electroencephalogram (EEG). The EEG signal is highly non-linear and non-stationary, and hence, it is difficult to characterize and interpret it. However, it is a well-established clinical technique with low associated costs. In this work, we propose a methodology for the automatic detection of normal, pre-ictal, and ictal conditions from recorded EEG signals. Four entropy features namely Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Sample Entropy (SampEn), Phase Entropy 1 (Si), and Phase Entropy 2 (S2) were extracted from the collected EEG signals. These features were fed to seven different classifiers: Fuzzy Sugeno Classifier (FSC), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Decision Tree (DT), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC). Our results show that the Fuzzy classifier was able to differentiate the three classes with a high accuracy of 98.1%. Overall, compared to previous techniques, our proposed strategy is more suitable for diagnosis of epilepsy with higher accuracy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Acharya, U.

In this paper, we proposed a new feature selection algorithm, named CMFS, which comprehensively measures the significance of a term both in inter-category and intra-category. We evaluated CMFS on three benchmark document collections, 20-Newsgroups. Reuters-21578 and WebKB, using two classification algorithms, Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The experimental results, comparing CMFS with six well-known feature selection algorithms, show that the proposed method CMFS is significantly superior to Information Gain (IC), Chi statistic (CHI), Document Frequency (DF), Orthogonal Centroid Feature Selection (OCFS) and DIA association factor (DIA) when Nave Bayes classifier is used and significantly outperforms IC, DF, OCFS and DIA when Support Vector Machines are used.

An Efficient High-Frequency Linear RF Amplifier Synthesis Method Based on Evolutionary Computation and Machine Learning Techniques	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Differential evolution; efficient global optimization; expensive black-box optimization; Gaussian process; mm-wave frequency; radio frequency (RF) circuit synthesis	GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; POWER-AMPLIFIER; DESIGN; LAYOUT; TOOL; ICS	Existing radio frequency (RF) integrated circuit (IC) design automation methods focus on the synthesis of circuits at a few GHz, typically less than 10 GHz. That framework is difficult to apply to RF IC synthesis at mm-wave frequencies (e. g., 60-100 GHz). In this paper, a new method, called efficient machine learning-based differential evolution, is presented for mm-wave frequency linear RF amplifier synthesis. By using electromagnetic (EM) simulations to evaluate the key passive components, the evaluation of circuit performances is accurate and solves the limitations of parasitic-included equivalent circuit models and predefined layout templates used in the existing synthesis framework. A decomposition method separates the design variables that require expensive EM simulations and the variables that only need cheap circuit simulations. Hence, a low-dimensional expensive optimization problem is generated. By the newly proposed core algorithm integrating adaptive population generation, naive Bayes classification, Gaussian process and differential evolution, the generated low-dimensional expensive optimization problem can be solved efficiently (by the online surrogate model), and global search (by evolutionary computation) can be achieved. A 100 GHz three-stage differential amplifier is synthesized in a 90 nm CMOS technology. The power gain reaches 10 dB with more than 20 GHz bandwidth. The synthesis costs only 25 h, having a comparable result and a nine times speed enhancement compared with directly using the EM simulator and global optimization algorithms.

Congenic dissection of a major QTL for methamphetamine sensitivity implicates epistasis	GENES BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Addiction; congenic; genetic; locomotor; microarray; psychostimulant; QTL; reward; striatum; transcriptome	CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE; QUANTITATIVE TRAIT GENE; DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASES; AMPHETAMINE; EXPRESSION; ADDICTION; MOUSE; RATS; MECHANISM; RESPONSES	We previously used the C57BL/6J (B6) x A/J mouse chromosome substitution strain (CSS) panel to identify a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 11 influencing methamphetamine (MA)-induced locomotor activity. We then made an F2 cross between CSS-11 and B6 and narrowed the locus (Bayes credible interval: 79109 Mb) which was inherited dominantly and accounted for 14% of the phenotypic variance in the CSS panel. In the present study, we created congenic and subcongenic lines possessing heterozygous portions of this QTL to narrow the interval. We identified one line (8496 Mb) that recapitulated the QTL, thus narrowing the region to 12 Mb. This interval also produced a small decrease in locomotor activity following prior saline treatment. When we generated subcongenic lines spanning the entire 12-Mb region, the phenotypic difference in MA sensitivity abruptly disappeared, suggesting an epistatic mechanism. We also evaluated the rewarding properties of MA (2 mg/kg, i.p.) in the 84- to 96-Mb congenic line using the conditioned place preference (CPP) test. We replicated the locomotor difference in the MA-paired CPP chamber yet observed no effect of genotype on MA-CPP, supporting the specificity of this QTL for MA-induced locomotor activity under these conditions. Lastly, to aid in prioritizing candidate genes responsible for this QTL, we used the Affymetrix GeneChip (R) Mouse Gene 1.0ST Array to identify genes containing expression QTLs (eQTL) in the striatum of drug-naIve, congenic mice. These findings highlight the difficulty of using congenic lines to fine map QTLs and illustrate how epistasis may thwart such efforts.	[Bryant, C. D.; Kole, L. A.; Guido, M.

A semi-automated method for bone age assessment using cervical vertebral maturation	ANGLE ORTHODONTIST			English	Article						Decision support systems; Clinical; Age determination by skeleton; Cervical vertebrae; Orthodontics	MANDIBULAR GROWTH; AGREEMENT	Objective: To propose a semi-automated method for pattern classification to predict individuals' stage of growth based on morphologic characteristics that are described in the modified cervical vertebral maturation (CVM) method of Baccetti et al. Materials and Methods: A total of 188 lateral cephalograms were collected, digitized, evaluated manually, and grouped into cervical stages by two expert examiners. Landmarks were located on each image and measured. Three pattern classifiers based on the Naive Bayes algorithm were built and assessed using a software program. The classifier with the greatest accuracy according to the weighted kappa test was considered best. Results: The classifier showed a weighted kappa coefficient of 0.861 +/- 0.020. If an adjacent estimated pre-stage or poststage value was taken to be acceptable, the classifier would show a weighted kappa coefficient of 0.992 +/- 0.019. Conclusion: Results from this study show that the proposed semi-automated pattern classification method can help orthodontists identify the stage of CVM. However, additional studies are needed before this semi-automated classification method for CVM assessment can be implemented in clinical practice. (Angle Orthod. 2012;82:658-662.)

J	Bekhuis, T; Demner-Fushman, D				Bekhuis, Tanja; Demner-Fushman, Dina			Screening nonrandomized studies for medical systematic reviews: A comparative study of classifiers	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Review						Medical informatics; Clinical research informatics; Text mining; Document classification; Systematic reviews	TEXT CATEGORIZATION; SEARCH FILTERS; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; WORKLOAD; QUALITY	Objectives: To investigate whether (1) machine learning classifiers can help identify nonrandomized studies eligible for full-text screening by systematic reviewers; (2) classifier performance varies with optimization; and (3) the number of citations to screen can be reduced. Methods: We used an open-source, data-mining suite to process and classify biomedical citations that point to mostly nonrandomized studies from 2 systematic reviews. We built training and test sets for citation portions and compared classifier performance by considering the value of indexing, various feature sets, and optimization. We conducted our experiments in 2 phases. The design of phase I with no optimization was: 4 classifiers x 3 feature sets x 3 citation portions. Classifiers included k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, complement nave Bayes, and evolutionary support vector machine. Feature sets included bag of words, and 2- and 3-term n-grams. Citation portions included titles, titles and abstracts, and full citations with metadata. Phase II with optimization involved a subset of the classifiers, as well as features extracted from full citations, and full citations with overweighted titles. We optimized features and classifier parameters by manually setting information gain thresholds outside of a process for iterative grid optimization with 10-fold cross-validations. We independently tested models on data reserved for that purpose and statistically compared classifier performance on 2 types of feature sets. We estimated the number of citations needed to screen by reviewers during a second pass through a reduced set of citations. Results: In phase I, the evolutionary support vector machine returned the best recall for bag of words extracted from full citations; the best classifier with respect to overall performance was k-nearest neighbor. No classifier attained good enough recall for this task without optimization. In phase II, we boosted performance with optimization for evolutionary support vector machine and complement naive Bayes classifiers. Generalization performance was better for the latter in the independent tests. For evolutionary support vector machine and complement naive Bayes classifiers, the initial retrieval set was reduced by 46% and 35%, respectively. Conclusions: Machine learning classifiers can help identify nonrandomized studies eligible for full-text screening by systematic reviewers. Optimization can markedly improve performance of classifiers. However, generalizability varies with the classifier. The number of citations to screen during a second independent pass through the citations can be substantially reduced. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, D; Liu, Y				Wang, Dong; Liu, Yang			A cross-corpus study of subjectivity identification using unsupervised learning	NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING			English	Article								In this study, we investigate using unsupervised generative learning methods for subjectivity detection across different domains. We create an initial training set using simple lexicon information and then evaluate two iterative learning methods with a base naive Bayes classifier to learn from unannotated data. The first method is self-training, which adds instances with high confidence into the training set in each iteration. The second is a calibrated EM (expectation-maximization) method where we calibrate the posterior probabilities from EM such that the class distribution is similar to that in the real data. We evaluate both approaches on three different domains: movie data, news resource, and meeting dialogues, and we found that in some cases the unsupervised learning methods can achieve performance close to the fully supervised setup. We perform a thorough analysis to examine factors, such as self-labeling accuracy of the initial training set in unsupervised learning, the accuracy of the added examples in self-training, and the size of the initial training set in different methods. Our experiments and analysis show inherent differences across domains and impacting factors explaining the model behaviors.

Nine Data Mining Algorithms vs. the TNM Staging System	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; LUNG-CANCER PATIENTS; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; NODE-METASTASIS; 7TH EDITION; CARCINOMA; CLASSIFICATION; RADIOTHERAPY; MODELS; CART	Objective: Over the past decades, many studies have used data mining technology to predict the 5-year survival rate of colorectal cancer, but there have been few reports that compared multiple data mining algorithms to the TNM classification of malignant tumors (TNM) staging system using a dataset in which the training and testing data were from different sources. Here we compared nine data mining algorithms to the TNM staging system for colorectal survival analysis. Methods: Two different datasets were used: 1) the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results dataset; and 2) the dataset from a single Chinese institution. An optimization and prediction system based on nine data mining algorithms as well as two variable selection methods was implemented. The TNM staging system was based on the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM staging system. Results: When the training and testing data were from the same sources, all algorithms had slight advantages over the TNM staging system in predictive accuracy. When the data were from different sources, only four algorithms (logistic regression, general regression neural network, Bayesian networks, and Naive Bayes) had slight advantages over the TNM staging system. Also, there was no significant differences among all the algorithms (p>0.05). Conclusions: The TNM staging system is simple and practical at present, and data mining methods are not accurate enough to replace the TNM staging system for colorectal cancer survival prediction. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the predictive accuracy of all the algorithms when the data were from different sources. Building a larger dataset that includes more variables may be important for furthering predictive accuracy.

J	Fernandez-Martinez, F; Zablotskaya, K; Minker, W				Fernandez-Martinez, Fernando; Zablotskaya, Kseniya; Minker, Wolfgang			Text categorization methods for automatic estimation of verbal intelligence	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Spoken dialog systems; Naive Bayes classification; Rocchio approach; k-Nearest neighbors	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR	In this paper we investigate whether conventional text categorization methods may suffice to infer different verbal intelligence levels. This research goal relies on the hypothesis that the vocabulary that speakers make use of reflects their verbal intelligence levels. Automatic verbal intelligence estimation of users in a spoken language dialog system may be useful when defining an optimal dialog strategy by improving its adaptation capabilities. The work is based on a corpus containing descriptions (i.e. monologs) of a short film by test persons yielding different educational backgrounds and the verbal intelligence scores of the speakers. First, a one-way analysis of variance was performed to compare the monologs with the film transcription and to demonstrate that there are differences in the vocabulary used by the test persons yielding different verbal intelligence levels. Then, for the classification task, the monologs were represented as feature vectors using the classical TF-IDF weighting scheme. The Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors and Rocchio classifiers were tested. In this paper we describe and compare these classification approaches, define the optimal classification parameters and discuss the classification results obtained. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A comparative study of Naive Bayes classifier and Bayes net classifier for fault diagnosis of monoblock centrifugal pump using wavelet analysis	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Wavelet analysis; Naive Bayes; Bayes net	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; DECISION TREE; ROTATING MACHINERY; FEATURE-SELECTION; FUZZY CLASSIFIER; NEURAL-NETWORKS; ROLLER BEARING; SYSTEM; TRANSFORM	In most of the industries related to mechanical engineering, the usage of pumps is high. Hence, the system which takes care of the continuous running of the pump becomes essential. In this paper, a vibration based condition monitoring system is presented for monoblock centrifugal pumps as it plays relatively critical role in most of the industries. This approach has mainly three steps namely feature extraction, classification and comparison of classification. In spite of availability of different efficient algorithms for fault detection, the wavelet analysis for feature extraction and Naive Bayes algorithm and Bayes net algorithm for classification is taken and compared. This paper presents the use of Naive Bayes algorithm and Bayes net algorithm for fault diagnosis through discrete wavelet features extracted from vibration signals of good and faulty conditions of the components of centrifugal pump. The classification accuracies of different discrete wavelet families were calculated and compared to find the best wavelet for the fault diagnosis of the centrifugal pump. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Dai, JF; Feng, JJ; Zhou, J				Dai, Jifeng; Feng, Jianjiang; Zhou, Jie			Robust and Efficient Ridge-Based Palmprint Matching	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Palmprint; orientation field; density map; data fusion; distortion; matching; cascade filtering; generalized Hough transform; naive Bayes classifier	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; FINGERPRINT; IDENTIFICATION; VERIFICATION; TRANSFORM; ALGORITHM; FEATURES	During the past decade, many efforts have been made to use palmprints as a biometric modality. However, most of the existing palmprint recognition systems are based on encoding and matching creases, which are not as reliable as ridges. This affects the use of palmprints in large-scale person identification applications where the biometric modality needs to be distinctive as well as insensitive to changes in age and skin conditions. Recently, several ridge-based palmprint matching algorithms have been proposed to fill the gap. Major contributions of these systems include reliable orientation field estimation in the presence of creases and the use of multiple features in matching, while the matching algorithms adopted in these systems simply follow the matching algorithms for fingerprints. However, palmprints differ from fingerprints in several aspects: 1) Palmprints are much larger and thus contain a large number of minutiae, 2) palms are more deformable than fingertips, and 3) the quality and discrimination power of different regions in palmprints vary significantly. As a result, these matchers are unable to appropriately handle the distortion and noise, despite heavy computational cost. Motivated by the matching strategies of human palmprint experts, we developed a novel palmprint recognition system. The main contributions are as follows: 1) Statistics of major features in palmprints are quantitatively studied, 2) a segment-based matching and fusion algorithm is proposed to deal with the skin distortion and the varying discrimination power of different palmprint regions, and 3) to reduce the computational complexity, an orientation field-based registration algorithm is designed for registering the palmprints into the same coordinate system before matching and a cascade filter is built to reject the nonmated gallery palmprints in early stage. The proposed matcher is tested by matching 840 query palmprints against a gallery set of 13,736 palmprints. Experimental results show that the proposed matcher outperforms the existing matchers a lot both in matching accuracy and speed.

J	Kose, C; Sevik, U; Ikibas, C; Erdol, H				Kose, Cemal; Sevik, Ugur; Ikibas, Cevat; Erdol, Hidayet			Simple methods for segmentation and measurement of diabetic retinopathy lesions in retinal fundus images	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Automatic diagnosis of DR; Automatic segmentation; Background image extraction; DR; Medical image analysis; Optic disc; Retinal images	BLOOD-VESSEL DETECTION; MACULAR DEGENERATION; OPTIC DISC; AUTOMATED SEGMENTATION; DIAGNOSIS; PHOTOGRAPHS; DRUSEN; FILTER	Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most important complications of diabetes mellitus, which causes serious damages in the retina, consequently visual loss and sometimes blindness if necessary medical treatment is not applied on time. One of the difficulties in this illness is that the patient with diabetes mellitus requires a continuous screening for early detection. So far, numerous methods have been proposed by researchers to automate the detection process of DR in retinal fundus images. In this paper, we developed an alternative simple approach to detect DR. This method was built on the inverse segmentation method, which we suggested before to detect Age Related Macular Degeneration (ARMDs). Background image approach along with inverse segmentation is employed to measure and follow up the degenerations in retinal fundus images. Direct segmentation techniques generate unsatisfactory results in some cases. This is because of the fact that the texture of unhealthy areas such as DR is not homogenous. The inverse method is proposed to exploit the homogeneity of healthy areas rather than dealing with varying structure of unhealthy areas for segmenting bright lesions (hard exudates and cotton wool spots). On the other hand, the background image, dividing the retinal image into high and low intensity areas, is exploited in segmentation of hard exudates and cotton wool spots, and microaneurysms (MAs) and hemorrhages (HEMs), separately. Therefore, a complete segmentation system is developed for segmenting DR, including hard exudates, cotton wool spots, MAs, and HEMS. This application is able to measure total changes across the whole retinal image. Hence, retinal images that belong to the same patients are examined in order to monitor the trend of the illness. To make a comparison with other methods, a Naive Bayes method is applied for segmentation of DR. The performance of the system, tested on different data sets including various qualities of retinal fundus images, is over 95% in detection of the optic disc (OD), and 90% in segmentation of the DR.

Yet, unnecessary use of chemotherapy can worsen patients' quality of life due to treatment-related toxicities. Thus, accurate prediction of survival in terminally ill patients can help clinicians decide on the most appropriate palliative care for these patients. However, studies have shown that clinicians often make imprecise predictions of survival in cancer patients. Hence, the purpose of this study was to create a clinical decision support tool to predict survival in cancer patients beyond 120 days after palliative chemotherapy. Materials and Methods: Data were obtained from a retrospective study of 400 randomly selected terminally ill cancer patients in the National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS) from 2008 to 2009. After removing patients with missing data, there were 325 patients remaining for model development. Three classification algorithms, naive Bayes (NB), neural network (NN), and support vector machine (SVM) were used to create the models. A final model with the best prediction performance was then selected to develop the tool. Results: The NN model had the best prediction performance. The accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and area under the curve (AUC) of this model were 78%, 82%, 74%, and 0.857, respectively. Five patient attributes (albumin level, alanine transaminase level (ATL), absolute neutrophil count, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status, and number of metastatic sites) were included in the model. Conclusions: A decision support tool to predict survival in cancer patients beyond 120 days after palliative chemotherapy was created. With further validation, this tool coupled with the professional judgment of clinicians can help improve patient care.

The present study was conducted to investigate the alterations in the serum proteome in GBM patients compared to healthy controls. Comparative proteomic analysis was performed employing classical 2DE and 2D-DIGE combined with MALDI TOF/TOF MS and results were further validated through Western blotting and immunoturbidimetric assay. Comparison of the serum proteome of GBM and healthy subjects revealed 55 differentially expressed and statistically significant (p <0.05) protein spots. Among the identified proteins, haptoglobin, plasminogen precursor, apolipoprotein A-1 and M, and transthyretin are very significant due to their functional consequences in glioma tumor growth and migration, and could further be studied as glioma biomarkers and grade-specific protein signatures. Analysis of the lipoprotein pattern indicated elevated serum levels of cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and low-density lipoproteins in GBM patients. Functional pathway analysis was performed using multiple software including ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA), protein analysis through evolutionary relationships (PANTHER), database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID), and GeneSpring to investigate the biological context of the identified proteins, which revealed the association of candidate proteins in a few essential physiological pathways such as intrinsic prothrombin activation pathway, plasminogen activating cascade, coagulation system, glioma invasiveness signaling, and PI3K signaling in B lymphocytes. A subset of the differentially expressed proteins was applied to build statistical sample class prediction models for discrimination of GBM patients and healthy controls employing partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and other machine learning methods such as support vector machine (SVM), Decision Tree and Naive Bayes, and excellent discrimination between GBM and control groups was accomplished.

In this work, we make use of the Conformal Prediction framework for the assessment of stroke risk based on ultrasound images of atherosclerotic carotid plaques. For this application, images were recorded from 137 asymptomatic and 137 symptomatic plaques (symptoms are Stroke, Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA), and Amaurosis Fugax (AF)). Two feature sets were extracted from the plaques; the first based on morphological image analysis and the second based on image texture analysis. Both sets were used in order to evaluate the performance of CPs on this problem. Four CPs were constructed using four popular classification methods, namely Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Naive Bayes Classification (NBC), and k-Nearest Neighbours. The results given by all CPs demonstrate the reliability and importance of the obtained confidence measures on the problem of stroke risk assessment.

J	Liu, T; Guan, XH; Qu, Y; Sun, YA				Liu, Ting; Guan, Xiaohong; Qu, Yu; Sun, Yanan			A layered classification for malicious function identification and malware detection	CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE			English	Article						layered classification; network security; malware detection; malicious function identification	EXECUTABLES; ALGORITHMS	Millions of new malicious programs are produced by the mature industry of malware production. These programs have tremendous challenges on the signature-based antivirus products. Machine learning techniques are applicable for detecting unknown malicious programs without knowing their signatures. In this paper, a layered classification method is developed to detect malwares with a two-layer framework. The low-level-classifier is employed to identify whether the programs perform any malicious functions according to the API-calls of the programs; the up-level-classifier is applied to detect malwares according to the function identification. A hybrid structure called Type-Function, constituting of the classification results of low-level-classifier and up-level-classifier, is proposed to describe the malware. This method is compared with Naive Bayes, decision tree, and boosting using a comprehensive test dataset containing 16,135 malwares and 1800 benign programs. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other algorithms in terms of detection accuracy. Moreover, the Type-Function structure is proved as an unprejudiced and effective method for malware description. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

These small RNAs have now been shown to be critical regulators in a number of biological processes in the cell including pathophysiology of diseases like cancers. The increasingly evident roles of microRNA in disease processes have also motivated attempts to target them therapeutically. Recently there has been immense interest in understanding small molecule mediated regulation of RNA, including microRNA. Results: We have used publicly available datasets of high throughput screens on small molecules with potential to inhibit microRNA. We employed computational methods based on chemical descriptors and machine learning to create predictive computational models for biological activity of small molecules. We further used a substructure based approach to understand common substructures potentially contributing to the activity. Conclusion: We generated computational models based on Naive Bayes and Random Forest towards mining small RNA binding molecules from large molecular datasets. We complement this with substructure based approach to identify and understand potentially enriched substructures in the active dataset. We use this approach to identify miRNA binding potential of a set of approved drugs, suggesting a probable novel mechanism of off-target activity of these drugs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and most comprehensive computational analysis towards understanding RNA binding activities of small molecules and predictive modeling of these activities.

In this paper, the thermogravimetric (TG) curves of 49 wood samples are used to classify them in 7 predetermined species. Different functional and multivariate statistical supervised classification methods are used for this task: a nonparametric Nadaraya-Watson kernel functional estimator (K-NFDA), using the complete TG curves, and multivariate supervised classification approaches, such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Naive Bayes (NBC), Neural Networks (NN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Before applying the multivariate techniques, the TG curves are discretized using principal component analysis (PCA) or fitting a four-component generalized logistic model. The results show that the classical method of LDA using the logistic parameters had the best performance, although high correct classification percentages were also obtained with the rest of the approaches. The work is completed with a comprehensive simulation study, comparing the classification techniques in different scenarios. Artificial TG curves are generated using the logistic model and additional conclusions on wood classification are established. Due to the heterogeneity of wood, this simulation study is very useful to describe worst-case scenarios and to assess more accurately the proposed classification methodologies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The lip color of a person is considered as a symptom to reflect the physical conditions of organs in the body. However, the traditional diagnostic approach is mainly based on observation by doctor's nude eyes, which is non-quantitative and subjective. The non-quantitative approach largely depends on the doctor's experience and influences accurate the diagnosis and treatment in TCM. Developing new quantification methods to identify the exact syndrome based on the lip diagnosis of TCM becomes urgent and important. In this paper, we design a computer-assisted classification model to provide an automatic and quantitative approach for the diagnosis of TCM based on the lip images. Methods: A computer-assisted classification method is designed and applied for syndrome diagnosis based on the lip images. Our purpose is to classify the lip images into four groups: deep-red, red, purple and pale. The proposed scheme consists of four steps including the lip image preprocessing, image feature extraction, feature selection and classification. The extracted 84 features contain the lip color space component, texture and moment features. Feature subset selection is performed by using SVM-RFE (Support Vector Machine with recursive feature elimination), mRMR (minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance) and IG (information gain). Classification model is constructed based on the collected lip image features using multi-class SVM and Weighted multi-class SVM (WSVM). In addition, we compare SVM with k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm, Multiple Asymmetric Partial Least Squares Classifier (MAPLSC) and Naive Bayes for the diagnosis performance comparison. All displayed faces image have obtained consent from the participants. Results: A total of 257 lip images are collected for the modeling of lip diagnosis in TCM. The feature selection method SVM-RFE selects 9 important features which are composed of 5 color component features, 3 texture features and 1 moment feature. SVM, MAPLSC, Naive Bayes, kNN showed better classification results based on the 9 selected features than the results obtained from all the 84 features. The total classification accuracy of the five methods is 84%, 81%, 79% and 81%, 77%, respectively. So SVM achieves the best classification accuracy. The classification accuracy of SVM is 81%, 71%, 89% and 86% on Deep-red, Pale Purple, Red and lip image models, respectively. While with the feature selection algorithm mRMR and IG, the total classification accuracy of WSVM achieves the best classification accuracy. Therefore, the results show that the system can achieve best classification accuracy combined with SVM classifiers and SVM-REF feature selection algorithm. Conclusions: A diagnostic system is proposed, which firstly segments the lip from the original facial image based on the Chan-Vese level set model and Otsu method, then extracts three kinds of features (color space features, Haralick co-occurrence features and Zernike moment features) on the lip image. Meanwhile, SVM-REF is adopted to select the optimal features. Finally, SVM is applied to classify the four classes. Besides, we also compare different feature selection algorithms and classifiers to verify our system. So the developed automatic and quantitative diagnosis system of TCM is effective to distinguish four lip image classes: Deep-red, Purple, Red and Pale. This study puts forward a new method and idea for the quantitative examination on lip diagnosis of TCM, as well as provides a template for objective diagnosis in TCM.

Job performance prediction in a call center using a naive Bayes classifier	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Employee turnover; Job performance; Naive Bayesian classifier; Call center	PERSONNEL-SELECTION	This study presents an approach to predict the performance of sales agents of a call center dedicated exclusively to sales and telemarketing activities. This approach is based on a naive Bayesian classifier. The objective is to know what levels of the attributes are indicative of individuals who perform well. A sample of 1037 sales agents was taken during the period between March and September of 2009 on campaigns related to insurance sales and service pre-paid phone services, to build the naive Bayes network. It has been shown that, socio-demographic attributes are not suitable for predicting performance. Alternatively, operational records were used to predict production of sales agents, achieving satisfactory results. In this case, the classifier training and testing is done through a stratified tenfold cross-validation. It classified the instances correctly 80.60% of times, with the proportion of false positives of 18.1% for class no (does not achieve minimum) and 20.8% for the class yes (achieves equal or above minimum acceptable). These results suggest that socio-demographic attributes has no predictive power on performance, while the operational information of the activities of the sale agent can predict the future performance of the agent.

Exploring the behaviour of base classifiers in credit scoring ensembles	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Finance; Credit scoring; Classifier ensemble	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; PREDICTION; BANKRUPTCY; MODEL	Many techniques have been proposed for credit risk assessment, from statistical models to artificial intelligence methods. During the last few years, different approaches to classifier ensembles have successfully been applied to credit scoring problems, demonstrating to be more accurate than single prediction models. However, it is still a question what base classifiers should be employed in each ensemble in order to achieve the highest performance. Accordingly, the present paper evaluates the performance of seven individual prediction techniques when used as members of five different ensemble methods. The ultimate aim of this study is to suggest appropriate classifiers for each ensemble approach in the context of credit scoring. The experimental results and statistical tests show that the C4.5 decision tree constitutes the best solution for most ensemble methods, closely followed by the multilayer perceptron neural network and logistic regression, whereas the nearest neighbour and the naive Bayes classifiers appear to be significantly the worst.

An unsupervised approach to feature discretization and selection	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Feature discretization; Feature quantization; Feature selection; Linde-Buzo-Gray algorithm; Sparse data; Support vector machines; Naive Bayes; k-nearest neighbor	RANDOM SUBSPACE METHOD; MICROARRAY DATA; GENE SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; CANCER; INFORMATION; REDUNDANCY; RELEVANCE	Many learning problems require handling high dimensional datasets with a relatively small number of instances. Learning algorithms are thus confronted with the curse of dimensionality, and need to address it in order to be effective. Examples of these types of data include the bag-of-words representation in text classification problems and gene expression data for tumor detection/classification. Usually, among the high number of features characterizing the instances, many may be irrelevant (or even detrimental) for the learning tasks. It is thus clear that there is a need for adequate techniques for feature representation, reduction, and selection, to improve both the classification accuracy and the memory requirements. In this paper, we propose combined unsupervised feature discretization and feature selection techniques, suitable for medium and high-dimensional datasets. The experimental results on several standard datasets, with both sparse and dense features, show the efficiency of the proposed techniques as well as improvements over previous related techniques.

This paper explores the possibility of using this model for multidimensional data visualization. To achieve this, a new learning algorithm called naive Bayes self-organizing map (NBSOM) is proposed to enable the naive Bayes model to perform topographic mappings. The training is carried out by means of an online expectation maximization algorithm with a self-organizing principle. The proposed method is compared with principal component analysis, self-organizing maps, and generative topographic mapping on two benchmark data sets and a real-world image processing application. Overall, the results show the effectiveness of NBSOM for multidimensional data visualization.

This method enables high pixel-depth watermark embedding, while maintaining high image quality. This technique is capable of embedding watermarks with pixel depths up to 3 bits without causing prominent degradation to the image quality. To achieve high image quality, the parallel oriented high-efficient direct binary search (DBS) halftoning is selected to be integrated with the proposed orientation modulation (OM) method. The OM method utilizes different halftone texture orientations to carry different watermark data. In the decoder, the least-mean-square-trained filters are applied for feature extraction from watermarked images in the frequency domain, and the naive Bayes classifier is used to analyze the extracted features and ultimately to decode the watermark data. Experimental results show that the DBS-based OM encoding method maintains a high degree of image quality and realizes the processing efficiency and robustness to be adapted in printing applications.

Parameter uncertainty in portfolio selection: Shrinking the inverse covariance matrix	JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE			English	Article						Portfolio optimisation; Inverse covariance matrix; Estimation risk; Shrinkage	MULTINORMAL PRECISION MATRIX; NAIVE DIVERSIFICATION; EFFICIENT PORTFOLIOS; EMPIRICAL BAYES; OPTIMIZATION; VARIANCE; CHOICE; MODEL; SENSITIVITY; PERFORMANCE	The estimation of the inverse covariance matrix plays a crucial role in optimal portfolio choice. We propose a new estimation framework that focuses on enhancing portfolio performance. The framework applies the statistical methodology of shrinkage directly to the inverse covariance matrix using two non-parametric methods. The first minimises the out-of-sample portfolio variance while the second aims to increase out-of-sample risk-adjusted returns. We apply the resulting estimators to compute the minimum variance portfolio weights and obtain a set of new portfolio strategies. These strategies have an intuitive form which allows us to extend our framework to account for short-sale constraints, transaction costs and singular covariance matrices. A comparative empirical analysis against several strategies from the literature shows that the new strategies often offer higher risk-adjusted returns and lower levels of risk. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, probabilistic-based methods were employed to develop prediction models on hERG inhibition prediction, which are different from traditional QSAR models that are mainly based on supervised hard point (HP) classification approaches giving yes/no answers. The obtained models can ascertain whether or not a given set of compounds can block hERG ion channels. The results presented indicate that the proposed probabilistic-based method can be a valuable tool for ranking compounds with respect to their potential cardio-toxicity and will be promising for other toxic property predictions.

J	Peck, JS; Benneyan, JC; Nightingale, DJ; Gaehde, SA				Peck, Jordan S.; Benneyan, James C.; Nightingale, Deborah J.; Gaehde, Stephan A.			Predicting Emergency Department Inpatient Admissions to Improve Same-day Patient Flow	ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE			English	Article							AMBULANCE DIVERSION; ADMITTED PATIENTS	ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE 2012; 19:10451054 (C) 2012 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine Abstract Objectives: The objectives were to evaluate three models that use information gathered during triage to predict, in real time, the number of emergency department (ED) patients who subsequently will be admitted to a hospital inpatient unit (IU) and to introduce a new methodology for implementing these predictions in the hospital setting. Methods: Three simple methods were compared for predicting hospital admission at ED triage: expert opinion, naive Bayes conditional probability, and a generalized linear regression model with a logit link function (logit-linear). Two months of data were gathered from the Boston VA Healthcare Systems 13-bed ED, which receives approximately 1,100 patients per month. Triage nurses were asked to estimate the likelihood that each of 767 triaged patients from that 2-month period would be admitted after their ED treatment, by placing them into one of six categories ranging from low to high likelihood. Logit-linear regression and naive Bayes models also were developed using retrospective data and used to estimate admission probabilities for each patient who entered the ED within a 2-month time frame, during triage hours (1,160 patients). Predictors considered included patient age, primary complaint, provider, designation (ED or fast track), arrival mode, and urgency level (emergency severity index assigned at triage). Results: Of the three methods considered, logit-linear regression performed the best in predicting total bed need, with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.887, an R2 of 0.58, an average estimation error of 0.19 beds per day, and on average roughly 3.5 hours before peak demand occurred. Significant predictors were patient age, primary complaint, bed type designation, and arrival mode (p < 0.0001 for all factors). The naive Bayesian model had similar positive predictive value, with an AUC of 0.841 and an R2 of 0.58, but with average difference in total bed need of approximately 2.08 per day. Triage nurse expert opinion also had some predictive capability, with an R2 of 0.52 and an average difference in total bed need of 1.87 per day. Conclusions: Simple probability models can reasonably predict ED-to-IU patient volumes based on basic data gathered at triage. This predictive information could be used for improved real-time bed management, patient flow, and discharge processes. Both statistical models were reasonably accurate, using only a minimal number of readily available independent variables.

Aquatic weed automatic classification using machine learning techniques	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Aquatic weed; Optimum-path forest; Support vector machines; Naive Bayes; Artificial neural networks; Shape analysis	SPECIES DISCRIMINATION; NEURAL-NETWORK; SHAPE-ANALYSIS	Aquatic weed control through chemical products has attracted much attention in the last years, mainly because of the ecological disorder caused by such plants, and also the consequences to the economical activities. However, this kind of control has been carried out in a non-automatic way by technicians, and may be a not healthy policy, since each species may react differently to the same herbicide. Thus, this work proposes the automatic identification of some species by means of supervised pattern recognition techniques and shape descriptors in order to compose a nearby future expert system for automatic application of the correct herbicide. Experiments using some state-of-the-art techniques have shown the robustness of the employed pattern recognition techniques. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Pereira, Luis A.

So far, publicly available data sets used for modeling Pgp transport included compounds tested in different assays, different cell lines, and different protocols. In this work, we present a collection of 478 Efflux Ratios (ERs) in MDCK-MDR1 cell lines, and from this collection we define a data set of 187 compounds that were tested in the Borst-derived MDCK-MDR1 cell lines. Of the 23 models resulting from the use of different descriptors, classification algorithms, and variable selection techniques, the 4 most accurate in external validation (similar to 0.86) are based on VolSurf+ (VS+) descriptors. Two of these models are Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers using 4 descriptors that were selected through a new technique hereby first time extensively described.

Classification Accuracies of Physical Activities Using Smartphone Motion Sensors	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						Activity classification; machine learning; accelerometer; gyroscope; smartphone	UNITED-STATES	Background: Over the past few years, the world has witnessed an unprecedented growth in smartphone use. With sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes on board, smartphones have the potential to enhance our understanding of health behavior, in particular physical activity or the lack thereof. However, reliable and valid activity measurement using only a smartphone in situ has not been realized. Objective: To examine the validity of the iPod Touch (Apple, Inc.) and particularly to understand the value of using gyroscopes for classifying types of physical activity, with the goal of creating a measurement and feedback system that easily integrates into individuals' daily living. Methods: We collected accelerometer and gyroscope data for 16 participants on 13 activities with an iPod Touch, a device that has essentially the same sensors and computing platform as an iPhone. The 13 activities were sitting, walking, jogging, and going upstairs and downstairs at different paces. We extracted time and frequency features, including mean and variance of acceleration and gyroscope on each axis, vector magnitude of acceleration, and fast Fourier transform magnitude for each axis of acceleration. Different classifiers were compared using the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) toolkit, including C4.5 (J48) decision tree, multilayer perception, naive Bayes, logistic, k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and meta-algorithms such as boosting and bagging. The 10-fold cross-validation protocol was used. Results: Overall, the kNN classifier achieved the best accuracies: 52.3%-79.4% for up and down stair walking, 91.7% for jogging, 90.1%-94.1% for walking on a level ground, and 100% for sitting. A 2-second sliding window size with a 1-second overlap worked the best. Adding gyroscope measurements proved to be more beneficial than relying solely on accelerometer readings for all activities (with improvement ranging from 3.1% to 13.4%). Conclusions: Common categories of physical activity and sedentary behavior (walking, jogging, and sitting) can be recognized with high accuracies using both the accelerometer and gyroscope onboard the iPod touch or iPhone. This suggests the potential of developing just-in-time classification and feedback tools on smartphones.

J	Beiki, AH; Saboor, S; Ebrahimi, M				Beiki, Amir H.; Saboor, Saba; Ebrahimi, Mansour			A New Avenue for Classification and Prediction of Olive Cultivars Using Supervised and Unsupervised Algorithms	PLOS ONE			English	Article							OLEA-EUROPAEA L.; GENETIC DIVERSITY; FEATURE-SELECTION; ENZYME THERMOSTABILITY; SOUTHERN SPAIN; SP-NOV.; DNA; SEQUENCE; MARKER; IDENTIFICATION	Various methods have been used to identify cultivares of olive trees; herein we used different bioinformatics algorithms to propose new tools to classify 10 cultivares of olive based on RAPD and ISSR genetic markers datasets generated from PCR reactions. Five RAPD markers (OPA0a21, OPD16a, OP01a1, OPD16a1 and OPA0a8) and five ISSR markers (UBC841a4, UBC868a7, UBC841a14, U12BC807a and UBC810a13) selected as the most important markers by all attribute weighting models. K-Medoids unsupervised clustering run on SVM dataset was fully able to cluster each olive cultivar to the right classes. All trees (176) induced by decision tree models generated meaningful trees and UBC841a4 attribute clearly distinguished between foreign and domestic olive cultivars with 100% accuracy. Predictive machine learning algorithms (SVM and Naive Bayes) were also able to predict the right class of olive cultivares with 100% accuracy. For the first time, our results showed data mining techniques can be effectively used to distinguish between plant cultivares and proposed machine learning based systems in this study can predict new olive cultivars with the best possible accuracy.

J	Malovini, A; Barbarini, N; Bellazzi, R				Malovini, Alberto; Barbarini, Nicola; Bellazzi, Riccardo			Hierarchical Naive Bayes for genetic association studies	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; DISEASE; LASSO; SNPS; POLYMORPHISMS; CLASSIFIERS; REGRESSION; MODEL	Background: Genome Wide Association Studies represent powerful approaches that aim at disentangling the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits. The usual "one-SNP-at-the-time" testing strategy cannot capture the multi-factorial nature of this kind of disorders. We propose a Hierarchical Naive Bayes classification model for taking into account associations in SNPs data characterized by Linkage Disequilibrium. Validation shows that our model reaches classification performances superior to those obtained by the standard Naive Bayes classifier for simulated and real datasets. Methods: In the Hierarchical Naive Bayes implemented, the SNPs mapping to the same region of Linkage Disequilibrium are considered as "details" or "replicates" of the locus, each contributing to the overall effect of the region on the phenotype. A latent variable for each block, which models the "population" of correlated SNPs, can be then used to summarize the available information. The classification is thus performed relying on the latent variables conditional probability distributions and on the SNPs data available. Results: The developed methodology has been tested on simulated datasets, each composed by 300 cases, 300 controls and a variable number of SNPs. Our approach has been also applied to two real datasets on the genetic bases of Type 1 Diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes generated by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. Conclusions: The approach proposed in this paper, called Hierarchical Naive Bayes, allows dealing with classification of examples for which genetic information of structurally correlated SNPs are available. It improves the Naive Bayes performances by properly handling the within-loci variability.

To fully capture the genetic biomarkers that jointly explain the heritability component of a disease, thus, all SNPs from a genome-wide association study should be analyzed simultaneously. Results: In this paper, we present Bag of Naive Bayes (BoNB), an algorithm for genetic biomarker selection and subjects classification from the simultaneous analysis of genome-wide SNP data. BoNB is based on the Naive Bayes classification framework, enriched by three main features: bootstrap aggregating of an ensemble of Naive Bayes classifiers, a novel strategy for ranking and selecting the attributes used by each classifier in the ensemble and a permutation-based procedure for selecting significant biomarkers, based on their marginal utility in the classification process. BoNB is tested on the Wellcome Trust Case-Control study on Type 1 Diabetes and its performance is compared with the ones of both a standard Naive Bayes algorithm and HyperLASSO, a penalized logistic regression algorithm from the state-of-the-art in simultaneous genome-wide data analysis. Conclusions: The significantly higher classification accuracy obtained by BoNB, together with the significance of the biomarkers identified from the Type 1 Diabetes dataset, prove the effectiveness of BoNB as an algorithm for both classification and biomarker selection from genome-wide SNP data.

J	Magis, AT; Price, ND				Magis, Andrew T.; Price, Nathan D.			The top-scoring 'N' algorithm: a generalized relative expression classification method from small numbers of biomolecules	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Classification; Top-scoring pair; Relative expression; Cross validation; Support vector machine; Graphics processing unit; Microarray	GENE-EXPRESSION; PROSTATE-CANCER; PROCESSING UNITS; PREDICTION; TUMOR; CELL; DIAGNOSIS; PATTERNS	Background: Relative expression algorithms such as the top-scoring pair (TSP) and the top-scoring triplet (TST) have several strengths that distinguish them from other classification methods, including resistance to overfitting, invariance to most data normalization methods, and biological interpretability. The top-scoring 'N' (TSN) algorithm is a generalized form of other relative expression algorithms which uses generic permutations and a dynamic classifier size to control both the permutation and combination space available for classification. Results: TSN was tested on nine cancer datasets, showing statistically significant differences in classification accuracy between different classifier sizes (choices of N). TSN also performed competitively against a wide variety of different classification methods, including artificial neural networks, classification trees, discriminant analysis, k-Nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, and support vector machines, when tested on the Microarray Quality Control II datasets. Furthermore, TSN exhibits low levels of overfitting on training data compared to other methods, giving confidence that results obtained during cross validation will be more generally applicable to external validation sets. Conclusions: TSN preserves the strengths of other relative expression algorithms while allowing a much larger permutation and combination space to be explored, potentially improving classification accuracies when fewer numbers of measured features are available.

J	Jiang, LX; Cai, ZH; Zhang, H; Wang, DH				Jiang, Liangxiao; Cai, Zhihua; Zhang, Harry; Wang, Dianhong			Not so greedy: Randomly Selected Naive Bayes	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Naive Bayes; Attribute selection; Random search; Classification; Ranking; Class probability estimation	CLASS PROBABILITY ESTIMATION; DECISION TREE; ROC CURVE; ALGORITHMS; NETWORKS; RANKING; AREA	Many approaches are proposed to improve Naive Bayes, among which the attribute selection approach has demonstrated remarkable performance. Algorithms for attribute selection fall into two broad categories: filters and wrappers. Filters use the general data characteristics to evaluate the selected attribute subset before the learning algorithm is run, while wrappers use the learning algorithm itself as a black box to evaluate the selected attribute subset. In this paper, we work on the attribute selection approach of wrapper and propose an improved Naive Bayes algorithm by carrying a random search through the whole space of attributes. We simply called it Randomly Selected Naive Bayes (RSNB). In order to meet the need of classification, ranking, and class probability estimation, we discriminatively design three different versions: RSNB-ACC, RSNB-AUC, and RSNB-CLL. The experimental results based on a large number of UCI datasets validate their effectiveness in terms of classification accuracy (ACC), area under the ROC curve (AUC), and conditional log likelihood (CLL), respectively.

Annotating the functions of proteins identified in this data has become a big and crucial problem. Various computational methods have been developed to infer the protein functions based on either the sequences or domains of proteins. The existing methods, however, ignore the recurrence and the order of the protein domains in this function inference. Results: We developed two new methods to infer protein functions based on protein domain recurrence and domain order. Our first method, DRDO, calculates the posterior probability of the Gene Ontology terms based on domain recurrence and domain order information, whereas our second method, DRDO-NB, relies on the naive Bayes methodology using the same domain architecture information. Our large-scale benchmark comparisons show strong improvements in the accuracy of the protein function inference achieved by our new methods, demonstrating that domain recurrence and order can provide important information for inference of protein functions.

The proposed method is based on canonical correlations between the predictors X and responses Y. The paper proposes a modified version of the canonical correlation matrix Sigma(-1/2)(X) Sigma(XY) Sigma(-1/2)(Y) which is suitable for discrimination with class labels Y in a HDLSS context. The modified canonical correlation matrix yields ranking vectors for variable selection, a discriminant direction and a rule which is essentially equivalent to the naive Bayes rule. The paper examines the asymptotic behavior of the ranking vectors and the discriminant direction and gives precise conditions for HDLSS consistency in terms of the growth rates of the dimension and sample size. The feature selection induced by the discriminant direction as ranking vector is shown to work efficiently in simulations and in applications to real HDLSS data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Automated, highly-accurate, bug assignment using machine learning and tossing graphs	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Bug assignment; Bug tossing; Machine learning; Empirical studies		Empirical studies indicate that automating the bug assignment process has the potential to significantly reduce software evolution effort and costs. Prior work has used machine learning techniques to automate bug assignment but has employed a narrow band of tools which can be ineffective in large, long-lived software projects. To redress this situation, in this paper we employ a comprehensive set of machine learning tools and a probabilistic graph-based model (bug tossing graphs) that lead to highly-accurate predictions, and lay the foundation for the next generation of machine learning-based bug assignment. Our work is the first to examine the impact of multiple machine learning dimensions (classifiers, attributes, and training history) along with bug tossing graphs on prediction accuracy in bug assignment. We validate our approach on Mozilla and Eclipse, covering 856,259 bug reports and 21 cumulative years of development. We demonstrate that our techniques can achieve up to 86.09% prediction accuracy in bug assignment and significantly reduce tossing path lengths. We show that for our data sets the Naive Bayes classifier coupled with product-component features, tossing graphs and incremental learning performs best. Next, we perform an ablative analysis by unilaterally varying classifiers, features, and learning model to show their relative importance of on bug assignment accuracy. Finally, we propose optimization techniques that achieve high prediction accuracy while reducing training and prediction time. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Firstly, the concept of mean potentiality approach (MPA) has been developed and an algorithm based on this new approach has been proposed to get a balanced solution of a fuzzy soft set based decision making problem. Secondly, a parameter reduction procedure based on relational algebra with the help of the balanced algorithm of mean potentiality approach has been used to reduce the choice parameter set in the parlance of fuzzy soft set theory and it is justified to the problems of diagnosis of a disease from the myriad of symptoms from medical science. Moreover the feasibility of this proposed method is demonstrated by comparing with Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Naive Bayes classification method and Feng's method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

While the accuracy of the detector is central to the success of CA, the detection delay or length of an individual authentication period is important as well since it is a measure of the window of vulnerability of the system. However, high accuracy and small detection delay are conflicting requirements that need to be balanced for optimum detection. In this paper, we propose the use of sequential sampling technique to achieve optimum detection by trading off adequately between detection delay and accuracy in the CA process. We illustrate our approach through CA based on user command line sequence and naive Bayes classification scheme. Experimental evaluation using the Greenberg data set yields encouraging results consisting of a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 11.78% and a false rejection rate (FRR) of 1.33%, with an average command sequence length (i.e., detection delay) of 37 commands. When using the Schonlau et al. (SEA) data set, we obtain FAR = 4.28% and FRR = 12%.

It has become one of the key techniques for organizing information. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, has been used in text classification with better performance than rule based ones. But they mostly need lots of training samples in the processing, which not only brings heavy work for previous data collection, but also require a higher storage and computing resources during the processing. Naive Bayes is one of the most efficient and effective inductive learning algorithms and can get more accurate result in the large training sample set. To improve the performance, feature selection mechanisms are incorporated into naive bayes algorithm. Firstly, feature extraction techniques are applied to remove irrelevant and redundant features. After that, naive bayes classification algorithm is used to text classification. The experimental results have shown that this method keeps high classification accuracy.

Fikri Azli; Choi, Deokjai			Simple SMS spam filtering on independent mobile phone	SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS			English	Article						SMS spam; filtering; mobile phone; independent		The amount of Short Message Service (SMS) spam is increasing. Various solutions to filter SMS spam on mobile phones have been proposed. Most of these use Text Classification techniques that consist of training, filtering, and updating processes. However, they require a computer or a large amount of SMS data in advance to filter SMS spam, especially for the training. This increases hardware maintenance and communication costs. Thus, we propose to filter SMS spam on independent mobile phones using Text Classification techniques. The training, filtering, and updating processes are performed on an independent mobile phone. The mobile phone has storage, memory and CPU limitations compared with a computer. As such, we apply a probabilistic Naive Bayes classifier using word occurrences for screening because of its simplicity and fast performance. Our experiment on an Android mobile phone shows that it can filter SMS spam with reasonable accuracy, minimum storage consumption, and acceptable processing time without support from a computer or using a large amount of SMS data for training. Thus, we conclude that filtering SMS spam can be performed on independent mobile phones. We can reduce the number of word attributes by almost 50% without reducing accuracy significantly, using our usability-based approach. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	[Nuruzzaman, M.

While the parameters obtained by flow cytometry analysis form the basis of the diagnosis of the disease, the question whether these parameters offer additional prognostic information still remains open. In this work, we attempt to provide computer-assisted support to the clinical experts of the field, by deploying a classification system for B-CLL multiparametric prognosis that combines various heterogeneous (clinical, laboratory and flow cytometry) parameters associated with the disease. For this purpose, we employ the naive-Bayes classifier and propose an algorithm that improves its performance. The algorithm discretizes the continuous classification attributes (candidate prognostic parameters) and selects the most useful subset of them to optimize the classification accuracy. Thus, in addition to the high classification accuracy achieved, the proposed approach also suggests the most informative parameters for the prognosis. The experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of flow cytometry parameters in our system improves prognosis. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The stages of the algorithm are scan period estimation, preprocessing (normalization, resampling, averaging), feature extraction, and classification. Naive Bayes (NB), decision-tree (DT), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are used to classify five different ASTs in simulation and real experiments. Classifiers are compared based on their accuracy, noise robustness, and computational complexity. DT classifiers are found to outperform the others.

IMPRECISE CLASSIFICATION WITH CREDAL DECISION TREES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF UNCERTAINTY FUZZINESS AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Decision trees; imprecise classification; imprecise probabilities; imprecise Dirichlet model; uncertainty measures	PROBABILITY INTERVALS; MULTINOMIAL DATA; DIRICHLET MODEL; DATA SETS; CLASSIFIERS	In this paper, we present the following contributions: (i) an adaptation of a precise classifier to work on imprecise classification for cost-sensitive problems; (ii) a new measure to check the performance of an imprecise classifier. The imprecise classifier is based on a method to build simple decision trees that we have modified for imprecise classification. It uses the Imprecise Dirichlet Model (IDM) to represent information, with the upper entropy as a tool for splitting. Our new measure to compare imprecise classifiers takes errors into account. Thus far, this has not been considered by other measures for classifiers of this type. This measure penalizes wrong predictions using a cost matrix of the errors, given by an expert; and it quantifies the success of an imprecise classifier based on the cardinal number of the set of non-dominated states returned. To compare the performance of our imprecise classification method and the new measure, we have used a second imprecise classifier known as Naive Credal Classifier (NCC) which is a variation of the classic Naive Bayes using the IDM; and a known measure for imprecise classification.

J	Ercan, G; Cicekli, I				Ercan, Gonenc; Cicekli, Ilyas			Keyphrase extraction through query performance prediction	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						keyphrase extraction; query performance prediction	KULLBACK-LEIBLER DISTANCE	Previous research shows that keyphrases are useful tools in document retrieval and navigation. While these point to a relation between keyphrases and document retrieval performance, no other work uses this relationship to identify keyphrases of a given document. This work aims to establish a link between the problems of query performance prediction (QPP) and keyphrase extraction. To this end, features used in QPP are evaluated in keyphrase extraction using a naive Bayes classifier. Our experiments indicate that these features improve the effectiveness of keyphrase extraction in documents of different length. More importantly, commonly used features of frequency and first position in text perform poorly on shorter documents, whereas QPP features are more robust and achieve better results.

Note on Naive Bayes Based on Binary Descriptors in Cheminformatics	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							DISCRIMINATION; CLASSIFIER; DISCOVERY	A plethora of articles on naive Bayes classifiers, where the chemical compounds to be classified are represented by binary valued (absent or present type) descriptors, have appeared in the cheminformatics literature over the past decade. The principal goal of this paper is to describe how a naive Bayes classifier based on binary descriptors (NBCBBD) can be employed as a feature selector in an efficient manner suitable for cheminformatics. In the process, we point out a fact well documented in other disciplines that NBCBBD is a linear classifier and is therefore intrinsically suboptimal for classifying compounds that are nonlinearly separable in their binary descriptor space. We investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm on classifying a subset of the MDDR data set, a standard molecular benchmark data set, into active and inactive compounds.

But for some reasons, DNS interaction is quite vulnerable to a kind of man-in-the-middle (MITM) spoofing attack. This paper illustrates the MITM spoofing attack and proposes a type of defense technique employing Naive Bayes (NB) Classifier. Considering three types of individual factors, then illustrates, analyzes and evaluates their performances. The 3-factor NB technique achieves the best performance with an average identifying ratio of 99.7875%. What's more, we provide a proposal on taking balance of precision and time consumption accordingly. In all, the presented NB technique is quite helpful in defense against DNS MITM spoofing attack.

J	Zaeri, A; Nematbakhsh, MA				Zaeri, Ahmad; Nematbakhsh, Mohammad Ali			A Framework for Semantic Interpretation of Noun Compounds Using Tratz Model and Binary Features	ETRI JOURNAL			English	Article						Noun compounds; semantic relation; multiclass classifier; feature selection; semantic features	INFORMATION; SIMILARITY	Semantic interpretation of the relationship between noun compound (NC) elements has been a challenging issue due to the lack of contextual information, the unbounded number of combinations, and the absence of a universally accepted system for the categorization. The current models require a huge corpus of data to extract contextual information, which limits their usage in many situations. In this paper, a new semantic relations interpreter for NCs based on novel lightweight binary features is proposed. Some of the binary features used are novel. In addition, the interpreter uses a new feature selection method. By developing these new features and techniques, the proposed method removes the need for any huge corpuses. Implementing this method using a modular and plugin-based framework, and by training it using the largest and the most current fine-grained data set, shows that the accuracy is better than that of previously reported upon methods that utilize large corpuses. This improvement in accuracy and the provision of superior efficiency is achieved not only by improving the old features with such techniques as semantic scattering and sense collocation, but also by using various novel features and classifier max entropy. That the accuracy of the max entropy classifier is higher compared to that of other classifiers, such as a support vector machine, a Naive Bayes, and a decision tree, is also shown.

This paper investigates defect diagnosis of induction motors, which are widely used in manufacturing systems as a source of actuation. A new approach, based on feature extraction from the envelope of the motor current instead of the motor current itself, has been investigated. This is based on the consideration that motor current envelope is effective in revealing the amplitude-modulated nature of the motor current signal. Three pattern classifiers - Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, and support vector machine, have been investigated for defect classification. Experimental results have demonstrated that the new feature extraction and selection method yields a higher degree of accuracy than the traditional method for motor defect classification.

Each probe set on the array consisted of EST (expressed sequence tag) sequence of 20 feature pairs of 25 bp sequence. The data set comprised of 61 samples, divided into two groups of 40 samples for tumor cells (Group 1) and 21 samples for normal cells (Group 2). In order to do background adjustments for the negative expression values, the data was transformed into log base 2 and estimation of missing values was performed by K-nearest neighbor method, followed by normalization using 'minimum mean ratio' among arrays. The basic statistics used for the significance analysis was J5 test, which was computed for each probe and for each contrast with a threshold value of 4.0 and mean as the measure of central tendency. The differentially expressed genes were expressed at high frequency in tumour samples. The Naive. Bayes Classifier Algorithm was used to test defined classification of samples of genes. Correlation distance was measured with the help of Pearson's correlation distance. On the basis of J5 test scores, top 5 upregulated genes, viz., vasopressin-neurophysin 2-copeptin preproprotein, cytochrome, P450 2A7 isoform, major centromere autoantigen B, myelin associated glycoprotein and bone morphogenetic protein 1 isoform 3 precursor, were selected for further analysis. The above said genes have not yet been reported to be differentially overexpressed in colon cancer cells, while their overexpression was reported in other cancers, such as, lung and breast cancer, etc. These genes can be used for prediction and analyses of the gene products, which will help in designing new diagnostic and treatment strategies for the colon cancer.

In this paper, a hybrid generative/discriminative semisupervised learning algorithm is proposed that utilizes a large number of unlabeled samples to supplement a small number of labeled samples. This hybrid method allows us to combine the modeling power and flexibility of generative models with the superior performance of discriminative approaches. Other related issues, such as learning efficiency enhancement and distribution estimation smoothing, are also discussed. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively reduce the calibration effort and exhibit superior performance in terms of localization accuracy and robustness.

In this article, an automatic whole breast lesion detection system based on the naive Bayes classifier using the PC-based US system Terason t3000 (Terason Ultrasound, Burlington, MA, USA) with a hand-held probe is proposed. To easily retrieve the US images for any regions of the breast, a clock-based storing system is proposed to record the scanned US images. A computer-aided detection (CAD) system is also developed to save the physicians' time for a huge volume of scanned US images. The pixel classification of the US is based on the naive Bayes classifier for the proposed lesion detection system. The pixels of the US are classified into two types: lesions or normal tissues. The connected component labeling is applied to find the suspected lesions in the image. Consequently, the labeled two-dimensional suspected regions are separated into two clusters and further checked by two-phase lesion selection criteria for the determination of the real lesion, while reducing the false-positive rate. The free-response operative characteristics (FROC) curve is used to evaluate the detection performance of the proposed system. According to the experimental results of 31 cases with 33 lesions, the proposed system yields a 93.4% (31/33) sensitivity at 4.22 false positives (FPs) per hundred slices. Moreover, the speed for the proposed detection scheme achieves 12.3 frames per second (fps) with an Intel Dual-Core Quad 3 GHz processor and can be also effectively and efficiently used for other screening systems.

J	Sprouse, J; Almeida, D				Sprouse, Jon; Almeida, Diogo			Assessing the reliability of textbook data in syntax: Adger's Core Syntax	JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS			English	Article							ACCEPTABILITY JUDGMENTS; MAGNITUDE ESTIMATION; GENERATIVE GRAMMAR; NULL HYPOTHESIS; LINGUISTIC ACCEPTABILITY; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; WH-CONSTRAINTS; GRAMMATICALITY; INTUITIONS; CARROTS	There has been a consistent pattern of criticism of the reliability of acceptability judgment data in syntax for at least 50 years (e.g., Hill 1961), culminating in several high-profile criticisms within the past ten years (Edelman & Christiansen 2003, Ferreira 2005, Wasow & Arnold 2005, Gibson & Fedorenko 2010, in press). The fundamental claim of these critics is that traditional acceptability judgment collection methods, which tend to be relatively informal compared to methods from experimental psychology, lead to an intolerably high number of false positive results. In this paper we empirically assess this claim by formally testing all 469 (unique, US-English) data points from a popular syntax textbook (Adger 2003) using 440 naive participants, two judgment tasks (magnitude estimation and yes-no), and three different types of statistical analyses (standard frequentist tests, linear mixed effects models, and Bayes factor analyses). The results suggest that the maximum discrepancy between traditional methods and formal experimental methods is 2%. This suggests that even under the (likely unwarranted) assumption that the discrepant results are all false positives that have found their way into the syntactic literature due to the shortcomings of traditional methods, the minimum replication rate of these 469 data points is 98%.

Evaluation of Visible-Near Infrared Reflectance Spectra of Avocado Leaves as a Non-destructive Sensing Tool for Detection of Laurel Wilt	PLANT DISEASE			English	Article							LEAF PIGMENT CONTENT; SPECTROSCOPY; CLASSIFICATION; VEGETATION; LAURACEAE; REDBAY; INDEX	Laurel wilt, caused by the fungus Raffaelea lauricola, affects the growth, development, and productivity of avocado, Persea americana. This study evaluated the potential of visible-near infrared spectroscopy for non-destructive sensing of this disease. The symptoms of laurel wilt are visually similar to those caused by freeze damage (leaf necrosis). In this work, we performed classification studies with visible-near infrared spectra of asymptomatic and symptomatic leaves from infected plants, as well as leaves from freeze-damaged and healthy plants, both of which were non-infected. The principal component scores computed from principal component analysis were used as input features in four classifiers: linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA). Naive-Bayes classifier, and bagged decision trees (BDT). Among the classifiers, QDA and BDT resulted in classification accuracies of higher than 94% when classifying asymptomatic leaves from infected plants. All of the classifiers were able to discriminate symptomatic-infected leaves from freeze-damaged leaves. However, the false negatives mainly resulted from asymptomatic-infected leaves being classified as healthy. Analyses of average vegetation indices of freeze-damaged, healthy (non-infected), asymptomatic-infected, and symptomatic-infected leaves indicated that the normalized difference vegetation index and the simple ratio index were statistically different.

Clint			Probabilistic Detection of Morphologic Indicators for Beach Segmentation With Multitemporal LiDAR Measurements	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Divergence; light detection and ranging (LiDAR); pattern classification; shoreline erosion	AIRBORNE TOPOGRAPHIC LIDAR; BANDWIDTH SELECTION; SHORELINE POSITION; DIVERGENCE; ESTIMATORS; EXTRACTION; FILTER	Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) surveys provide a rich data source of topographic information. However, beach monitoring with LiDAR data has been mostly limited to visualization and first-order measures derived from digital elevation models (DEMs). To exploit more information from multitemporal LiDAR data acquired over a beach, we extract surface features to detect morphologies that are indicative of shoreline change patterns. First, through cross-shore profile sampling of LiDAR-derived DEMs, the continuous 3-D beach surface is parameterized into several 1-D morphologic features progressing alongshore. Profiles are subsequently partitioned into binary erosion or accretion classes dependent on measured shoreline change between surveys. Then, a feature's class separability is quantified using information divergence measures nonparametrically constructed via Parzen windowing. The more interclass separation provided by a feature, the greater its discriminative potential, and the higher its ranking as a morphologic indicator. Rankings are computed across the survey epochs to evaluate performance stability of the features. Finally, the top-ranked features are implemented within a naive Bayes classifier to assess their ability to segment terrain more likely to erode. Results demonstrate the utility of the developed framework to systematically extract and incorporate useful morphologic information from LiDAR data for discerning patterns in beach change.

J	Liu, TY; Cheng, YL; Ni, ZH				Liu, Tingyu; Cheng, Yalong; Ni, Zhonghua			Mining event logs to support workflow resource allocation	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Workflow; Resource allocation; Data mining; Process mining; Association rules	STAFF ASSIGNMENT; SUPPLY CHAIN; MANAGEMENT; PATTERNS; SYSTEMS	Currently, workflow technology is widely used to facilitate the business process in enterprise information systems (EIS), and it has the potential to reduce design time, enhance product quality and decrease product cost. However, significant limitations still exist: as an important task in the context of workflow, many present resource allocation (also known as "staff assignment") operations are still performed manually, which are time-consuming. This paper presents a data mining approach to address the resource allocation problem (RAP) and improve the productivity of workflow resource management. Specifically, an Apriori-like algorithm is used to find the frequent patterns from the event log, and association rules are generated according to predefined resource allocation constraints. Subsequently, a correlation measure named lift is utilized to annotate the negatively correlated resource allocation rules for resource reservation. Finally, the rules are ranked using the confidence measures as resource allocation rules.

Due to high cost and laboriousness. in experimental tests, it is necessary to develop robust in silico methods to predict chemical mutagenicity. In this paper, a comprehensive database containing 7617 diverse compounds, including 4252 mutagens and 3365 nonmutagens, was constructed. On the basis. of this data set, high predictive models were then built using five machine learning methods, namely support Vector machine (SVM), C4.5 decision free (C4.5 DT), artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and naive Bayes (NB), along with five fingerprints, namely CDK fingerprint (FP), Estate fingerprint (Estate), MACCS keys.(MACCS) PubChem fingerprint (PubChem) and Substructure fingerprint (SubFP). Performances were measured by cross Validation and an external test set containing 831 diverse chemicals. Information.:Information gain and substructure analysis were used to interpret the models. The accuracies of fivefold Cross Validation were from 0.808 to 0.841 for top five Models. The, range of accuracy:for the,external validation set was from 0.904 to 0.980, which outperformed that of Toxtree., Three models (PubChem-kNN, MACCS-kNN, and PubChem-SVM) showed high and reliable,predictive accuracy. for the mutagens and nonmutagens and, hence, could he used in prediction of chemical Ames Mutagenicity:	[Xu, Congying; Cheng, Feixiong; Chen, Lei; Du, Zheng; Li, Weihua; Liu, Guixia; Lee, Philip W.; Tang, Yun] E China Univ Sci & Technol, Shanghai Key Lab New Drug Design, Sch Pharm, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Liu, Guixia] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Drug Res, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China	Liu, GX (reprint author), E China Univ Sci & Technol, Shanghai Key Lab New Drug Design, Sch Pharm, 130 Meilong Rd, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.	gxliu@ecust.edu.cn; ytang234@ecust.edu.cn	Cheng, Feixiong/D-9922-2013; LI, Weihua/G-7190-2011	Cheng, Feixiong/0000-0002-1251-3116; 	863 Project [2012AA020308]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [WY1113007]; State Key Laboratory of Drug Research [SIMM1203KF-13]; Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology [11DZ2260600]	We gratefully acknowledged the financial supports from the 863 Project (Grant 2012AA020308), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (WY1113007), the State Key Laboratory of Drug Research (Grant SIMM1203KF-13), and the Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology (Grant 11DZ2260600).

Objective: We investigate how the context of models, the independent variables used, and the modeling techniques applied influence the performance of fault prediction models. Method: We used a systematic literature review to identify 208 fault prediction studies published from January 2000 to December 2010. We synthesize the quantitative and qualitative results of 36 studies which report sufficient contextual and methodological information according to the criteria we develop and apply. Results: The models that perform well tend to be based on simple modeling techniques such as Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression. Combinations of independent variables have been used by models that perform well. Feature selection has been applied to these combinations when models are performing particularly well. Conclusion: The methodology used to build models seems to be influential to predictive performance. Although there are a set of fault prediction studies in which confidence is possible, more studies are needed that use a reliable methodology and which report their context, methodology, and performance comprehensively.

J	Garnavi, R; Aldeen, M; Bailey, J				Garnavi, Rahil; Aldeen, Mohammad; Bailey, James			Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Melanoma Using Border- and Wavelet-Based Texture Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Classification; computer-aided diagnosis of melanoma; dermoscopy; feature extraction; wavelet	PIGMENTED SKIN-LESIONS; MALIGNANT-MELANOMA; DERMOSCOPY IMAGES; FEATURE-SELECTION; DIGITAL DERMOSCOPY; EPILUMINESCENCE MICROSCOPY; PATTERN-ANALYSIS; ABCD RULE; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION	This paper presents a novel computer-aided diagnosis system for melanoma. The novelty lies in the optimized selection and integration of features derived from textural, border-based, and geometrical properties of the melanoma lesion. The texture features are derived from using wavelet-decomposition, the border features are derived from constructing a boundary-series model of the lesion border and analyzing it in spatial and frequency domains, and the geometry features are derived from shape indexes. The optimized selection of features is achieved by using the gain-ratio method, which is shown to be computationally efficient for melanoma diagnosis application. Classification is done through the use of four classifiers; namely, support vector machine, random forest, logistic model tree, and hidden naive Bayes. The proposed diagnostic system is applied on a set of 289 dermoscopy images (114 malignant, 175 benign) partitioned into train, validation, and test image sets. The system achieves an accuracy of 91.26% and area under curve value of 0.937, when 23 features are used. Other important findings include 1) the clear advantage gained in complementing texture with border and geometry features, compared to using texture information only, and 2) higher contribution of texture features than border-based features in the optimized feature set.

In gene expression data sets, the correlation between genes can be high when they share the same biological pathway. Moreover, the gene expression data sets may contain outliers due to either chemical or electrical reasons. A good gene selection method should take group effects into account and be robust to outliers. In this paper, we propose a Laplace naive Bayes model with mean shrinkage (LNB-MS). The Laplace distribution instead of the normal distribution is used as the conditional distribution of the samples for the reasons that it is less sensitive to outliers and has been applied in many fields. The key technique is the L-1 penalty imposed on the mean of each class to achieve automatic feature selection. The objective function of the proposed model is a piecewise linear function with respect to the mean of each class, of which the optimal value can be evaluated at the breakpoints simply. An efficient algorithm is designed to estimate the parameters in the model. A new strategy that uses the number of selected features to control the regularization parameter is introduced. Experimental results on simulated data sets and 17 publicly available cancer data sets attest to the accuracy, sparsity, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed algorithm. Many biomarkers identified with our method have been verified in biochemical or biomedical research. The analysis of biological and functional correlation of the genes based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms shows that the proposed method guarantees the selection of highly correlated genes simultaneously.

The methodology of setting up a classifier committee and voting on the documents for classification can achieve high categorization precision. However, traditional Vector Space Model can easily lead to the curse of dimensionality and feature sparsity problems; so it affects classification performance seriously. This article proposed a novel classification algorithm called LDABoost based on boosting ideology which uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to modeling the feature space. Instead of using words or phrase, LDABoost use latent topics as the features. In this way, the feature dimension is significantly reduced. Improved Naive Bayes (NB) is designed as the weaker classifier which keeps the efficiency advantage of classic NB algorithm and has higher precision. Moreover, a two-stage iterative weighted method called Cute Integration in this article is proposed for improving the accuracy by integrating weak classifiers into strong classifier in a more rational way. Mutual Information is used as metrics of weights allocation. The voting information and the categorization decision made by basis classifiers are fully utilized for generating the strong classifier. Experimental results reveals LDABoost making categorization in a low-dimensional space, it has higher accuracy than traditional AdaBoost algorithms and many other classic classification algorithms.

Two types of data representations were considered: microarray based and medical imaging based. In contrast to previous researches, this research also considered the imbalanced nature of these data. It was observed that the SMO algorithm performed better for the majority of the test data, especially for microarray based data when accuracy was used as performance measure. Considering the imbalanced characteristic of the data, the Naive Bayes algorithm was seen to perform highly in terms of true positive rate (TPR). Regarding the influence of SMOTE, a well-known imbalanced data classification technique, it was observed that there was a notable performance improvement for J48, while the performance of SMO remained comparable for the majority of the datasets. Overall, the results indicated SMO as the most potential candidate for the microarray and image dataset considered in this research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lee, KJ; Choi, DJ				Lee, Kyoung-Ju; Choi, Deok-Jai			Mobile Junk Message Filter Reflecting User Preference	KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						SMS spam filter; smart phone application; personalized spam filter		In order to block mobile junk messages automatically, many studies on spam filters have applied machine learning algorithms. Most previous research focused only on the accuracy rate of spam filters from the view point of the algorithm used, not on individual user's preferences. In terms of individual taste, the spam filters implemented on a mobile device have the advantage over spam filters on a network node, because it deals with only incoming messages on the users' phone and generates no additional traffic during the filtering process. However, a spam filter on a mobile phone has to consider the consumption of resources, because energy, memory and computing ability are limited. Moreover, as time passes an increasing number of feature words are likely to exhaust mobile resources. In this paper we propose a spam filter model distributed between a users' computer and smart phone. We expect the model to follow personal decision boundaries and use the uniform resources of smart phones. An authorized user's computer takes on the more complex and time consuming jobs, such as feature selection and training, while the smart phone performs only the minimum amount of work for filtering and utilizes the results of the information calculated on the desktop. Our experiments show that the accuracy of our method is more than 95% with Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine, and our model that uses uniform memory does not affect other applications that run on the smart phone.

The proposed method focuses on specific characteristics of text categorization domain. Also, it ensures that every document in the training set is represented by at least one feature and the number of selected features is determined in a data-driven way. We compare the effectiveness of the proposed method with the Variable Ranking method using three text categorization benchmarks (Reuters-21578, 20 Newsgroup and WebKB), two different classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbor and Naive Bayes) and five feature evaluation functions. The experiments show that ALOFT obtains equivalent or better results than the classical Variable Ranking. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Pinheiro, Roberto H. W.; Cavalcanti, George D.

Although a good number of successful content-based anti-spam filters are available, their current utilization in real scenarios is still a long way off. In this context, the SpamAssassin filter offers a rule-based framework that can be easily used as a powerful integration and deployment tool for the fast development of new anti-spam strategies. This paper presents Grindstone4Spam, a publicly available optimization toolkit for boosting SpamAssassin performance. Its applicability has been verified by comparing its results with those obtained by the default SpamAssassin software as well as four well-known anti-spam filtering techniques such as Naive Bayes, Flexible Bayes, Adaboost and Support Vector Machines in two different case studies. The performance of the proposed alternative clearly outperforms existing approaches working in a cost-sensitive scenario. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Cerchiello, P; Giudici, P				Cerchiello, Paola; Giudici, Paolo			Non parametric statistical models for on-line text classification	ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION			English	Article						Non parametric statistical models; Kruskal-Wallis test; Brunner-Dette-Munk test; Text analysis; Opinion spam detection		Social media, such as blogs and on-line forums, contain a huge amount of information that is typically unorganized and fragmented. An important issue, that has been raising importance so far, is to classify on-line texts in order to detect possible anomalies. For example on-line texts representing consumer opinions can be, not only very precious and profitable for companies, but can also represent a serious damage if they are negative or faked. In this contribution we present a novel statistical methodology rooted in the context of classical text classification, in order to address such issues. In the literature, several classifiers have been proposed, among them support vector machine and naive Bayes classifiers. These approaches are not effective when coping with the problem of classifying texts belonging to an unknown author. To this aim, we propose to employ a new method, based on the combination of classification trees with non parametric approaches, such as Kruskal-Wallis and Brunner-Dette-Munk test. The main application of what we propose is the capability to classify an author as a new one, that is potentially trustable, or as an old one, that is potentially faked.

J	Stella, F; Amer, Y				Stella, F.; Amer, Y.			Continuous time Bayesian network classifiers	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Bayesian classifiers; Continuous time; Multivariate trajectory	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; CLASSIFICATION	The class of continuous time Bayesian network classifiers is defined; it solves the problem of supervised classification on multivariate trajectories evolving in continuous time. The trajectory consists of the values of discrete attributes that are measured in continuous time, while the predicted class is expected to occur in the future. Two instances from this class, namely the continuous time naive Bayes classifier and the continuous time tree augmented naive Bayes classifier, are introduced and analyzed. They implement a trade-off between computational complexity and classification accuracy. Learning and inference for the class of continuous time Bayesian network classifiers are addressed, in the case where complete data are available. A learning algorithm for the continuous time naive Bayes classifier and an exact inference algorithm for the class of continuous time Bayesian network classifiers are described. The performance of the continuous time naive Bayes classifier is assessed in the case where real-time feedback to neurological patients undergoing motor rehabilitation must be provided.

T.; Armitage, Grenville; Branch, Philip; Zander, Sebastian			Timely and Continuous Machine-Learning-Based Classification for Interactive IP Traffic	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING			English	Article						Interactive traffic; Machine Learning (ML); sub-flows; traffic classification	IDENTIFICATION; NETWORKS	Machine Learning (ML) for classifying IP traffic has relied on the analysis of statistics of full flows or their first few packets only. However, automated QoS management for interactive traffic flows requires quick and timely classification well before the flows finish. Also, interactive flows are often long-lived and should be continuously monitored during their lifetime. We propose to achieve this by using statistics derived from sub-flows-a small number of most recent packets taken at any point in a flow's lifetime. Then, the ML classifier must be trained on a set of sub-flows, and we investigate different sub-flow selection strategies. We also propose to augment training datasets so that classification accuracy is maintained even when a classifier mixes up client-to-server and server-to-client directions for applications exhibiting asymmetric traffic characteristics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with the Naive Bayes and C4.5 Decision Tree ML algorithms, for the identification of first-person-shooter online game and VoIP traffic. Our results show that we can classify both applications with up to 99% Precision and 95% Recall within less than 1 s. Stable results are achieved regardless of where within a flow the classifier captures the packets and the traffic direction.	[Nguyen, Thuy T.

Surface activity is correlated to the shape of LC waveforms. Although field monitoring is necessary in order to acquire an exact view of activity and insulators' performance, field waveforms are not often recorded due to the required long term monitoring and the accumulation of data. Instead, extracted values, such as the peak value, charge and number of pulses exceeding predefined thresholds, are recorded, with actual waveforms either being recorded occasionally or not at all. However, a fully representative extracted value is yet to be determined. In this paper, 1540 field waveforms are investigated to acquire a detailed image of the waveforms' shape in the field. Simple classification rules are employed to distinguish between basic groups. Discharge waveforms are further classified based on the duration of discharges. Twenty different features, from time and frequency domain, two feature extraction algorithms (student t-test and mRMR) and three classification algorithms (knn, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines) are employed for the classification. Results described in this paper can be used to maximize the efficiency of field LC monitoring.

Development and evaluation of a Naive Bayesian model for coding causation of workers' compensation claims	JOURNAL OF SAFETY RESEARCH			English	Article						Data-mining; Text-mining; Bayes; Accident narratives; Text classification	INJURY NARRATIVES	Introduction: Tracking and trending rates of injuries and illnesses classified as musculoskeletal disorders caused by ergonomic risk factors such as overexertion and repetitive motion (MSDs) and slips, trips, or falls (STFs) in different industry sectors is of high interest to many researchers. Unfortunately, identifying the cause of injuries and illnesses in large datasets such as workers' compensation systems often requires reading and coding the free form accident text narrative for potentially millions of records. Method: To alleviate the need for manual coding, this paper describes and evaluates a computer auto-coding algorithm that demonstrated the ability to code millions of claims quickly and accurately by learning from a set of previously manually coded claims. Conclusions: The auto-coding program was able to code claims as a musculoskeletal disorders, SIP or other with approximately 90% accuracy. Impact on industry: The program developed and discussed in this paper provides an accurate and efficient method for identifying the causation of workers' compensation claims as a SIT or MSD in a large database based on the unstructured text narrative and resulting injury diagnoses. The program coded thousands of claims in minutes. The method described in this paper can be used by researchers and practitioners to relieve the manual burden of reading and identifying the causation of claims as a SIT or MSD. Furthermore, the method can be easily generalized to code/classify other unstructured text narratives. National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Bertke, S. J.; Meyers, A.

Typically one is interested in determining which, of a large number of potentially redundant or noisy features, are most discriminative for classification. The objective of the paper is to exploit machine learning algorithms for automated classification of different angle closure mechanisms based on the quantitative assessment of Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT). In this paper, we propose an effective combination of Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR), a mutual information feature selection, with AdaBoost, an adaptive boosting to detect angle closure glaucoma. The proposed method effectively combines the best feature selection and classifier to the problem. A sequential forward search was conducted to determine the optimal feature subset by the proposed criteria. The optimal selected feature subset, using only 11.90% of the entire available feature, for our angle closure glaucoma dataset outperforms the result using all 84 features. It also achieves better prediction compared to 4 other methods, i.e., Classification Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest and Naive Bayes. The reduced set of features avoids computation of unnecessary features and thus improves the efficiency. Furthermore, 9 out of the 10 selected features have been clinically proven to be important in determining the type of angle closure glaucoma. The algorithm show promising and encouraging results to detect and determine the type of angle closure glaucoma which may help early recognition and treatment of the disease. The reduced complexity of the generated models achieves better generalization and improves the efficiency.

GENERATIVE CLASSIFIERS; LONGITUDINAL DATA; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; NAIVE BAYES; MODELS; MORTALITY; DISTRIBUTIONS; VOLUME; RATES	Motivated by the need for accurate traffic flow prediction in transportation management, we propose a functional data method to analyze traffic flow patterns and predict future traffic flow. In this study we approach the problem by sampling traffic flow trajectories from a mixture of stochastic processes. The proposed functional mixture prediction approach combines functional prediction with probabilistic functional classification to take distinct traffic flow patterns into account. The probabilistic classification procedure, which incorporates functional clustering and discrimination, hinges on sub-space projection. The proposed methods not only assist in predicting traffic flow trajectories, but also identify distinct patterns in daily traffic flow of typical temporal trends and variabilities.

Jaundice is the most common disease of the newborn and although being benign in most cases it can lead to severe neurological consequences if poorly evaluated. In different areas of medicine, data mining has contributed to improve the results obtained with other methodologies. Hence, the aim of this study was to improve the diagnosis of neonatal jaundice with the application of data mining techniques. Methods: This study followed the different phases of the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining model as its methodology. This observational study was performed at the Obstetrics Department of a central hospital (Centro Hospitalar Tamega e Sousa - EPE), from February to March of 2011. A total of 227 healthy newborn infants with 35 or more weeks of gestation were enrolled in the study. Over 70 variables were collected and analyzed. Also, transcutaneous bilirubin levels were measured from birth to hospital discharge with maximum time intervals of 8 hours between measurements, using a noninvasive bilirubinometer. Different attribute subsets were used to train and test classification models using algorithms included in Weka data mining software, such as decision trees (J48) and neural networks (multilayer perceptron). The accuracy results were compared with the traditional methods for prediction of hyperbilirubinemia. Results: The application of different classification algorithms to the collected data allowed predicting subsequent hyperbilirubinemia with high accuracy. In particular, at 24 hours of life of newborns, the accuracy for the prediction of hyperbilirubinemia was 89%. The best results were obtained using the following algorithms: naive Bayes, multilayer perceptron and simple logistic. Conclusions: The findings of our study sustain that, new approaches, such as data mining, may support medical decision, contributing to improve diagnosis in neonatal jaundice.

J	Koc, L; Mazzuchi, TA; Sarkani, S				Koc, Levent; Mazzuchi, Thomas A.; Sarkani, Shahram			A network intrusion detection system based on a Hidden Naive Bayes multiclass classifier	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Intrusion detection systems; Data mining; Multiclass classification; Hidden Naive Bayes (HNB); Denial-of-services (DoS)	SELECTION	With increasing Internet connectivity and traffic volume, recent intrusion incidents have reemphasized the importance of network intrusion detection systems for combating increasingly sophisticated network attacks. Techniques such as pattern recognition and the data mining of network events are often used by intrusion detection systems to classify the network events as either normal events or attack events. Our research study claims that the Hidden Naive Bayes (HNB) model can be applied to intrusion detection problems that suffer from dimensionality, highly correlated features and high network data stream volumes. HNB is a data mining model that relaxes the Naive Bayes method's conditional independence assumption. Our experimental results show that the HNB model exhibits a superior overall performance in terms of accuracy, error rate and misclassification cost compared with the traditional Naive Bayes model, leading extended Naive Bayes models and the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) Cup 1999 winner. Our model performed better than other leading state-of-the art models, such as SVM, in predictive accuracy. The results also indicate that our model significantly improves the accuracy of detecting denial-of-services (DoS) attacks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wan, XW; Wu, ZY				Wan, Xinwang; Wu, Zhenyang			Sound source localization based on discrimination of cross-correlation functions	APPLIED ACOUSTICS			English	Article						Microphone array; Sound source localization; Cross-correlation function; Naive-Bayes classifier; Euclidean distance classifier	ACOUSTIC SOURCE LOCALIZATION; TIME-DELAY; TRACKING; CLASSIFICATION; NETWORK	Sound source localization plays a crucial role in many microphone arrays application, ranging from speech enhancement to human-computer interface in a reverberant noisy environment. The steered response power (SRP) using the phase transform (SRP-PHAT) method is one of the most popular modern localization algorithms. The SRP-based source localizers have been proved robust, however, the methods may fail to locate the sound source in adverse noise and reverberation conditions, especially when the direct paths to the microphones are unavailable. This paper proposes a localization algorithm based on discrimination of cross-correlation functions. The cross-correlation functions are calculated by the generalized cross-correlation phase transform (GCC-PHAT) method. Using cross-correlation functions, sound source location is estimated by one of the two classifiers: Naive-Bayes classifier and Euclidean distance classifier.

J	Wang, GT; Song, QB; Xu, BW; Zhou, YM				Wang, Guangtao; Song, Qinbao; Xu, Baowen; Zhou, Yuming			Selecting feature subset for high dimensional data via the propositional FOIL rules	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Feature subset selection; Feature interaction; Propositional FOIL rule; Filter method	MULTIPLE DATA SETS; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; MUTUAL INFORMATION; CLASSIFIERS	Feature interaction is an important issue in feature subset selection. However, most of the existing algorithms only focus on dealing with irrelevant and redundant features. In this paper, a propositional FOIL rule based algorithm FRFS, which not only retains relevant features and excludes irrelevant and redundant ones but also considers feature interaction, is proposed for selecting feature subset for high dimensional data. FRFS first merges the features appeared in the antecedents of all FOIL rules, achieving a candidate feature subset which excludes redundant features and reserves interactive ones. Then, it identifies and removes irrelevant features by evaluating features in the candidate feature subset with a new metric CoverRatio, and obtains the final feature subset. The efficiency and effectiveness of FRFS are extensively tested upon both synthetic and real world data sets, and it is compared with other six representative feature subset selection algorithms, including CFS, FCBF, Consistency, Relief-F, INTERACT, and the rule-based FSBAR, in terms of the number of selected features, runtime and the classification accuracies of the four well-known classifiers including Naive Bayes, C4.5, PART and IB1 before and after feature selection. The results on the five synthetic data sets show that FRFS can effectively identify irrelevant and redundant features while reserving interactive ones. The results on the 35 real world high dimensional data sets demonstrate that compared with other six feature selection algorithms, FRFS cannot only efficiently reduce the feature space, but also can significantly improve the performance of the four well-known classifiers.

J	Stover, JH; Ulm, MC				Stover, Jason H.; Ulm, Matthew C.			Hyperparameter estimation and plug-in kernel density estimates for maximum a posteriori land-cover classification with multiband satellite data	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Iterated conditional modes; Naive Bayes; Remote sensing	UNITED-STATES; ACCURACY; IMAGES; AREA	Classifying land cover via satellite imagery is an important problem in geographical studies. This paper presents a maximum a posteriori (MAP) land-cover classifier for multiband satellite data. The method uses the Markov random field model. The MAP estimation is carried out via iterated conditional modes. The reflectivities are transformed via principal components to overcome correlation and skewness, and then the distributions of the components are estimated with kernel densities. To make use of a large amount of past work in the area, the prior distribution is selected from the US Geological Survey's land-cover database. Prior hyperparameters are estimated by equating some of their differences with the logarithms of ratios of relative frequencies from the land-cover survey, and then estimated via least squares and a bagging-type procedure. The resulting classifier produces a smooth image and captures detailed features of the study area, including roads. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In particular, non-coding RNA-protein interactions play an important role to facilitate biological functions in signalling, transcriptional regulation, and even the progression of complex diseases. However, experimental determination of protein-RNA interactions remains time-consuming and labour-intensive. Here, we develop a novel extended naive-Bayes-classifier for de novo prediction of protein-RNA interactions, only using protein and RNA sequence information. Specifically, we first collect a set of known protein-RNA interactions as gold-standard positives and extract sequence-based features to represent each protein-RNA pair. To fill the gap between high dimensional features and scarcity of gold-standard positives, we select effective features by cutting a likelihood ratio score, which not only reduces the computational complexity but also allows transparent feature integration during prediction. An extended naive Bayes classifier is then constructed using these effective features to train a protein-RNA interaction prediction model. Numerical experiments show that our method can achieve the prediction accuracy of 0.77 even though only a small number of protein-RNA interaction data are available. In particular, we demonstrate that the extended naive-Bayes-classifier is superior to the naive-Bayes-classifier by fully considering the dependences among features. Importantly, we conduct ncRNA pull-down experiments to validate the predicted novel protein-RNA interactions and identify the interacting proteins of sbRNA CeN72 in C. elegans, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.

The recently proposed random forests classifier is used to map the local segment features to their corresponding prediction histograms. We compare the results of our approach with those of the baseline Bag-of-Words (BoW) and the Naive-Bayes Nearest Neighbor (NBNN) methods on the multi-view IXMAS dataset. Additionally, comparisons between our multi-camera fusion strategy and the normally used early feature concatenating strategy are also carried out using different camera views and different segment scales. It is proven that the proposed sensor fusion technique, coupled with the random forests classifier, is effective for multiple view human action recognition. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Preoperative diagnosis of a CPA region mass is mainly based on imaging. MRI is the best method for diagnosing the CPAM. But MRI can't diagnose the different masses accurately. Many computer aided diagnose (CAD) technologies were developed to help radiologists to improve the diagnostic performance. The medical cases in the experiment were from West China Hospital. The experiment validates efficiency and effective of the some kinds Bayesian classifiers by 0-1 Error and RMSE. The result of experiment shows that Bayesian Classification model can classify CPAM effectively.

In this paper we focus on wrapper-based feature (metric) selection techniques, which evaluate the merit of feature subsets based on the performance of classification models. We seek to understand the relationship between the internal learner used inside wrappers and the external learner for building the final classification model. We perform experiments using four consecutive releases of a very large telecommunications system, which include 42 software metrics (and with defect data collected for every program module). Our results demonstrate that (1) the best performance is never found when the internal and external learner match; (2) the best performance is usually found by using NB (Naive Bayes) inside the wrapper unless SVM (Support Vector Machine) is external learner; (3) LR (Logistic Regression) is often the best learner to use for building classification models regardless of which learner was used inside the wrapper.

Managing these huge numbers of incoming bug reports is a challenging task. Dealing with these reports manually consumes time and resources which leads to delaying the resolution of important bugs which are crucial and need to be identified and resolved earlier. Bug triaging is an important process in software maintenance. Some bugs are important and need to be fixed right away, whereas others are minor and their fixes could be postponed until resources are available. Most automatic bug assignment approaches do not take the priority of bug reports in their consideration. Assigning bug reports based on their priority may play an important role in enhancing the bug triaging process. In this paper, we present an approach to predict the priority of a reported bug using different machine learning algorithms namely Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. We also investigate the effect of using two feature sets on the classification accuracy. We conduct experimental evaluation using open-source projects namely Eclipse and Firefox. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach is feasible in predicting the priority of bug reports. It also shows that feature-set-2 outperforms feature-set-1. Moreover, both Random Forests and Decision Trees outperform Naive Bayes.

To deal with this threat, many anti-spam filters have been developed. One big challenge for these filters is to predict the labels of emails in a personalized mailbox. In this paper, we report the performance of an anti-spam filter named SENTINEL. In addition to some commonplace attributes, SENTINEL uses attributes related to natural language stylometry. The filter has been tested with six benchmark datasets in the Enron-Spam collection. Classifiers generated by well-known meta-learning algorithms like ADABOOSTM1 and BAGGING perform equally the best, while a Random Forest (RF) generated classifier performs almost as well. The performance of classifiers using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) are not satisfactory. Comparisons show that the performance of SENTINEL surpasses that of a number of state-of-the-art personalized filters proposed in previous studies.

Selective Sampling Designs to Improve the Performance of Classification Methods	2013 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND APPLICATIONS (ICMLA 2013), VOL 2			English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)	DEC 04-07, 2013	Miami, FL	Assoc Machine Learning & Applicat, IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc		Planned Missing Data Design; Selective Sampling; Classification		Selective Sampling design refers to the situation where a study has a fixed number of observations but can decide to allocate them differently among the variables during the data gathering phase, such that some variables will have a greater ratio of missing values than others. In particular, we can decide to allocate more, or less missing values to uncertain variables: those for which the relative frequency is closer to 50% (higher uncertainty), or further from 50% (lower certainty). The main objective of the study is to investigate how a Selective Sampling process helps improve the performance of classification methods. This study specifically asks: "Can Selective Sampling affect the performance of the classification methods?" We focus on the three different classification models of NaIve Bayes, Logistic Regression and Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN) for binary datasets. Three different schemes of sampling are defined: 1-Uniform (random samples) as a baseline, 2-Most Uncertain (higher sampling rate of uncertain items) and 3-Least Uncertain (lower sampling rate of uncertain items). We investigate the impacts of these different schemes on the performance of the three models on 11 different datasets. The results from 100 fold cross-validation show that Selective Sampling in all of the datasets improves the prediction performance of the TAN model and, in more than half of the datasets (54.6%), brings a higher prediction performance to NaIve Bayes and Logistic Regression classifiers.

One of the most common application areas is to use classification of algorithms that estimate the future events by past experiences. In this context, in order to predict future events, a data warehouse is created by using the background of students which includes demographic, personal, school, and course information of students. On this data warehouse by using classification algorithms, new applications which can make inferences for the future could be developed. Aims of this study are to create student data warehouse which can be used data mining algorithms, to improve an early warning system that may estimate students' the future academic successes for students and also for their families and to find out primary factors affecting their academic success.

This Model consists of sending a request message, like the PATH message in the Resource Reservation Protocol(RSVP), and standing for a response message, like the RESV message in RSVP, upon which required resources are reserved. Moreover, crossed routers do not participate in flows classification according to DiffServ Model, since this classification is stringent and is driven by the ingress node at network entry. This paper proposes a new flexible one-way model of the LSP/Tunnel setup in MPLS networks which are based on the mapping of incoming requests on flows admission using a Naive Bayes model and the weighted K-nearest neighbor algorithm. The proposed model is compared to parallel solutions such as the IntServ-over-Diffserv model, the classical model using RSVP-TE and the EEAC-SV approach proposed in [12]. Simulation results show that the new model outperforms other solutions with respect to the request delay bounds and the packet dropping ratio capability, respectively.

Multi-layer hybrid machine learning techniques for anomalies detection and classification approach	2013 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HYBRID INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS (HIS)			English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS)	DEC 04-06, 2013	Gammarth, TUNISIA			Artificial Immune System; Network Intrusion Detection; Machine Learning; Intrusion Classification	NETWORK INTRUSION DETECTION; DETECTION SYSTEM; BIOINFORMATICS	Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are well-known research area for the detection of anomalous activities in a system from both inside and outside intruders. In this article, a multi-layer hybrid machine learning intrusion detection system is designed and developed to achieve high efficiency and improve the detection and classification rate accuracy inspired by immune systems with negative selection approach. In the first layer, principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm was used for feature selection. Then, genetic algorithm was applied to generate anomaly detectors, which are able to discriminate between normal and anomalous behaviors in the second layer. It is followed by applying classification using several classifiers including naive bayes, multilayer perceptron neural network, and decision trees to increase the detection accuracy and obtain more information on the detected anomalies. The selected classifiers are trained and applied to label the detected anomalies in both the normal and anomalous traffic. The principle interest of this work is to benchmark the performance of the proposed multi-layer IDS system by using NSL-KDD benchmark data set used by IDS researchers. The obtained results demonstrated that naive bayes classifier has better classification accuracy in the case of lower presented attacks such as U2R and R2L, while the J48 decision tree classifier gives high accuracy up to 82% for DoS attacks and 65.4% for probe attacks in the anomaly traffic.

Real world data, however, often suffer from corruptions or noise but not always known. This is the heart of information-based remote sensing models. This paper investigates the impact of incomplete remotely sensed data in the evaluation of machine learning techniques (classifiers) for the task of predicting or classifying pixels into different landcover region types. Six classifiers are empirically evaluated by artificially simulating different missing data proportions, patterns and mechanisms using a multispectral image dataset. A 4-way repeated measures design is employed to analyse the data. The simulation results suggest classifiers as having their strengths and limitations in terms of dealing with the incomplete data problem with the artificial neural network classifier as substantially inferior and naive Bayes classifier and support vector machines representing superior approaches.

Previous study showed that a significant number of bug reports are actually misclassified between bugs and non-bugs. However, classifying bug reports is a time-consuming task. In the previous study, researchers spent 90 days to classify manually more than 7,000 bug reports. To tackle this problem, we propose automatic bug report classification techniques. We apply topic modeling to the corpora of preprocessed bug reports of three open-source software projects with decision tree, naive Bayes classifier, and logistic regression.

To construct the oriented representation, we incorporate motion information into pixel change history(PCH) image, through splitting the PCH image into several oriented channels according to the corresponding motion direction. Moreover, relative velocities of body parts are also considered and therefore the accumulating is adapted with the weight of each pixel's relative speed. Afterwards, invariant features are extracted from WOPCH images and a naive Bayes model is used for recognition. Experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional holistic approaches without requiring lots of training samples.

Classifications of different water levels facilitate in preserving water reserves and maintain the equilibrium in the ecosystem. In this paper we shall inspect the classification of drainage water levels in Canada. A powerful statistical tool called support vector machines is used to classify the said drainage water remote sensed spatial data sets. To boost the performance of support vector machines classifier a new generic algorithm based on parametric distribution model will be proposed. Later several evaluation metrics like kappa statistics are used to compare the results of the proposed algorithm with multi-layer perceptron neural networks and naive bayes classifiers.

These models tend to become inconsistent over a period of time as the underlying data stream like network traffic tends to change and get affected by evolution of concept drift. Change in network traffic pattern is inevitable, it impacts the enterprises which are dynamic in nature especially cloud-centric enterprises. These changes in the network pattern can be of short time period or they can be persistent for longer time duration. Change in network traffic pattern is not always because of malicious activity, changes can be benign and thus impacting the performance of the IDS/IPS model. There is a need to quantify concept drifts and incorporate them in the model. In this paper we have proposed a supervised learning model to quantify the concept drift in the network traffic. The proposed model uses adaptive learning strategies with fixed training window to constantly evolve the model. Classification of data is done by Naive Bayes Classifier. ROC curve generated from Naive Bayes classifiers has been used as a de facto method for identifying concept drift. Classifications have been carried out on entire dataset and also on specific flow attributes like source ip, destination ip, source port, destination port, flags and protocols. In this paper we demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed model to identify drift in the network pattern and also which flow attributes have contributed in concept drifting using ROC curve.

In current years, machine learning algorithms have been successfully shown to generate high forecasting accuracy and have drawn interest from healthcare professionals, research community, planners and policy makers. In this paper, three supervised machine learning classification techniques are compared to project cancer incidence and mortality rates. Classification methods covered in this work are Bayesian Network, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor. These classification methods have been tested on the datasets provided by Statistics Canada. This paper evaluates the performance of above classification techniques that examine the accuracy of each method via the utilization of prediction accuracy measures including Mean Absolute Errors, Root Mean Squared Errors, Relative Absolute Error, Precision, ROC area, TP and FP Rate.

We also discovered that the multinomial naive bayes is suitable for combination with the greedy method. The hybrid method of greedy and multinomial naive bayes algorithm yielded the best performance with the accuracy over all traditional algorithms. Based on our experiments, the multinomial naive bayes algorithm with the greedy search feature selection yielded the best performance with the accuracy of 85.00 %.

In order to address this problem a novel feature selection method named "Improved Normalized Point wise Mutual Information (INPMI)" is proposed. The proposed INPMI method coupled with Sequential forward search (SFS) finds the best feature subset to aid feature selection process. The key properties of evaluating feature subset i.e. relevancy and redundancy are analysed well. The classifiers like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and J48 are used to determine the accuracy for the choice of features selected. Experimental results with benchmark medical datasets from UCI (University of California Irvine) machine learning database show that proposed INPMI-NB model with SFS, INPMI-SVM model with SFS, INPMI-J48model with SFS achieves 98.36 %,98.90 %, 94.53 % classification accuracy and selects 22 features for erythemato-squamous diseases. Also the proposed work is evaluated on a World Aircraft dataset to prove its generalization ability. Experimental results prove that the proposed INPMI method outperforms the existing systems.

Comparison of Data Mining Classification Algorithms for Breast Cancer Prediction	2013 FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING, COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING TECHNOLOGIES (ICCCNT)			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)	JUL 04-06, 2013	Tiruchengode, INDIA			Classification; Decision tree; Naive Bayes; K-Nearest neighbor; Breast cancer		Data mining is an area of computer science with a huge prospective, which is the process of discovering or extracting information from large database or datasets. There are many different areas under Data Mining and one of them is Classification or the supervised learning. Classification also can be implemented through a number of different approaches or algorithms. We have conducted the comparison between three algorithms with help of WEKA (The Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis), which is an open source software. It contains different type's data mining algorithms. This paper explains discussion of Decision tree, Bayesian Network and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms. Here, for comparing the result, we have used as parameters the correctly classified instances, incorrectly classified instances, time taken, kappa statistic, relative absolute error, and root relative squared error.

Face and Facial Expression Recognition using Extended Locality Preserving Projection	2013 FOURTH NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION, PATTERN RECOGNITION, IMAGE PROCESSING AND GRAPHICS (NCVPRIPG)	National Conference on Computer Vision Pattern Recognition Image Processing and Graphics		English	Proceedings Paper	4th National Conference on Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Image Processing and Graphics (NCVPRIPG)	DEC 18-21, 2013	Jodhpur, INDIA	Indian Inst Technol Jodhpur, Indian Unit Pattern Recognit & Artificial Intelligence				Face images of a person taken in varying expressions, orientations, lighting conditions are expected to be close to each other even under any mathematical transformation. These high dimensional face images are difficult to be recognized as faces of same person by machines in contrast to the humans. Many of the existing face recognition systems thus explicitly reduce the dimensions before performing recognition task. However, it is not guaranteed that varying faces of a single person could still be close in the lower dimensional space. Dimensionality reduction technique such as Extended Locality Preserving Projection (ELPP) not only reduces the dimension of the input data remarkably but also preserves the locality using neighbourhood information in the projected space. This paper deals with a face recognition system where ELPP is used to reduce the dimension of face images and hence uses ELPP coefficients as features to the classifier for recognition. In specific, two classifiers namely Naive Bayes classifier and Support Vector Machine are used. Results of face recognition of different data sets are highly impressive and at the same time results of facial expressions are encouraging. Experiments have also been carried out by taking a supervised version of ELPP (ESLPP).

In this paper, we propose a friendship prediction approach by fusing the topology and geographical features in location based social networks (LBSNs). We investigate the features of users' relationship both online and offline and quantify the contributions of selected features through information gain metric. Three key features are selected, namely user social topology, location category, and check-in location. Friendship is predicted based on the fusion of the selected online/offline features. Three inference models are selected to infer the friendship, including Random Forests, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes. The proposed approach is validated by intensive empirical evaluations using the collected Foursquare and Jiepang datasets.

A good email classifier is not only evaluated by performance accuracy but also by the false positive rate. This research presents an Enhanced Genetic Programming (EGP) approach which works by building an ensemble of classifiers for detecting spams. The proposed classifier is tested on the most informative features of two publically available corpuses (Enron and spamassassin) found using Greedy stepwise search method. Thereafter, the proposed ensemble of classifiers is compared with various Machine Learning Classifiers: Genetic Programming (GP), Bayesian, Naive Bayes (NB), J48, Random forest (RF), and SVM. Results of this study indicate that the proposed classifier (EGP) is the best classifier among those compared in terms of performance accuracy as well as false positive rate.

In previous work, content-free topic segmentation achieved good accuracy through a modified naive Bayes classifier and vocalisation horizon features. In this study, we attempted to improve on those results by incorporating time (sequential) dependency information into the topic boundary detection process through the use of conditional random fields and ensemble classifiers. We expected that incorporating such information would help reduce the number of false positives generated by the naive Bayes method. We introduce a new metric in the assessment of performance, in addition to the usual Pk and WindowDiff (WD) metrics in order to account for the under-detection bias of the segmentation task. Although a boosting model showed fairly good performance using a simple base classifier and limited contextual features, the more elaborate methods still trailed the Bayesian method.

In this paper, we consider the task of assigning labels to the unlabeled actors (individuals) in a large heterogeneous social network in which labels are available for a subset of actors. Specifically, we seek to learn a predictive model to label actors based on the attributes of the actors themselves and/or items that are linked to them in the network. Unfortunately, the number of distinct items, represented in real-world networks such as Facebook or Flickr is quite large (in the millions) although only a small subset of them are linked to specific actors. This leads to data sparsity which causes over-fitting and hence poor performance in predicting the labels of unlabeled actors. To address this problem, we induce hierarchical taxonomies over items and use the resulting taxonomies as a basis for selecting abstract and hence parsimonious representations of network data for learning the predictive models. Our experiments using three different predictors (Iterative classification Naive Bayes, Iterative classification Logistic Regression, and EdgeCluster) on two real-world data sets, Last.fm and Flickr, show that the predictive models that take advantage of abstract representations of network data are competitive with, and in some cases, outperform those that do not.

Fraudulent behavior is imperceptibly concealed both in local and relational data, making it even harder to define useful input for prediction models. Starting from expert knowledge, this paper succeeds to efficiently incorporate social network effects to detect fraud for the Belgian governmental social security institution, and to improve the performance of traditional non-relational fraud prediction tasks. As there are many types of social security fraud, this paper concentrates on payment fraud, predicting which companies intentionally disobey their payment duties to the government. We introduce a new fraudulent structure, the so-called spider constructions, which can easily be translated in terms of social networks and included in the learning algorithms. Focusing on the egonet of each company, the proposed method can handle large scale networks. In order to face the skewed class distribution, the SMOTE approach is applied to rebalance the data. The models were trained on different timestamps and evaluated on varying time windows. Using techniques as Random Forest, logistic regression and Naive Bayes, this paper shows that the combined relational model improves the AUC score and the precision of the predictions in comparison to the base scenario where only local variables are used.

To address this issue, we develop a malware detection system, which uses a behavior-based detection approach to deal with the detection of a large number of unknown malware. To accurately detect malware, we examine system calls to capture the runtime behavior of software, which interacts with an operating system and adopt machine learning approaches such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes learning schemes to learn the dynamic behavior of software execution. Using real-world malware and benign samples, we conduct experiments on Android devices and evaluate the effectiveness of our developed system in terms of learning algorithms, the size of training set, the length of n-grams, and the overhead in training and detection processes. Our experimental data demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed detection system to detect malware.

In syndrome identification, the relation of symptoms usually correlates with syndrome and represents the pattern of syndrome at symptomatic level. Hence, we learn models for classifying syndromes in depression using 4 different algorithms, which are naive Bayes, Bayes network, SVM and C4.5. From the results of classification, we find that the dependence of symptoms has something to do with the accuracies of syndrome classification. Then, 8 symptom networks corresponding to depression and 7 syndromes are constructed to explore the interaction profile of symptoms under syndrome. By comparing syndrome-specific symptom network to the base network of depression, we discover the enriched edges and different nodes to represent the pattern of each syndrome. Literature and symptom ranking by Fisher score demonstrate the correctness of the different nodes selected through network comparison. After all, the enriched edges and different nodes associated with a given syndrome reveal the pattern of that syndrome at symptomatic level.

With the help of data mining techniques, some findings relevant to the ageing problem can be revealed. This paper studies the performance of Bayesian network augmented naive Bayes classifier, naive Bayes classifier and proposed feature selection methods for naive Bayes on predicting a C. elegans gene's effect on the organism's longevity. The results show that due to the hierarchical structure of predictor attribute values (Gene Ontology terms), the Bayesian network augmented naive Bayes classifier performs better than the naive Bayes classifier, and the proposed feature selection methods for naive Bayes can effectively optimize the predictive performance of naive Bayes.

Based on the gait data extracted, it was found that all three vertical GRF features are higher for normal subjects as compared to PD group. Conversely, longer time is taken by PD group to complete a stance phase. Moreover, based on Analysis of Variance, it was also confirmed that all three vertical GRF features are statistical significant. Further, to verify the effectiveness of these features in discriminating anomalous PD gait pattern, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes classifier are used as classifiers. Initial results showed that SVM with RBF kernel outshine other classifiers with 96.9% accuracy, 100% sensitivity and 95% specificity.

Real-time 3D Full Body Motion Gesture Recognition	2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND BIOMIMETICS (ROBIO)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	DEC 12-14, 2013	Shenzhen, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE			HUMAN-ROBOT INTERACTION	Gesture is one of the fundamental way of human machine natural interaction. To understand this, system should be able to interpret 3D movements of human. This paper presents a real-time 3D full body gesture recognition system by tracking joints of head, neck, shoulder, arms, hands and legs. This tracking is done by Kinect motion sensor with OpenNI API and 3D full-body motion gestures are recognized. In this system, User to Kinect distance is adapted using proposed COG(center of gravity) correction method. Joint Position is normalized using the proposed 3D Joint position normalization method. For gesture recognition data mining classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Back Propagation Neural Network is used. The system is trained to recognize 12 gestures used by the umpires in a cricket match. It is tested with about 20000 frames of 15 users using 5-fold cross validation method. It achieved 98.11% accuracy with Neural Network based classifier and 88.84% accuracy with Naive Bayes classifier.

Unlike other chronic diseases, CRF is not yet thoroughly explored in literature. In this paper, we propose a new clinical decision support system for diagnosing patients with CRF. Several data classification algorithms including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Naive Bayes and Decision Tree are developed and implemented to diagnose patients with CRF and determine the progression stage of the disease. A clinical dataset of 102 instances is collected from patients' records and used in this study. Performance of the developed CRF diagnosis system is assessed in terms of diagnosis accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity and is evaluated by specialist physicians. Furthermore, the open source Weka software is also used in this study for performance comparison and evaluation purposes. The obtained results showed that the developed decision tree algorithm is the most accurate CRF classifier (92.2%) when compared to all other algorithms/implementations involved in this study.

It is caused due to deposits of drusen on the retina and the disease may cause severe blindness. It is important to detect ARMD in its early stages to save patient's vision. This paper proposes a new technique for drusen detection from fundus images by using Gabor kernel based filter bank and eliminating spurious regions which may be confused with drusen. The proposed system represents each region with a number of features and then applies hybrid classifier as an ensemble of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine to classify these regions as drusen and non-drusen. The proposed system is evaluated by testing it on STARE database using performance factors like sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. The results show the comparison and validity of proposed system with existing techniques.

Histopathological Prostate Tissue Glands Segmentation for Automated Diagnosis	2013 IEEE JORDAN CONFERENCE ON APPLIED ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES (AEECT)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Jordan Conference on Applied Electrical Engineering and Computing Technologies (AEECT)	DEC 03-05, 2013	Amman, JORDAN	IEEE Jordan Sect	Univ Jordan, Fac Engn & Technol	Prostate tissue; Gleason grading; gland segmentation; Naive Bayes classifier		In this work, we propose a methodology for segmenting glands automatically in digitized images of histopathological prostate tissue for grade classification. Gleason grading describes the abnormality of cancer cells and their degree of aggressiveness by using numerical scale from grade 1 that represents benign tissues through grade 5 for tissues characterized as advanced stage cancer. The special characteristics of glands in prostate tissue for each grade play a significant role in discriminating Gleason grades. Therefore, lumen objects and tissue glands were segmented as the major regions of interest for tissue grading. Lumen objects were segmented by an empirical thresholding technique. Since we are mainly concerned with the inner regions of the glands consisting of the lumen, cytoplasm and the inner boundary of the cell nuclei, a k-means clustering approach was employed to the a* color channel of the L* a* b* color model for each of the tissue images. This was followed by statistical and morphological features extraction for the segmented lumen objects and glands. Finally, a naive Bayes classifier was used to classify tissue images to the correct grade. The efficiency of the automated segmentation method was evaluated, and classification results achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 91.66%, 96.66%, and 95.00%, respectively. These results indicate that our automated methodology could serve as an adjunct to histopathologists and would have a positive impact when integrated with conventional histopathological diagnosis procedures.

These fundus images are really helpful in diagnosis of possible abnormalities and severe diseases like diabetic macular edema and its various types. Research has shown that early detection and treatment can prevent total vision loss and severe impacts on human visual system. Hence an automated system for diagnosing macular edema will help the ophthalmologists and patients. In this paper, we have proposed a novel method for diagnosing macular edema using fundus images. The technique has four steps which constitutes of preprocessing, macula detection, feature extraction of possible exudates region followed by classification using Naive Bayes classifier. The proposed system is tested using MESSIDOR database and results show that our method outperformed others in terms of accuracy.	[Zaidi, Zainab Yousaf; Akram, M.

For these evaluations, mathematical algorithms known as model observers (MOs) are often used as a substitute for human observers in early stages of image reconstruction algorithm development. For SPECT-MPI (myocardial perfusion imaging), diagnostic tasks involve detection, localization and assessment of regions with abnormal myocardial perfusion. In this work we propose a new MO for these tasks. The proposed MO is based on a machine-learning algorithm known as Naive-Bayes classifier (NB-MO). In the proposed approach, NB-MO is applied over a set of image features extracted from SPECT polar maps, aiming to predict perfusion scores given by humans for each myocardium region (segment). Next we compute average MO performance by first directly predicting individual human observer scores, and then using multi reader alternative free-response analysis (AFROC) in the same fashion as used on human observers. Our human observer study was comprised of five experienced (physicians) readers who scored location and severity of perfusion defects in 179 simulated SPECT-MPI cases and two different reconstruction methods (FBP and OSEM). The presented results show good performance agreement between humans and the proposed NB-MO, as well as excellent generalization properties of NB-MO between different reconstruction methods.

Any impending fault within these motors is generally very difficult to isolate by conventional fault sensors or experts. The fact is generally attributed to the non-linear behavior of the motor's terminal characteristics. Extracting anomalous behavior from such data is a challenging task and predominantly relies on the historical machine data pattern. Based on the abovementioned context, this paper presents a novel time-series condition monitoring data assessment methodology to identify developing faults in induction motors. The technique employs Hidden Markov Models to identify anomalous machine behavior. The identification thus obtained is further improved via a Naive Bayes classifier to further eliminate false positives from healthy and fault-containing data. The overall Bayes classification outcome showed a marked increase in detection accuracy at 84.55% with a substantial reduction in false positives.

Performance Comparison of Parkinsonian Gait based on Principal Component Analysis	2013 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS & APPLICATIONS (ISIEA 2013)	IEEE Symposium on Industrial Electronics and Applications		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium on Industrial Electronics and Applications (ISIEA)	SEP 22-25, 2013	Kuching, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, IEEE Malaysia Ind Elect Ind Applicat Soc Joint Chapter		Gait analysis; Principal Component Analysis; Artificial Neural Network; Support Vector Machine; Naive Bayes Classifier		The aim of this paper is to explore the potential of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as feature selection in identifying gait pattern between Parkinsonian and healthy adult. Original gait database which consist of four basic spatiotemporal gait features, five kinetic gait features and twelve kinematic gait features are acquired from prior walking experiments of both Parkinson Disease (PD) and normal subjects. These features undergo normalization based on mean and standard deviation values followed by PCA as feature selection. To evaluate the effectiveness of PCA as feature selection, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes classifier (NBC) are chosen as classifiers. Overall, results obtained proven the ability of PCA as feature selection capable to improve classification accuracy. Success rate of above 89% obtained also demonstrated that feature selection via PCA along with NBC as classifier produced significant improvement compared to other classifiers for kinematic gait parameters.

On the other side, the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) has seen much enthusiastic development as a device for general-purpose intensive parallel computation. In this paper we propose a framework which combines both approaches and evaluates the relevance of having nodes in a distributed processing cluster that make use of GPU units for further fine-grained parallel processing. We have engineered parallel and distributed versions of two data mining problems, the naive Bayes classifier and the k-means clustering algorithm, to run on the framework and have evaluated the performance gain. Finally, we also discuss the requirements and perspectives of integrating GPUs in a distributed processing cluster, introducing a fully distributed heterogeneous computing cluster.

Object Shape and Size Recognition From Tactile Images	2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL COMMUNICATION AND COMPUTING (ICCC)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Control Communication and Computing (ICCC)	DEC 13-15, 2013	Trivandrum, INDIA	IEEE		Human Computer Interaction (HCI); Tactile image; k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN); Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA); Naive Bayes classifier; Ensemble classifiers	CLASSIFIER	Artificial touch sensing system for various Human Computer Interaction (HCI) applications is required to be capable of recognizing various parameters viz. object shape, size, texture and surface. However, only identifying object-shapes is not sufficient for object recognition. It is necessary to distinguish the object shapes according to their dimensions or sizes. Thus in the present work object shapes as well as their sizes are recognized by processing and analysis of tactile images obtained by grasping different objects. In this study, statistical features are extracted from a number of acquired tactile images for classification in their respective object shape and size classes. Both inter-subject and intra-subject classifications are performed using four different classifiers (k-nearest neighbor (kNN), Naive Bayes classifier, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Ensemble) in one-versus-one (OVO) basis, which resulted in high classification accuracy independent of the type of classifier. The mean classification accuracies for inter-subject and intra-subject shape and size recognition are found to be 93%, 87% and 94% and 88% respectively.

It recommends a list of items to an end-user from a potentially overwhelming collection of choices. Since the preferences of a user is different from the likings of other users, traditional recommender systems that recommend top-rated entities to all the users, may not suffice in anticipating the needs of a user. Therefore, contextualization of recommender system is required to act more efficiently and in a user-specific manner. In an effort to deliver personalized recommendations shaped by user's contextual information, we have devised a novel methodology to incorporate contextual information into the recommender system. The proposed algorithm presents a framework for identifying the relevant contextual-variables and generating the cluster of contextual-features that depict similar rating-pattern for each class of entities. Thereafter, determining the set of Most Influential Contextual-Features that exhibit same rating-pattern as the end-user across all classes and predict the rating an end-user will give to an item, he has not rated before. Our algorithm not only renders intelligent and personalized recommendations but also alleviates cold-start, sparsity and new-item problem of traditional recommender system.

In general processing of images includes Pre-processing, segmentation, Feature extraction and Classification. Significance of classifier is essential since results are always based on the classifier. The ultimate aim is to explain how WEKA tool is used for rheumatoid arthritis and investigate the performance of the various classifiers for huge data. In our method we are distinctively give attention to the classification methods like ADTree, Best First Decision tree(BF), Decision stump, J48Pruned tree, J48 Graft Pruned tree, Least Absolute Deviation regression trees (LAD), Logistic Model Tree(LMT), Naive -Bayes (NB), Random tree, Random forest tree, CART Decision tree. The features like Area, perimeter, circularity, integrated density, Median, Skewness, Raw integrated density, and Roundness and solidity are obtained from the Lymphocytes images and formed the data set. Different classifier is applied for RA facet for Validation. RA facet contains 108 rows and 10 columns. Using classifier to find out the various values like Relative Absolute Error, and Kappa Statistic, Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error and Root Relative Squared Error. From those values compare with all the methods ADT classifier is suggested for use in huge data.	[Chokkalingam, S.

Network traffic dataset have many features and all may not contribute in detection of threats. Rejecting irrelevant features may increase performance of IDS by reducing computational time. In this paper, feature selection techniques based on Gain ratio attribute, Correlation feature selection, Chi Squared attribute, Consistency subset, Filtered attribute, Filtered subset, Information gain attribute, One RA attribute and Symmetrical Uncert attribute evaluation are tested on three classifiers (Naive Bayes, J48 and PART) by using Weka data mining and machine learning tool on UCI KDD CUP 1999 network traffic dataset. The feature selection methods are analyzed on parameters like accuracy, number of features selected out of total features, time taken, TP rate and FP rate. The result shows that almost same level of accuracy can be achieved by reducing number of features considerably which also takes less computational time to detect threats. Filtered subset evaluation comes out to be best technique which suggests only 17.07 % of total features. Hence it is proposed that reduced number of features should be used in IDS for the quick detection of threats.

This project proposes a novel method for recognizing activities and detecting fall of a person using body-worn sensors. Traditional algorithms like Naive Bayes classifier and Support Vector Machine are mainly used for activity classification. However, these systems fail to capture significant association that exists between interesting patterns. Existing accelerometer based wearable systems are not sufficient to determine the fall of a person. Hence, a Fuzzy Associative Classification based Human Activity Recognition (FAC-HAR) system is proposed to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks in detecting abnormal status of a person. The proposed (FAC-HAR) system uses three different sensors namely heartbeat, breathing rate and accelerometer and employs fuzzy clustering and associative classification for abnormality detection. The proposed system introduces a novel learning mechanism is to improve classification accuracy. A classification accuracy of 92% is achieved with the proposed fuzzy frequent pattern mining based human activity recognition.	[Surana, Jigar; Hemalatha, C. Sweetlin; Vaidehi, V.; Palavesam, S.

Various methodologies have been developed to localize text contained in scene images. One main application of localizing scene image text is to produce a real time support to visually impaired persons. To design a real-time support platform for visually impaired persons, classification of textual information i.e. character and non-character information can provide a baseline for further research. However, the challenge exists in choosing the optimum classifier for this purpose. In this work, first, we used Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSERs) to detect character candidates in a scene image; then, we trained several classifiers, i.e., AdaboostM1, Bayesian Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Bayes Net, to classify MSERs as characters and non-characters; and finally, we compared and analyzed the performances of these classifiers empirically. From experiments, it has been concluded that Bayesian Logistic Regression provides the better accuracy over the other three classifiers. This work argues that MSER based character candidates extraction and Bayesian Logistic Regression based text classification are two prominent and potential techniques in scene text detection.

In this work we will show that Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) ensembles can successfully detect and classify objects from several classes by taking advantage of head-pose estimation. The single HNNs are using pixel sums of Haarlike features as input, resulting in HNNs with a small number of neurons. An advantage of using these in ensembles is their compact form. Although it was shown that such HNNs can only memorise few patterns, by utilising a naive-Bayes mechanism we were able to exploit the multi-class ability of single HNNs within an ensemble. In this work we report successful head pose classification, which presents a 4-class problem (3 poses + negatives). Results show that successful classification can be achieved with small training sets and ensembles, making this approach an interesting choice for online learning and robotics.

These data arrive quickly, massively and are visible just once. Thus they necessarily have to be learnt according to their arrival orders. For classification problems online decision trees are known to perform well and are widely used on streaming data. In this paper, we propose a new decision tree method based on order statistics. The construction of an online tree usually needs summaries in the leaves. Our solution uses bounded error quantiles summaries. A robust and performing discretization or grouping method uses these summaries to provide, at the same time, a criterion to find the best split and better density estimations. This estimation is then used to build a naive Bayes classifier in the leaves to improve the prediction in the early learning stage.

Considering these, Compressive Tracking algorithm (CT) [1] extracts features from compressed domain, and classified object and background via a naive Bayes classier with online update. To further solve the problems of drift and inadequacy of training data, we introduce transfer learning into CT to take full advantage of prior information and propose a self-traininglike transfer learning algorithm. It selects training samples from samples collection to update classifier by the conduction of the classifier constructed at first frame. Eventually we introduce self-training-like transfer learning algorithm into CT to construct a novel tracking algorithm called Transfer Learning based Compressive Tracking (TLCT). Experimental results on 17 publicly available challenging sequences have shown the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm.

For an insufficient number of training examples, the estimation will suffer from the zero-frequency problem which does not allow NB classifiers to classify instances whose conditional probabilities are zero. Laplace-estimate and M-estimate are two common methods which alleviate the zero-frequency problem by adding some fixed terms to the probability estimation to avoid zero conditional probability. A major issue with this type of design is that the fixed terms are pre-specified without considering the uniqueness of the underlying training data. In this paper, we propose an Artificial Immune System (AIS) based self-adaptive probability estimation method, namely AISENB, which uses AIS to automatically and self-adaptively select the optimal terms and values for probability estimation. The unique immune system based evolutionary computation process, including initialization, clone, mutation, and crossover, ensure that AISENB can adjust itself to the data without explicit specification of functional or distributional forms for the underlying model.

One potential weakness of NB is the strong conditional independence assumption between attributes, which may deteriorate the classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new Artificial Immune System based Weighted Naive Bayes (AISWNB) classifier. AISWNB uses immunity theory in artificial immune systems to find optimal weight values for each attribute. The adjusted weight values will alleviate the conditional independence assumption and help calculate the conditional probability in an accurate way. Because AISWNB uses artificial immune system search mechanism to find optimal weights, it does not need to know the importance of individual attributes nor the relevance among attributes. As a result, it can obtain optimal weight value for each attribute during the learning process. Experiments and comparisons on 36 benchmark data sets demonstrate that AISWNB outperforms other state-of-the-art attribute weighted NB algorithms.

However, in traditional classification, we need to acquire the whole dataset and then build a training model which may take a lot of time and resource consumption. Another drawback of the traditional classification is that it cannot process the dataset timely and efficiently, especially for real- time data stream or big data. In this paper, we evaluate a lightweight method based on incremental learning algorithms for fast classification. We use this method to do outlier detection via several popular incremental learning algorithms, like Decision Table, Naive Bayes, J48, VFI, KStar, etc.	[Fong, Simon; Luo, Zhicong] Univ Macau, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Taipa, Macau, Taiwan; [Yap, Bee Wah] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Comp & Math Sci, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia	Fong, SM (reprint author), Univ Macau, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Taipa, Macau, Taiwan.	ccfong@umac.mo; mb05406@umac.mo; beewah@tmsk.uitm.edu.my	Fong, Simon/C-9388-2009	Fong, Simon/0000-0002-1848-7246			Atkeson CG, 1997, ARTIF INTELL REV, V11, P11, DOI 10.1023/A:1006559212014; Galvan IM, 2011, INT J INTELL SYST, V26, P773, DOI 10.1002/int.20493; Khan Mehnaz, 2012, INT J ENG ADV TECHNO, V2, P326	3	0	0	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-0-7695-5066-4				2013							186	190		10.1109/ISCBI.2013.45		5	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems	Computer Science	BC1JF	WOS:000350145100039

In this paper, we use different ways for feature selection and dimensionality reduction to determine the most important software metrics. Three different classifiers are utilized, namely Naive Bayes, support vector machine and decision tree.

However, cooperation among cognitive radio (CR) users may also introduce a variety of overheads due to the extra sensing time, delay, energy, and operations that limit achievable cooperative gain. In responding to this paper, we propose a machine learning based fusion center algorithm that can provide real time per frame training and decision based cooperative spectrum sensing. The new fusion algorithm based on training a machine learning classifier over a set containing some frame energy test statistics along with their corresponding decisions about the presence or absence of the primary user (PU) transmission, so as to predict the decisions for new frames with new energy test statistics. The simulation and numerical results show that the new approach performs the same as the current fusion rule with less sensing time, delay and operations. In this paper we also present a simulation comparison of four supervised machine learning classifiers: K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and Decision Tree (DT) in classifying 1000 testing frames after training these classifiers over a set containing 1000 frames. It shows that KNN and DT classifier outperform the other two classifiers in the accuracy of classifying the new frames.

One area that received much attention is the statistical underlying models in these studies. As data becoming bulky and prediction is often the goal of modeling, Data Mining and Machine Learning methods are becoming favorable in providing the underlying probability models for species distribution studies. Machine Learning encompasses a wide range of classification techniques, among others, with various capabilities. Although a number of techniques were presented and applied in species distribution modeling, many remain still untested. We here examine the potential of the Naive Bayes classification method, a widely and successfully applied technique in a number of fields, for modeling the common reed Phragmites australis distributions. We developed a Naive Bayes classifier to predict occurrences of Phragmites australis in a site on the Southern Finnish coast. We also tested the potential of the classifier to provide input to a cellular automaton for modeling the spread of Phragmites australis. The results suggests that the Naive Bayes classifier has significant potential in predicting species occurrences and providing transition rules for the dynamic modeling of species distributions.

Logistic Regression and Bayesian Approaches in Modeling Acceptance of Male Circumcision in Pune, India	20TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2013)			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 01-06, 2013	Adelaide, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Univ S Australia, Ctr Ind & Appl Math, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, GOYDER Inst, Govt S Australia, Australian Math Soc, Australian Math Sci Inst, Simulat Australia, Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math		Logistic Regression; Bayesian networks; Discernment analyses		Discernment analyses in survey data are being developed to help researchers better understand intentions of surveyed subjects. These models can aid in successful decision-making by allowing calculation of the likelihood of a particular outcome based on subject's known characteristics. There are many modern discernment analyses which have been used to develop predictive models in many different scientific disciplines areas. Predictive models are used in a variety of public health and medical domains. These models are constructed from observed cases, which are typically collected from various studies. The data can be preprocessed and serve as data to build statistical and machine learning models. The most frequently used discernment analysis in epidemiological datasets with binary outcomes is logistic regression. However, modern discernment Bayesian methods - i.e., Naive Bayes Classifier and Bayesian networks - have shown promising results, especially with datasets that have a large number of independent variables (>30). A study was conducted to review and compare these models, elucidate the advantages and disadvantages of each, and provide criteria for model selection. The two models were used for estimation of acceptance of medical male circumcision among a sample of 457 males in Pune, India on the basis of their answers to a survey that included questions on sociodemographics, HIV prevention knowledge, high-risk behaviors, and other characteristics. Although the models demonstrated similar performance, the Bayesian methods performed better especially in predicting negative cases, i.e., subjects who did not want to undergo medical male circumcision in cross validation evaluations. Since there were less negative cases in the dataset, this indicates with smaller sample size, Bayesian methods perform better than logistic regression. Identifying models' unique characteristics strengths as well as limitations - may help improve decision-making.	[Yoo, C.; Saxena, A.; Krupp, K.; Klausner, J.

Thus, a set of Data Mining (DM) models were developed using prevision techniques and classification models. These models enable a better doctor's decision having into account the Sepsis level of the patient. The DM models use real data collected from the Intensive Care Unit of the Santo Antonio Hospital, in Oporto, Portugal. Classification DM models were considered to predict sepsis level in a supervised learning approach. The models were induced making use of the following algorithms: Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes classifier. The models were assessed using the Confusion Matrix, associated metrics, and Cross-validation. The analysis of the total error rate, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were the metrics used to identify the most relevant measures to predict sepsis level. This work demonstrates that it is possible to predict with great accuracy the sepsis level.	[Goncalves, Joao M.

However, most existing feature selection algorithms are single objective wrapper approaches. In this work, we propose a multi-objective filter feature selection algorithm based on binary particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and probabilistic rough set theory. The proposed algorithm is compared with other five feature selection methods, including three PSO based single objective methods and two traditional methods. Three classification algorithms (naive bayes, decision trees and k-nearest neighbours) are used to test the generality of the proposed filter algorithm. Experiments have been conducted on six datasets of varying difficulty. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can automatically evolve a set of non-dominated feature subsets. In almost all cases, the proposed algorithm outperforms the other five algorithms in terms of both the number of features and the classification performance (evaluated by all the three classification algorithms). This paper presents the first study on using PSO and rough set theory for multi-objective feature selection.

Automated annotation of functional imaging experiments via multi-label classification	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						text mining; data mining; multi-label classification; bioinformatics; CogPO; neuroimaging; annotations	METAANALYSIS; BRAINMAP; MODEL; CLASSIFIERS; ONTOLOGY; DESIGN; SETS	Identifying the experimental methods in human neuroimaging papers is important for grouping meaningfully similar experiments for meta-analyses. Currently, this can only be done by human readers. We present the performance of common machine learning (text mining) methods applied to the problem of automatically classifying or labeling this literature. Labeling terms are from the Cognitive Paradigm Ontology (CogPO), the text corpora are abstracts of published functional neuroimaging papers, and the methods use the performance of a human expert as training data. We aim to replicate the expert's annotation of multiple labels per abstract identifying the experimental stimuli, cognitive paradigms, response types, and other relevant dimensions of the experiments. We use several standard machine learning methods: naive Bayes (NB), k-nearest neighbor, and support vector machines (specifically SMO or sequential minimal optimization). Exact match performance ranged from only 15% in the worst cases to 78% in the best cases. NB methods combined with binary relevance transformations performed strongly and were robust to overfitting. This collection of results demonstrates what can be achieved with off-the-shelf software components and little to no pre-processing of raw text.

The system segments hand shapes from a captured 3D scene by using depth information and active contours. A hand shape is recognized by a trained naive Bayes classifier, whether it belongs to a palm, a pointing hand form or both hands with simple occlusion. A plane is approximated by using RANSAC for a palm hand form, while a vector from the hand centroid to the fingertip is obtained for a pointing hand form by using ICP as tracking method.

First, we apply Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) to construct low dimensional linear-subspace representations from the noisy fMRI images for each subject and then perform a Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) classification. In previous studies the discrimination of cognitive brain states from fMRI is done by transforming the fMRI into a time sequence of voxels from which the brain states are inferred. RPCA improved the classification rate of a real benchmark fMRI data.

To capture features covering a diversity of different objects, it has been observed that a sufficient number of learning instances are required to efficiently estimate the models' parameter values. In this paper, we propose a genetic programming (GP) based method for the problem of binary image classification that uses a single instance per class to evolve a classifier. The method uses local binary patterns (LBP) as an image descriptor, support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier, and a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) as an analyser. Furthermore, a multi-objective fitness function is designed to detect distinct and informative regions of the images, and measure the goodness of the wrapped classifiers. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated on six data sets and compared to the performances of both GP based (Two-tier GP and conventional GP) and non-GP (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines and hybrid Naive Bayes/Decision Trees) methods. The results show that a comparable or significantly better performance has been achieved by the proposed method over all methods on all of the data sets considered.

Vehicle-to-vehicle communication regularly makes use of the broadcast mode transmissions, which are not often used prior to this application. Broadcast mode transmissions are more prone to frame loss from channel contention than unicasts due to its inability to adapt, and are unable to recover lost frames. This makes them very sensitive to channel congestion. In this paper, we first apply a variant of Bianchi et al.'s Markov model of the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF), to show that the observed inter-frame idle slots can be expressed as a probability distribution conditional on the number of saturated stations. It therefore follows that the probability distribution for the number of saturated stations can be estimated from inter-frame idle slots through Bayes Law. Second, we present a novel passive channel congestion estimation technique that observes the inter-frame idle slot counts in any given IEEE 802.11 network and uses a naive Bayes classifier to estimate the current channel contention in terms of the number of concurrent saturated stations. This technique is evaluated using computer simulations, and is shown to produce more accurate estimates with faster convergence time than the existing technique of observing collision probability using channel busy status as a proxy.

Using Weka workbench, we constructed seven representative classification models to discriminate the cold/heat nature of Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) based on efficacy attributes and evaluated them by three kinds of validations. The results showed that naive Bayes, Bayesian network and logistic regression performed efficient discrimination on the unseen test set after a proper attribute selection, while random tree, multi-layer perceptron network, logistic regression and PART algorithm might be suitable for the retrospective analysis with all attributes. This work could provide a methodology reference for further discrimination researches and facilitate the scientific explanation of these CHM concepts.

Any ignorance and negligence leads to unpleasant situations thereafter. A wearable attire system can precisely interpret the implicit communication of the state of the subject and pass it to the care takers or to an automated aid device. Casual and conventional movements of subjects during play and living condition can be used for the above purpose. The proposed system suggests a novel way of identifying safe and unsafe conditions of playing for the children where a rapid warning assistance is required. The Same in the case of the normal and contraction time identification of pregnant women. Naive Bayes classifier was applied on five different sets of combinations of features constructed by Fractal Dimension, Fast Fourier Transformation, Singular Value Decomposition and combinations of the three. The result shows the combinational features of FFT and SVD are more supportive in all three sets of experiments and better classified by Navie Bayes classifier than the other combination and individual features. The experimental results show a well-distinguished realization of different body movement activities using a wearable attire array medium and the interpretation results always show significant and identifiable thresholds.

In our initial works in [5] and [6], we proposed the foundational theory of CMOS, Classification by the Moments of Order Statistics, for some uni-dimensional symmetric and asymmetric distributions of the exponential family. In this paper, we generalize those results for various multidimensional distributions. The strategy is analogous to a Naive-Bayes' approach, although it, really, is of an anti-Naive-Bayes' paradigm.

Five feature selection methods and three classifiers are evaluated on a Czech corpus in order to build an efficient Czech document classification system. Lemmatization and POS tagging are used for a precise representation of the Czech documents. We demonstrated, that POS tag filtering is very important, while the lemmatization plays a marginal role for classification. We also showed that Maximum Entropy and Support Vector Machines are very robust to the feature vector size and outperform significantly the Naive Bayes classifier from the view point of the classification accuracy. The best classification accuracy is about 90% which is enough for an application for the Czech News Agency, our commercial partner.

Nevertheless, many dictionary-based SR methods randomly select patches from of a larger set of training images to build their dictionaries [8, 14, 19, 20], thus relying on patches being diverse enough. This paper describes a dictionary building method for SR based on adaptively selecting an optimal subset of patches out of the training images. Each training image is divided into sub-image entities, named regions, of such a size that texture consistency is preserved and high-frequency (HF) energy is present. For each input patch to super-resolve, the best-fitting region is found through a Bayesian selection. In order to handle the high number of regions in the training dataset, a local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor (NBNN) approach is used. Trained with this adapted subset of patches, sparse coding SR is applied to recover the high-resolution image. Experimental results demonstrate that using our adaptive algorithm produces an improvement in SR performance with respect to non-adaptive training.

In this paper, we propose a novel mobile sensing based framework which uses machine learning algorithms for the detection of agriculture activities. To collect the sensors data and ground truth an android based mobile application has also been developed and has been provided to the farmers. We investigate the performance of Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifiers to detect the activities like Harvesting, Bed Making, Stand-still and Walking. We also use the same classifiers to detect the placement of the mobile phone on the body which will hence provide a degree of freedom to the farmers in placing the mobile phone as per their convenience.

Herein, we propose a diagnostic system based on sequence-derived structural and physicochemical attributes of proteins that involved in both types of tumors via feature extraction, feature selection and prediction models. 1497 proteins attributes computed and important features selected by 12 attribute weighting models and finally machine learning models consist of seven SVM models, three ANN models and two NB models applied on original database and newly created ones from attribute weighting models; models accuracies calculated through 10-fold cross and wrapper validation (just for SVM algorithms). In line with our previous findings, dipeptide composition, autocorrelation and distribution descriptor were the most important protein features selected by bioinformatics tools. The algorithms performances in lung cancer tumor type prediction increased when they applied on datasets created by attribute weighting models rather than original dataset. Wrapper-Validation performed better than X-Validation; the best cancer type prediction resulted from SVM and SVM Linear models (82%). The best accuracy of ANN gained when Neural Net model applied on SVM dataset (88%). This is the first report suggesting that the combination of protein features and attribute weighting models with machine learning algorithms can be effectively used to predict the type of lung cancer tumors (SCLC and NSCLC).

J	Lu, YJ				Lu, Yingjie			Automatic topic identification of health-related messages in online health community using text classification	SPRINGERPLUS			English	Article						Online health community; Text classification; Topic identification; Topic classification		To facilitate patient involvement in online health community and obtain informative support and emotional support they need, a topic identification approach was proposed in this paper for identifying automatically topics of the health-related messages in online health community, thus assisting patients in reaching the most relevant messages for their queries efficiently. Feature-based classification framework was presented for automatic topic identification in our study. We first collected the messages related to some predefined topics in a online health community. Then we combined three different types of features, n-gram-based features, domain-specific features and sentiment features to build four feature sets for health-related text representation. Finally, three different text classification techniques, C4.5, Naive Bayes and SVM were adopted to evaluate our topic classification model. By comparing different feature sets and different classification techniques, we found that n-gram-based features, domain-specific features and sentiment features were all considered to be effective in distinguishing different types of health-related topics. In addition, feature reduction technique based on information gain was also effective to improve the topic classification performance. In terms of classification techniques, SVM outperformed C4.5 and Naive Bayes significantly. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach could identify the topics of online health-related messages efficiently.

J	Song, QB; Ni, JJ; Wang, GT				Song, Qinbao; Ni, Jingjie; Wang, Guangtao			A Fast Clustering-Based Feature Subset Selection Algorithm for High-Dimensional Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Feature subset selection; filter method; feature clustering; graph-based clustering	MULTIPLE DATA SETS; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; MUTUAL INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION; CLASSIFIERS; RELEVANCE; SEARCH	Feature selection involves identifying a subset of the most useful features that produces compatible results as the original entire set of features. A feature selection algorithm may be evaluated from both the efficiency and effectiveness points of view. While the efficiency concerns the time required to find a subset of features, the effectiveness is related to the quality of the subset of features. Based on these criteria, a fast clustering-based feature selection algorithm (FAST) is proposed and experimentally evaluated in this paper. The FAST algorithm works in two steps. In the first step, features are divided into clusters by using graph-theoretic clustering methods. In the second step, the most representative feature that is strongly related to target classes is selected from each cluster to form a subset of features. Features in different clusters are relatively independent, the clustering-based strategy of FAST has a high probability of producing a subset of useful and independent features. To ensure the efficiency of FAST, we adopt the efficient minimum-spanning tree (MST) clustering method. The efficiency and effectiveness of the FAST algorithm are evaluated through an empirical study. Extensive experiments are carried out to compare FAST and several representative feature selection algorithms, namely, FCBF, ReliefF, CFS, Consist, and FOCUS-SF, with respect to four types of well-known classifiers, namely, the probability-based Naive Bayes, the tree-based C4.5, the instance-based IB1, and the rule-based RIPPER before and after feature selection. The results, on 35 publicly available real-world high-dimensional image, microarray, and text data, demonstrate that the FAST not only produces smaller subsets of features but also improves the performances of the four types of classifiers.

The aim of this study was to evaluate classification algorithms based on ASOCT measurements for the detection of gonioscopic angle closure. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: We included 2047 subjects aged >= 50 years. Methods: Participants underwent gonioscopy and ASOCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). Customized software (Zhongshan Angle Assessment Program, Guangzhou, China) was used to measure ASOCT parameters in horizontal ASOCT scans. Six classification algorithms were considered (stepwise logistic regression with Akaike information criterion, Random Forest, multivariate adaptive regression splines, support vector machine, naive Bayes' classification, and recursive partitioning). The ASOCT-derived parameters were incorporated to generate point and interval estimates of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curves for these algorithms using 10-fold cross-validation as well as 50: 50 training and validation. Main Outcome Measures: We assessed ASOCT measurements and angle closure. Results: Data on 1368 subjects, including 295 (21.6%) subjects with gonioscopic angle closure were available for analysis. The mean (+/- standard deviation) age was 62.4 +/- 7.5 years and 54.8% were females. Angle closure subjects were older and had smaller ACW, ACA, and ACV; greater LV; and thicker irides (P<0.001 for all). For both, the 10-fold cross-validation and the 50: 50 training and validation methods, stepwise logistic regression was the best algorithm for detecting eyes with gonioscopic angle closure with testing set AUC of 0.954 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.942-0.966) and 0.962 (95% CI, 0.948-0.975) respectively, whereas recursive partitioning had relatively the poorest performance with testing set AUC 0.860 (95% CI, 0.790-0.930) and 0.905 (95% CI, 0.876-0.933), respectively. This algorithm performed similarly well (AUC, 0.957) in a second independent sample of 200 angle closure subjects and 302 normal controls. Conclusions: A classification algorithm based on stepwise logistic regression that used a combination of 6 parameters obtained from a single horizontal ASOCT scan identified subjects with gonioscopic angle closure >95% of the time.

Under this constraints, optimization techniques perform poorly in particular when little a priori knowledge is available. In this work we investigate the possibility of combining approaches from advanced statistics and optimization algorithms to effectively explore a combinatorial search space sampling a limited number of experimental points. To this purpose we propose the Naive Bayes Ant Colony Optimization (NACO) procedure. We tested its performance in a simulation study.

V.; Stent, Amanda			Live and learn from mistakes: A lightweight system for document classification	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						3LM; Centroid; Clusterhead; Classifier; Lifelong; Online		We present a Life-Long Learning from Mistakes (3LM) algorithm for document classification, which could be used in various scenarios such as spam filtering, blog classification, and web resource categorization. We extend the ideas of online clustering and batch-mode centroid-based classification to online learning with negative feedback. The 3LM is a competitive learning algorithm, which avoids over-smoothing, characteristic of the centroid-based classifiers, by using a different class representative, which we call clusterhead. The clusterheads competing for vector-space dominance are drawn toward misclassified documents, eventually bringing the model to a "balanced state" for a fixed distribution of documents. Subsequently, the clusterheads oscillate between the misclassified documents, heuristically minimizing the rate of misclassifications, an NP-complete problem. Further, the 3LM algorithm prevents over-fitting by "leashing" the clusterheads to their respective centroids. A clusterhead provably converges if its class can be separated by a hyper-plane from all other classes. Lifelong learning with fixed learning rate allows 3LM to adapt to possibly changing distribution of the data and continually learn and unlearn document classes. We report on our experiments, which demonstrate high accuracy of document classification on Reuters21578, OHSUMED, and TREC07p-spam datasets. The 3LM algorithm did not show over-fitting, while consistently outperforming centroid-based, Naive Bayes, C4.5, AdaBoost, kNN, and SVM whose accuracy had been reported on the same three corpora.

Firstly, we describe different tokenization methods which allow us for extracting valuable features from the e-mails. The methods are used to create training sets for individual Bayesian classifiers, because different methods of feature extraction ensure the desirable diversity of classifier ensemble. Because of the lack of an adequate analytical methods of ensemble evaluation the most valuable and diverse committees are chosen on the basis of computer experiments which are carried out on the basis of our own spam dataset. Then the number of well known fusion methods using class labels and class supports are compared to establish the final proposition.

J	Yang, H; Fong, S; Wong, R; Sun, GM				Yang, Hang; Fong, Simon; Wong, Raymond; Sun, Guangmin			Optimizing Classification Decision Trees by Using Weighted Naive Bayes Predictors to Reduce the Imbalanced Class Problem in Wireless Sensor Network	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article								Standard classification algorithms are often inaccurate when used in a wireless sensor network (WSN), where the observed data occur in imbalanced classes. The imbalanced data classification problem occurs when the number of samples in one class, usually the class of interest, is much lower than the number in the other classes. Many classification models have been studied in the data-mining research community. However, they all assume that the input data are stationary and bounded in size, so that resampling techniques and postadjustment by measuring the classification cost can be applied. In this paper, we devise a new scheme that extends a popular stream classification algorithm to the analysis of WSNs for reducing the adverse effects of the imbalanced class in the data.. is new scheme is resource light at the algorithm level and does not require any data preprocessing. It uses weighted naive Bayes predictors at the decision tree leaves to effectively reduce the impact of imbalanced classes. Experiments show that our modified algorithm outperforms the original stream classification algorithm.

With the increasing availability of large databases with a wide range of information there is a growing need to use methods capable of recognizing classification patterns. Based on a dataset of 356 foreign body injuries located in larynx, pharynx, mouth, esophagus or stomach, which occurred in European children aged up to 14 years in 2000-2002, this study is aimed to predict injury severity applying feature selection procedures for identifying the most influential variables among the consumer product characteristics and the circumstances of the injury that can lead to hospitalization and complications. Selective naive Bayes classifiers were implemented on a subset of 307 and 303 injuries, for which hospitalization and complications details were given respectively, using filter and wrapper strategies for inducing feature selection. The variables recognized by the selective naive Bayes were: the injured child age and gender, the foreign body type and its characteristics (volume, consistency, shape), whether the injury occurred in presence or in absence of an adult and the activity the child played before the accident. Filter strategy resulted in the most accurate classification model. Models induced by feature selection approach give an improvement in the comprehensibility of the phenomenon, which is missed when the whole set of variables is considered. The need of fostering the attention of caretakers toward a proper surveillance of children and of the manufactures toward the safety design of the end product emerged. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal of this study was to compare computational tools with and without feature selection for predicting osteoporosis outcome in Taiwanese women based on genetic factors such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To elucidate relationships between osteoporosis and SNPs in this population, three classification algorithms were applied: multilayer feedforward neural network (MFNN), naive Bayes, and logistic regression. A wrapper-based feature selection method was also used to identify a subset of major SNPs. Experimental results showed that the MFNN model with the wrapper-based approach was the best predictive model for inferring disease susceptibility based on the complex relationship between osteoporosis and SNPs in Taiwanese women. The findings suggest that patients and doctors can use the proposed tool to enhance decision making based on clinical factors such as SNP genotyping data.

Further more, with the increasingly mature of the attack knowledge, complex and diverse attack tools and techniques, the current simple firewall technology has been unable to meet the needs of the people. Facing so many challenges and threats, intrusion detection and prevention technology is bound to become one of the core technologies in the security audit. The iintrusion detection, playing a role of active defense, is an effective complement to the firewall, and is an important part of network security. This paper mainly analyzes the decision tree algorithm and improved Naive Bayes algorithm, proving the effectiveness of the improved Naive Bayes algorithm.

Thus, understanding proteinprotein interactions (PPIs) is essential to decipher biological functions in a living cell. To predict large-scale PPIs, effective and efficient computational approaches are desirable to integrate heterogeneous data sources provided by advanced technologies. In this paper, we extend our previous work on a Bayesian classifier for human PPI predictions from model organisms, by introducing a tree-augmented naive Bayes (TAN) classifier. TAN maintains the simplicity and robustness of a naive Bayes classifier while allows for the dependence among variables. Our empirical results show that by integrating features extracted from microarray expression measurements, Gene Ontology values, and orthologous scores, TAN achieves higher classification accuracy than the manually constructed Bayesian network classifier and naive Bayes. For human PPI prediction, TAN obtains 88% sensitivity while keeping a reasonable 70% specificity on testing samples.

In this paper, we attempt to discard this assumption in order to develop a more efficient and secure scheme to perform classification with minimal disclosure of private data. Our proposed scheme is based on the work by Vaidya and Clifton [2], which uses commutative encryption to perform secure set intersection so that the parties with access to the individual partitions have no knowledge of the intersection. The evaluations presented in this paper are based on experimental results, which show that our proposed protocol scales well with large sparse datasets*.

We introduced a procedure to learn the parameters of the Naive Bayes model, and we discussed two classification rules. The model was estimated and tested on 559 Italians aged 1622. Two experts provided the dental evaluations, and the model was estimated for each of them. We evaluated the coherence of the evidence provided by the experts. Some indexes have been proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of the models, emphasizing how the experts ability and the technology affect the results. We introduced two benchmarks, one based on the sample distribution per sex and age: in this case, probability of correct classification increases 22% and the proportion of false adults impressively decreases 80.2%; the other benchmark, obtained by simulating hard evidence, shows how the use of soft evidence increases the proportion of correct classification 3.1% and decreases the crucial proportion of false adults about 20%. Similarly, the proportion of false minors decreases about 5.3%.

Furthermore, we introduce a pair of weight parameters to balance the impact of labeled and pseudolabeled data, and define a hybrid objective function to tune their values during co-training. The final prediction is given by the combination of base classifiers, and we define a pseudo-validation set to regulate their weight. Additionally, we present a strategy of pseudo-labeled data selecting to deal with the class imbalance problem. Experimental results on six datasets show that our method performs much better in practice, especially when the amount of labeled data is small. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, SY; Zhu, MM; Yang, YL				Liu, Sanyang; Zhu, Mingmin; Yang, Youlong			A Bayesian Classifier Learning Algorithm Based on Optimization Model	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							MUTUAL INFORMATION; NETWORKS	Naive Bayes classifier is a simple and effective classification method, but its attribute independence assumption makes it unable to express the dependence among attributes and affects its classification performance. In this paper, we summarize the existing improved algorithms and propose a Bayesian classifier learning algorithm based on optimization model (BC-OM). BC-OM uses the chi-squared statistic to estimate the dependence coefficients among attributes, with which it constructs the objective function as an overall measure of the dependence for a classifier structure. Therefore, a problem of searching for an optimal classifier can be turned into finding the maximum value of the objective function in feasible fields. In addition, we have proved the existence and uniqueness of the numerical solution. BC-OM offers a new opinion for the research of extended Bayesian classifier. Theoretical and experimental results show that the new algorithm is correct and effective.

Sentiment analysis extracts and measures the sentiment or "attitude" of documents as well as the topics within documents. The attitude may be the person's judgment (e.g., positive vs. negative) or emotional tone (e.g., objective vs. subjective). In this paper we define a supervised learning solution for sentiment analysis on twitter messages which gives profound accuracy using Nave Bayes Classification. It classifies the tweets either positive or negative. Our dataset consists of tweets containing move reviews retrieved from twitter using certain keywords on a cloud platform. The experiment and analysis has 3 major steps. In the first step, the algorithm used is Naive Bayes which performed Boolean classification on bag of words, resulting in 71% of accuracy. In the second step, Naive Bayes algorithm is applied on bag of words without stop words which gave 72% accuracy. In the third step, using the concept of Information gain, high value features are selected using Chi-Square, which gave maximum accuracy. The evaluating metrics used in this work are Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F-Measure for both the sentiment classes. The results show that Naive Bayes algorithm with the application of feature selection using the minimum Chi-Square value of 3 gave an Accuracy of 89%, Positive Precision 83.07%, Positive Recall 97.2%, Positive F-Measure 89.9%, Negative Precision 96.6%, Negative Recall 81.2% and Negative FMeasure 88.2%. The significant increase in Positive Recall specifies that the classifier classifies positive words with more probability when compared to the negative words. This paper also describes the preprocessing steps needed in order to achieve high accuracy.	[Sayeedunnissa, S.

Previous studies have indicated that the use of features derived from Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans lead to more accurate and earlier diagnosis of AD, compared to the traditional approaches that use a combination of clinical assessments. In this study, we compare Naive Bayes (NB) with variations of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for the automatic diagnosis of AD. 3D Stereotactic Surface Projection (3D-SSP) is utilised to extract features from PET scans. At the most detailed level, the dimensionality of the feature space is very high. Hence we evaluate the benefits of a correlation-based feature selection method to find a small number of highly relevant features; we also provide an analysis of selected features, which is generally supportive of the literature. However, we have also encountered patterns that may be new and relevant to prediction of the progression of AD.

Nevertheless, the cave is a unique deep-sea-like habitat zone due to total darkness, lack of water circulation, oligotrophy, and cold homothermy, a thermal regime similar to that of the deep Mediterranean. We studied the meiofaunal community composition and diversity at 3 sampling stations in the cave (entrance, middle, and blind end). Major taxon composition, based on presence/absence data, did not vary over the transect; however, significant differences in community were found. Tardigrades were the only major taxon restricted to the inner parts of the cave. Copepod diversity decreased towards the inner parts of the cave. The 3PP Cave was characterized by very low abundances of meiofaunal organisms similar to abyssal sites elsewhere. A total of 405 individual copepods were assigned to 27 families and 90 species (75% of them new to science). Significant differences in copepod communities between stations were found at family, genus, and species level. Some harpacticoid taxa generally known from the deep sea, such as Marsteinia, Ancorabolina, Paranannopus, Nematovorax, and Argestidae, were represented in the 3PP Cave. A naive Bayes model was used for the first time to classify the communities as 'shallow' or 'abyssal'. The meiobenthic communities at the entrance and the end of the cave were unequi vocally classified as 'shallow' and 'abyssal' respectively, while the middle part of the cave presented a mixed community. Our study further highlights the strong faunal and community affinities between marine caves and the deep sea, indicating the existence of dispersal mechanisms from deep waters into the euphotic zone for benthic organisms.

Local online users often represent their opinions and experiences on the web with written Persian. Although the information in those reviews is valuable to potential consumers and sellers, the huge amount of web reviews make it difficult to give an unbiased evaluation to a product. In this paper, standard machine learning techniques SVM and naive Bayes are incorporated into the domain of online Persian Movie reviews to automatically classify user reviews as positive or negative and performance of these two classifiers is compared with each other in this language. The effects of feature presentations on classification performance are discussed. We find that accuracy is influenced by interaction between the classification models and the feature options. The SVM classifier achieves as well as or better accuracy than naive Bayes in Persian movie. Unigrams are proved better features than bigrams and trigrams in capturing Persian sentiment orientation.

Texture analysis of computed tomography (CT) scans is one of important preliminary stage in the computerized detection system and classification for lung cancer. Among different types of images features analysis, Haralick texture with variety of statistical measures has been used widely in image texture description. The extraction of texture feature values is essential to be used by a CAD especially in classification of the normal and abnormal tissue on the cross sectional CT images. This paper aims to compare experimental results using texture extraction and different machine leaning methods in the classification normal and abnormal tissues through lung CT images. The machine learning methods involve in this assessment are Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree (J48) and Backpropagation Neural Network. AIRS is found to provide high accuracy (99.2%) and sensitivity (98.0%) in the assessment. For experiments and testing purpose, publicly available datasets in the Reference Image Database to Evaluate Therapy Response (RIDER) are used as study cases.

In the proposed scheme, traffic flows are described using the discretized statistical features and flow correlation information is modeled by bag-of-flow (BoF). We solve the BoF-based traffic classification in a classifier combination framework and theoretically analyze the performance benefit. Furthermore, a new BoF-based traffic classification method is proposed to aggregate the naive Bayes (NB) predictions of the correlated flows. We also present an analysis on prediction error sensitivity of the aggregation strategies. Finally, a large number of experiments are carried out on two large-scale real-world traffic datasets to evaluate the proposed scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can achieve much better classification performance than existing state-of-the-art traffic classification methods.

Automated detection of diabetes using higher order spectral features extracted from heart rate signals	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						ECG; HRV; higher order spectra; diabetes; Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy; bispectrum; entropy; classifier	RATE-VARIABILITY; CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY; QT INTERVAL; CLASSIFICATION; ECG; HYPERGLYCEMIA; ARRHYTHMIA; TRANSFORM; DYNAMICS; TIME	Diabetes Mellitus, often referred to as diabetes, is a chronic disease that affects a vast majority of world population. The percentage of people affected is increasing every year. Diabetes is very difficult to cure. It can only be kept under control. In this scenario, diagnosis of diabetes is of great importance. In this work, we used Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signals obtained from ECG signals for the purpose of diagnosis of diabetes. We employed signal processing methods to extract features from the HRV signal. Since HRV signals are of nonlinear nature, we made use of Higher Order Spectrum (HOS) based features for analysis. In this paper, we have extracted the HOS features from HRV signals corresponding to normal and diabetic subjects. These selected features were fed independently to seven classifiers namely Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes classifier (NBC), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Fuzzy classifier and Decision Tree (DT) classifier. The performance of these classifiers was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve measures. We observed that the GMM classifier presented the highest accuracy of 90.5%, while the other classifiers presented accuracies in the range of 86.5% to 71.4%. Thus, the proposed Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) technique has the ability to detect diabetes efficiently by analyzing the subtle changes in ECG signals that are indicative of the presence of diabetes in a patient. Also, we have proposed unique bispectrum and bicoherence plots for normal and diabetes heart rate signals.

Activity Recognition Using Smartphone Sensors	2013 IEEE CONSUMER COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING CONFERENCE (CCNC)			English	Proceedings Paper	10th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)	JAN 11-14, 2013	Las Vegas, NV	IEEE			ACCELEROMETRY	Motion sensor embedded smartphones have provided a new platform for activity inference. These sensors, initially used for cell phone feature enhancement, are now being used for a variety of applications. Providing cell phone users information about their own physical activity in an understandable format can enable users to make more informed and healthier lifestyle choices. In this work, we built a smartphone application which tracks users' physical activities and provide feedback requiring no user input during routine operation. The application reports estimates of the calories burned, broken up by physical activities. Detectable physical activities include walking, running, climbing stairs, descending stairs, driving, cycling and being inactive. We evaluated a number of classification algorithms from the area of Machine Learning, including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine classifiers. For training and verification of classifiers, we collected a dataset of 510 activity traces using cell phone sensors. We developed a smartphone app that performs activity recognition that does not require any user intervention. The classifier implemented in the Android app performs at an average true positives rate of greater than 95%, false positives rate of less than 1.5% and an ROC area of greater than 98%.

However, the experimental method to identify virion proteins is time consuming and expensive. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop novel computational methods for phage virion protein identification. In this study, a Naive Bayes based method was proposed to predict phage virion proteins using amino acid composition and dipeptide composition. In order to remove redundant information, a novel feature selection technique was employed to single out optimized features. In the jackknife test, the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 79.15% for phage virion and nonvirion proteins classification, which are superior to that of other state-of-the-art classifiers. These results indicate that the proposed method could be as an effective and promising high-throughput method in phage proteomics research.

Nevertheless, how to test its statistical significance under an ultra-high-dimensional (UHD) setup is not well understood. To fill this important theoretical gap, we propose a novel testing statistic with a standard normal asymptotic null distribution, even if the predictor dimension is considerably larger than the sample size. This makes the proposed method useful for UHD data analysis. Simulation studies are presented to demonstrate its finite sample performance and a text classification example is described for illustration.

In order to evaluation synthetically, analyzed three popular text categorization algorithm that are naive Bayes (NB), decision tree(DT) and support vector machines(SVM). Carried on simulation experiment used the open source data mining tool of Weka. Experimental results show some significant conclusions: The performance of three classification methods are better, including Support vector machine classification of the best performance, highest precision and recall, naive Bayes second, the minimum Decision tree. Also found that classification performance associated not only the choice of the classification algorithm but also the differences between corpus categories.

Our study indicates that using Dense-SIFT along with dimensionality reduction using PCA enables NBNN to obtain state-of-the-art results. We demonstrate this on two tasks: (1) scene image categorization on the UIUC 8 Sports Events Image Dataset (obtaining 84.67%) and the MIT 67 Indoor Scene Image Dataset (obtaining 48.84%); and (2) detecting videos depicting certain events of interest on the challenging MED' 11 video dataset with only 15 positive training videos per event. We present an extension referred to as sparse-NBNN that constrains the number of training images that can used to match with a given test image for the image-to-class distance computation. Experiments indicate that this improves upon NBNN for handling of imbalanced training data.

It is not species specific and has been applied to Grevy's and plains zebras, giraffes, leopards, and lionfish. We describe two approaches, both based on extracting and matching keypoints or "hotspots". The first tests each new query image sequentially against each database image, generating a score for each database image in isolation, and ranking the results. The second, building on recent techniques for instance recognition, matches the query image against the database using a fast nearest neighbor search. It uses a competitive scoring mechanism derived from the Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor algorithm recently proposed for category recognition. We demonstrate results on databases of more than 1000 images, producing more accurate matches than published methods and matching each query image in just a few seconds.

The classification difficulties in medical area frequently classify medical dataset based on the result of medical diagnosis or description of medical treatment by the medical specialist. The Extensive amounts of information and data warehouse in medical databases need the development of specialized tools for storing, retrieving, investigation, and effectiveness usage of stored knowledge and data. Intelligent methods such as neural networks, fuzzy sets, decision trees, and expert systems are, slowly but steadily, applied in the medical fields. Recently, Bijective soft set theory has been proposed as a new intelligent technique for the discovery of data dependencies, data reduction, classification and rule generation from databases. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on Bijective soft sets for the generation of classification rules from the data set. Investigational results from applying the Bijective soft set analysis to the set of data samples are given and evaluated. In addition, the generated rules are also compared to the well-known decision tree classifier algorithm and Naive bayes. The learning illustrates that the theory of Bijective soft set seems to be a valuable tool for inductive learning and provides a valuable support for building expert systems.	[Kumar, S.

Naive Bayes technique implemented by creating tables of training; the sets of these tables were generated by using four factors that affect employee's continuity in their jobs. The training tables used to predict the classification of other (unclassified) instances, and tabulate the results of conditional and prior probabilities to test unknown instance for classification. The information obtained can classify unknown instances for employment in the labor market. In Decision Tree technique, a model was constructed from a dataset in the form of a tree, created by a process known as splitting on the value of attributes. The Decision Rules, which was constructed from Decision Trees of rules gave the best results, therefore we recommended using this method in predicting labor market. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Accordingly, it was used a database created by Graz University of Technology for the BCI Competition II. The database was created through an experiment in which an individual was asked to imagine the movement of her right or left hand while the EEG signal reading (Electroencephalogram) was being performed directly on the scalp by using three bipolar electrodes. In order to analyze the EEG signals for spectral estimation, it was used the Periodogram method computed in three different frequencies in mu-rythm (8 a 13Hz) and beta-rythm (14 a 25Hz) frequencies to generate the Naive Bayes classifier entries. This database enabled to obtain a hit rate higher than 80%, which is consistent with results from the literature. Systems based on Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) can appropriate these algorithms to trigger and control devices through mental intentions only.

However, a massive amount of spam mail is polluting mailboxes everyday, taking advantage of the ability to send mail to any number of random people through the internet. In this paper we will introduce an efficient method of classifying E-mails using the SVM(Support Vector Machine) learning algorithm, which is recently showing high performance in the field of classifying documents. The disposition of the words inside the E-mail documents are extracted, and the performance of classification is compared and examined through the learning based on the change of DF value which occurs to reduce the disposition space in the learning level. To assess the performance of the SVM, the SVM is compared to the Naive Bayes classifier (which uses probability methods) and a vector model classifier in order to verify that the method of using the learning algorithm of SVM shows better performance.

The proposed system is intended as a screening and monitoring tool in home-healthcare applications and not as a replacement for ECG-based methods used in clinical environments. Based on the BCG data recorded in a study with ten AF patients, we evaluate and rank seven popular machine learning algorithms (naive Bayes, linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, support vector machines, random forests as well as bagged and boosted trees) for their performance in separating 30-s long BCG epochs into one of three classes: sinus rhythm, AF, and artifact. For each algorithm, feature subsets of a set of statistical time-frequency-domain and time-domain features were selected based on the mutual information between features and class labels as well as the first-and second-order interactions among features. The classifiers were evaluated on a set of 856 epochs by means of tenfold cross validation. The best algorithm (random forests) achieved a Matthews correlation coefficient, mean sensitivity, and mean specificity of 0.921, 0.938, and 0.982, respectively.

By employing interelement dependency models to overcome the independence violation problem inherent in the Naive Bayes learners, our method yields intrusion detectors with better accuracy. For efficient and lightweight counting of n-gram features without losing accuracy, we use a k-truncated generalized suffix tree (k-TGST) for storing n-gram features. The k-TGST storage mechanism enables us to scale up the classifiers, which cannot be easily achieved by Support-Vector-Machine- (SVM-) based methods that require implausible computing power and resources for accuracy. Experimental results on a set of practical benchmark datasets show that our method is scalable up to 20-gram with consistent accuracy comparable to SVMs.	Dongseo Univ, Div Comp & Informat Engn, Pusan 617716, South Korea	Kang, DK (reprint author), Dongseo Univ, Div Comp & Informat Engn, 47 Jurye Ro, Pusan 617716, South Korea.	dkkang@dongseo.ac.kr					Andorf C., 2004, P 5 INT C KNOWL BAS, P256; Boser B.

Retrieving right informations from these servers is challenging and, sometimes, this is very time consuming. Current medical technology do not provide a smart methodology classification of such documents based on their content. In this work the radiological structured reports are analysed classified and assigning an appropriate label. The text classifier is used to label a mammographic structured report. The experimental data are real clinical report coming from a hospital server. Analysing the structured report content, the classifier labels the patient structured report as healthy or pathological. The present work uses Information Retrieval techniques to improve the classification process. These technique provide a light semantic analysis to remove negative terms, a removing stop-word step and, finally, a thesaurus is used to uniform used words. The structured reports are classified using a Bayes Naive Classifier. The experimental results provide interesting performance in terms of specificity and sensibility. Others two indexes are computed in order to assess system's robustness: these are the A(z) (Area under Curve ROC) and sigma(Az) (A(z) standard error).

The detection of the position of the golf club was performed using a computer vision technique followed by the estimation algorithm Darwinian particle swarm optimization to obtain a kinematical model of each trial. The estimated parameters of the models were subsequently used as sample of five classification algorithms: (a) linear discriminant analysis, (b) quadratic discriminant analysis, (c) naive Bayes with normal distribution, (d) naive Bayes with kernel smoothing density estimate, and (e) least squares support vector machines. Beyond testing the performance of each classification method, it was also possible to identify a putting signature that characterized each golf player. It may be concluded that these methods can be applied to the study of coordination and motor control on the putting performance, allowing for the analysis of the intra- and interpersonal variability of motor behavior in performance contexts.

In wireless sensor networks, the cognitive radio technology enables sensor nodes to occupy licensed band in opportunistic manner and introduces advantages of improving spectrum utilization and increasing system throughput. By considering the opportunistic spectrum access nature, in this paper, we aim to provide a stable path selection scheme for cognitive radio sensor networks. The proposed routing protocol utilizes priori delivery information and derives a novel routing metric for the optimal path selection. The routing metric is derived from naive Bayes inference and used to indicate the path stability by means of delivery probability. We show through extensive simulations that the proposed routing protocol is efficient to find the most probable delivery path and increase the system throughput.

In consideration of the associations of properties, an improved method that is classification algorithm for Naive Bayes based on validity and correlation (CANBBVC) is proposed to delete more noise samples with validity and correlation, thus resulting in better classification performance. Experimental results show this model has higher classification accuracy comparing the one based on validity solely.

PSO for Feature Construction and Binary Classification	GECCO'13: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2013 GENETIC AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	15th Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO)	JUL 06-10, 2013	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	Assoc Comp Machinery, Special Interest Grp Genet & Evolutionary Computat (ACM SIGEVO)		Particle swarm optimisation; feature construction; binary classification	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHMS; REDUCTION	In classification, the quality of the data representation significantly influences the performance of a classification algorithm. Feature construction can improve the data representation by constructing new high-level features. Particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is a powerful search technique, but has never been applied to feature construction. This paper proposes a PSO based feature construction approach (PSOFC) to constructing a single new high-level feature using original low-level features and directly addressing binary classification problems without using any classification algorithm. Experiments have been conducted on seven datasets of varying difficulty. Three classification algorithms (decision trees, naive bayes, and k-nearest neighbours) are used to evaluate the performance of the constructed feature on test set. Experimental results show that a classification algorithm using the single constructed feature often achieves similar (or even better) classification performance than using all the original features, and in almost all cases, adding the constructed feature to the original features significantly improves its classification performance. In most cases, PSOFC as a classification algorithm (using the constructed feature only) achieves better classification performance than a classification algorithm using all the original features, but needs much less computational cost. This paper represents the first study on using PSO for feature construction in classification.

HRCT findings of ILDs are classified into several categories (e.g. consolidation, emphysema, ground glass, nodular etc.) based on their texture like appearances. Therefore, analysis of ILDs is considered as a texture analysis problem. Many approaches have been proposed for CBIR of lung images using texture as primitive visual content. This paper presents a new approach to CBIR for ILDs. The proposed approach makes use of a trained neural network (NN) to find the output class label of query image. The degree of confidence of the NN classifier is analyzed using Naive Bayes classifier that dynamically takes a decision on the size of the search space to be used for retrieval. The proposed approach is compared with three simple distance based and one classifier based texture retrieval approaches. Experimental results show that the proposed technique achieved highest average percentage precision of 92.60% with lowest standard deviation of 20.82%.

Automatic Detection and Segmentation of Ischemic Lesions in Computed Tomography Images of Stroke Patients	MEDICAL IMAGING 2013: COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging - Computer-Aided Diagnosis	FEB 12-14, 2013	Lake Buena Vista, FL	SPIE, Aeroflex Inc, Univ Cent Florida, CREOL Coll Opt & Photon, DQE Instruments Inc, Medtronic Inc, PIXELTEQ			BRAIN IMAGES; VALIDATION	Stroke is the third most common cause of death in developed countries. Clinical trials are currently investigating whether advanced Computed Tomography can be of benefit for diagnosing stroke at the acute phase. These trials are based on large patients cohorts that need to be manually annotated to obtain a reference standard of tissue loss at follow-up, resulting in extensive workload for the radiologists. Therefore, there is a demand for accurate and reliable automatic lesion segmentation methods. This paper presents a novel method for the automatic detection and segmentation of ischemic lesions in CT images. The method consists of multiple sequential stages. In the initial stage, pixel classification is performed using a naive Bayes classifier in combination with a tissue homogeneity algorithm in order to localize ischemic lesion candidates. In the next stage, the candidates are segmented using a marching cubes algorithm. Regional statistical analysis is used to extract features based on local information as well as contextual information from the contra-lateral hemisphere. Finally, the extracted features are summarized into a likelihood of ischemia by a supervised classifier. An area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 0.91 was obtained for the identification of ischemic lesions. The method performance on lesion segmentation reached a Dice similarity coeficient (DSC) of 0.74 +/- 0.09, whereas an independent human observer obtained a DSC of 0.79 +/- 0.11 in the same dataset. The experiments showed that it is feasible to automatically detect and segment ischemic lesions in CT images, obtaining a comparable performance as human observers.

Automatic screening for DR has shown to be an efficient and cost-effective way to lower the burden on the healthcare system, by triaging diabetic patients and ensuring timely care for those presenting with DR. Several supervised algorithms have been developed to detect pathologies related to DR, but little work has been done in determining the size of the training set that optimizes an algorithm's performance. In this paper we analyze the effect of the training sample size on the performance of a top-down DR screening algorithm for different types of statistical classifiers. Results are based on partial least squares (PLS), support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and Naive Bayes classifiers. Our dataset consisted of digital retinal images collected from a total of 745 cases (595 controls, 150 with DR). We varied the number of normal controls in the training set, while keeping the number of DR samples constant, and repeated the procedure 10 times using randomized training sets to avoid bias. Results show increasing performance in terms of area under the ROC curve (AUC) when the number of DR subjects in the training set increased, with similar trends for each of the classifiers. Of these, PLS and k-NN had the highest average AUC. Lower standard deviation and a flattening of the AUC curve gives evidence that there is a limit to the learning ability of the classifiers and an optimal number of cases to train on.

Among these, shared health related information might be used to infer health status and incidence rates for specific conditions or symptoms. In this work, we evaluate the use of Twitter messages and search engine query logs to estimate the incidence rate of influenza like illness in Portugal. Based on a classified dataset of 2704 tweets from Portugal, we obtained a precision of 0.78 and an F-measure of 0.83 for a Naive Bayes classifier with 650 textual features. We obtained a Pearson's correlation ratio of 0.89 (p < 0.001) between health-monitoring data from the Influenzanet project and the prediction by a multiple linear regression model, using as predictors the relative frequencies estimated from the classifier output and from query logs.

The purpose of this work is to prevent child accidents such as unintentional injuries at home. In order to prevent child accidents in the home and reduce efforts of parents, we present a new safety management system for babies and children. We collected labeled accelerometer data from babies as they performed daily activities which are standing still, standing up, sitting down, walking, toddling, crawling, climbing up, climbing down, stopping, wiggling, and rolling. In order to recognize daily activities, mean, standard deviation, and slope of time-domain features are calculated over sliding windows. In addition, the FFT analysis is adopted to extract frequency-domain features of the aggregated data, and then energy and correlation of acceleration data are calculated. We used the resulting training data to induce a predictive model for activity recognition. Naive Bayes, Bayes Net, Support Vector Machine, k- Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Decision Table, Multilayer Perceptron, Logistic classifiers are tested on these features. Classification results using training and eight classifiers were compared. The overall accuracy of activity recognition was 96.2% using only a single wearable triaxial accelerometer sensor with the k- Nearest Neighbor.

To obtain these measurements, accurate brain tissue segmentation is needed. We propose a novel method for automatic segmentation of cortical grey matter (CoGM), unmyelinated white matter (UWM), myelinated white matter (MWM), basal ganglia and thalami, brainstem, cerebellum, ventricles, and cerebrospinal fluid in the extracerebral space (CSF) in MRI scans of the brain in preterm infants. For this project, seven preterm born infants, scanned at term equivalent age were used. Axial T1- and T2-weighted scans were acquired with 3T MRI scanner. The automatic segmentation was performed in three subsequent stages where each tissue was labeled. First, a multi-atlas-based segmentation (MAS) was employed to obtain localized, subject specific spatially varying priors for each tissue. Next, based on these priors, two-class classification with k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier was performed to obtain the segmentation of each tissue type separately. Last, to refine the final result, and to achieve the segmentation along the tissue boundaries, a multiclass naive Bayes classifier was employed. The results were evaluated against the manually set reference standard and quantified in terms of Dice coefficient (DC) and modified Hausdorff distance (MHD), defined as 95th-percentile of the Hausdorff distance. On average, the method achieved the following DCs: 0.87 for CoGM, 0.91 for UWM, 0.60 for MWM, 0.93 for basal ganglia and thalami, 0.87 for brainstem, 0.94 for cerebellum, 0.86 for ventricles, 0.82 for CSF. The obtained average MHDs were 0.48 mm, 0.44 mm, 3.09 mm, 0.39 mm, 0.62 mm, 0.35 mm, 1.75 mm, 1.13 mm, for each tissue, respectively. The proposed methods achieved high segmentation accuracy for all tissues, except for MWM, and it provides a tool for quantification of brain tissue volumes in axial MRI scans of preterm born infants.

We propose a new affective sensing approach to evaluate the computer user's affective states as they transition from "relaxation" to "stress," through processing the PD signal. Wavelet denoising and Kalman filtering were used to preprocess the PD signal. Then, three features were extracted from it and five classification algorithms were used to evaluate the overall performance of the identification of "stress" states in the computer users, achieving an average accuracy of 83.16 percent, with the highest accuracy of 84.21 percent reached with a Multilayer Perceptron and a Naive Bayes classifier. The Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) signal was also analyzed to study the comparative efficiency of affective sensing through the PD signal. We compared the discriminating power of the three features derived from the preprocessed PD signal to three features derived from the preprocessed GSR signal in terms of their Receiver Operating Characteristic curves. The results confirm that the PD signal should be considered a powerful physiological factor to involve in future automated affective classification systems for human-computer interaction.

J	Feng, PM; Lin, H; Chen, W				Feng, Peng-Mian; Lin, Hao; Chen, Wei			Identification of Antioxidants from Sequence Information Using Naive Bayes	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							LABEL LEARNING CLASSIFIER; AMINO-ACID-COMPOSITION; SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION; MEMBRANE-PROTEINS; CHOUS PSEAAC; PREDICTION; SITES	Antioxidant proteins are substances that protect cells from the damage caused by free radicals. Accurate identification of new antioxidant proteins is important in understanding their roles in delaying aging. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop computational methods to identify antioxidant proteins. In this study, a Naive Bayes-based method was proposed to predict antioxidant proteins using amino acid compositions and dipeptide compositions. In order to remove redundant information, a novel feature selection technique was employed to single out optimized features. In the jackknife test, the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 66.88% for the discrimination between antioxidant and nonantioxidant proteins, which is superior to that of other state-of-the-art classifiers. These results suggest that the proposed method could be an effective and promising high-throughput method for antioxidant protein identification.

Single and hybrid classification techniques are applied to construct models for PPP project dispute prediction. The single classification techniques utilized are multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks, decision trees (DTs), support vector machines, the naive Bayes classifier, and k-nearest neighbor. Two types of hybrid learning models are developed. One combines clustering and classification techniques and the other combines multiple classification techniques. Experimental results indicate that hybrid models outperform single models in prediction accuracy, Type I and II errors, and the receiver operating characteristic curve. Additionally, the hybrid model combining multiple classification techniques perform better than that combining clustering and classification techniques. Particularly, the MLP + MLP and DT + DT models perform best and second best, achieving prediction accuracies of 97.08% and 95.77%, respectively. This study demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of hybrid machine learning techniques for early prediction of dispute occurrence using conceptual project information as model input. The models provide a proactive warning and decision-support information needed to select the appropriate resolution strategy before a dispute occurs.

Comparing predictions made by a prediction model, clinical score, and physicians Pediatric asthma exacerbations in the emergency department	APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Asthma; pediatrics; emergency medical services; decision support techniques	RESPIRATORY ASSESSMENT MEASURE; DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; SEVERITY SCORE; MANAGEMENT; CARE; ALGORITHMS; GUIDELINES; ACCURACY; CHILDREN	Background: Asthma exacerbations are one of the most common medical reasons for children to be brought to the hospital emergency department (ED). Various prediction models have been proposed to support diagnosis of exacerbations and evaluation of their severity. Objectives: First, to evaluate prediction models constructed from data using machine learning techniques and to select the best performing model. Second, to compare predictions from the selected model with predictions from the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) score, and predictions made by ED physicians. Design: A two-phase study conducted in the ED of an academic pediatric hospital. In phase 1 data collected prospectively using paper forms was used to construct and evaluate five prediction models, and the best performing model was selected. In phase 2 data collected prospectively using a mobile system was used to compare the predictions of the selected prediction model with those from PRAM and ED physicians. Measurements: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and accuracy in phase 1; accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values in phase 2. Results: In phase 1 prediction models were derived from a data set of 240 patients and evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. A naive Bayes (NB) model demonstrated the best performance and it was selected for phase 2. Evaluation in phase 2 was conducted on data from 82 patients. Predictions made by the NB model were less accurate than the PRAM score and physicians (accuracy of 70.7%, 73.2% and 78.0% respectively), however, according to McNemar's test it is not possible to conclude that the differences between predictions are statistically significant. Conclusion: Both the PRAM score and the NB model were less accurate than physicians. The NB model can handle incomplete patient data and as such may complement the PRAM score. However, it requires further research to improve its accuracy.	[Farion, K. J.] Childrens Hosp Eastern Ontario, Div Emergency Med, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L1, Canada; [Farion, K.

In this paper, we attempt to predict toxicity of compounds using computational techniques, where results from certain in vitro assays applied on 309 chemicals, along with computed properties of chemicals are used to predict the toxicity caused by them at a particular endpoint. We show that both Random Forest (RF) and Naive Bayes (NB) have a good performance. We also show that using small and related trees in RF helps to further improve the performance.

The Agent is expected to guide Meeting Scheduling Agents to select appropriate negotiation strategies to resolve or avoid meeting conflicts via automated negotiation. We view scheduling as a strategic agreement problem. In a strategic environment, strategies play crucial role concluding negotiation process and bring a possible win-win result. The proposed Agent is designed using model-based, goal-based methodology that uses special communication protocol guided by simultaneous response protocol. Naive Bayes model of Maximum Likelihood Estimation is used for evaluating meeting invitation subjected to user preference, participant's importance for the meeting, schedule availability and hence guide meeting scheduling agents to select appropriate negotiation strategies.

A probabilistic model based Bayes' classifier is implemented to classify the current operation state of the ShipBoard Power System (SPS), depending upon the power system readiness for critical contingencies. Real power, reactive power, and generator status are taken as input features for the algorithm. Loss of vital/non-vital load is calculated by solving optimal power flow (OPF) to help build the knowledge base. Training data are updated online to increase the accuracy of the proposed approach. The characterization of the operation states helps the shipboard power management system to take the appropriate control action. Initial results from tests are presented and the outcomes from the particular techniques are discussed. Moreover, we also present RTDS based experimental framework towards the ongoing research on overall management system including the diagnosis support. Naive Bayes' approach has classified the system states with 97.67% accuracy to new instances. Preliminary results show the computation time of this approach is in the order of 25 ms.

Researchers have long been committed applying statistical and data processing tools to spice up data analysis on large data sets. Health problem identification is one in every of the applications where data mining tools are proving flourishing results. Uterus Fibroid diagnosis and Prognosis square measure two medical applications cause a good challenge to the researchers. The employment of machine learning and method techniques has revolutionized the entire process of Fibroid diagnosis and Prognosis. The diagnosis of fibroid present within the different parts of the female internal reproductive organ distinguishes it's eliminated or detain the female internal reproductive organ. Fibroid Prognosis predicts once Fibroid is probably going to recur in patients that have had their cancers excised. Thus, these two issues are mainly within the scope of the classification issues. This study paper summarizes numerous data mining techniques, review and technical articles on Fibroid diagnosis and prognosis. During this paper we tend to present an outline of the present research being carried out using the data mining techniques to reinforce the Fibroid diagnosis and prognosis.	[Girija, D.

Sensitivity and specificity of machine learning classifiers and spectral domain OCT for the diagnosis of glaucoma	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article						Machine learning classifiers; Optical coherence tomography; Sensitivity; Specificity; Spectral domain	OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY; NERVE-FIBER LAYER; STRATUS OCT; PERIMETRY; EYES; THICKNESS; NETWORK	PURPOSE. To investigate the sensitivity and specificity of machine learning classifiers (MLC) and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) for the diagnosis of glaucoma. METHODS. Sixty-two patients with early to moderate glaucomatous visual field damage and 48 healthy individuals were included. All subjects underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination, achromatic standard automated perimetry, and RNFL imaging with SD-OCT (Cirrus HD-OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, California, USA). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were obtained for all SD-OCT parameters. Subsequently, the following MLCs were tested: Classification Tree (CTREE), Random Forest (RAN), Bagging (BAG), AdaBoost M1 (ADA), Ensemble Selection (ENS), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), Naive-Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Areas under the ROC curves (aROCs) obtained for each parameter and each MLC were compared. RESULTS. The mean age was 57.0 +/- 9.2 years for healthy individuals and 59.9 +/- 9.0 years for glaucoma patients (p=0.103). Mean deviation values were -4.1 +/- 2.4 dB for glaucoma patients and -1.5 +/- 1.6 dB for healthy individuals (p<0.001). The SD-OCT parameters with the greater aROCs were inferior quadrant (0.813), average thickness (0.807), 7 o'clock position (0.765), and 6 o'clock position (0.754). The aROCs from classifiers varied from 0.785 (ADA) to 0.818 (BAG). The aROC obtained with BAG was not significantly different from the aROC obtained with the best single SD-OCT parameter (p=0.93). CONCLUSIONS. The SD-OCT showed good diagnostic accuracy in a group of patients with early glaucoma. In this series, MLCs did not improve the sensitivity and specificity of SD-OCT for the diagnosis of glaucoma.

Data Preparation by CFS an Essential approach for decision making using C 4.5 for Medical data mining	2013 THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMPUTING & COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ACCT 2013)	International Conference on Advanced Computing & Communication Technologies		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Technologies (ACCT)	APR 06-07, 2013	Rohtak, INDIA	RG Educ Soc, IEEE Comp Soc, Mittal Web Solut		CFS; DataMining; Trauma; GCS; CFS	FEATURE-SELECTION; TREES	Trauma has become the leading cause of death in day to day life. Every year millions of people die and many more are handicapped due to various types of accidents caused by Trauma and many people become handicapped for the rest of their lives. It is necessary to develop a tool for predicting and preventing trauma. Reducing mortality rate and increasing the Health awareness is the aim. We have used the data mining process, to extract the useful data from large datasets. Feature subset selection is of immense importance in the field of data mining. The increased dimensionality of data makes testing and training of general classification method difficult. Mining on the reduced set of attributes reduces computation time and also helps to make the patterns easier to understand. The CFS approach for feature selection is proposed. As a part of feature selection step we used filter approach algorithm as random search technique for subset generation, wrapped with different classifiers/induction algorithm namely decision tree C 4.5, Naive Bayes, as subset evaluating mechanism on standard datasets. It is mandatory to obtain ethical and legal clearance from regional as well as Institutional Ethics Review Board (IERB), before using data mining tools in health care research. We got Ethical clearance from BGS Hospital for using the datasets. These datasets were gathered from the patient files which were recorded in the medical record section of the BGS Hospital Bangalore. Further the relevant attributes identified by proposed filter are validated using classifiers. Experimental results illustrate, employing feature subset selection using proposed filter approach has enhanced classification accuracy. Applying [DM] techniques to the data brings about very interesting and valuable results. It is concluded that in this case, comparing the result of evaluating the models on test set, decision tree works better than NaiveBayes. In this paper, we have also used WEKA Tool for creating the models.	[Ashwinkumar, U.

In this sense, artificial intelligence models are used to determine pitting corrosion behaviour of stainless steel. This work presents the C-MANTEC constructive neural network algorithm as an automatic system to determine the status pitting corrosion of that alloy. Several classification techniques are compared with our proposal: Linear Discriminant Analysis, k-Nearest Neighbor, Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes. The results obtained show the robustness and higher performance of the C-MANTEC algorithm in comparison to the other artificial intelligence models, corroborating the utility of the constructive neural networks paradigm in the modelling pitting corrosion problem.

As the Internet grows, the security limitations are becoming more crucial, facing such threats. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a common protecting systems that is used to detect malicious activity from inside and outside users of a system. It is very important to increase detection accuracy rate as possible, and get more information about the detected attacks, as one of the drawbacks of an anomaly IDS is the lack of detected attacks information. In this paper, an IDS is built using Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature selection, then some classification techniques are applied on the detected anomalies to define their classes. The results show that J48 mostly give better results than other classifiers, but for certain attacks Naive Bayes give the best results.

We have implemented SentiWordNet approach with different variations of linguistic features, scoring schemes and aggregation thresholds. We used two pre-existing large datasets of Movie Reviews and two Blog post datasets on revolutionary changes in Libya and Tunisia. We have computed sentiment polarity and also its strength for both movie reviews and blog posts. The paper also presents an evaluative account of performance of the SentiWordNet approach with two popular machine learning approaches: Naive Bayes and SVM for sentiment classification. The comparative performance of the approaches for both movie reviews and blog posts is illustrated through standard performance evaluation metrics of Accuracy, F-measure and Entropy.	[Singh, V.

Continuous tracking of these devices provides an opportunity to verify the identity of a user, based on a profile of behavioral biometrics from the user's previous interaction with these devices. We propose a bank of sensors, each feeding a binary detector (trying to distinguish the authentic user from all others). In this study the detectors use features derived from the keyboard and the mouse, and their decisions are fused to develop a global authentication decision. The binary classification of the individual features is developed using Naive Bayes Classifiers which play the role of local detectors in a parallel binary decision fusion architecture. The conclusion of each classifier ('authentic user' or 'other') is sent to a Decision Fusion Center (DFC) where we use the Neyman-Pearson criterion to maximize the probability of detection under an upper bound on the probability of false alarms. We compute the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of the resulting detection scheme, and use the ROC to assess the contribution of each individual sensor to the quality of the global decision on user authenticity. In this manner we identify the characteristics (and local detectors) that are most significant to the development of correct user authentication. While the false accept rate (FAR) and false reject rate (FRR) are fixed for the local sensors, the fusion center provides trade-off between the two global error rates, and allows the designer to fix an operating point based on hislher tolerance level of false alarms. We test our approach on a real-world dataset collected from 10 office workers, who worked for a week in an office environment as we tracked their keyboard dynamics and mouse movements during interaction with laptops and desktop computers.

Face recognition system based on feature extration	2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION COMMUNICATION AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS (ICICES)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Information Communication and Embedded Systems (ICICES)	FEB 21-22, 2013	Chennai, INDIA			Automatic face recognition system(afrs); thresholding; scale invariant feature transform(sift); modified feature discriminant analysis; naives bayes classifier		Automatic face recognition system has been facing problems in recognizing subjects of varying ages. Age invariant recognition has been of great use in tracking people database especially in public domain systems like driving license, passport, and criminal records etc., this paper deals with a forensic face recognition which is robust to changes in age, pose, expression and illumination. It has a pre-processing stage in which all the background information including the hairy parts in the face is removed by thresholding. After preprocessing the thresholded image is divided into macro blocks. The scale invariant feature points are extracted from all the blocks by means of Scale Invariant Feature Transform. These extracted feature points are further refined by Taylor transformation technique and dominant orientation is assigned to every feature point. The common features between the blocks are grouped by means of Feature Discriminate Analysis. These features are classified with the ferns from the database by means of Naive Bayes Classifier. This approach tends to give more robustness to pose and expression variations thereby improved accuracy of 60% in FG NET database compared to other probabilistic approaches with a trade off in processing time.

Malware authors often use encryption/compression methods to conceal their malicious executables data and code. These methods that transform some or all of the original bytes into a series of random looking data bytes appear in 80 to 90% of malware samples. This fact creates special challenges for anti-virus scanners who use static and dynamic methods to analyze large malware collections. In this paper we propose a method to identify malware executables by reading initial 2500 byte patterns of the sample. Our method reduces overall scanner execution time by considering 2500 bytes instead of whole file. Experimental results are evaluated using different classification algorithms (Random Forest, Ada-Boost, IBK, J48, Naive-Bayes) followed by a feature selection method.

Tactile data were collected using a biomimetic fingertip sensor. We propose a control architecture that implements a perception-action cycle for the exploratory procedure, which allows the fingertip to react to tactile contact whilst regulating the applied contact force. In addition, the fingertip is actively repositioned to an optimal position to ensure accurate perception. The method is trained off-line and then the testing performed on-line based on contour following around several different test shapes. We then implement object recognition based on the extracted shapes. Our active approach is compared with a passive approach, demonstrating that active perception is necessary for successful contour following and hence shape recognition.

However, current machine learning approaches are either too complex or perform poorly. Here, a novel two-step machine-learning framework is presented to address this need. First, a Naive Bayes estimator is used to rank features from which the top-ranked will most likely contain the most informative features for prediction of the underlying biological classes. The top-ranked features are then used in a Hidden Naive Bayes classifier to construct a classification prediction model from these filtered attributes. In order to obtain the minimum set of the most informative biomarkers, the bottom-ranked features are successively removed from the Naive Bayes-filtered feature list one at a time, and the classification accuracy of the Hidden Naive Bayes classifier is checked for each pruned feature set. The performance of the proposed two-step Bayes classification framework was tested on different types of -omics datasets including gene expression microarray, single nucleotide polymorphism microarray (SNParray), and surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) proteomic data. The proposed two-step Bayes classification framework was equal to and, in some cases, outperformed other classification methods in terms of prediction accuracy, minimum number of classification markers, and computational time.
