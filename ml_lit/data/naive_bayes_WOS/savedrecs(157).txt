In this paper, we introduce a remote health care system, which is composed of a wireless vital sensor, multiple receivers and a triage engine installed in a desktop personal computer (PC). The middleware installed in the receiver, which was developed in C++, supports reliable data handling of vital data to the ethernet port. On the other hand, the human interface of the triage engine, which was developed in JAVA, shows graphics on his/her ECG data, 3D acceleration data, body surface temperature data and behavior status in the display of the desktop PC and sends an urgent e-mail containing the display data to a pre-registered medical doctor when it detects the occurrence of an abnormal event. In the triage engine, the lethal arrhythmia detection algorithm based on short time Fourier transform (STFT) analysis can achieve 100 % sensitivity and 99.99 % specificity, and the behavior recognition algorithm based on the combination of the nearest neighbor method and the Naive Bayes method can achieve more than 71 % classification accuracy.

Though online SVM classifier gives high classification performance on online spam filtering on large benchmark data sets, its computational cost turns out to be very expensive for other faster methods such as Naive Bayes on large-scale application. We use information gain based feature selection method to reduce feature vector dimension of online SVM filter in this paper. Experimental results illustrate that the method improves the filter performance a little and greatly reduces the computational cost of online SVM filter.

This method is based on vector quantization of invariant descriptors of 3D-object patches. We analyze the performance of two well-known classifiers: the Naive Bayes and the SVM. The results show the effectiveness of our approach and prove that the method is robust to non-rigid and deformable shapes, in which the class of transformations may be very wide due to the capability of such shapes to bend and assume different forms.

As genome-wide DNA sequencing is getting more affordable, more dense genotyping is performed and accuracy is increased. Therefore, health public services may consider the results of this approach in their preventing plans and physicians be encouraged to perform these risk tests. A web-based tool has been built for risk assessing of complex diseases and its knowledge base is currently filled with multiple sclerosis risk variants and their effect on the disease. The genetic profiling is calculated by using a Naive Bayes network, which it has been shown to provide highly accurate results as long as dense genotyping, haplotype reconstruction and several markers at a time are considered.

The early detection of AD has become one of the principal focuses of research, and its diagnosis is fundamental when the disease is incipient or even prodromic, because it is at these stages when treatments are more effective. There are numerous research studies to characterise the disease in these stages, and we have used the specific research carried out by Drs. Herminia Peraita and Lina Grasso. The application of Artificial Intelligence techniques, such as Bayesian Networks and Influence Diagrams, may provide a very valuable contribution both to the very research and the application of results. This article justifies using Bayesian Networks and Influence Diagrams to solve this type of problems and because of their great contribution to this application field. The modelling techniques used for constructing the Bayesian Network are mentioned in this article, and a mechanism for automatic learning of the model parameters is established.			josemaria.guerrero@cpiia.org	Ferrandez, Jose Manuel/C-9378-2009	Ferrandez, Jose Manuel/0000-0002-4613-6101			Arias-Calleja M., 2009, CARMEN HERRAMIENTA S; Bottcher S.

In literature, numbers of novel feature extraction and representation methods have been proposed. However, many of them only focus on specific domain problems. In this article, we introduce a novel distance-based feature extraction method for various pattern classification problems. Specifically, two distances are extracted, which are based on (1) the distance between the data and its intra-cluster center and (2) the distance between the data and its extra-cluster centers. Experiments based on ten datasets containing different numbers of classes, samples, and dimensions are examined. The experimental results using naive Bayes, k-NN, and SVM classifiers show that concatenating the original features provided by the datasets to the distance-based features can improve classification accuracy except image-related datasets. In particular, the distance-based features are suitable for the datasets which have smaller numbers of classes, numbers of samples, and the lower dimensionality of features. Moreover, two datasets, which have similar characteristics, are further used to validate this finding. The result is consistent with the first experiment result that adding the distance-based features can improve the classification performance.

The aim of this work is to use a new fuzzy immune rule-based classification system for a medical diagnosis of a cardiovascular disease. In this study, fuzzy immune approach (FIA), which can be improved by ours, is a new method and firstly, it is applied to ECG dataset. The performance of the proposed approach, in terms of classification accuracy, ROC curves, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) was compared with traditional classifier schemes: C4.5, Naive Bayes, KStar, Meta END, and ANN. The classification accuracies and AUC statistics of PEA for the data sets used are the highest among the classifiers reported on the UCI website and other classifiers used for related problems and tested by cross validation.

The inference of a GRN from gene expression data (the GRN reverse engineering), is a challenging task that requires the exploitation of diverse mathematical and computational techniques. The DREAM conference proposes several challenges about the inference of biological networks and/or the prediction of how they are influenced by perturbations. This paper describes a method for GRN reverse engineering that the authors submitted to the 2010 DREAM challenge. The methodology is based on a combination of well known statistical methods into a Naive Bayes classifier. Despite its simplicity the approach fared fairly well when compared to other proposals on real networks.

The traditional Naive Bayes text categorization directly uses term frequency to describe the relationship between words and categories. In deed, there are many words with high frequency do not have a close relevance with the category. To solve this problem, we introduce cloud model theory into Naive Bayes text classification and build a new feature selection system. By using numerical characteristics of cloud, we obtain more representative features. Experimental results on 20 Newsgroups show that our method can improve accuracy of text categorization remarkably.

Alternatively, we restrict the number of parents of a node in a Bayesian network classifier by computing the strength of relations between this node and others. The measure method is carried out with conditional mutual information testing, for it has a property of additive decomposition of itself. Moreover, we propose a Local Score-Search algorithm (LSS) for Bayesian network classifier learning. Comparing with the fixed number algorithms, experimental results obtained have shown that LSS is more effective on average of classification error rate.

Artificial neural network and naive Bayesian classifiers were trained with data from single and multiple subjects and their ability to discriminate among three difficulty conditions was tested. When trained on data from multiple subjects, both types of classifiers poorly discriminated between the three levels. However, a novel model, the naive Bayesian classifier with a hidden node, performed nearly as well as the models trained and tested on individuals. In addition, a hierarchical Bayes model with a higher level constraint on the hidden node can further improve its performance.

Building on our previous successful approach that enhanced the harmonic parts by means of Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for increased accuracy, we integrate on the one hand a new source separation algorithm specifically tailored to extracting the leading voice from monaural recordings. On the other hand, we introduce Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (BLSTM-RNNs) as context-sensitive classifiers for this scenario, which have lately led to great success in Music Information Retrieval tasks. Through a combination of leading voice separation and BLSTM networks, as opposed to a baseline approach using Hidden Naive Bayes on the original recordings, the accuracy of simultaneous detection of vocal presence and vocalist gender on beat level is improved by up to 10% absolute. Furthermore, using this technique we achieve 91.6% accuracy in determining the gender of the predominant vocalist on song level, which is 4% absolute above our previous best result.

The formulas used for probabilistic record linkage have been recognized by some as being equivalent to the naive Bayes classifier. While this method can produce useful results, it is not difficult to improve accuracy by using one of a host of other machine learning or neural network algorithms. Even a simple single-layer perceptron tends to outperform the naive Bayes classifier-and thus traditional probabilistic record linkage methods-by a substantial margin. Furthermore, many record linkage system use simple field comparisons rather than more complex features, partially due to the limits of the probabilistic formulas they use. This paper presents an overview of probabilistic record linkage, shows how to cast it in machine learning terms, and then shows that it is equivalent to a naive Bayes classifier. It then discusses how to use more complex features than simple field comparisons, and shows how probabilistic record linkage formulas can be modified to handle this. Finally, it demonstrates a huge improvement in accuracy through the use of neural networks and higher-level matching features, compared to traditional probabilistic record linkage on a large (80,000 pair) set of labeled pairs of genealogical records used by FamilySearch.org.

Statistical features are obtained from of a set of neighboring voxels without using any computation that requires hard labeling of grey matter and white matter tissues. The significance of the proposed features is quantitatively evaluated with a Naive Bayes probabilistic approach, which is used for classification, and experiments are conducted on a total of 21 subjects with FCD lesions.

Classifiers can do a good job in achieving accurate mechanism classification of glycoside hydrolases which have different physicochemical properties. This classification method is not limited by reaction conditions. In this paper, a new method is proposed to classify the catalytic mechanism of a certain glycoside hydrolase according to their sequence and structure features by using several classifiers. Through making a comparison of the classification results achieved by the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier and the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier and Multi layer Perceptron (MLP)classifier, the kNN classifier is approved to be an ideal choice in classifying and predicting the catalytic mechanisms of glycoside hydrolases with various physicochemical properties.

Know Your Data: Understanding Implicit Usage versus Explicit Action in Video Content Classification	MULTIMEDIA ON MOBILE DEVICES 2011 AND MULTIMEDIA CONTENT ACCESS: ALGORITHMS AND SYSTEMS V	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Multimedia on Mobile Devices and Multimedia Content Access - Algorithms and Systems V	JAN 25-26, 2011	San Francisco, CA	SPIE, Soc Imaging Sci & Technol (IS & T)		Video; Social; Categorization; YouTube; Naive Bayes; Classification		In this paper, we present a method for video category classification using only social metadata from websites like YouTube. In place of content analysis, we utilize communicative and social contexts surrounding videos as a means to determine a categorical genre, e. g. Comedy, Music. We hypothesize that video clips belonging to different genre categories would have distinct signatures and patterns that are reflected in their collected metadata. In particular, we define and describe social metadata as usage or action to aid in classification. We trained a Naive Bayes classifier to predict categories from a sample of 1,740 YouTube videos representing the top five genre categories. Using just a small number of the available metadata features, we compare the classifications produced by our Naive Bayes classifier with those provided by the uploader of that particular video. Compared to random predictions with the YouTube data (21% accurate), our classifier attained a mediocre 33% accuracy in predicting video genres. However, we found that the accuracy of our classifier significantly improves by nominal factoring of the explicit data features. By factoring the ratings of the videos in the dataset, the classifier was able to accurately predict the genres of 75% of the videos. We argue that the patterns of social activity found in the metadata are not just meaningful in their own right, but are indicative of the meaning of the shared video content. The results presented by this project represents a first step in investigating the potential meaning and significance of social metadata and its relation to the media experience.

In this paper, visual data are organized into an orientation histogram to roughly express input images by extracting and cumulating straight lines according to direction angle. In addition, behavioral data are organized into a behavioral histogram by cumulating motions performed to avoid obstacles encountered while the robot is executing specified behavioral patterns. These visual and behavioral data are utilized as input data, and the probability that a place belongs to a specific class is calculated by designating the places already learnt by the robot as categories. The naive Bayes classification method is employed, in which the probability is calculated that the input data belong to each specific category, and the category with the highest probability is then selected. The location of the robot is classified by merging the probabilities for visual and behavioral data. The experimental results are as follows. First, a comparison of behavioral patterns used by the robot to collect data about a place indicates that a rotational behavior pattern provides the best performance. Second, classification performance is more accurate with two types of input data than with a single type of data.

This paper proposes a new collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on the social tagging, which try to settle the semantic gap and the cold start problems of traditional collaborative filtering. Firstly, the communities with the similar habits are detected in the social network of the digital library. Then the candidate tags are derived from the user-book-tag correlation model. Finally, the books with highest posterior of the tags are recommended by the naive Bayes classifier. Experiments results show that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of the collaborative filtering algorithms.

The image to class distance(I2CD), with simple formulation, can tackle the intra-class variation and show the state of the art results in several datasets. This paper focuses on the performance of I2CD on Unbalanced training dataset which has not been catched much attention by I2CD researchers. Under the naive bayes assumption, when the dataset is Unbalanced, I2CD is not comparable. We propose Random Sampling I2CD to tackle the imbalanced problem, and provide an efficient approximation method to reduce the test time complexity. Experimental results show that PRSI2CD outperforms the original I2CD in imbalanced setting.

The accurate colour classification is the basis of the colour management system for dyeing products. The classification method based on Naive Bayes and its improved algorithms mostly was affected by the distribution of sample space. It was unstable when samples' attributes were not independent with each other, so the prediction accuracy dropped. A novel colour classification method based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) was proposed in this paper, which solved the classification problem by twice optimal-searching using the principle of nonlinear transformation and structural risk minimization. It obtained the input parameters, made the predicting error minimum by cross validation of sample data. Initially, the knowledge of CIE1976L*a*b* and HSV colour model was used in extracting features of colour and the classification model was discussed. Further, the theoretical knowledge of SVM and Naive Bayes algorithms were introduced. Finally, experiments Were done using sample data under four situations of random sampling, homogeneous sampling, stratified sampling and sampling with data having different attributes. Experimental results show that: 1) each attribute of colour feature doesn't have to meet the assumption of conditions independence; 2) the SVM-based classification method was not dependent on the distribution of the sample space, so it had better classification stability; 3) SVM had higher accuracy in classification especially while certain attribute of colour feature such as lightness had little effect on classification.

Opinion lexicons comprise opinion words expressing prior positive or negative sentiments. In most previous work documents are represented as bags of words and sentiment analysis has been cast a classification problem, where opinion lexicons are only used to enhance the classification models. In this paper we aim to establish the direct connection between document sentiment and opinion words in the documents. We propose two holistic approaches that consider the probability distribution of both opinion words and their polarity for analyzing document sentiment. Our extensive experiments on blogs of 12 topics show that our holistic models significantly improve baseline models using words and their polarity information separately, and is also superior to an existing approach combining both types of information.

A large-margin formulation solved by linear programming is adopted to learn sparse features on the max-similarity based image representation. The margins between the training images and the query images can be directly utilized for classification by the Naive-Bayes or the K Nearest Neighbor category classifier. Balancing between efficiency and classification accuracy is the most attractive characteristic of our approach. Efficiency lies in its on-line sparsity learning algorithm and direct usage of margins, while accuracy depends on the discriminative power of selected sparse features with their weights. We test our approach using much fewer features on Caltech-101 and Scene-15 datasets and our classification results are comparable to the state-of-the-art.

Such situations are prevalent in business processes where events consist of communications between people, such as email messages. We examine how the accuracy of an independent task identifier, such as a classification or clustering engine, can be improved by examining the currently mined process model. First, a classification scheme based on identifying the keywords in each message is presented to provide an initial labeling. We then demonstrate how these labels can be refined by considering the likelihood that the event represents a particular task as obtained via an analysis of the current representation of the process model. This process is then repeated a number of times until the model is sufficiently refined. Results show that both keyword classification and the current process model analysis can be significantly effective on their own, and when combined have the potential to correct virtually all errors when noise is low (less than 20%), and can reduce the error rate by about 85% when noise is in the 30-40% range.

J	Li, JG; Brew, C				Li, Jianguo; Brew, Chris			Class-based approach to disambiguating Levin verbs	NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING			English	Article							ROLES	Lapata and Brew (Computational Linguistics, vol. 30, 2004, pp. 295-313) (hereafter LB04) obtain from untagged texts a statistical prior model that is able to generate class preferences for ambiguous Lewin (English Verb Classes and Alternations: A Preliminary Investigation, 1993, University of Chicago Press) verbs (hereafter Levin). They also show that their informative priors, incorporated into a Naive Bayes classifier deduced from hand-tagged data (HTD), can aid in verb class disambiguation. We re-analyse LB04's prior model and show that a single factor (the joint probability of class and frame) determines the predominant class for a particular verb in a particular frame. This means that the prior model cannot be sensitive to fine-grained lexical distinctions between different individual verbs falling in the same class. We replicate LB04's supervised disambiguation experiments on large-scale data, using deep parsers rather than the shallow parser of LB04. In addition, we introduce a method for training our classifier without using HTD. This relies on knowledge of Levin class memberships to move information from unambiguous to ambiguous instances of each class. We regard this system as unsupervised because it does not rely on human annotation of individual verb instances. Although our unsupervised verb class disambiguator does not match the performance of the ones that make use of HTD, it consistently outperforms the random baseline model. Our experiments also demonstrate that the informative priors derived from untagged texts help improve the performance of the classifier trained on untagged data.

J	Min, H; Yu, S; Lee, T; Yoon, S				Min, Hyeyoung; Yu, Seunghak; Lee, Taehoon; Yoon, Sungroh			Support Vector Machine Based Classification of 3-Dimensional Protein Physicochemical Environments for Automated Function Annotation	ARCHIVES OF PHARMACAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Protein function; 3-dimensional structure; FEATURE; Dimensionality reduction; Normalization; Support vector machine	FUNCTION PREDICTION; RESIDUES; SITES; 3D	The knowledge of protein functions as well as structures is critical for drug discovery and development. The FEATURE system developed at Stanford is an effective tool for characterizing and classifying local environments in proteins. FEATURE utilizes vectors of a fixed dimension to represent the physicochemical properties around a residue. Functional sites and non-sites are identified by classifying such vectors using the Naive Bayes classifier. In this paper, we improve the FEATURE framework in several ways so that it can be more flexible, robust and accurate. The new tool can handle vectors of a user-specified dimension and can suppress noise effectively, with little loss of important signals, by employing dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, our approach utilizes the support vector machine for a more accurate classification. According to the results of our thorough experiments, the proposed new approach outperformed the original tool by 20.13% and 13.42% with respect to true and false positive rates, respectively.

J	Conway, M				Conway, Mike			Mining a corpus of biographical texts using keywords	LITERARY AND LINGUISTIC COMPUTING			English	Article								Using statistically derived keywords to characterize texts has become an important research method for digital humanists and corpus linguists in areas such as literary analysis and the exploration of genre difference. Keywords-and the associated concepts of 'keyness' and 'key-keyness'-have inspired conferences and workshops, many and varied research papers, and are central to several modern corpus processing tools. In this article, we present evidence that (at least for the task of biographical sentence classification) frequent words characterize texts better than keywords or key-keywords. Using the naive Bayes learning algorithm in conjunction with frequency-, keyword-, and key-keyword-based text representation to classify a corpus of biographical sentences, we discovered that the use of frequent words alone provided a classification accuracy better than either the keyword or key-keyword representations at a statistically significant level. This result suggests that (for the biographical sentence classification task at least) frequent words characterize texts better than keywords derived using more computationally intensive methods.

A number of common learning algorithms have been adapted for this task, including k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) and decision trees. Following this line, we propose an adaptation of the naive Bayes classification algorithm for the label ranking problem. Our main idea lies in the use of similarity between the rankings to replace the concept of probability. We empirically test the proposed method on some metalearning problems that consist of relating characteristics of learning problems to the relative performance of learning algorithms. Our method generally performs better than the baseline indicating that it is able to identify some of the underlying patterns in the data.

The elegant simplicity and apparent accuracy of naive Bayes (NB) even when the independence assumption is violated, fosters the ongoing interest in the model. Rough Sets Theory has been used for different tasks in knowledge discovery and successfully applied in many real-life problems. In this study we make use of rough sets ability, in discovering attributes dependencies, to overcome the NB un-practical assumption. We propose a new algorithm called Rough-Naive Bayes (RNB) that is expected to outperform other current NB variants. RNB is based on adjusting attributes' weights based on their dependencies and contribution to the final decision. Experimental results show that RNB can achieve better performance than NB classifier.

Helpfully, there are different approaches able to automatically detect and remove most of these messages, and the best-known ones are based on Bayesian decision theory and Support Vector Machines. However, there are several forms of Naive Bayes filters, something the anti-spam literature does not always acknowledge. In this paper, we discuss seven different versions of Naive Bayes classifiers, and compare them with the well-known Linear Support Vector Machine on six non-encoded datasets. Moreover, we propose a new measurement in order to evaluate the quality of anti-spam classifiers.

Image annotation is an important step of content-based image retrieval (CBIR), which is relevant for many real-world applications. In this paper, a new algorithm based on multiple grid segmentation, entropy-based information and a Bayesian classifier, is proposed for an efficient, yet very effective, image annotation process. The proposed approach follows a two step process. In the first step, the algorithm generates grids of different sizes and different overlaps, and each grid is classified with a Naive Bayes classifier. In a second step, we used information based on the predicted class probability, its entropy, and the entropy of the neighbors of each grid element at the same and different resolutions, as input to a second binary classifier that qualifies the initial classification to select the correct segments. This significantly reduces false positives and improves the overall performance. We performed several experiments with images from the MSRC-9 database collection, which has manual ground truth segmentation and annotation information. The results show that the proposed approach has a very good performance compared to the initial labeling, and it also improves other scheme based on multiple segmentations.

The first step of web mining is to classify web pages into interesting classes, so the classification is one of the essential techniques for web mining. In this paper, we study the capabilities of bayesian classifiers for web pages categorization, after that we report our work on the comparison of binary-classification and multi-classification. Results on benchmark dataset show that bayesian classifiers perform satisfying, especially for Hidden Naive Bayes (HNB) which is more competitive than other methods. Furthermore, the performances of binary-classification are better than those of multi-classification under the evaluation metrics of accuracy and F-measure.

J	Bylander, T				Bylander, Tom			Transforming examples for multiclass boosting	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						ensemble methods; boosting; multiclass learning; pseudoloss; Hamming loss		AdaBoost.M2 and AdaBoost. MH are boosting algorithms for learning from multiclass datasets. They have received less attention than other boosting algorithms because they require base classifiers that can handle the pseudoloss or Hamming loss, respectively. The difficulty with these loss functions is that each example is associated with k weights, where k is the number of classes. We address this issue by transforming an m-example dataset with k weights per example into a dataset with km examples and one weight per example. Minimising error on the transformed dataset is equivalent to minimising loss on the original dataset. Resampling the transformed dataset can be used for time efficiency and base classifiers that cannot handle weighted examples. We empirically apply the transformation on several multiclass datasets using naive Bayes and decision trees as base classifiers. Our experiment shows that it is competitive with AdaBoost.

EM-based Naive Bayes algorithm is often employed to argument the labeled data with the unlabeled ones. However, such an approach assumes the distributions of these two sets of data are identical, which may not hold in practice and often results in inferior performance. We propose a semi-supervised algorithm, called Ratio-Adjusted EM-based Naive Bayes (RAEMNB), for sentiment classification, which combines knowledge from a source domain and limited training instances from a target domain. In RAEMNB, the initial Bayes model is trained from labeled instances from both domains. During each EM iteration, we add an extra R-step to adjust the ratio of predicted positive instances to negative ones, which is approximated with labeled instances of target domain. Experimental results show that our RAEMNB approach outperforms the traditional supervised, semi-supervised classifiers.

This paper presents study undertaken to identify possible improvements in processing of neonatal sleep electroencephalographic recordings. The influence of segmentation, feature extraction and feature selection on the classification accuracy was examined. The total of 97 features was extracted for each EEG channel for each segment. For selection of individual features from different channels, sequential methods were used. Naive Bayes classifier was used for final classification and performance was evaluated through cross validation. Experiments show that the combination of adaptive segmentation and selected features led to better performance. Obtained results may provide a reference for developing or enhancing neonatal sleep EEG classification algorithms. Analysis was performed on real clinical data.

Considering that in learning Bayesian network classifier, estimating probabilities from a given set of training examples is crucial, and it has been proved that m-estimate can scale up the accuracy of many Bayesian classifiers. Thus, a natural question is whether FISC with m-estimate can perform even better. Response to this problem, in this paper, we aim to scale up the accuracy of FISC by m-estimate and propose new probability estimation formulas. The experimental results show that the Laplace estimate used in the original FISC performs not very well and our m-estimate can greatly scale up the accuracy, it even outperforms other outstanding Bayesian classifiers used to compare.

Neural Network-based Taxonomic Clustering for Metagenomics	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE				Metagenomic studies inherently involve sampling genetic information from an environment potentially containing thousands of distinctly different microbial organisms. This genetic information is sequenced producing many short fragments (<500 base pair (bp)); each is tentatively a small representative of the DNA coding structure. Any of the fragments may belong to any of the organisms in the sample, but the relationship is unknown a priori. Furthermore, most of these organisms have not been identified and correspondingly are not represented in any of the publicly available search databases. Our goal is to be able to predict the taxonomic classification of an organism based on the fragments obtained from an environmental sample that may include many (some previously unidentified) organisms. To elucidate the diversity and composition of the sample, we first use a supervised naive Bayes classifier to score the fragments of known genomes, followed by an unsupervised clustering to group fragments from similar organisms together. We are then free to analyze each cluster separately. This is challenging since we are not interested in similar sequences, but sequences that come from similar genomes, which are known to vary widely intra-genomically. Our dataset comprises of an extremely challenging scenario involving clustering fragments at the phyla level, where none of the phyla have been previously seen or identified. We present two variations of our proposed approach, one based on ART and K-means. We show that ART can cluster 500bp fragments from 17 novel phyla at an overall isolation/grouping that is 10% better than K-means and nearly 7 times over chance.

The Naive Bayes classifier and Logistic Regression were used to predict binding sites given transcription factor sequences. Prediction accuracy was estimated using 10-fold cross-validation. Experiments showed that the best prediction of nucleotide densities at selected site positions is obtained using only a few key protein sequence positions. These positions are stably selected by the forward feature selection based on the mutual information of factor-site position pairs.

On the server side, the information for each promotion package for a phone operator is stored as well as the usage database for each client. The client side is a user interface for both phone operators and users to enter their information. The analysis engine are based on KNN, ANN, decision tree and Naive Bayes models. For comparison, it is shown that KNN and decision outperforms the others.

It outperforms Naive Bayes, yet at the same time maintains the computational simplicity of Naive Bayes. But the existing TAN model, BL-TAN, for text categorization has the following two problems: 1) it does not take the features that do not appear in texts into account; 2) it ignores the information of word frequency. Based on the two problems, we propose two improved TAN models, BNL-TAN and MUL-TAN, where BNL-TAN considers the unappeared features and MUL-TAN uses the information of word frequency. Then, we compare the original BL-TAN with these two improved versions on Chinese and English unbalanced text datasets, respectively. Experimental results show BNL-TAN is better than BL-TAN and MUL-TAN is much better than BL-TAN and BNL-TAN. So, we conclude that word frequency of texts is very important to text categorization.

We determined a list of Swedish cue phrases marking explicitly the relations and we learned the word pairs automatically from a corpus of 60 million words. We evaluated the method by building two-way classifiers and we obtained the results: Contrast vs. Other 67.9%, CEV vs. Other 57.7%, and Elaboration vs. Other 52.2%.

In a typical scenario, multiple parties may wish to collaborate to extract interesting global information such as class labels without revealing their respective data to each other. This may be particularly useful in applications such as car selling units, medical research etc. In the proposed work, we aim to develop a global classification model based on the Naive Bayes classification scheme. The Naive Bayes classification has been used because of its simplicity and high efficiency. For privacy-preservation of the data, the concept of trusted third party with two offsets has been used. The data is first anonymized at local party end and then the aggregation and global classification is done at the trusted third party. The proposed algorithms address various types of fragmentation schemes such as horizontal, vertical and arbitrary distribution.	[Keshavamurthy, B.

Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers for classifying Databank Accession Number sentences from online biomedical articles	DOCUMENT RECOGNITION AND RETRIEVAL XVII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Document Recognition and Retrieval XVII	JAN 19-21, 2010	San Jose, CA	SPIE, IS & T (Soc Imaging Sci & Technol), Inst Telecom		Naive Bayes; Support Vector Machine (SVM); databank; labeling; text classification; bibliographic information		This paper describes two classifiers, Nave Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to classify sentences containing Databank Accession Numbers, a key piece of bibliographic information, from online biomedical articles. The correct identification of these sentences is necessary for the subsequent extraction of these numbers. The classifiers use words that occur most frequently in sentences as features for the classification. Twelve sets of word features are collected to train and test the classifiers. Each set has a different number of word features ranging from 100 to 1,200. The performance of each classifier is evaluated using four measures: Precision, Recall, F-Measure, and Accuracy. The Naive Bayes classifier shows performance above 93.91% at 200 word features for all four measures. The SVM shows 98.80% Precision at 200 word features, 94.90% Recall at 500 and 700, 96.46% F-Measure at 200, and 99.14% Accuracy at 200 and 400. To improve classification performance, we propose two merging operators, Max and Harmonic Mean, to combine results of the two classifiers. The final results show a measureable improvement in Recall, F-Measure, and Accuracy rates.

We investigate the recognition of handwritten musical notation based on three related probabilistic inference techniques: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Markov Models (MMs) and Naive Bayes (NBs). Music notes are written on a tablet. A sequence of ink patterns representing this symbol is captured and subsequently employed for constructing the models of HMMs, MMs and NBs. The proposed approach exploits both global and local information derived from ink patterns which we have demonstrated the exploitation of this information via different features employed in different HMMs. The specificity and sensitivity measures of these classification models are compared using unseen test datasets. The findings show that HMM outperformed MM and NB models, due to the ability of HMM in exploiting both transitional probability (transition matrix A) and the overall likelihood of the observed events (emission matrix B). Also, HMMs with more hidden states outperformed those with less states, since a larger model has more capacity. In conclusion, our approach demonstrated that HMM can better exploit information extracted from ink patterns than models of MM or NB, and therefore is an optimal inference technique to encoding useful information for musical notation representation.

Naive Bayes texture classification applied to whisker data from a moving robot	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE			RAT; CORTEX; DECISION; DISCRIMINATION; NEURONS	Many rodents use their whiskers to distinguish objects by surface texture. To examine possible mechanisms for this discrimination, data from an artificial whisker attached to a moving robot was used to test texture classification algorithms. This data was examined previously using a template-based classifier of the whisker vibration power spectrum [1]. Motivated by a proposal about the neural computations underlying sensory decision making [2], we classified the raw whisker signal using the related 'naive Bayes' method. The integration time window is important, with roughly 100ms of data required for good decisions and 500ms for the best decisions. For stereotyped motion, the classifier achieved hit rates of about 80% using a single ( horizontal or vertical) stream of vibration data and 90% using both streams. Similar hit rates were achieved on natural data, apart from a single case in which the performance was only about 55%. Therefore this application of naive Bayes represents a biologically motivated algorithm that can perform well in a real-world robot task.

However, NB might suffer from poor performance when its conditional independence assumption is violated. While most recent research focuses on improving NB by alleviating the conditional independence assumption, we propose a new Meta learning technique to scale up NB by assuming an altered strategy to the traditional Cascade Learning (CL).

Several existing approachs use smart outlets or detectors to acquire the information of individual appliance and recognize the operating state. However, such approachs have to install numerous devices if they want to monitor the states of all appliances. This will increase the cost and complexity of installation and maintenance. Therefore, we develop an appliance recognition system which minimizing the scope of deployment. We install smart meters at single-point, distribution board, to measure the power consumption at circuit-level. In addition, to improve the recognition accuracy of our system and detect the state changes in real time, We use dynamic baysian network to take user behavior into account and Bayes filter to perform online inference. Finally, we design several experiments to compare our approach with some commonly used classifiers, such as Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Results shows that our model outperforms these classifiers and the accuracies of all appliances are greater than 92%. Furthermore, we also compare the results of Bayes filter with Viterbi algorithm, which is an offline inference method. The difference in accuracy of every appliance between Bayes filter and Viterbi algorithm is less than 1%.

The features further employed are: the relative mean square energy, the number of maxima in the energy envelope, the pitch frequency average and the relative number of zero crossings for every utterance. This approach implies low computational requirements for features extraction and provides good recognition rates.

Simultaneously, power densities have increased resulting in greater chances of thermal anomalies situations where the temperature at a location exceeds the safety threshold for equipment placed there. In this paper, we explore some techniques for predicting such thermal anomalies so that preemptive steps can be taken to address them. Four such techniques - a simple threshold method, a moving averages-based method, an EWMA-based method, and, a machine learning technique called naive Bayesian classifier - are tried on three months of temperature sensor data obtained from a real data center. The initial results are encouraging and the naive Bayes method performs better than the others, although the false positive rate needs to be improved.

However, the hazards that follow these new types of communication are growing as well. Predators use Internet conversations to attract minor users, usually resulting in catastrophic consequences. In this paper, a new risk management based approach is proposed, which aims to monitor internet-based conversations and identify possible attacks. In particular, a wide research on the area of children exploitation is first conducted, in order to identify the methods and the techniques that are used. Then, the implementation of a system capable of capturing and analyzing chat dialogs is proposed. The proposed system is under development and has not be implemented yet. It is based on three different sensors. The first one performs text analysis on captured traffic, as an attempt to look for known patterns that may indicate a possible attack. The Naive Bayes classifier method then follows, based upon the initial training set. In addition, this training set is enhanced and adopted to specific users' needs via the proposed "supervised learning technique". The second sensor captures files or web links that are sent through the chat conversation, indicating possible personal information leak or exposing unwanted material to minors. The third sensor counts how many times the same users talk with a particular child. As a result, a total risk factor is calculated as a weighted sum of the three risk factors, through applying the proper weight coefficients. In case the risk factor is above the predefined threshold, a warning signal is sent in order to warn on time that there is a possible grooming attack. The main challenge in the proposed system implementation is related to natural language processing, due to the fact that teenagers use their own acronyms and idioms when chatting, creating their own language. A deep research on these dialogs might result into different linguistic sets. Another important challenge is related with the privacy in internet-related communications.

This paper deals with the acceleration sensor of a commercial mobile phone that makes it possible to identify and classify the user's means of transportation. The needed pre-processing of the sensor data is described as well as the used classification algorithms, i.e. Naive Bayes classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Their performance for solving the classification problem in combination with the different pre-processings is analyzed. It is shown that both classifiers are able to solve the classification task with high accuracy given a proper preprocessing. Support Vector Machines outperform Naive Bayes classifiers and achieve a classification accuracy of over 97% on an unknown test data set.

However, the visual interpretation of these spectra is difficult and few clinicians are trained to use the technique. In this study, sixty-eight spectra obtained from twenty-two multi-voxel spectroscopies were classified using three well-known classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)., Decision Trees and Naive Bayes. The best results were obtained using NaiveBayes that presented an average balanced accuracy rate around 75%, although K-Nearest Neighbors presented very good results in some situations. The obtained results lead us to conclude that it is possible to classify magnetic resonance spectra with data mining techniques for further integration in a Clinical Decision Support System which may help in the diagnosis of new cases.

The system employed signature for authentication purpose. The major functional blocks of the proposed system are presented. Information is extracted as time functions of various dynamic properties of the signatures. We apply our methodology to global features extracted from a 108-users database. Thirty-one features were identified and extracted from each signature. Rough set approach has resulted in a reduced set of nine features that were found to capture the essential characteristics required for signature identification. Low error rates obtained in experiments illustrate the feasibility of using Rough Set as a promising technique for online signature identification systems.

Our framework addresses the problems of assessing and utilizing data mining models in medical domain. The framework consists of three stages. The first stage involves preprocessing of the data to improve its quality. The second stage employs k-means clustering algorithm to cluster the data into k clusters (in our case, k=2 i.e. cluster / no, cluster1 / yes) for validation the class labels associated with the data. After clustering, the class labels associated with the data is compared with the labels generated by clustering algorithm if both the labels are same it is assumed that the data is correctly classified. The instances for which the labels are not same are considered to be misclassified and are removed before further processing. In the third stage support vector machine classification is applied. The classification model is validated by using k-fold cross validation method. The performance of SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier is also compared with Naive Bayes classifier. In our case SVM classifier outperforms the Naive Bayes classifier. To validate the proposed framework, experiments have been carried out on benchmark datasets such as Indian Pima diabetes dataset and Wisconsin breast cancer dataset (WBCD). These datasets were obtained from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. Our proposed study obtained classification accuracy on both datasets, which is better with respect to the other classification algorithms applied on the same datasets as cited in the literature. The performance of the proposed framework was also evaluated using the sensitivity and specificity measures.	[Patil, B. M.; Joshi, R.

The goal is to build a classifier for a task-of-interest for which we have too few training samples. We additionally have "supplementary data" collected from other tasks, but it is uncertain which of these other samples are relevant, that is, which samples are classified in the same way as in the task-of-interest. The research problem is how to use the "supplementary data" from the other tasks to improve the classifier in the task-of-interest. We show how to solve the problem, and demonstrate the solution with logistic regression classifiers. The key idea is to model all tasks as mixtures of relevant and irrelevant samples, and model the irrelevant part with a sufficiently flexible model such that it does not distort the model of relevant data. We give two learning algorithms for the method - a simple maximum likelihood optimization algorithm and a more advanced variational Bayes inference algorithm; in both cases we show that the method works better than a comparable multi-task learning model and naive methods.

We present a concise review of community structure finding (CSF) algorithms and applications. We apply a CSF algorithm and various other algorithms on three different microarray data sets. We calculate modularity and C-rand indices as an indication of the quality of each clustering of the three data sets. We compare the performance of the CSF algorithm with the performance of three other algorithms: hierarchical clustering (HC) algorithm, K-means, dynamic tree cut (DTC) algorithm and Naive Bayes Clustering (NBC) using both C-rand and modularity values. We report that the CSF algorithm detects clusters resulting in high modularity; however the CSF does not result in clusters with high C-rand values compared to the other methods.

The algorithm combines a bottom-up, low-level, procedure of a bag-of-words naive Bayes phase for winnowing out unlikely object classes with a high-level procedure for detection and classification. The high-level process is a hybrid of a voting method where votes are filtered using beliefs computed by a class-specific graphical model. In that sense, shape is both explicit (determining the voting pattern) and implicit (each object part votes independently) - hence the term "semi-explicit shape model".

The increasing volume of spam has become a serious threat not only to the Internet, but also to society. Content-based filtering is one mainstream method of combating this threat in its various forms, but the previous Content-based filtering methods are hard to find a balance between efficiency and effectiveness. In this paper we intend to seek a linear solve for this problem, and two online linear classifiers: the Perceptron and Winnow are explored for this task in three benchmark corpora, which include English corpus PU1, Lingspam and Chinese corpus 2005-Jun, Our experiments conclude that both of these classifiers can filter spam emails effectively as well as efficiently. It is also show that they perform much better than a standard Naive Bayes method. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, they have a state-of-the-art performance for filtering Chinese spam emails, at least on the above corpora. Furthermore, both of the two classifiers are easily adaptively updated, thus are suitable for real dynamic environment.

But now this rate is decreased in the recent years due to the earlier diagnosis and proper treatment. Chances of the long survival of the patient can be increased by the accurate brain tumor diagnosis. For this regard we are proposing more accurate and efficient system for brain tumor diagnosis and brain tumor region extraction. Proposed system first diagnosis the tumor from the brain MR images using naive bayes classification. After diagnosis brain tumor region is extracted using K-means clustering and boundary detection techniques. We are achieving diagnosis accuracy more than 99%. Qualitative results show that accurate tumor region is extracted by the proposed system. The proposed technique is tested against the datasets of different patients received from Holy Family hospital and Abrar MRI&CT Scan center Rawalpindi.	[Qurat-ul Ain; Mehmood, Irfan; Jaffar, M.

The method exploits statistics of the histogram, wavelet statistics, amplitudes of local extrema from the ID and 2D adjacency histograms, center of mass of the histogram characteristic function and co-occurrence matrices for feature extraction process. In order to reduce the proposed features dimension and select the best subset, genetic algorithm is used and the results are compared through principle component analysis and linear discriminant analysis. The results show that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy in discriminating between innocent and stego images, as compared to one of well-known image steganalysis schemes.

Unfortunately, in several tasks training sets are extremely small and their generation is very expensive. In order to tackle this problem in tins paper we propose a new text classification method that takes advantage of the information embedded in the own test set. This method is supported on the idea that similar documents must belong to the same category. Particularly, it classifies the documents by considering not only their own content; but also information about the assigned category to other similar documents from the same test set. Experimental results in four data sets of different sizes are encouraging. They indicate that the proposed method is appropriate: to be used with small training sets, where it could significantly outperform the results from traditional approaches such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines.

The neural network is first trained to achieve an accuracy rate, the activation of the values in the hidden layers of the neural network is analyzed and from this analysis are generated classification rules. The proposed approach was tested on a set of data from a Colombian organization for the sending and payment of remittances, in order to identify patterns associated with fraud detection. Similarly the results of the techniques used in the model were compared with other mining techniques such as Decision Trees and Naive Bayes. A prototype software was developed to test the model, which was integrated into RapidMiner tool, which can be used as a tool for academic software.

The objective of this research is to assess the relative performance of some well-known classification methods for managing portfolio by predicting financial performance of a company on the basis of text documents. This approach is quite useful for managing portfolios on the basis of predicted risk category by framing the risk categorization task to assess company's financial outlook in the form of a classification problem. Availability of financial text information in electronic form and positive correlation between news reports on company's financial status make its classification a useful tool for investors to predict financial outlook of a company before investing their money in particular stock. Major contribution of classifier is that it enables to manage investor's portfolio. Among the proposed classification techniques combined naive bayes and K-NN (NBKNN) with bigrams and unigrams with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) approach for features extraction has high potential of classifying and predicting risk from available financial news. We developed a text classification algorithm that classifies financial news article by using a combination of a reduced but highly informative word feature sets and a variant of weighted majority algorithm. Short learning time is additional advantage of this technique resulted due to its computational efficiency along with relatively high accuracy. We measure the accuracy on precision basis and also do a comparative analysis of combined NBKNN with other classification techniques. The major contribution lies in developing new classification method and its application in portfolio management.

Imbalance distribution of instances between churners and non-churners and the size of customer dataset are the concerns when building a churn prediction model. This paper presents a local PCA classifier approach to avoid these problems by comparing eigenvalues of the best principal component. The experiments were carried out on a large real-world Telecommunication dataset and assessed on a churn prediction task. The experimental results showed that local PCA classifier generally outperformed Naive Bayes, Logistic regression, SVM and Decision Tree C4.5 in terms of true churn rate.	[Sato, T.; Huang, B.

Supervised Learning Approach for Predicting the Quality of Cotton Using WEKA	INFORMATION PROCESSING AND MANAGEMENT	Communications in Computer and Information Science		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Recent Trends in Business Administration and Information Processing	MAR 26-27, 2010	Trivandrum, INDIA	ACEEE		Machine learning Techniques; Multilayer Perceptron; Naive Bayes; J48; k-Nearest Neighbor		Cotton is the world's most important natural fibre used in Textile manufacturing. Cotton fiber is processed into yarn and fabric. Yarn strength depends extremely on the quality of cotton. The physical characteristics such as fiber length, length distribution, trash value, color grade, strength, shape, tenacity, density, moisture absorption, dimensional stability, resistance, thermal reaction, count, etc., contributes to the quality of cotton. Hence determining the quality of cotton accurately is an essential task to make better raw material choices in textile industry which in turn will support better buying and selling decisions. In this work, cotton quality prediction is modeled as classification task and implemented using supervised learning algorithms namely Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayes, J48 Decision tree, k-nearest neighbor in WEKA environment on the cotton quality assessment dataset. The classification models have been trained using the data collected from a spinning mill. The prediction accuracy of the classifiers is evaluated using 10-fold cross validation and the results are compared. It is observed that the model based on decision tree classifier produces high predictive accuracy compared to other models.	[Selvanayaki, M.; Vijaya, M. S.; Jamuna, K.

Bayes method has shown its good classification performance in fault diagnosis, while the real-timing of this method can be guaranteed effectively. By taking advantages of the PCA and Naive Bayes classification, an integrated approach is proposed for the fault diagnosis of chemical process. Firstly, the dimension of industrial data was reduced by PCA method, and the resulting data were discretized to some grades for Bayes classification. The simulation results of TE process show that PCA-Bayes classification is feasible to detect and locate faults quickly with good real time property and high robustness.

We propose a feature selection scheme based on slicing technique which was originally proposed for programming languages. The proposed approach called Case Slicing Technique (CST). Slicing means that we are interested in automatically obtaining that portion features' of the case responsible for specific parts of the solution of the case at hand. We show that our goal should be to eliminate the number of features by removing irrelevant once. Choosing a subset of the features may increase accuracy and reduce complexity of the acquired knowledge. Our experimental results indicate that the performance of CST as a method of feature subset selection is better than the performance of the other approaches which are RELIEF with Base Learning Algorithm (C4.5), RELIEF with K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN), RELIEF with Induction of Decision Tree Algorithm (1D3) and RELIEF with Naive Bayes (NB), which are mostly used in the feature selection task.

The aim of the study was to uncover the identity, the dynamic behavior, and the interactions among the components of the circadian clock. Transcriptional profiling has exposed the regulon conferring benefits for circadian biology and bioinformatics. Circadian plant time course gene expression data was examined, this was the prerequisite for Naive Bayes classifiers which were trained and led to expression model with a success rate of up to 87%. The model showed new combinatorial rules, including presence of elements and their frequencies in driving particular phases.

Both techniques lead to significant error reductions with different learning algorithms, but improvements do not accumulate.

An early detection of MI greatly improves patient's chances of surviving and returning to health. In this work we focused on inferior MI detection; our database consisted of 6350 ECG records. Interpretation of records was made by cardiologist and 512 records were diagnosed as an inferior MI. Prediction of inferior MI was acquired by the Selvester QRS score, the Novacode, and the Siemens 440/740. Moreover, we compared performance of learning algorithms Ripper, C4.5, SVM, and Naive Bayes to the decison systems. The best decision system, the Selvester score, achieved 0.58 of sensitivity and 0.93 of specificity. The better results were obtained by Ripper - sensitivity 0.83, specificity 0.92. The modification of Selvester yielded to similar performance of 0.85 sensitivity and 0.90 specificity.

Kurt			Machine learning for radioxenon event classification for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY			English	Article						Machine learning; Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty; Radioxenon monitoring		A method of weapon detection for the Comprehensive nuclear-Test-Ban-Treaty (CTBT) consists of monitoring the amount of radioxenon in the atmosphere by measuring and sampling the activity concentration of (131m)Xe, (133)Xe, (133m)Xe, and (135)Xe by radionuclide monitoring. Several explosion samples were simulated based on real data since the measured data of this type is quite rare. These data sets consisted of different circumstances of a nuclear explosion, and are used as training data sets to establish an effective classification model employing state-of-the-art technologies in machine learning. A study was conducted involving classic induction algorithms in machine learning including Naive Bayes, Neural Networks, Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines, that revealed that they can successfully be used in this practical application. In particular, our studies show that many induction algorithms in machine learning outperform a simple linear discriminator when a signal is found in a high radioxenon background environment.

Observers were asked to judge whether the visual and auditory stimuli occurred simultaneously. The subjective judgment for 90-ms-asynchronous stimuli showed trial-by-trial variation, and we successfully classified subjective simultaneity using neuromagnetic signals. We submitted raw MEG signals, a wavelet transform, and nonlinear dynamics to a naive Bayes classifier. In the case of raw signals and nonlinear dynamics, the classifier trained with the VA (where the visual stimulus was given first) or AV (where the visual stimulus was given second) data could predict the subjective simultaneity of the other VA (or AV) data at a rate better than chance. The classification rate using nonlinear dynamics was comparable to that using raw signals, despite the fact that the dimension was considerably low (101 vs. 88,000 dimensions). In the case of the wavelet transform, the classifier trained with the VA data was able to decode the AV data, and vice versa. These results suggest that (1) we can decode subjective simultaneity using MEG signals. (2) nonlinear dynamics may encode simultaneity specific to the order of the audiovisual inputs, (3) the time-frequency characteristics of neural activity may predict subjective simultaneity independently of the physical order of the audiovisual inputs, and (4) the neural activity (time-frequency characteristics) reflecting subjective simultaneity may share a common mechanism among different sensory modalities.

This paper presents an application of the boosting-based ensemble learning with penalty setting profiles on automatic unknown word recognition in Thai. Treating a sequential task as a non-sequential problem requires us to rank a set of generated candidates for a potential unknown word position. Since the correct candidate might not located at the highest rank among those candidates in the set, the proposed method provides penalties, in the form of a penalty setting profile, to improper ranking in order to reconstruct the succeeding classification model. In addition a number of alternative penalty setting profiles are introduced and their performances are compared on the task of extracting unknown words from a large Thai medical text. Using the naive Bayes as the base classifier for ensemble learning, the proposed method achieves the accuracy of 89.24%, which is an improvement of 9.91%, 7.54%, 5.25% over conventional naive Bayes, non-ensemble version, and flat penalty setting profile.

Over the past decade, neural networks and support vector machines (SVMs) have achieved good results for genes classification. This paper presents a methodology which uses two neural networks to classify unseen genes based on their expression levels. In order to remove some of the noise and deal with the imbalanced class distribution of the dataset, data pre-processing is firstly performed before data classification in which data cleaning, data transformation and data over-sampling using SMOTE algorithm are undertaken. Thereafter, two neural networks with different architectures are trained using Scaled Conjugate Gradient in two different ways: 1) the training-validation-testing approach and 2) 10-fold cross-validation. Experimental results show that this methodology outperforms the previous best-performing SVM for this problem and 8 other classifiers: 3 SVMs, C4.5, Bayesian network Naive Bayes, K-NN and JRip.

We have compared six classifiers for predicting implantation potentials of IVF embryos. We have constructed an embryo based dataset which represents an imbalanced distribution of positive and negative samples as in most of the medical datasets. Since it is shown that accuracy is not an appropriate measure for imbalanced class distributions, ROC analysis have been used for performance evaluation. Our experimental results reveal that Naive Bayes and Radial Basis Function methods produced significantly better performance with (0.739 +/- 0.036) and (0.712 +/- 0.036) area under the curve measures respectively.

In particular, we estimate the location of Flickr photos, based on their tags, at four different scales, ranging from a city-level granularity to fine-grained intra-city areas. Using Dempster-Shafer's evidence theory, we combine the output of the different classifiers into a single mass assignment. We demonstrate experimentally that the induced belief and plausibility measures are useful to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to classify the photo at a given granularity. Thus an adaptive method is obtained, by which photos are georeferenced at the most appropriate resolution.

Diagnosis, treatment and care of pressure ulcers are costly for health services. Accurate wound evaluation is a critical task for optimizing the efficacy of treatment and care. Prediction of wound evolution helps the effective management of health resources and planning of pharmacological treatment and health-care decisions. In this paper, different machine learning approaches have been designed and used to predict the evolution of pressure ulcers. These predictive systems are based on local features extracted from wound images which were weekly taken in uncontrolled lighting conditions. The images were automatically segmented by the mean-shift procedure. A group of clinical experts manually classified the segmented regions into five different tissue types, and a set of local descriptors based on area measurements of these tissues was extracted. The one-week evolution of two different indicators for pressure ulcer evaluation is predicted: the ratio between granulation and devitalized tissue, and the percentage of wound-bed border consisting of granulation tissue. Of the tens of machine learning approaches and architectures tested in this study, support vector machines, naive Bayes classifiers, neural networks and decision trees achieved the highest accuracy rates in the prediction of the two indicators above, with also acceptable sensitivity and positive predictive value rates. Feature selection significantly reduced the number of input features needed for prediction. Neural networks and decision trees gave the best performance results, and the C4.5 algorithm achieved the highest accuracy rate (similar to 81%) in the prediction of the granulation/devitalized ratio from a small number of input features.

Even if the problem of WSD is difficult, when we consider its bilingual version, this problem becomes to be much more complex. In this case, it is needed not only to find the correct translation, but this translation must consider the contextual senses of the original sentence (in a source language), in order to find the correct sense (in the target language) of the source word. In this paper we propose a model based on n-grams (3-grams and 5-grams) that significantly outperforms the last results that we presented at the cross-lingual word sense disambiguation task at the SemEval-2 forum. We use a naive Bayes classifier for determining the probability of a target sense (in a target language) given a sentence which contains the ambiguous word (in a source language). For this purpose, we use a bilingual statistical dictionary, which is calculated with Giza++ by using the EUROPARL parallel corpus, in order to determine the probability of a source word to be translated to a target word (which is assumed to be the correct sense of the source word but in a different language). As we mentioned, the results were compared with those of an international competition, obtaining a good performance.

We propose a multi-batch strategy applying on test-cost sensitive Naive Bayes classifier and evaluate its performance on several data sets. We build graphs horn attributes and it includes the vertices cost and set cost. Then we use randomized algorithm to select the unknown attributes in each testing cycle.

One main challenge for this study is to find the optimal subsets of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) which are most tightly associated with diseases. Feature selection which might effectively reduce the computational complexity has become a necessity in many bioinformatics applications. Hence we present a prediction algorithm based on support vector machine (SVM) with a hybrid feature selection method named F-score and compact GA (FCGA). FCGA combines the advantage of filter method and wrapper method, which not only eliminates the redundancy of feature and reduces computing time, but also solves the problem of SVM's parameters selection. We use this prediction algorithm to analyze the lung cancer dataset including 595 samples and each one has 141 SNPs. To evaluate the prediction accuracy of our algorithm, we compare it with Naive Bayes along with some commonly used feature selection methods. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has the highest level of accuracies compared with the other methods.

In 2002, a new standard named "National Student Physical Health Standard" (PHS) began to be carried out year by year. Therefore, a great deal of test data is recorded. Although sports data analysis became more and more technical with the development of artificial intelligence and data analysis technologies, studies on these records were still limited to basic statistics analysis in the past. In this paper a new technology named "Data Mining" which can find unknown patterns of certain data sets and relationships among the data is introduced to analyze PHS test data. We attempt to apply various data mining algorithms in PHS data analysis with the help of Microsoft SQL Server 2005. First, decision tree and naive bayes algorithms are applied to analysis the dependency between single test and score level. Second, association rules algorithm is used to explore detailed associations between single test and score level. Finally, classifying performance of naive bayes, decision tree and clustering algorithms are compared. Some valuable conclusions are achieved.

The class imbalance is that the amount of one class may be much less than that of another in training set. Under-sampling is a very popular approach to deal with this problem. Under-sampling approach is very efficient, it only using a subset of the majority class. The drawback of under-sampling is that it throws away many potentially useful majority class examples. To overcome this drawback, we adopt an unsupervised learning technique for supervised learning. We proposes cluster-based majority under-sampling approaches for selecting a representative subset from the majority class. Compared to under-sampling, cluster-based under-sampling can effectively avoid the important information loss of majority class. We adopt two methods to select representative subset from k clusters with certain proportions, and then use the representative subset and the all minority class samples as training data to improve accuracy over minority and majority classes. In the paper, we compared the behaviors of our approaches with the traditional random under-sampling approach on ten UCI repository datasets using the following classifiers: k-nearest neighbor and Naive Bayes classifier. Recall, Precision, F-measure, G-mean and BACC (balance accuracy) are used for evaluating performance of classifiers. Experimental results show that our cluster-based majority under-sampling approaches outperform the random under-sampling approach. Our approaches attain better overall performance on k-nearest neighbor classifier compared to Naive Bayes classifier.

This paper adopts three supervised learning approaches and a web-based semantic orientation approach, PMI-IR, to Chinese reviews. The results show that SVM outperforms naive bayes and N-gram model on various sizes of training examples, but does not obviously exceeds the semantic orientation approach when the number of training examples is smaller than 300.

An approach for rich format text classification is design and implemented here. We propose a comprehensive feature weighting which considers structure affections to classification by using feature structure distribution weight which is calculated with extended structure model, and text formats as well. We also take into account of the descriptive information of title, keywords, subject, structure, style and text, and morphology information in rich format text. The text classification is fulfilled by a document component tree similarity. We first decompose document, gather features by components, complete document component tree, and compare similarity between same kinds of components. The final result is the combination of all classifiers of component tree. We thoroughly study OpenOffice.org word document from text classification view, construct component tree for OpenOffice.org word document and conduct classification with corpus. Experiment results show that the component tree similarity based Naive Bayes classifier turns out a pretty good precision and recall rate.

This task frequently involves the examination of a variety of summary statistics and diagnostic plots. The interpretation of these diagnostics is often subjective, and generally requires careful expert scrutiny. Results: We show how an unsupervised classification technique based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and the naive Bayes model can be used to automate microarray quality assessment. The method is flexible and can be easily adapted to accommodate alternate quality statistics and platforms. We evaluate our approach using Affymetrix 3' gene expression and exon arrays and compare the performance of this method to a similar supervised approach. Conclusion: This research illustrates the efficacy of an unsupervised classification approach for the purpose of automated microarray data quality assessment. Since our approach requires only unannotated training data, it is easy to customize and to keep up-to-date as technology evolves. In contrast to other "black box" classification systems, this method also allows for intuitive explanations.

J	Cheng, CH; Chen, YH; Liu, JW				Cheng, Ching-Hsue; Chen, Yao-Hsien; Liu, Jing-Wei			Classifying Cinnamomums using rough sets classifier based on interval-discretization	PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Data mining; Classification; Interval-discretization; Decision tree; Rough sets; Cinnamomum	ATTRIBUTES	Classification, which is the task of assigning objects to one of several predefined categories, is a pervasive problem that encompasses many diverse applications. Decision tree classifier, which is a simple yet widely used classification technique, employs training data to yield decision rules; moreover, it can create thresholds and then split the list of continuous attributes into descrete intervals for handling continuous attributes (Quinlan in Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 4:77-90, 1996). Rough set theory (Pawlak in International Journal of Computer and Information Sciences 11:341-356, 1982; International Journal of Man-Machine Studies 20:469483, 1984; Rough sets: theoretical aspects of reasoning about data. Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1991) has been applied to a wide variety of decision analysis problems for the extraction of rules from databases. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that takes advantage of combining decision tree and rough sets classifier and applies it to plant classification. The introduced approach starts with decision tree classifier (C4.5) as preprocessing technique to make interval-discretization, subsequently, and uses rough set method for extracting rules. The proposed approach aims at finding out classification rules via analyzing lamina attributes (leaf stalk, leaf width, leaf length, length/width ratio) of Cinnamomum, which are gathered and measured by plant specialists in the field of Taiwan. A comparison with the widely used algorithms (e.g., decision tree, multilayer perceptrons, naive Bayes, and rough sets classifier) is carried out to show numerous advantages of the proposed approach. Finally, employing with test data in which species are unknown, results of classification are approved by consulting the relative plant specialists.

J	Badulescu, A; Moldovan, D				Badulescu, Adriana; Moldovan, Dan			A Semantic Scattering model for the automatic interpretation of English genitives	NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING			English	Article							DISTANCE	An important problem in knowledge discovery from text is the automatic extraction of semantic relations. This paper addresses the automatic classification of the semantic relations expressed by English genitives. A learning model is introduced based on the statistical analysis of the distribution of genitives semantic relations in a corpus. The semantic and contextual features of the genitive's noun phrase constituents play a key role in the identification of the semantic relation. The algorithm was trained and tested on a corpus of approximately 20,000 sentences and achieved an f-measure of 79.80 per cent for of-genitives, far better than the 40.60 per cent obtained using a Decision Trees algorithm, the 50.55 per cent obtained using a Naive Bayes algorithm, or the 72.13 per cent obtained using a Support Vector Machines algorithm on the same corpus using the same features. The results were similar for s-genitives: 78.45 per cent using Semantic Scattering, 47.00 per cent using Decision Trees, 43.70 per cent using Naive Bayes, and 70.32 per cent using a Support Vector Machines algorithm. The results demonstrate the importance of word sense disambiguation and semantic generalization/specialization for this task. They also demonstrate that different patterns (in our case the two types of genitive constructions) encode different semantic information and should be treated differently in the sense that different models should be built for different patterns.

By focusing on the probabilistic space of classifiers induced by the classification algorithm rather than on that of datasets, we obtain efficient characterizations for computing the moments, which is followed by visualization of the resulting formulae that are too complicated for direct interpretation. By assuming the data to be drawn independently and identically distributed from the underlying probability distribution, and by going over the space of all possible datasets, we establish general relationships between the generalization error, hold-out-set error, cross-validation error, and leave-one-out error. We later exemplify the method and the results by studying the behavior of the errors for the naive Bayes classifier.

Building Bayesian network classifiers through a Bayesian complexity monitoring system	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						Bayesian networks; classification; Bayes factor; naive Bayes; tree-augmented naive Bayes classifier	DISTRIBUTIONS; PROBABILITY	Nowadays, the need for practical yet efficient machine learning techniques for engineering applications are highly in demand. A new learning method for building Bayesian network classifiers is presented in this article. The proposed method augments the naive Bayesian (NB) classifier by using the Chow and Liu tree construction method, but introducing a Bayesian approach to control the accuracy and complexity of the resulting network, which yields simple structures that are not necessarily a spanning tree. Experiments by using benchmark data sets show that the number of augmenting edges by using the proposed learning method depends on the number of training data used. The classification accuracy was better, or at least equal, to the NB and the tree augmented NB models when tested on 10 benchmark data sets.

Speech feature extraction constitutes the front end module of any speech decoder: it plays an essential role and has a strong impact on the recognition performance. The research community is aggressively searching for more powerful solutions which combine the existing feature extraction methods for a better and more reliable information capture from the analog speech signal. In this research work, we propose new approaches to combining phoneme recognizers' output in order to provide better recognition performance and improved robustness with respect to noise and channel distortions. Machine learning tools such as the Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines have been used in the combination of hypotheses. Experiments under different SNR levels have proven that our proposed approach outperforms the two most common feature extraction techniques, namely Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Perceptual Linear Prediction(PLP) with Cepstral Mean Subtraction (CMS) and RASTA respectively, for channel normalization.

Bankruptcy prediction by providing necessary warnings can make the companies aware of this problem so they can take appropriate measures with these warnings. The aim of this study is model development for financial distress prediction of listed companies in Tehran stocks exchange (TSE) using Bayesian networks (BNs). The sample consists of 72 bankrupt firms and 72 non bankrupt ones from 1997 to 2007 and bankrupt firms are those firms that subject to Business Law par. 141. In order to develop a bankruptcy prediction model, we consider 20 predictor variables including liquidity ratios, leverage ratios, profitability ratios and other factors like firm's size and auditor's opinion and then we use two methods for choosing variables. The first method is based upon conditional correlation between variables and the second method based upon conditional likelihood. Then three models for predicting financial distress are developed using naive bayes model and regression model and the result of three models are compared. The accuracy in predicting bankruptcy of the first naive bayes model's performance that is based upon conditional correlation is 90% and the accuracy of the second naive bayes model is 93% and finally the accuracy of the logistic regression that was built for comparing to naive bayes models is 90%. Collectively the results show that it is possible to predict financial distress using Bayesian models. Also, because this prediction is based on the information provided in financial statements of companies, it can be an evidence that the financial statements of companies have information content. With respect to the remainder variables in developed models in this research we find firms that have lower profitability and have more long term liabilities and have lower liquidity are more in risk of financial distress. To reduce financial distress risk, firms should use more conservative methods which lead to decrease in debts and reduce their costs. Further analyses show that the discretization into two, three and four states cause the model's performance to increase but increasing states into five states causes the model's performance to decrease.

In this paper, we investigate the reasons for the success of RLO ensembles. Our study suggests that the decomposition of most of the classes of the dataset into two subclasses for each class is the reason for the success of the RLO method. Our study leads to the development of a new output manipulation based ensemble method; Random Subclasses (RS). In the proposed method, we create new subclasses from each subset of data points that belongs to the sane class using RLO framework and consider each subclass as a class of its own. The comparative study suggests that RS is similar to RLO method, whereas RS is statistically better than or similar to Bagging and AdaBoost. M1 for most of the datasets. The similar performance of RLO and RS suggest that the creation of local structures (subclasses) is the main reason for the success of RLO. The another conclusion of this study is that RLO is more useful for classifiers (linear classifiers etc.) that have limited flexibility in their class boundaries. These classifiers can not learn complex class boundaries. Creating subclasses makes new; easier to learn, class boundaries.

There are approaches to solve the problem like analytical, heuristic and simulation ones. Analytical methods cannot meet the requirements of rescheduling regarding solution time, especially for large problem instances. Analytic approaches as well as simulation based systems need a long calculation time. To generate good solutions a lot of simulation runs have to be made. Thus, extensive research was done in heuristic rescheduling systems. Usually, dispatching rules are used. Their drawback is that it is impossible to define a superior dispatching rule for all situations in the workshop. To solve this problem, we intend to combine the Giffler / Thompson heuristic with a knowledge based system - a naive bayes classifier with offline generated training data. This combination enables the selection of the best dispatching rule dynamically, depending on the system's state. The paper presents the concept of our approch; a first stage of research progress. Therefore, preliminary results on learning scheduling decisions are shown.

There has recently been an increasing interest in developing such systems, with several views on which are the best discriminator features. This paper presents a new offline signature verification system, which considers a new combination of previously used features and introduces two new distance-based ones. A new feature grouping is presented. We have experimented with two classification methods and two feature selection techniques. The best performance so far was obtained with the Naive Bayes classifier on the reduced feature set (through feature selection).

Clustering is used to group image regions into prototypical region clusters that summarize the training data and can be used as the basis of annotating new test images. Since this problem involves clustering sparse and high dimensional data, we use a semi-supervised constrained clustering algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and feature discrimination. The constraints consist of pairs of image regions that should not be included in the same cluster. These constraints are deduced from the irrelevance of all concepts annotating the training images. The constraints help in guiding the clustering process. The GSJ algorithm uses the fuzzy membership function of each region cluster. Finally, Bayes rule is used to label images based on the posterior probability of each concept. The proposed algorithm was implemented and tested on a data set that includes 3000 images using four-fold cross validation.	[Ben Ismail, M.

ADDING EXPERT KNOWLEDGE TO TAN-BASED INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEMS	SECRYPT 2009: PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SECURITY AND CRYPTOGRAPHY			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Security and Cryptography	JUL 07-10, 2009	Milan, ITALY	INSTICC, IEICE SWIM, IEEE SMC TCEI, Int Assoc Cryptol Res		Intrusion detection; TAN		Bayesian networks are important knowledge representation tools for handling uncertain pieces of information. The success of these models is strongly related to their capacity to represent and handle (in)dependence relations. A simple form of Bayesian networks, called naive Bayes has been successively applied in many classification tasks. In particular, naive Bayes have been used for intrusion detection. Unfortunately, naive Bayes are based on a strong independence assumption that limits its application scope. This paper considers the well-known Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN) classifiers in the context of intrusion detection. In particular, we study how additional expert information such that "it is expected that 80% of traffic will be normal" can be integrated in classification tasks. Experimental results show that our approach improves existing results.

Into the classification problem context is well-known the fact that a higher number of discriminators not necessarily will increase the discrimination power. This work investigates a methodology for features selection and Internet traffic classification in which the problem to classify one among M classes is split in M one-against-all binary classification problems, with each binary problem adopting eventually a set of different discriminators. Different combinations of discriminators selection methods, classification methods and decision algorithms could be embedded into the methodology. To investigate the performance of this methodology we have used the Naive Bayes classifier to select the set of discriminators and for classification. The proposed method intends to reduce the total number of different discriminators used into the classification problem. The methodology was tested for classification of traffic flows and the experimental results showed that we can reduce significantly the number of discriminators per class sustaining the same accuracy level.

Link-based classification is the problem of predicting the class label of a target entity given information about features of the entity and about features of the related entities. A natural approach to link-based classification is to upgrade standard classification methods from the propositional, single-table testing. In this paper we propose a new classification rule for upgrading naive Bayes classifiers (NBC). Previous work on relational NBC has achieved the best results with link independency assumption which says that the probability of each link to an object is independent from the other links to the object. We formalize our method by breaking it into two parts: (1) the independent influence assumption: that the influence of one path from the target object to a related entity is independent of another. We consider object-path independency and (2) the independent feature assumption of NBC: that features of the target entity and a related entity are probabilistically independent given a target class label. We derive a new relational NBC rule that places more weight on the target entity features than formulations of the link independency assumption. The new NBC rule yields higher accuracies on three benchmark datasets-Mutagenesis, Movie Lens, and Cora-with average improvements ranging from 2% to 10%.

In this research, we have used Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) to construct our defect prediction framework. Our proposed framework uses the hierarchical structure information about the source code of the software product, to perform defect prediction at a functional method level and source file level. We have applied our model on SoftLAB and Eclipse datasets. We have measured the performance of our proposed model and applied cost benefit analysis. Our results reveal that source file level defect prediction improves the verification effort, while decreasing the defect prediction performance in all datasets.

In this paper, we address the problem of learning classifiers from structured relational data that are annotated with relevant meta data. Specifically, we show how to learn classifiers at different levels of abstraction in a relational setting, where the structured relational data are organized in an abstraction hierarchy that describes the semantics of the content of the data. We show how to cope with some of the challenges presented by partial specification in the case of structured data, that unavoidably results from choosing a particular level of abstraction. Our solution to partial specification is based on a statistical method, called shrinkage. We present results of experiments in the case of learning link-based Naive Bayes classifiers on a text classification task that (i) demonstrate that the choice of the level of abstraction can impact the performance of the resulting link-based classifiers and (ii) examine the effect of partially specified data.

Both new classifiers provide low-variance probability estimates of class labels from low-bias probabilistic models in their respective domains. We combine these two novel classifiers in a naive Bayes framework to form a classifier that fuses similarity and feature information to produce accurate probability estimates for the class labels. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the two classifiers improve upon the state-of-the-art in their respective domains, and that the fused classifier adaptively uses the best information for classification.

Although the text categorization techniques in a number of areas have been gotten very good research and applications, for relatively short and different structures of the short data, the categorization research is relatively less. In fact, in order to use handily, it is very necessary to do the categorization research and application. In this paper, based on existing research, we analyzed and research some current text categorization algorithm, according to the experimental data, we also analyzed and compared that, in short text data categorization, SVM algorithm has good performance, and we suggested some improvements just for reference.

First, naive Bayes and TAN models where continuous probability densities are approximated by MTE potentials are used to provide a distribution of stock returns. Second, a Bayesian network is used to determine a, return distribution for a portfolio of stocks. Using MTE potentials to approximate the distributions for the continuous variables in the network allows use of the Shenoy-Shafer architecture to obtain a solution for the marginal distributions. We also illustrate the problem that arises in these models where deterministic relationships between variables appear, which is related to the partitioning of the domain of the MTE distributions. We propose a solution based on simulation.

To install a new wind energy turbine, measurement and evaluation of the meteorological data are quite important. In this paper, a novel system is developed for the installation of wind turbines. Firstly, necessary data including the speed and the direction of wind, the solar insolation, the ultraviolet radiation and the rainfall are received from a meteorology station, and then data acquired are converted into useful information using a rule-based inference mechanism. Finally, the useful information obtained are evaluated in a Naive Bayes algorithm. The power and the size of wind turbine are determined automatically using data measured. Thus, some complicated calculations including more than parameters related to fields where the large-sized wind turbines will be installed can easily be accomplished by means of the powerful decision support system developed.

In this paper, we take advantage of single valued ranking evaluation functions in order to develop a new method of genetic feature selection tailored to improve the accuracy of content-based image retrieval systems. We propose to boost the feature selection ability of the genetic algorithms (GA) by employing an evaluation criteria (fitness function) that relies on order-based ranking evaluation functions. The evaluation criteria are provided by the GA and has been successfully employed as a measure to evaluate the efficacy of content-based image retrieval process, improving up to 22% the precision of the query answers. Experiments on three medical datasets containing breast cancer diagnosis and breast tissue density analysis showed that fitness functions based on ranking evaluation functions occupy an essential role on the algorithms' performance, obtaining results significatively better than other fitness function designs. The experiments also showed that the proposed method obtains results superior than feature selection based on the traditional decision-tree C4.5, naive bayes, support vector machine, 1-nearest neighbor and association rule mining.

In this paper an artificial data generator called GLOR is presented, which is based on a Monte Carlo method and designed for the training of machine learning classifiers for glaucoma diagnosis. The generated population is characterized by the functional and structural data of eyes. In this study, these parameters are provided by High Definition Optical Coherence Tomography (HD-OCT) and by Standard Automated Perimetry (SAP) instruments. A Naive-Bayes classifier trained by using an artificial population comprising of 4500 normal and 500 glaucomatous subjects, obtained a rate of 77% for sensibility and 93% for specificity, during a classification performance evaluation using real patient data. The area under a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve was 0.9308.

Within the data mining arena, an automated dust storm detection system is under development using ITSC's remote sensing data visualization and analysis tool, ADaM-IVICS. In this study, a reference supervised classification method was used as a baseline for comparison against a threshold based heuristic classifier designed to distinguish clouds from airborne mineral dust in selected Terra MODIS Level 1B imagery. The reference classification method couples an Orthogonal Forward Selection (OFS) optimization algorithm and a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier on training samples to determine the optimal spectral bands. The NB classifier then uses the selected subset of spectral bands to detect dust. The threshold-based classifier used is implemented as a Decision Tree and based on the Integrated Dust Detection (IDD) method. The IDD method calculates D*, a dust index based on infrared bands suitable for both daytime and nighttime dust detection. Incorporating NDVI to improve the demarcation between land and ocean surfaces obscured and un-obscured by dust refined the IDD method. Additional thresholds were derived using combination of both D* and NDVI to improve the classification accuracy. Classification results from the threshold-based algorithm are compared to reference results and are presented in this paper.

J	El-Halees, A				El-Halees, Alaa			Filtering Spam E-Mail from Mixed Arabic and English Messages: A Comparison of Machine Learning Techniques	INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Anti-spam filtering; machine learning techniques; text data mining		Spam is one of the main problems in emails communications. As the volume of non-english language spam increases, little work is done in this area. For example, in Arab world users receive spam written mostly in arabic, english or mixed Arabic and english. To filter this kind of messages, this research applied several machine learning techniques. Many researchers have used machine learning techniques to filter spam email messages. This study compared six supervised machine learning classifiers which are maximum entropy, decision trees, artificial neural nets, naive bayes, support system machines and k-nearest neighbor. The experiments suggested that words in Arabic messages should be stemmed before applying classifier. In addition, in most cases, experiments showed that classifiers using feature selection techniques can achieve comparable or better performance than filters do not used them.

The effect of parameters including size of the dataset, kind of the independent attributes, number of the discrete attributes, and their values have been investigated. From the results, it can be concluded that in datasets consisting of both discrete and continuous attributes, the AUC of the three mentioned classifiers is the same. With increasing the number of the discrete attributes, the AUC of the logistic regression is increased and the precision related to this classifier become more than the other two classifiers. Also considering impact of the discrete attributes it can be seen that with increasing the number of values in discrete attributes the AUC related to the logistic regression classifier increases and linear regressions' AUC decreases, but the AUC of the Naive-Bayes classifier remains constant. The results of this research can help data miners in selecting the more efficient classifiers based on the conditions of feature that exist in their datasets.

An Evaluation of Feature Selection Techniques with Various Software Quality Classification Models	15TH ISSAT INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RELIABILITY AND QUALITY IN DESIGN, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	15th ISSAT International Conference on Reliability and Quality in Design	AUG 06-08, 2009	San Francisco, CA			soft-ware quality classification model; feature selection; rough set; Kolmogorov-Smirnov		Software quality models are effective tools that have been used to estimate faulty components in the software development process. Potential faulty components identified by the software quality models will be intensively inspected and tested to produce a more reliable final product. Many studies have been dedicated towards improving the performance of software quality models. It has been found that the predictive accuracy of the models is significantly influenced by the quality of data involved in the model building process. By eliminating irrelevant and redundant features from the original training data set, we can build software quality models with better predictive performance. In this paper, we studied two feature selection techniques, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) and Rough Set (RS), and applied them to a very large telecommunications software system. To assess the classification performance of the software quality models on the smaller subsets of features selected using the two approaches, we employed five different classifiers which include naive Bayes (NBayes), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (1,11), and k nearest neighbors (K-NN), to classify software modules into fault-prone and not fault-prone groups. The experimental results showed that predicative capability was maintained or even improved when over 90 percent of the attributes were eliminated from the original data set. This would greatly benefit future software quality assurance efforts on metrics collection, model construction, model validation, and model evaluation of similar systems. In addition, we demonstrated that the KS feature selection technique had similar performances to the RS feature selection technique in terms of a certain performance metric, however, the KS method is computationally faster and easier to implement than the RS method.

Unsupervised text classification does not need training data but is often criticized to cluster blindly. Supervised text classification needs large quantities of labeled training data to achieve high accuracy. However, in practice, labeled samples are often difficult, expensive or time consuming to obtain. In the meanwhile, unlabeled documents can be collected easily owing to the rapid developing Internet. Class associated words are the words which represent the subject of classes and provide prior knowledge of classification for training a classifier. A learning algorithm, based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization (EM) and a Naive Bayes classifier, is introduced to classify documents from fully unlabeled documents using class associated words. Experimental results show that it has good classification capability with high accuracy, especially for those categories with small quantities of samples. In the algorithm, class associated words are used to set classification constraints during learning process to restrict to classify documents into corresponding class labels and improve the classification accuracy.

In this paper, we propose an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based EEG feature extraction and modeling approach for person authentication. Five dominating Independent Components (DIC) are determined from five brain regions represented by EEG channels, then univariate autoregressive coefficients of DICs are extract as features. Based on AR coefficients of DICs, a Naive Bayes probabilistic model is employed for person authentication purpose. Results from a real EEG motor task study suggest that the proposed ICA-based approach is promising and may open new directions in the emerging EEG biometry area.	[He, Chen; Wang, Z.

In this paper, we propose an EEG feature extraction and hashing approach for person authentication. Multi-variate autoregressive (mAR) coefficients are extracted as features from multiple EEG channels and then hashed by using our recently proposed Fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transform (FJLT)-based hashing algorithm to obtain compact hash vectors. Based on the EEG hash vectors, a Naive Bayes probabilistic model is employed for person authentication. Our EEG hashing approach presents a fundamental departure from existing methods in EEG-biometry study. The promising results suggest that hashing may open new research directions and applications in the emerging EEG-based biometry area.	[He, Chen; Lv, Xudong; Wang, Z.

Analysis of lyrics must be a complement of acoustic methods for music retrieval. One basic aspect of music retrieval is music emotion recognition by learning from lyrics. This problem is different from traditional text classification in that more linguistic or semantic information is required for better emotion analysis. Thereby, we focus on how to extract meaningful features and how to modeling them for music emotion recognition. First, we investigate the lyrics corpus based on Zipf's Law using word as a unit, and results roughly obey Zipf's Law. Then, we study three kinds of preprocessing methods and a series of language grams under the well-known n-gram language model framework to extract more semantic features. At last, we employ three supervised learning methods, Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classification, and support vector machine, to examine the classification performance. Besides that, we also improve ME with Gaussian and Laplace priors to model features for music emotion recognition. Experiment al results show that feature extraction methods improved music emotion recognition accuracy. ME with priors obtained the best.

There are two main factors which affect the performance of classification. One is the representation of images, and the other is the design of classifier. The representation of images based on bag-of-word(BOW) has become a popular method because of its simpleness and high efficiency. This paper aims to compare some state-of-the-art classifiers used in object categorization based on the BOW technology. In the dataset of Xerox7 and CalTech6, we compare the performance of five classifiers which are SVM, Maximum Entropy, Naive Bayes, Adaboost and Random Forests. The result of experiments show that SVM and Maximum Entropy have better performance than others.

The main function of the system is to extract information related to terrorism events found in Thai news articles. The terrorism events can then be classified and presented to intelligence officers who can further analyze and predict terrorism events. This paper compares three named entity feature selection techniques provided by terrorism gazetteer, terrorism ontology and terrorism grammar rules, for entity recognition. The machine learning algorithms use for event extraction include Naive Bayes (NB), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DTREE) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Each term feature is weighted by using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). Finite State Transduction is applied for learning feature weights. Experimental results show that the SVM algorithm with a terrorism ontology feature selection yields the best performance with 69.90% for both precision and recall.

This system focuses on delivering personalized content in Tamil language to an individual user needs based on their learning abilities and interests. This paper deals with automatic classification of Tamil documents and also the information extraction from those documents to construct the knowledge base. Documents are repositories of knowledge. There are numerous documents available and effective search in documents is time consuming. To make document search a simpler task, we need to perform document categorization. Document category can be found out using various techniques. In this paper, Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm is used to classify Tamil documents to one of pre-defined categories. Experiments are used to evaluate the Naive Bayes categorizer. The experimental results show that the Naive Bayes classifier performs well and its effectiveness is achieved with 89.8% accuracy. Informational words or sentences of the documents are then extracted using heuristic rules to fill up the predefined templates. An individual user's interests are identified and recorded to create a user profile. A user profile is specific to a user and is subjected to change over time. The Topic categorizer is used to categorize the topic based on user's query. The topic analyzer is used to analyze the user's profile and evaluate the user's knowledge using intelligent evaluator system. Based on the user's knowledge, intelligent evaluator system makes a decision to suggest the Location or to suggest a new topic retrieved from the knowledge base.

The averaged one-dependence estimators (AODE) is a classifier that averages ODEs, which are ANB models. However, the expressiveness of AODE is still limited by the restricted structure of ODE. In this paper, we propose a model averaging method for NB Trees (NBTs) with flexible structures and present experimental results in terms of classification accuracy. Results of comparative experiments show that our proposed method outperforms AODE on classification accuracy.

This paper presents a comparison of three different algorithmic schemes for single-trial ERP detection: SVM (baseline), hierarchical SVM-(naive) Bayes, selected temporal windows-based SVM-(naive) Bayes. An ERP-based image search system, including experimental setup, data collection, pre-processing, and three ERP detection schemes is described and utilized as the framework for comparison. We apply three schemes on EEG data from four subjects acquired on four days (eight sessions) each. Results indicate that a properly trained SVM operating on data from the post-stimulus [0,500]ms interval and SVMs trained on 50ms nonoverlapping windows spanning the poststimulus [200,450]ms interval (where P300 is expected) whose binary decisions are fused via the naive-Bayes approach perform similarly in terms of area under the ROC curve measure, while the latter fusion approach applied to all ten nonoverlapping windows spanning the [0,500]ms poststimulus interval is inferior. The poststimulus time limit of 500ms is imposed on all data that goes into the ER-P detector because in our experimental setup the subjects are asked to press a button when they recognize the event of. interest, which creates motor responses in the brain typically in the [600,800]ms interval and around.

Since trained classifiers using imbalanced data are mostly derived from the majority class, their prediction performance is poor for the minority class. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble learning method based on an active example selection algorithm to resolve the imbalanced data problem. To compensate a possible sub-optimal classifier, our proposed ensemble learning methods aggregates classifiers built by the active example selection algorithm. We implement this ensemble learning method based on the active example selection algorithm using incremental naive Bayes classifiers. Our empirical results show that we greatly improve the performance of classification models trained by five real world imbalanced biomedical data. The proposed ensemble learning methods outperforms other approaches by 0.03 similar to 0.15 in terms of AUC which solve imbalanced data problem.

We present Markov conditional mixtures of naive Bayes models with spatiotemporal regularization constraints in a transductive learning and inference framework. The proposed model extends on previous work [3] to account for non independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sequential data by imposing the learning and inference problem w.r.t. time. The multimodal mixture assumption on the class-conditional likelihood for each covariate feature domain in conjunction with spatiotemporal regularization constraints allow us to explain more complex distributions required for classification in multimodal longitudinal brain imagery. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on multimodal temporal MRI brain images using ROC statistics and report preliminary results.

Prior to the feature selection, 114 parameters were extracted as the original feature set based on EMD, AR model, statistical methods and entropy. Then the ReliefF was employed to evaluate the quality of every individual feature and a sequential feature sets were obtained according to the marks evaluated by ReliefF. Then the cross validation technique was used to get the candidate feature set from the sequential sets. At the second stage, the genetic algorithm was utilized to search a more compact feature set based on the candidate set. Three different classifiers means the LDC (linear discriminant classifier), KNNC (k nearest neighbors classifier) and NBC (naive bayes classifier) were employed to evaluate the proposed method The application results to the real gear fault diagnosis have shown that the proposed method can obtain a higher performance with a small size feature set.

The main problem is that previous approaches still suffer from the difficulty to produce effective samples for training classifiers. In recent research, a new sampling technique, called Progressive Border Sampling (PBS), has been proposed to produce a small sample from the original labelled training set by identifying and augmenting border points. However, border sampling on multi-class domains is not a trivial issue. Training sets contain much redundancy and noise in practical applications. In this work, we discuss several issues related to PBS and show that PBS can be used to produce effective samples by removing redundancies and noise from training sets for training classifiers.

By allowing one-order attribute dependencies, one-dependence estimators (ODEs) have been shown to be able to approximate the ground-truth attribute dependencies whilst keeping the effectiveness of probability estimation, and therefore leading to excellent performance. In previous studies, however, ODEs were exploited in simple ways, such as by averaging, for classification. In this paper, we propose a semi-naive exploitation of ODEs that fits a function of ODEs to pursue higher-order attribute dependencies. Extensive experiments show that the proposed SNODE approach can achieve better performance than many state-of-the-art Bayesian classifiers.

In such models, words are independent on one another and their semantic relations are unrevealed. This paper proposes a vector-space-based text analyzer by introducing conceptual semantic similarity into traditional vector-space-based models. Naive Bayes classification technology is also adopted into this new analyzer. Experiment results indicate that the new analyzer can improve text classification.

In this paper, we present a strategy for solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN) detection using radiology knowledge-based feature extraction scheme and biomimetic pattern recognition (BPR). The proposed feature extraction scheme intends to synthesize comprehensive information of SPN according to radiology knowledge, e.g. grey level features, morphological, texture and spatial context features. Using support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB) and BPR as the classifiers to evaluate different feature representation schemes, our experimental study shows that the proposed radiology knowledge-based features can significantly improve the classification effectiveness of SPN detection from nonnodules, in terms of accuracy and F(1) value, regardless of the classifiers used. We also note that BPR can deliver a consistent performance using our knowledge-based features, even the ratios between nonnodules and nodules are quite different in the training set.

On the Classification Performance of TAN and General Bayesian Networks	RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS XXV			English	Proceedings Paper	28th SGAI International Conference on Innovative Techniques and Applications of Artificial Intelligence	DEC, 2008	Cambridge, ENGLAND	British Comp Soc Specialist Grp Artificial Intelligence			CLASSIFIERS	Over a decade ago, Friedman et al. introduced the Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN) classifier, with experiments indicating that it significantly Outperformed Naive Bayes (NB) in terms of classification accuracy, whereas general Bayesian network (GBN) classifiers performed no better than NB. This paper challenges those claims, using a careful experimental analysis to show that GBN classifiers significantly outperform NB on datasets analyzed, and are comparable to TAN performance. It is found that the poor performance reported by Friedman et al. are not attributable to the GBN per se, but rather to their use of simple empirical frequencies to estimate GBN parameters, whereas basic parameter smoothing (used in their TAN analyses but not their GBN analyses) improves GBN performance significantly. It is concluded that, while GBN classifiers may have some limitations, they deserve greater attention, particularly in domains where insight into classification decisions, as well as good accuracy, is required.

Given a set of documents, the system automatically extracts the mentioned topics and assists the user to select their optimal number. The user-validated topics are exploited to build a model for multi-label document classification. While topic extraction is performed by using an optimized implementation of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model, multi-label document classification is performed by using a specialized version of the Multi-Net Naive Bayes model. The performance of the system is investigated by using 10,056 documents retrieved from the WEB through a set of queries formed by exploiting the Italian Google Directory. This dataset is used for topic extraction while an independent dataset, consisting of 1,012 elements labeled by humans, is used to evaluate the performance of the Multi-Net Naive Bayes model. The results are satisfactory, with precision being consistently better than recall for the labels associated with the four most frequent topics.

The effects of preprocessing and incorporating additional features on the classifiers were examined. The preliminary experimental results show that the use of preprocessing and incorporating additional features produced no significant gain or loss in classification efficiency. However the feature space used by the classification methods decreased, which could be beneficial for resource limited environments. In addition the solutions to the SMS text classification may be applied to other problems, like the classification of English sentences. Our collection of text messages may not be statistically significant, because of very limited sources for text messages.

In our previous studies [1] and [2] mixed-metrics were proposed in order to combine color and texture metrics for image retrieval task. It was shown that it is always possible to mark out the best mixed-metrics for every group of similar images and improve retrieval effectiveness. In order to get the proper mixed-metrics a particular query-image should be classified to one of the predefined groups of perceptually similar images and this should be done in the real-time mode while processing the query and retrieving the result. In our previous work [3] the highly specialized classification method was proposed to solve this task. In the current study Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers are discussed and applied to the mixed-metrics approach to image retrieval. Classification result for these classifiers in comparison with the classifier, proposed in [3], are presented.

The survival data is modeled using a Coxian phase-type distribution which is associated with the inter-related variables using a range of possible data mining approaches such as Bayesian networks (BNs), the Naive Bayes Classification method and classification regression trees. This paper utilizes the Discrete Conditional Phase-type model (DC-Ph) to explore the modeling of patient waiting times in an Accident and Emergency Department of a UK hospital. The resulting DC-Ph model takes on the form of the Coxian phase-type distribution conditioned on the outcome of a logistic regression model.

Classifying Text with Statistically Selected Features to Closely Related Categories	2009 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN RECENT TECHNOLOGIES IN COMMUNICATION AND COMPUTING (ARTCOM 2009)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing	OCT 27-28, 2009	Kerala, INDIA			Text Classification; Naive Bayes Classifier; Supervised learning; Feature selection; chi-square statistics		Text Classification is continuing to be one of the most researched problems due to continuously-increasing amount of electronic documents and digital data. Classifying documents to closely related categories is the most complex task in text categorization. Feature selection is an essential preprocessing step for improving the efficiency and accuracy of the text classifiers by removing redundant and irrelevant terms from the training corpus. In this paper, a novel feature selection algorithm based on chi-square statistics, have been proposed for Naive Bayes classifier. The proposed feature selection method not only identifies the related features for a class, but also determines the type of dependency between the feature and category. The performance of the classifier with the features selected by the proposed method and the features selected by conventional chi-square max method are compared for closely related categories. Experiments were conducted with randomly chosen training documents from six closely related categories of 20Newsgroup Benchmarks. Experimental results show that the classifier has better classifying accuracy with positive features selected by the proposed method.	[Meena, M.

A Higher Order Collective Classifier for Detecting and Classifying Network Events	ISI: 2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics	JUN 08-11, 2009	Richardson, TX	Univ Arizona	Univ Texas, Dallas			Labeled Data is scarce. Most statistical machine learning techniques rely on the availability of a large labeled corpus for building robust models for prediction and classification. In this paper we present a Higher Order Collective Classifier (HOCC) based on Higher Order Learning, a statistical machine learning technique that leverages latent information present in co-occurrences of items across records. These techniques violate the IID assumption that underlies most statistical machine learning techniques and have in prior work outperformed first order techniques in the presence of very limited data. We present results of applying HOCC to two different network data sets, first for detection and classification of anomalies in a Border Gateway Protocol dataset and second for building models of users from Network File System calls to perform masquerade detection. The precision of our system has been shown to be 30% better than the standard Naive Bayes technique for masquerade detection. These results indicate that HOCC can successfully model a variety of network events and can be applied to solve difficult problems in security using the general framework proposed.

However, in literature, there is no standard color space in which a particular color points are represented for computer vision tasks. In this paper, we evaluated 11 color models with three different learning schemas for their performance in classifying tumor-related colors. The color models we studied are CIELAB, CIELUV, CIEXYZ, CMY, CMYK, HSL, HSV, Hunter-LAB, NRGB, RGB, and SCT. With 11 color models, prediction accuracies of three well-known classifiers, namely SVMs, C4.5, and Naive Bayes, are statistically compared on a large dataset of 3494 Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) stained histopathologic images. Surprisingly, experiment results show that in contrast to general assumptions, there is no single model that is better than others in every case. However, C4.5 outperformed other two classifiers by obtaining average F-measure of 0.9989.

The proposed method is based on the regression tree of data mining. In recent years, the power market becomes more deregulated and competitive. As a result, the distribution generation is introduced in power systems. As clean energy, power utilities are quite interested in wind power generation. However, it is difficult to deal with wind power generation due to the uncertainty of the wind power output. In this paper, an efficient method is proposed to construct rules of data and forecast the wind speed. This paper makes use of NBTree as the prediction model. It is a hybrid model of C4.5 and Naive Bayes (NB). The proposed method is successfully applied to real data for wind speed.

The Discriminative Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier has been a focus of research in the field of text classification. This paper increases the accuracy of Discriminative Multinomial Bayesian Classifier with the usage of the feature selection technique that evaluates the worth of an attribute by computing the value of the chi-squared statistic with respect to the class. We performed a large-scale comparison on benchmark datasets with other state-of-the-art algorithms and the proposed methodology had greater accuracy in most cases.

Vietnamese is a different language with different features and it is not clear whether the standard methods will work on the categorization of Vietnamese documents. This paper describes morphological level document representtations that are appropriate for Vietnamese text documents and investigates the effectiveness of several standard learning algorithms including Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbour (ICNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with four different kernel functions. The results show that it is possible to build effective and efficient classifiers for Vietnamese text categorization using our representations and the standard algorithms, and demonstrate that the performance can be improved by using infogain for feature selection and using an external dictionary for filtering the vocabulary.

The corpora of aviation domain are firstly segmented by LIP platform from HIT. Then four feature selection methods and two classifiers are applied to extract definitions. First of all, we summarize the correct proportion of feature subset used in classification of term definitions, and secondly argue that the naive bayes classifier combined with CHI or ODDS for feature selection achieve the best score in the F1-measure and F2-measure. In the end, we recognize that the use of SVM classifier with linear kernel could achieve very high precision, but the worst recall.

To achieve this goal a two phase strategy was followed. In the first phase, a common representation procedure was considered, based on a Naive-Bayes classifier methodology. Conditional probabilities parameters were initially evaluated through a frequency estimation method and after that optimized using a Genetic Algorithm approach. In a second phase, a combination scheme was proposed exploiting the particular features of Bayes probabilistic reasoning. This strategy was applied to describe and combine SCORE, ASSIGN and Framingham models. Validation results were obtained based on individual models, assuming their statistical correctness. The achieved results are very promising, showing the potential of the strategy to accomplish the desired goals.

Unfortunately the classification process can be time-consuming and users are still required to spend considerable amount of time scanning through the classified Web documents to identify the ones that satisfy their information needs. In solving this problem, we first introduce Car Sum, an extractive single-document summarization approach, which is simple and effective in performing the summarization task, since it only relies on word similarity to generate high-quality summaries. Hereafter we train a Naive Bayes classifier on Cor Sum-generated summaries and verify the classification accuracy using the summaries and the speed-up during the process. Experimental results on the DUC-2002 and 20 Newsgroups datasets show that CorSum outperforms other extractive summarization methods, and classification time is significantly reduced using CorSum-generated summaries with compatible accuracy. More importantly, browsing summaries, instead of entire documents, classified to topic-oriented categories facilitates the information searching process on the Web.

Text mining is the process of extracting interesting information and knowledge from unstructured text. One key difficulty with text classification learning algorithms is that they require many hand-labeled documents to learn accurately. In the text mining pattern discovery phase, the text classification step aims to automatically attribute one or more pre-defined classes to text documents. In this research, we propose to use an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled documents based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization (EM) and a naive Bayes classifier on a grid environment, this combination is based on a mixture of multinomials, which is commonly used in text classification. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic approach to inductive learning. It estimates the a posteriori probability that a document belongs to a class given the observed feature values of the document, assuming independence of the features. The class with the maximum a posteriori probability is assigned to the document. EM is a class of iterative algorithms for maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimation in problems with unlabeled data. The grid environment is a geographically distributed computation infrastructure composed of a set of heterogeneous resources. Text classification mining methods are time-consuming, but using the grid infrastructure can bring significant benefits in the learning and classification process.	[Roncero, V. G.; Costa, M. C.

This classification task implies the learning in a high dimensional feature space. So, it is an example of how the DTB algorithm performs in such feature space problems. In [1], it has been shown that hypotheses computed by the DTB model are more comprehensible that the ones computed by another ensemble methods. Hence, this paper tries to show that the DTB algorithm maintains the same comprehensibility of hypothesis in high dimensional feature space problems while achieving the performance of other ensemble methods. Four traditional evaluation measures (precision, recall, F1 and accuracy) have been considered for performance comparison between DTB and others models usually applied to spam email filtering. The size of the hypothesis computed by a DTB is smaller and more comprehensible than the hypothesis computed by Adaboost and Naive Bayes.

Selection of a suitable filter is very important to solve power quality problems perfectly. Since filter selection depend on a lot of parameters of power system, decision support systems can be employed in filter selection. In this paper, "An Intelligent Decision Support System, IDSS" is proposed. The system determines efficiency of three phase shunt active power filter for the power quality problems. The system developed converts the parameters obtained into the useful data at rule-based inference mechanism then the useful data are evaluated in Naive Bayes classifier. Thus a low cost decision support system has been developed to guide the users in the rate of suitability of three phase shunt active power for solution the power quality problems.

Privacy-Preserving Evaluation of Generalization Error and Its Application to Model and Attribute Selection	ADVANCES IN MACHINE LEARNING, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	1st Asian Conference on Machine Learning	NOV 02-04, 2009	Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA	Nanjing Univ, LAMIDA Grp, Natl Sci Fdn China, IEEE Comp Soc Nanjing Chapter				Privacy-preserving classification is the task of learning or training a classifier on the union of privately distributed datasets without sharing the datasets. The emphasis of existing studies in privacy-preserving classification has primarily been put on the design of privacy-preserving versions of particular data mining algorithms, However, in classification problems, preprocessing and postprocessing-such as model selection or attribute selection-play a prominent role in achieving higher classification accuracy. In this paper, we show generalization error of classifiers in privacy-preserving classification can be securely evaluated without sharing prediction results. Our main technical contribution is a new generalized Hamming distance protocol that is universally applicable to preprocessing and postprocessing of various privacy-preserving classification problems, such as model selection in support vector machine and attribute selection in naive Bayes classification.

Although Machine learning techniques have been used earlier in many semantic integration approaches, dependence on precision recall curves to preset the weights and thresholds of the learning systems has been a serious bottleneck. By recasting the mapping problem to a classification problem we try to automate this step and develop a robust and extendable meta learning algorithm. The implication is that we can now extend the same method to map the ontology pairs with different similarity measures which might not be specialized for the specific domain, yet obtain results comparable to the state of the art mapping algorithms that exploit machine learning methods. Interestingly we see that as the similarity measures are diluted, our approach performs significantly better for unbalanced classes. We have tested our approach using several similarity measures and two real world ontologies, and the test results we discuss validate our claim. We also present a discussion on the benefits of the proposed meta learning algorithm.

But it has a strict assumption about the independence for each attribute, which is not obviously hold in real world domains. Many efforts have been made to relax the independence and improve the performance of the naive Bayesian classifier. Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN) classifier was proved to be one of the best methods. In this paper, we analyze the implementations of distribution-based TAN classifier and the classification-based TAN classifier. Then we utilize the information theory to compute the influence between two attributes, and then proposed a new heuristic searching measurement for the tree structure. The experimental results have shown the advantage of the new classifier.

Manual work still dominates the process of model generation, however, and leads to the huge gap between the number of complete genomes and genome-scale metabolic models. The challenge in constructing genome-scale models from existing databases is that usually such a directly extracted model is incomplete and contains network holes. Network holes occur when a network is disconnected and certain metabolites cannot be produced or consumed. In order to construct a valid metabolic model, network holes need to be filled by introducing candidate reactions into the network. As a step toward the high-throughput generation of biological models, we propose a Bayesian approach to improving draft genome-scale metabolic models. A collection of 23 types of biological and topological evidence is extracted from the SEED [1), KEGG [2], and BiGG [3] databases. Based on this evidence, we create 23 individual predictors using Bayesian approaches. To combine these individual predictors and unify their predictive results, we build an ensemble of individual predictors on majority vote and four classifiers: naive Bayes classifier, Bayesian network, multilayer perceptron network and AdaBoost. A set of experiments is performed to train and test individual predictors and integrative mechanisms of single predictors and to evaluate the performance of our approach.

However, many of the techniques that have been developed are designed for simplified situations. In this paper we discuss a more complex situation, namely recognizing activities when they are interweaved in complex and realistic scenarios. This technology is beneficial for monitoring the health of smart environment residents and for correlating activities with parameters such as energy usage. We describe our approach to interleaved activity recognition and evaluate various probabilistic techniques for activity recognition. We validate our algorithm on real sensor data collecting in our smart apartment testbed.

An important advantage of these classification systems is that, using Association Rule Mining (ARM) they are able to examine several features at a time. While other state of art methods like decision tree or naive bayes classifiers consider that feature is independent of each other. Many applications can benefit from good classification model. Associative classifiers are especially fit to applications where the model may assist the domain experts in their decisions. There are many domains such as medical, where the maximum accuracy of the model is desired and hence the accuracy of the associative classifiers. In this paper, we propose a new framework (associative classifier) that uses weighted association rule mining (WARM). In any prediction model all attributes do not have same importance in predicting the class label. So different weights can be assigned to different attributes according to their predicting capability. We propose a theoretical model to introduce new associative classifier that takes advantage of weighted association rule mining. The model can he applied in any domain to improve the prediction accuracy.

For web page classification, we want to find a subset of words which help to discriminate between different kinds of web pages, so we introduced feature selection. In this paper, we study some feature selection methods such as ReliefF and Symmetrical Uncertainty. Also, the high dimensional text vocabulary space is one of the main challenges of web pages, we used Hidden Naive Bayes, Complement class Naive Bayes and other traditional techniques for web page classification. Results on benchmark dataset show that the abilities of HNB perform more satisfying than other methods and SU is more competitive than ReliefF for relevant words selection in web pages categorization.

A subset of the features was estimated in training data; another subset of the features was trained by discriminative function. The results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid algorithm almost always outperforms the naive bayes algorithms and perceptron algorithms whether the training set is small or not. On the other hand, a novel feature representation was proposed, which included term sequence feature, term appearance features and context information features. Comparing the previous method, long-range dependence was considered in the proposed feature representation, which add the position of feature into vector space model (VSM) and promotes the capability of feature representation. Further, punctuation feature is the important character for terms relation extraction.

One important property of such systems is agent autonomy. An aspect of agent autonomy, enactive knowledge, is investigated here through a Bayesian extension called TAN that supports learning through interactions with the environment. Finally, various scenarios are simulated for an appropriate modelling environment with suggestions for future work.			adelinat@sunway.edu.my					ARNBORG S, 1987, SIAM J ALGEBRA DISCR, V8, P277, DOI 10.1137/0608024; BOLEY H, 2007, IN IEEE INT C DIG EC, P398; CHICKERING DM, 1996, LEARNING DATA ARTIFI, V5; COOPER GF, 1990, ARTIF INTELL, V42, P393, DOI 10.1016/0004-3702(90)90060-D; Duda R.O., 2001, PATTERN CLASSIFICATI; Friedman N, 1997, MACH LEARN, V29, P131, DOI 10.1023/A:1007465528199; Giorgini P., 2005, AGENT ORIENTED METHO, P1; Hexmoor H, 2001, IEEE T SYST MAN CY C, V31, P509, DOI 10.1109/5326.983934; LAURITZEN SL, 1988, J ROY STAT SOC B MET, V50, P157; Lehman JF, 2006, GENTLE INTRO SOAR AR; Lopardo Gabriel Alejandro, 2008, 2008 Mexican International Conference on Computer Science, DOI 10.1109/ENC.2008.25; NIAZA M, 2009, IEEE COMMUNICAT  MAR, P166; Noe Alva, 2005, ACTION PERCEPTION; PEARL J, 1988, M KAUFMANN SERIES RE; Wang Y., 2003, Proceedings IEEE/WIC International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI 2003); Wilensky U., 1999, NETLOGO; 2004, EUROPEAN COORDINATIO; 2007, 4 INT C EN INT EN 07	18	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	2150-4938		978-1-4244-2345-3	I C DIGIT ECOSYST TE			2009							114	119				6	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BPK74	WOS:000279101500021

Sixty percent of P. falciparum genes have no known function and therefore new methods of gene function prediction are needed. To address this problem, we train a naive Bayes classifier on multiple sources of data and subsequently apply a modified version of the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis Algorithm to predict gene function in P. falciparum. To define gene function, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the Gene Ontology, specifically using the Biological Process category. We demonstrate the value of integrating multiple data sources by achieving accurate predictions on genes that cannot be annotated using simple sequence similarity based methods.	[Tedder, Philip M.

The misclassification costs of two classes are not equal nor are known. It is critical to find the optimum bound, i.e. threshold, which would best separate defective and defect-free classes in software data. We have applied decision threshold optimization on Naive Bayes classifier in order to find the optimum threshold for software defect data. ROC analyses show that decision threshold optimization significantly decreases false alarms (on the average by 11%) without changing probabiliry of detection rates.

Since the class distribution of dataset is highly imbalanced (11% Pozitive and 89% Negative implantation outcomes) the decision threshold of Naive Bayes classifier has been optimized using the features of ROC analysis. Experimental results show that classification with optimized threshold performs better than classification with default threshold.

We have applied Naive Bayes classifier to an original IVF dataset in order to discriminate embryos according to implantation potentials. The dataset we analyzed represents an imbalanced distribution of positive and negative instances. In order to deal with the problem of imbalance, we examined the effects of over sampling the minority class, under sampling the majority class and adjustment of the decision threshold on the classification performance. We have used features of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves in the evaluation of experiments. Our results revealed that it is possible to obtain optimum True Positive and False Positive Rates simply by adjusting the decision threshold. Under-sampling experiments show that we can achieve same prediction performance with less data as well as 736 embryo samples.	[Uyar, Asli; Bener, Ayse; Ciray, H.

Fuzzy Naive Bayesian model for Medical Diagnostic Decision Support	2009 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	SEP 03-06, 2009	Minneapolis, MN	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			COMPUTER; CLASSIFICATION; MULTICENTER; SYSTEM	This work relates to the development of computational algorithms to provide decision support to physicians. The authors propose a Fuzzy Naive Bayesian (FNB) model for medical diagnosis, which extends the Fuzzy Bayesian approach proposed by Okuda. A physician's interview based method is described to define a orthogonal fuzzy symptom information system, required to apply the model. For the purpose of elaboration and elicitation of characteristics, the algorithm is applied to a simple simulated dataset, and compared with conventional Naive Bayes (NB) approach. As a preliminary evaluation of FNB in real world scenario, the comparison is repeated on a real fuzzy dataset of 81 patients diagnosed with infectious diseases. The case study on simulated dataset elucidates that FNB can be optimal over NB for diagnosing patients with imprecise-fuzzy information, on account of the following characteristics-1) it can model the information that, values of some attributes are semantically closer than values of other attributes, and 2) it offers a mechanism to temper exaggerations in patient information. Although the algorithm requires precise training data, its utility for fuzzy training data is argued for. This is supported by the case study on infectious disease dataset, which indicates optimality of FNB over NB for the infectious disease domain. Further case studies on large datasets are required to establish utility of FNB.

First, the latent variables in Latent Dirichlet Conditional Naive-Bayes Models(LD-CNB) are redefined and some terminologies are defined. Second, Variational approximation inference for LD-CNB is stated in detail. Third, base on the variational approximation inference, we design a distributed EM algorithm for privacy preservation clustering. Finally, some datasets from UCI are chosen for experiment, Compared with the distributed k-means algorithm, the results show LD-CNB algorithm does work better and LD-CNB can work distributed, so LD-CNB can protect privacy information.

Existing research efforts such as Google AdSense and MSRA VideoSense/ImageSense have been devoted to the less intrusive insertion of relevant textual or video ads in streams or web pages through text/image/video content analysis whereas the inherent semantics of video ads is much less exploited. In this paper, we propose to link video ads with relevant product/service information across E-commerce websites or portals towards ad recommendation in a cross-media manner. Firstly, we carry out semantic analysis within ad videos in which Frames Marked with Product Images (FMPI) are extracted. Secondly, we link ad videos with relevant ads on the Web by utilizing FMPI to search visually similar Product Images (e.g. appearance or logo) and to collect their accompanying text (brand name, category, description, or other tags) over popular E-commerce websites or portals such as EBay, Amazon, Taobao, etc. We search visually similar product images with Local Sensitive Hashing (LSH) in a Naive Bayes Near Neighbor classifier. Finally, we may recommend more relevant products/services for ad videos through ranking those matched product images and categorizing useful tags of top ranked ads from the Web. Preliminary experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the idea of linking ad videos with product/service information from the Web.

Most popular tools for structural annotation of genomes are determined by computational pipelines. It is well-known that these computational methods have a number of shortcomings including false identifications and incorrect identification of gene boundaries. Proteomic data can used to confirm the identification of genes identified by computational methods and correct mistakes. A Proteogenomic mapping method has been developed, which uses peptides identified from mass spectrometry for structural annotation of genomes. Spectra are matched against both a protein database and the genome database translated in all six reading frames. Those peptides that match the genome but not the protein database potentially represent novel protein coding genes, annotation errors. These short experimentally derived peptides are used to discover potential novel protein coding genes called expressed Protein Sequence Tags (ePSTs) by aligning the peptides to the genomic DNA and extending the translation in the 3 ' and 5 ' direction. In the paper, an enhanced pipeline, has been designed and developed for discovering and evaluating of potential novel protein coding genes: 1) a distance-based outlier detection method for validating peptides identified from MS/MS, 2) a proteogenomic mapping for discovery of potential novel protein coding genes, 3) collection of evidence front a number of sources and automatically evaluate potential novel protein coding genes by using machine learning techniques, such as Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes etc.	[Wang, Nan] Univ So Mississippi, Sch Comp, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA	Wang, N (reprint author), Univ So Mississippi, Sch Comp, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA.	burgess@cvm.msstate.edu					Delcher AL, 1999, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V27, P4636, DOI 10.1093/nar/27.23.4636; Jaffe JD, 2004, PROTEOMICS, V4, P59, DOI 10.1002/pmic.200300511; Kalume DE, 2005, BMC GENOMICS, V6, DOI 10.1186/1471-2164-6-128; Lukashin AV, 1998, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V26, P1107, DOI 10.1093/nar/26.4.1107; Mann M, 2001, TRENDS BIOCHEM SCI, V26, P54, DOI 10.1016/S0968-0004(00)01726-6; WANG N, MCBIOS2009 OAKL OK F; WEKA SG, 1995, P NZ COMP SCI RES ST, P57	7	0	0	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA			978-0-7695-3739-9				2009							103	106		10.1109/IJCBS.2009.126		4	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Mathematical & Computational Biology	Computer Science; Mathematical & Computational Biology	BRI88	WOS:000282797800017

The key issue for active learning to solve is how to select the most "valuable" training samples to reduce labeled cost of amount of unlabeled samples. In the paper,we propose an efficient active Bayes classifier by using Affinity Propagation (AP) to select the most valuable samples on the unlabeled data sets.Firstly, the method clusters amount of unlabeled sample data by using AP algorithm.Secondly,through exemplars obtained from the results of cluster and similarity matrix,the method selects the unlabeled samples for experts to label. The method choose two kinds of most valuable instances to label: one is cluster center instance, which also called exemplar instance.Another is the instance which stays in the farthest position to the cluster center in the same cluster,that is,the sample which sets in the nearest position to the cluster boundary. The experiment results on UCI data sets demonstrate that our method is simple and more efficient compared with traditional active learning method.

The performance comparisons of single and combined classification algorithms were used for classifying the conduct disorder of vocational students in Thailand. Single classification included the performance comparisons of four classifiers: 1) Naive Bayes 2) Bayesian Belief Network 3) C4.5 algorithm and 4) RIPPER algorithm. Combined classification included two steps: attributes filtration and data classification. First step was the attribute selection technique named genetic search. Then, results were assessed by using three evaluators: 1) Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) 2) Consistency-based Subset Evaluation and 3) Wrapper Subset Evaluation. Second step was the classification of data set by using selected attributed from the first step and four classification algorithms used for single classification. Next, the measurements of classification accuracy had been performed by using the k-fold Cross Validation technique for both single and combined classifications. The outperformed classification model from single and combined classifications was identified. The model was named Conduct Disorder Classification Model (CDCM). It was found that combined classification using genetic search and wrapper subset evaluator with Decision Tree (C4.5) algorithm, had the highest accuracy rate at 83.01%. As well, results from CDCM evaluation showed that factors associated with conduct disorders of students included (1) grade point average a high school, (2) gender, (3) age. (4) father income, (5) grade of typing I subject, (6) height, (7) blood group and (8) grade of business subject. Future works were also suggested.

Many methods can be used to build classifiers, such as the decision tree, Bayesian method, instance-based learning, artificial neural network and support vector machine. This paper focuses on the classification methods based on decision tree learning, Bayesian learning, and instance-based learning. In each kind of classification methods, many improvements have been presented to scale up the classification accuracy of the basic algorithm. The paper also studies and compares the classification performance on classification accuracy empirically, using the whole 36 UCI data sets obtained from various sources selected by Weka.

Most published methods and algorithms may succeed in one aspect while neglecting the other. In this paper, we proposed an adaptive ensemble classifier for Concept drifting stream classification which focuses on both the above two aspects called AEC Our AEC includes two stages: the online stage and the offline stage, and three phases: classifier updating, ensemble classifiers reconstruction and component classifier subset selection for final decision. We take a new online bagging classification model that is based on incremental learner such as Naive Bayes classifier and can keep enough history information and create good diversity between different component classifiers. Then we take an offline scheme to do the ensemble reconstruction and ensemble subset selection: that is to drop certain number of classifiers periodically and use only a portion of the whole ensemble, the combination Of which may yield better accuracy to make classification. Experiment justifies the superiority of our model in both accuracy and sensitivity in the concept drifting environment.

Decision region is the region in which data are predicted the same class label by a classifier. Decision boundary is the boundary between re-ions of different classes: We view classification as dividing the data space into decision regions. The formal definitions of decision region and decision boundary are presented in this paper, and then the relationship between classification models and decision boundaries are studied. We present the analytical expressions of decision boundaries of four typical classifiers, which are C4.5 algorithm, back propagation (BP) neural network, naive Bayes classifier and support vector machine (SVM). Comparative experiments are performed to illustrate different decision boundaries of these four classifiers. Decision boundaries of ensemble learning are discussed. The concept of probability gradient region is introduced for probability based classifiers, and SOMPGRV algorithm is proposed for visualizing probability gradient regions.

The complexity together with the necessity to have accurate and last algorithms yield to many attempts in this field, but there is a. long way to solve these problems efficiently, yet. The importance of the problem encouraged us to work on a new approach as a solution. We use the content of web pages together with the link structure between them to improve the accuracy of results. In this work we use Naive-bayes models for each predefined webpage class and an extended version of Hidden Markov Model is used as website class models. A few sample websites are adopted as seeds to calculate models' parameters. For classifying the websites we represent them with tree structures and we modify the Viterbi algorithm to evaluate the probability of generating these tree structures by every website model. Because of the large amount of pages in a website, we use a sampling technique that not only reduces tire running tune of the algorithm but also improves the accuracy of the classification process. At the end of this paper, we provide some experimental results which show the performance of our algorithm compared to the previous ones.

The Impact of Pruning BayesFuzzy Rule Set	2009 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS DESIGN AND APPLICATIONS			English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications	NOV 30-DEC 02, 2009	Pisa, ITALY	Machine Intelligence Res Lab, IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc (SMCS), Int Fuzzy Syst Assoc, European Neural Network Soc, European Soc Fuzzy Log & Technol, World Fed Soft Comp	Univ Pisa			The use of Bayesian Network Classifiers (BCs) combined with the Fuzzy rule model to explain the learned BCs have been previously presented as the BayesFuzzy approach. This paper follows along BayesFuzzy lines of investigation aiming at improving the comprehensibility of a BC model and enhancing BayesFuzzy results by combining new pruning methods. In order to improve BayesFuzzy performance, in addition to the Markov Blanket-based pruning idea used by BayesFuzzy, two other pruning methods are proposed, implemented and empirically evaluated. The first pruning method is based on the conditional probability estimates given by the BC and the second one is the well-known post-rule pruning approach, usually used to prune rules extracted from decision trees. Also, three different Bayesian Networks induction algorithms, namely IC, K2 and Naive-Bayes, as well as, the C4.5 Decision Tree induction algorithms are employed in the empirical comparative analysis performed in the experiments. The obtained results reveal that BayesFuzzy combined with the new pruning methods can bring comprehensibility enhancements.

In this paper, a multimodal approach is proposed to infer human semantic interactions in meeting discussions. The human interaction, such as proposing an idea, giving comments, expressing a positive opinion, etc., implies user role, attitude, or intention toward a topic. Our approach infers human interactions based on a variety of audiovisual and high-level features, e.g., gestures, attention, speech tone, speaking time, interaction occasion, and information about the previous interaction. Four different inference models including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bayesian Net, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree are selected and compared in human interaction recognition. Our experimental results show that SVM outperforms other inference models, we can successfully infer human interactions with a recognition rate around 80%, and our multimodal approach achieves robust and reliable results by leveraging on the characteristics of each single modality.

This requires documents to be categorized according to some criteria. In this paper we analyze the behaviour of classification techniques such as Naive Bayes, Winnow, SVMs and k-NN, together with lemmatization and noun selection, in the categorization of documents written in Basque. In a second experiment, we study the effect of applying the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) dimensionality reduction technique before using the mentioned classification techniques. The results obtained show that the approach which combines SVD and k-NN for a lemmatized corpus gives the best categorization of all with a remarkable difference. The final aim pursued in this project is to facilitate the semiautomatic construction of the domain module of a CSLS.

Machine learning techniques have been employed to predict protein-protein interactions. One of such approaches is Naive Bayes approach which assumes conditional independence between features. And such problems as suffering from the missing value problems or being prohibitively time-consuming prevent them from being applied to predict PPI as readily as NB. In this work, we frame predicting PPI as a communication problem, and we train a classifier based on channel model (CBCM) to discriminate between pairs of proteins that are co-complexed and pairs that are not. We theoretically demonstrate that NB can be unified into CBCM in certain condition and also experimentally validate that CBCM is an effective approach for predicting co-complexed protein pairs from integrating diverse biological data. Our study suggests that PPI prediction problem can be effectively solved from the point view of communication problem.

Affect expression ill speech generally differs from culture to culture, from female to male. In this study, we focus on affect sensing from speech for different gender user groups for young people. So far our work mainly concentrates on the sensing of five basic emotions (including 'happiness', 'sadness', 'fear', 'surprise', and 'anger') and 'neutral' from speech. Detailed acoustic features have been extracted after analysis of speech data from one chosen male and female speaker. Our affect sensing component has been implemented under the theory of naive Bayes classifier. We have also evaluated it using new test data. Our work contributes to the conference themes oil intelligent technologies - machine learning and affective speech processing.

On the basis of immune algorithm, we propose a new method of text categorization called the Clonal Selection Algorithm Based on Antibody Density (CSABAD). According to the clonal selection principle and density control mechanism, only those cells that have higher affinity and lower density are selected to proliferate. The ultimate classifier is composed with many memory cells. Because CSABAD is a two-class algorithm, we discuss the main approaches how to apply it to the multi-class problem, such as one-vs-one (OVO), one-vs-rest (OVR) and directed acyclic graph (DAG). Our experiments show that one-vs-one obtains the best classification performance on the 20_newsgroups dataset. In addition, the experiment results also show that it significantly outperforms Rocchio and Naive Bayes.

According to the clonal selection principle and density control mechanism, only those cells that have higher affinity and lower density are selected to proliferate. In addition, we propose an improved approach, called Term Frequency, Inverted Document Frequency and Inverted Entropy (TFIDFIE), to compute term weights in document indexing. It considers the distribution of documents in the training set in which the term occurs.

AdaBoostM1 algorithm can improve the classification performance. The different TAN classifiers can be seen as a series of basic classifiers and are iterated through boosting. Based on the discussion of fault classification methods and a bias analysis of dissolved gas data of thirteen usual transformer faults, a combinatorial Bayesian network using boosting algorithm is introduced to realize the multi-resolution recognition of the insulation faults, which not only can make the fault diagnosis be more exact. Moreover, by comparing with the other method like naive Bayes, the proposed model reduces the error ratio, and recognition results show that this model is effective.

But TAN classifier was built by the conventional passive learning. The available training samples with actual classes are not enough for passive learning method for modeling TAN classifier in practice. The Query-by-Committee (QBC) method of active learning can examine unlabelled examples and selects only those that are most informative for labeling. It aims at using few labeled training examples to build efficient classifier. In this paper, an active TAN classifier algorithm based on vote entropy-maximum entropy of QBC is presented to solve the problem of building TAN classifier from unlabelled samples. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can reach the same accuracy as passive learning with few labeled training examples.	[Zhao, Y.; Cao, Y.

It's difficult to detect out by conventional techniques as firewall or misuse-based intrusion detection. Anomaly detection has been considered as a promising approach for masquerade detection, which is based on the idea that significant departures from normal behavior could be considered due to a masquerade. However, for low detection accuracy and high false alarm rate, it is still in research stage. Till now, many methods have been proposed from different viewpoints, such as Hidden Markov Model, Naive Bayes, SVM, and so on. Compared with other methods that with well theoretical backgrounds, two intuitive determined statistical methods: the Customized Grammars method and the Self Signature approach combined with Uniqueness, reported the much better detection efficiency. Especially, both methods based on the intuitive notion that the more frequently a usage pattern was employed by current user previously, the more indicative of normal. In other hand, the statistics of usage pattern in the Customized Grammars method was based on sequential grammars, and that of the Self Signature approach combined with Uniqueness was on commands and 2-grams. In this paper, these two methods are compared and evaluated on two benchmark data sets of Unix command sequence: the Schonlau data and the Greenberg data. As a result, contributions of command frequency and command sequence grammar in IDS were analyzed and clarified.

Web mining is a critical issue in data mining as well as other information process techniques to the World Wide Web to discover useful patterns. People can take advantage of these patterns to access the World Wide Web more efficiently. Web mining can be divided into three categories such as content mining, usage mining, and structure mining. In this paper we are going to apply web content mining to extract non-English knowledge from the web. We will investigate and evaluate some common methods; using web mining systems which have to deal with issues in language-specific text processing. Arabic language-independent algorithm will be used as a machine learning system. The algorithm will use a set of features as a vector of keywords for the learning process to apply text classification for the system. The algorithm usually used to classify a various number of documents written in a non English text language. The techniques used in the algorithm to categorize and classified the documents are two classifiers: Classifier K-Nearest Neighbor (CK-NN) and Classifier Naive Bayes (CNB). However, the algorithms usually depend on some phrase segmentation and extraction programs to generate a set of features or keywords to represent the retrieved web documents. A proposed Arabic text classification system will be called Arabic Text Classifier (ATC). The main goal of ATC is to compares the results between both classifiers used (CK-NN, CNB) and select the best average accuracy result rates to start a retrieving process. The theorem behind the ATC was introduced in this paper without demonstrating any practical views of the system.

J	Sandhu, PS; Singh, H				Sandhu, Parvinder Singh; Singh, Hardeep			SOFTWARE REUSABILITY MODEL FOR PROCEDURE BASED DOMAIN-SPECIFIC SOFTWARE COMPONENTS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						PLSA; SVD; SDD; ID3; LSA; Taguchi analysis; neuro-fuzzy system; Naive Bayes	RULES; REUSE	Automatic reusability appraisal is helpful in evaluating the quality of developed or developing reusable software components and in identification of reusable components from existing legacy systems; that can save cost of developing the software from scratch. But the issue of how to identify reusable components from existing systems has remained relatively unexplored. In this paper, we mention a two-tier approach by studying the structural attributes as well as usability or relevancy of the component to a particular domain. We evaluate Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) approach, LSA's Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique, LSA's Semi-Discrete Matrix Decomposition (SDD) technique and Naive Bayes approach to determine the Domain Relevancy of software components. It exploits the fact that Feature Vector codes can be seen as documents containing terms - the identifieres present in the components - and so text modeling methods that capture co-occurrence information in low-dimensional spaces can be used. In this research work, structural attributes of software components are explored using software metrics and quality of the software is inferred by Neuro-Fuzzy (NF) Inference engine, taking the metric values as input. The influence of different factors on the reusability is studied and the condition for the optimum reusability index is derived using Taguchi Analysis. The NF system is optimized by selecting initial rule-base through modified ID3 decision tree algorithm in combination with the results of Taguchi Analysis. The calculated reusability value enables to identify a good quality code automatically. It is found that the reusability value determined is close to the manual analysis used to be performed by the programmers or repository managers. So, the system developed can be used to enhance the productivity and quality of software development.

Our main tests took place in important fraud detection domains, which are characterized by the presence of high cardinality attributes and by the existence of relevant interactions among them. Other tests, over UCI data sets, show that HPB may have a quite wide applicability.

Assuming that the linguistic data of a polysemous word is classified to equivalent classes according to the number of its senses, we try to disambiguate them by using a hierarchical mixture of experts' probabilistic model - a soft version of neural networks that permits overlapping between classes and which is successfully applied in classification tasks. The model is used in combination with an effective feature selection strategy based on a Chi-square test that enhances disambiguation performance. Due to the absence of previous similar work on Greek linguistic data, for comparison we also implement and apply the very popular naive Bayes classifier to the same data. Comparing the two systems, we find that the Hierarchical Mixtures-of-Experts (HME) model is superior to the naive Bayes classifier, mainly because of its ability to permit overlapping and the capture of non-linearity among the data. We believe that the system can be successfully applied on real linguistic data after training on a small amount of data.

Function tags are extra functional information, such as logical subject or predicate, that can be added to certain nodes in syntactic parse trees. We model the function tags assignment problem as a classification problem. Each function tag is regarded as a class and the task is to find what class/tag a given node in a parse tree belongs to from a set of predefined classes/tags. The paper offers the first systematic comparison of the two techniques, naive Bayes and decision trees, for the task of function tags assignment. The comparison is based on a standardized data set, the Penn Treebank, a collection of sentences annotated with syntactic information including function tags. We found out that decision trees generally outperform naive Bayes for the task of function tagging. Furthermore, this is the first large scale evaluation of decision trees based solutions to the task of functional tagging.

J	Al-Tahrawi, MM; Abu Zitar, R				Al-Tahrawi, Mayy M.; Abu Zitar, Raed			Polynomial networks versus other techniques in text categorization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						polynomial networks; text categorization; document classification; document categorization		Many techniques and algorithms for automatic text categorization had been devised and proposed in the literature. However, there is still much space for researchers in this area to improve existing algorithms or come up with new techniques for text categorization (TC). Polynomial Networks (PNs) were never used before in TC. This can be attributed to the huge datasets used in TC, as well as the technique itself which has high computational demands. In this paper, we investigate and propose using PNs in TC. The proposed PN classifier has achieved a competitive classification performance in our experiments. More importantly, this high performance is achieved in one shot training (noniteratively) and using just 0.25%-0.5% of the corpora features. Experiments are conducted on the two benchmark datasets in TC: Reuters-21578 and the 20 Newsgroups.

Collaborative filtering for multi-class data using Bayesian networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS			English	Article						collaborative filtering; Bayesian networks	PROBABILISTIC NETWORKS; CLASSIFIERS	As one of the most successful recommender systems, collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms are required to deal with high sparsity and high requirement of scalability amongst other challenges. Bayesian networks (BNs), one of the most frequently used classifiers, can be used for CF tasks. Previous works on applying BNs to CF tasks were mainly focused on binary-class data, and used simple or basic Bayesian classifiers. 1,2 In this work, we apply advanced BNs models to CF tasks instead of simple ones, and work on real-world multi-class CF data instead of synthetic binary-class data. Empirical results show that with their ability to deal with incomplete data, the extended logistic regression on tree augmented naive Bayes (TAN-ELR) 3 CF model consistently performs better than the traditional Pearson correlation-based CF algorithm for the rating data that have few items or high missing rates. In addition, the ELR-optimized BNs CF models are robust in terms of the ability to make predictions, while the robustness of the Pearson correlation-based CF algorithm degrades as the sparseness of the data increases.

Traditional document representation approaches typically adopt a popular bag-of-word method as the underlying document representation. Although it's a simple and efficient method, the major shortcoming of bag-of-word representation is in the independent of word feature assumption. Many researchers have attempted to address this issue by incorporating semantic information into document representation. In this paper, we study the effect of semantic representation on the effectiveness of text classification systems. We employed a novel semantic smoothing technique to derive semantic information in a form of mapping probability between topic signatures and single-word features. Two classifiers, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine, were selected to carry out the classification experiments. Overall, our topic-signature semantic representation approaches significantly outperformed traditional bag-of-word representation in most datasets.

S	Alaiz-Rodriguez, R		Bergler, S		Alaiz-Rodriguez, Rocio			Local decision bagging of binary neural classifiers	ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	21st Conference of the Canadian-Society-for-Computational-Studies-of-Intelligence	MAY 28-30, 2008	Windsor, CANADA	Canadian Soc Computat Studies Intelligence			NETWORKS; ENSEMBLES; TREES	Bagging as well as other classifier ensembles have made possible a performance improvement in many pattern recognition problems for the last decade. A careful analysis of previous work points out, however, that the most significant advance of bagged neural networks is achieved for multiclass problems, whereas the binary classification problems seldom benefit from the classifier combination. Focusing on the binary classification applications, this paper evaluates the standard bagging approach and explores a novel variant, local bagging, that, while keeping the standard individual classifier generation, attempts to improve its decision combination stage by (a) dynamically selecting of a set of individual classifiers and (b) subsequently weighting them by their local accuracy. Experimental results carried out on standard benchmark data sets with Neural Networks, SVMs, Naive Bayes, C4.5 Decision Trees and Decision Stumps as the base classifier, show that local bagging yields significant improvements in these practical applications and is found more stable than Adaboost.

The objective of this work is to develop an automated system for the text classification of fanatic documents written in Arabic language. A module is used to lexically analyze raw Arabic texts in order to select and extract the features that characterize different categories of fanaticism. The lexically analyzed files contain the root of the word, its type and its form (or pattern). The combination of these three produces the stem of the word which is used in our work as a comparison factor in order to determine the relevant words of each category. Also, the results show that the classification accuracy is improved by incorporating the explanation patterns with well known classification methods.

Additionally, very few research works had discussed the issue of fraud detection in the area of corrupted CDR, due to its possibility yielded by lack of telecom equipment. In this paper, we present the leveraging missing values method, using the Naive Bayes approach posterior to rule-based classifier to analyze the probability of corrupted and missing values in CDR, which then consequently led to the discovery of useable record lies in rejected CDR. This approach differs from other missing value handling and fraud analysis research where it does not attempt to treat the missing values; instead, leveraging it into the probabilistic model for fraud analysis. In this paper, we also reveal an impact of the missing values in telecommunication services and significantly vacant an avenues future work in fraud detection research.

Data mining is the search for relationships and patterns within this data that could provide useful knowledge for effective decision-making. Classification analysis is one of the widely adopted data mining techniques for healthcare applications to support medical diagnosis, improving quality of patient care, etc. Usually medical databases are high dimensional in nature. If a training dataset contains irrelevant features (i.e., attributes), classification analysis may produce less accurate results. Data pre-processing is required to prepare the data for data mining and machine learning to increase the predictive accuracy. Feature selection is a preprocessing technique commonly used on high-dimensional data and its purposes include reducing dimensionality, removing irrelevant and redundant features, reducing the amount of data needed for learning, improving algorithms' predictive accuracy, and increasing the constructed models' comprehensibility. Much research work in data mining has gone into improving the predictive accuracy of the classifiers by applying the techniques of feature selection. The importance of feature selection in medical data mining is appreciable as the diagnosis of the disease could be done in this patient-care activity with minimum number of features. Feature selection may provide us with the means to reduce the number of clinical measures made while still maintaining or even enhancing accuracy and reducing false negative rates. In medical diagnosis, reduction in false negative rate can, literally, be the difference between life and death. In this paper we propose a feature selection approach for finding an optimum feature subset that enhances the classification accuracy of Naive Bayes classifier. Experiments were conducted on the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset to assess the effectiveness of our approach.

However, the large performance gap between these two families of approaches rendered NN-based image classifiers useless. We claim that the effectiveness of non-parametric NN-based image classification has been considerably undervalued We argue that two practices commonly used in image classification methods' have led to the inferior performance of NN-based image classifiers: (i) Quantization of local image descriptors (used to generate "bags-of-words ", codebooks). (ii) Computation of 'Image-to-Image' distance, instead of 'Image-to-Class' distance. We propose a trivial NN-based classifier - NBNN, (Naive-Bayes Nearest-Neighbor), which employs NN-distances in the space of the local image descriptors (and not in the space of images). NBNN computes direct 'Image-to-Class'distances without descriptor quantization. We further show that under the Naive-Bayes assumption, the theoretically optimal image classifier can be accurately approximated by NBNN. Although NBNN is extremely simple, efficient, and requires no learning/training phase, its performance ranks among the top leading learning-based image classifiers. Empirical comparisons are shown on several challenging databases (Caltech-101, Caltech-256 and Grazz-01).

However, the good performance of this method relies on the choice of an appropriate value for the input parameter k. In this work, we propose methods to estimate an adequate value for parameter k for any given database. Experimental results have shown that, in terms of predictive accuracy, k-NN using the estimated value for k usually outperforms k-NN with the values commonly used for k, as well as well-known methods such as decision trees and naive Bayes classification.

Optimizing features, therefore, is an important issue in flow classification. In this paper, we propose a wrapper feature selection algorithm GATS-C4.5 aiming at modeling lightweight flow classifier by (1) using hybrid genetic-tabu approach as search strategy to specify candidate subsets for evaluation; (2) using C4.5 algorithm as wrapper approach to obtain the optimum feature subset. We have examined the feasibility of our algorithm by conducting several experiments on flow datasets which were categorized as WWW, MAIL, P2P, etc. The experimental results show that classifier with our approach can greatly improve computational performance without negative impact on classification accuracy. Further more, our approach is able not only to have smaller resource consumption, but also to have higher classification accuracy than Naive Bayes method with Kernel density estimation after Fast Correlation-Based Filter (NBK-FCBF).

While it is fast and easy to implement, its performance in comparison to other machine learning methods is not ideal, In this paper, we present a hybrid approach using naive Bayes for information filtering. This approach differs from previous approaches in that it uses Multivariate Bernoulli Model and Multinomial Model successively. We report on the performance of our proposed approach using Reuters-21578 and 20 Newsgroups data. In the filtering process, we first use Multivatiate Bernoulli Model to estimate the preexamined probability for words appear in a document. Subsequently, the Multinomial Model is used to estimate the post-examined probability for final classification. We show that with sufficient training data, this hybrid approach can achieve higher F-measure score than using Multivariate Bernoulli Model or Multinomial Model alone.

However, the proliferation of multilingual documentation has become a common phenomenon in many international organisations, while most of the current systems has focused on the categorisation of monolingual text. It has been recently shown that the inherent redundancy in bilingual documents can be effectively exploited by relatively simple, bilingual naive Bayes (multinomial) models. In this work, we present a refined version of these models in which this redundancy is explicitly captured by a combination of a unigram (multinomial) model and the well-known IBM 1 translation model. The proposed model is evaluated on two bilingual classification tasks and compared to previous work.

The main reason for its poor performance is the independence assumption. Although many recent researches try to improve the performance of Naive Bayes by relaxing the independence assumption, none of them can be directly applied to the regression framework. The objective of this work is to present a new approach to improve the results of the NBR algorithm, by combining attributes by means of an auxiliary regression algorithm.

However, the independence assumption is often violated in many real-world applications. In response to this problem, a mount of research has been carried out to improve NBs accuracy by mitigating the attribute independence assumption, for example Lazy learning of Bayesian Rules(LBR), Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN) and Averaged One-Dependence Estimator(AODE). AODE which averages all Super Parent One-dependence Estimators (SPODE) has attracted widely attention for its outstanding performance. Because of the different role of every SPODEs, the performance will be expected to be improved significantly if different weights are assigned to these SPODEs. We proposed the framework of linear weighted SPODE ensemble and efficient learning strategy of weights based on differential evolution. The experience has shown that the proposed algorithm can generate better performance in most case than NB, A ODE, WAODE, TAN and LBR.

It's based on a new method in which rebroadcasting a packet is decided by an intelligent classification scheme. Each MN builds a classifier and uses it on data collected from the network environment. For an input vector describing a broadcast packet and current network conditions, the classifier returns a result of "Rebroadcast" or "Drop". Through the simulation,we can identify a more energetict communication protocol and more efficient use because of each MN's fitting various network condition.

WSD is usually considered to be a pattern classification to be research. Feature selection is an important sector of WSD process. We review Naive Bayes Model (NBM) seriously, and the feature selection method adopted in this paper is directed at Bayesian Assumption to improve NBM. Positional information concealed in the context of ambiguous word is mined via information gain calculation, to increase the knowledge acquisition efficiency of Bayesian model and to improve the effect of word-sense classification. Eight ambiguous words are tested in our experiment; the experimental results of improved Bayesian model are higher 3.5 per cent than the ones of NBM. The accuracy rise is bigger and the improvement effect is outstanding; and these results prove also the method put forward in this paper is efficacious.

Web pages classification is one of the essential techniques for web mining since classifying web pages of an interesting class is often the first step of mining the web. The high dimensional text vocabulary space is one of the main challenges of web pages. In this paper, we study the capabilities of bayesian classifiers for web pages categorization. Several feature, selection techniques, such as Chi Squared, Information Gain and Gain Ratio are used for selecting relevant words in web pages. Results on benchmark datasel show that the performances of Aggregating One-Dependence Estimators (AODE) and Hidden Naive Bayes (HNB) are both more competitive than other traditional methods.

Although many computational methods are currently available for identifying miRNA genes in the genomes of various species, very few algorithms can accurately predict the functional part of the miRNA gene, namely the mature miRNA. We introduce a computational method that uses a Naive Bayes; classifier to identify mature miRNA candidates based on sequence and secondary structure information of the miRNA precursor. Specifically, for each mature miRNA, we generate a set of negative examples of equal length on the respective precursor(s). The true and negative sets are then used to estimate probability distributions for sequence composition and secondary structure on each position along the RNA. The distance between these distributions is estimated using the symmetric Kullback-Leibier metric. The positions at which the two distributions differ significantly and consistently over a 10-fold cross-validation procedure are used as features for training the Naive Bayes classifier. A total of 15 classifiers were trained with true positive and negative examples from human and mouse. A performance of 76% sensitivity and 65% specificity was achieved using a consensus averaging over a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. Our findings suggest that position specific sequence and structure information combined with a simple Bayes classifier achieve a good performance on the challenging task of mature miRNA identification.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to improve attack detection at application layer by modeling user sessions as a sequence of events instead of analyzing every single event in isolation. We also argue that combining application access logs and the corresponding data access logs to generate unified logs eliminates the need to analyze them separately thereby resulting in an efficient and accurate system. We evaluate various methods such as conditional random fields, support vector machines, decision trees and naive Bayes, and experimental results show that our approach based on conditional random fields is feasible and can detect attacks at an early stage even when they are disguised within normal events.

In this paper, Pac-Man game is used as a test-bed. Different Bayesian classifiers like Naive Bayes and Bayesian Net are chosen to analyze off-line data from gamers who are choosing different strategies, in other words the classifiers are, trained with sample data from players using different strategies. The method attempts to use the constructed classifier to predict strategy type of a future player based on the data captured from its gameplay. This paper presents, the basic principle of the strategy-based player modeling by using the Bayesian classification theoretic approach and discusses the results of the experiments. The hypothesis proposed in this paper is that Bayesian Classification could be used as an approach with excellent Performance to recognize player's strategy pattern during real-time game genre.

In order to perform the classification, a web page is firstly represented by a vector of features with different weights, and the weight calculated method is improved. As the number of the features is big, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which is to select the relevant features will perform in preprocessing section as input for improved ICA algorithm (MFICA). Finally, the output of MFICA is sent to NB classifier for classification to boost the classifier's performance. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the NB classifier based on ICA model provides acceptable classification accuracy.

We describe all automatic system using sensors on a regular soccer table to detect rule violations in realtime. Naive Bayes is used for kick classification, the parameters are trained using supervised learning. In the on-line experiments, rule violations were detected at a higher rate than by the human players. The implementation proved its usefulness by being used by humans in real games and sets a basis for future research using probability models in table soccer.

Since the 3-dimensional structure of most proteins is still unknown, computational methods which can identify DNA-binding sites from protein sequences are in demand. In this study, we used a greedy method to search for features that are useful for the identification of DNA-binding sites. 5 features were selected from a pool of 534 features. Using the selected 5 features, a Naive Bayes method achieved 0.31 Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), which is an improvement over a previous method that used only 2 features as input. Since all of the 5 features can be derived from protein sequences, the proposed method can identify DNA-binding sites using only protein sequences as input.

It dramatically improves an ability to collect large amount of data about brain activity in human subjects performing tasks. Analysis of fMRI is essential for successful detection of cognitive states. This paper presents the use of single hidden-layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) to decode cognitive states from fMRI data. The SLFNs are trained by an improved extreme learning machine (ELM) which is named as regularized least-squares ELM (RLS-ELM). Experimental results show that the proposed method can give better performance compared to the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) classifier that is known as one of the best classifiers for decoding cognitive states.

In this paper, we present an automatic text classification model that is based on the Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks. It utilizes valuable discriminative information in training data and incorporates background knowledge in model learning. This approach can be particularly advantageous for applications where labeled training data are in short supply. The proposed model has been applied for classifying spam email, and the experiments on some benchmark spam testing corpus have shown that the model is effective in learning to classify documents based on content and represents a competitive alternative to the well-known text classifiers such as naive Bayes and SVM.

Selecting attributes subsets is an important approach to extend the Naive Bayes, and the state-of-the-art SBC algorithm has better accuracy in classification. In this paper, we review the weighted attribute method for Naive Bayes, and explain SBC is one of the special case in weighted attributed Methods. Interesting this method, we present a new one dependence augmented Naive Bayes with weighted attribute called WODANB, which use the fuzzy Support Vector Machine to optimize the weights.

Clients are classified into groups of different insurance risk levels. There is proposed to improve the efficiency of classification by using cluster analysis in the preprocessing phase. Experiments showed that, however the percentage of correctly qualified instances is satisfactory in case of Naive Bayes classification, but the use of cluster analysis and building separate models for different groups of clients improve significantly the accuracy of classification. Finally, there is discussed increasing of efficiency by using cluster validation techniques or tolerance threshold that enables obtaining clusters of very good quality.

Most of the studies done nowadays depend on Bag of Words model which takes the roots or the stems of the words as features. This situation both increases the number of features and the classification time. In this study, the method we named as YTU is used which applies a weighting algorithm on word stems and decreases the number of features to the number of classes resulting in lower classification time and better performance. Artificial Immune Recognition algorithms AIRS1, AIRS2, AIRS2Parallel which we tested by this method increased the performance in genre and author detection. In the experimental results section of the paper the comparison of the classification performance of mostly used classifiers on author and genre detection Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbourhood (K-NN) and the Artificial Immune Systems algorithms are presented. Especially in genre detection AIRS2Parallel classifier gives the highest performance of 99,6% with Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbourhood. This shows that Artificial Immune Recognition algorithms can be used in genre detection.

An algorithm to identify statistically significant discriminative motifs that distinguish between gene expression clusters is presented. The predictive power of the identified motifs is assessed with a supervised Naive Bayes classifier. An information-theoretic feature selection criterion helps find the most informative motifs. Results on benchmark and real data demonstrate that our algorithm accurately identifies discriminative motifs. We show that the integration of comparative genomics information into the motif finding process significantly improves the discovery of discriminative motifs and overall classification accuracy.

This generally precludes it from home use in isolated rural areas, where WLAN is a rare commodity. We propose an affordable localisation system which can be implemented using a variety of Bluetooth enabled mobile phones. This permits the incorporation of cellular network signal measurements as well as Bluetooth link measurements into the localisation framework. This paper presents a Hidden Markov Model localisation method, utilising the Viterbi algorithm, which enables single Bluetooth access point localisation.

Nearly 90% of the cost is maintenance due to error correction, adoptation and mainly enhancements. As Belady and Lehman (Lehman and Belady, 1985) state that software will become increasingly unstructured as it is changed. One way to overcome this problem is refactoring. Refactoring is an approach which reduces the software complexity by incrementally improving internal software quality. Our motivation in this research is to detect the classes that need to be rafactored by analyzing the code complexity. We propose a machine learning based model to predict classes to be refactored. We use Weighted Naive Bayes with InfoGain heuristic as the learner and we conducted experiments with metric data that we collected from the largest GSM operator in Turkey. Our results showed that we can predict 82% of the classes that need refactoring with 13% of manual inspection effort on the average.

Our method relies on extracting high level symbolic features from MIDI files. We explore the effect of combining several data mining preprocessing stages to reduce data processing complexity and classification execution time. Additionally, we employ a variety of probabilistic classifiers and ensembles. We compare the results produced by our best classifier with those obtained by more complex state of the art classifiers. Our experimental results indicate that our system constructed with the best performing combination of data mining preprocessing components together with a Naive Bayes-based classifier is capable of outperforming Other more complex ensembles of classifiers.

The techniques include listwise deletion, imputations by mean, k-nearest neighbor, and expectation maximization. The completed data are used to predict the presence or absence of NPC recurrence in each year by means of logistic regression, multilayer perceptron with backpropagation training, and naive bayes. Five year predictions are carried out. Validity of each predictive model is assured by 10-fold cross validation. Their results are compared in order to determine proper missing data treatment and the most efficient prediction technique. The results showed that EM imputation was superior to the other missing data techniques because it can be efficiently applied to all predictive models. The multilayer perceptron with backpropagation training gave the highest prediction performance and it was the most robust to the data completed by different missing data techniques.

To improve the performance of the Bayesian classifier, we present a novel algorithm called Ha (Increment Naive Bayes(HIB). We also evaluate the predictive power of the classifier, and show that our classifier yields high detection rates and works at a high learning speed.

In this study, we implemented a machine learning approach and developed reliable neural network and SVM based methods to classify human milochondria proteins with high confidence. We used experimentally characterized human mitochondria proteins as positive training datasets and human proteins localized in other organelles as negative training datasets for neural network, support vector machine, naive bayes and bayes network classification. In addition, we constructed simple amino acid composition model, a hybrid model of simple amino acid composition combining amino acid chemical-physical properties, and dipeptide amino acid composition model. With 5 fold cross-validations, the results demonstrate that multiple perceptrone neural network performs better than SVM in all three training models. We concluded that our classification approach utilizing empirically characterized human mitochondria protein sequences is a valuable tool for classifying human mitochondria proteins.

A framework of designing and implementing a vertical spider TSearch with basic general search spider architecture and functions is also showed TSearch uses SNBC to filter HTML pages and relies on LQNBC to defect unknown travel related Web sites with high precision. The recall and the precision for the classification of texts crawled by TSearch were measured experimentally. These experiments indicate that using LQNBC and SNBC, TSearch can produce promising travel related information for search.

Collecting and. analyzing traffic in real time and reporting the current status in time provide a feasible way. In this paper we used a refined Naive Bayes method, Naive Bayes Kernel Estimator (NBKE), to identify flooding attacks and port scans from normal traffic. The mechanism of our method is based on the observation that almost all known attacks could significantly change the traffic features. Uniquely, we employ the hand-identified traffic instance as the input of the NBKE. In this paper, we illustrate the higher accuracy in detection the flooding attacks and port scan behavior by using NBKE. Our results indicate that the simplest Naive Bayes (NB) estimator is able to achieve about 88.4% accuracy, while the Kernel Estimator can provide 96.8% accuracy. We also demonstrate that the mechanism our method based on is more reasonable.

So accurate, quick, effective classification is necessary. In this paper, we apply Online SVM technique for internet traffic identification and compare the result with that of previously applied Naive Bayes kernel estimation in AUCKLAND Vi and Entry data sets. Our results show that Online SVM technique is more robust and accurate than Naive Bayes algorithm. The test error can be limited to 5.81% in Entry data sets. For AUCKLAND Vi data sets, the test error can be limited to 14.05% and greatly outperforms Naive Bayes kernel estimation.

In this paper, we apply the discretization method in Naive Bayes for internet traffic identification and compare the result with that of previously applied Naive Bayes kernel estimation in AUCKLAND VI and Entry data sets. Our results show that discretization is more robust and accurate than kernel estimation. The average accuracy is improved to 97.93% and outperforms the kernel estimation by up to 4.2% in Entry data sets. For AUCKLAND VI data sets, the average accuracy is improved to 90.37% from 34.17%. We also find that discretization method for Naive Bayes is more efficient than kernel method during classification.		Liu, YH (reprint author), 169 Songling Rd, Qingdao 266101, Peoples R China.

The proposed method is based on [1] with some differences. These differences consist of first using collocational information to avoid the collection of spurious contexts caused by polysemous words in thesaurus categories, and second contribution of all words in the test data context, even those not appeared in the collected contexts to the calculation of the conceptual classes' score. Using a Farsi corpus and a Farsi thesaurus, this method correctly disambiguated 91.46% of the instances of 15 Farsi homographs. This method was compared to three supervised corpus based methods including Naive Bayes, Exemplar-based, and Decision List. Unlike supervised methods, this method needs no training data, and has a good performance on disambiguation of uncommon words. In addition, this method can be used for removing some kinds of morphological ambiguities.

Random forests-based fault diagnosis is treated as a Pattern Recognition problem, based oil measurements and feature selection. Two different types of inserting randomness to the trees are studied, based on different theoretical assumptions. The classifier is compared against other Machine Learning algorithms such as Neural Networks, Classification and Regression Trees, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor. The performance of the prediction model reaches a level of 97% in terms of precision and recall, improving the existing state-of-the-art levels achieved by Neural Networks by a factor of 1.5%-2%.

Artifacts can seriously degrade the quality of CT images, sometimes to the point of making them diagnostically unusable. We present a novel method for metal artifact treatment using classification based on the Fast Fourier Transform, as feature vector, and Naive Bayes Classifier. The main idea is to detect areas or images where artifacts occur. This can be of great relevance, for instance, on CT image preprocessing, in order to apply metal artifact reduction techniques only on areas where streaks occur. The classifier permits significant improvement of the image quality in short time, having potential to be used for 3D reconstruction and in clinical practice diagnoses.

Design and working principles of a number of optical type sensors have been illustrated and explained. Using the opto-tactile sensor multiple surface texture patterns of a number of objects like a carpet, stone, rough sheet metal, paper carton and a table surface have been captured and saved in MATLAB environment. The captured data have been adopted to soft computational techniques like Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique, Decision Tree (DT) C4.5 algorithm, and Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm for their learning. Testing with unknown surfaces using these techniques shows promising results at this stage and demonstrates its potential industrial use with further development. Results suggest that the methodology and procedures presented here are well suited for applications in intelligent robotic grasping.

The proposed improvement, called CVFDTNBC, induces a decision tree as CVFDT does, but contains naive-Bayes classifiers in the leaf nodes of the induced decision tree. The experiment using the artificially generated time-changing data streams shows that CVFDTNBC can induce a decision tree with more accuracy than CVFDT does.

Majority Filter-based Minority Prediction (MFMP): An Approach for Unbalanced Datasets	2008 IEEE REGION 10 CONFERENCE: TENCON 2008, VOLS 1-4	TENCON-IEEE Region 10 Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON 2008)	NOV 19-21, 2008	Hyderabad, INDIA	IEEE		Clustering; Classification; Random Under-sampling; Selective Sampling; Unbalanced dataset		For many data mining and machine learning applications predicting minority class samples from skewed unbalanced data sets is a crucial problem. To address this problem, we propose a majority filter-based minority prediction (MFMP) approach for unbalanced datasets. The MFMP adopts an unsupervised learning technique for selecting samples for supervised learning. The approach is based on two steps. In the first-step, minority samples are clustered and majority class samples that are out of minority classification regions are identified. This improves minority prediction rate. In the second step majority samples are randomly selected in individual clusters and this enhances majority prediction rate. Experimentally we studied the behavior of MFMP approach and compared with the traditional random under-sampling approach on a synthetic data set and three UCI repository datasets using the following classifiers: decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes and Radial basis function network. Precision, Recall and F-Measure are used for evaluating performance of classifiers. The experimental evidence suggests that MFMP approach exhibits good prediction rates over minority and majority classes on all classifiers. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperforms the traditional random under-sampling approach. MFMP applied on the decision tree gave better prediction as compared to other classifiers studied.

The driving vision for this work is to provide intelligent text to Farsi speech (TTS) systems that are sensitive to the speech acts of the input texts and can pronounce the corresponding intonation correctly. Seven speech acts were considered and 3 classification methods including of (1) Naive Bayes, (2) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and (3) Tree learner were used. The performance of speech act classification was evaluated using these methods including 10-Fold Cross-Validation, 70-30 Random Sampling and Area under ROC. KNN with an accuracy of 72% was shown to be the best classifier for classification of Farsi speech acts. It was observed that the amount of labeled training data has an important role in the classification performance.

The language model assumes that all terms are independent, therefore the majority of the documents returned to the ser will be those that contain the query terms. By making this assumption, related documents that do not contain the query terms will never be found, unless the related terms are introduced into the query using a query expansion technique. Unfortunately, recent attempts at performing a query expansion using a language model have not been in-line with the language model, being complex and not intuitive to the user. In this article, we introduce a simple method of query expansion using the naive Bayes assumption, that is in-line with the language model since it is derived from the language model. We show how to derive the query expansion term relationships using probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA). Through experimentation, we show that using PLSA query expansion within the language model framework, we can provide a significant increase in precision.	[Park, Laurence A.

Fast online estimation of the joint probability distribution	ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	12th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	MAY 20-23, 2008	Osaka, JAPAN	Japanese Soc Artificial Intelligence, Osaka Convent & Tourism Bur, Commemorat Org Japan World Exposit 70, Kayamori Fdn Informat Sci, Air Force Off Sci Res, Asian Off Aerosp Res & Dev, Future Syst Corp, Salford Syst, Math Syst				In this paper we propose an algorithm for the on-line maintenance of the joint probability distribution of a data stream. The joint probability distribution is modeled by a mixture of low dependence Bayesian networks, and maintained by an on-line EM-algorithm. Modeling the joint probability function by a mixture of low dependence Bayesian networks is motivated by two key observations. First, the probability distribution can be maintained with time cost linear in the number of data points and constant time per data point. Whereas other methods like Bayesian networks have polynomial time complexity. Secondly, looking at the literature there is empirical indication [1] that mixtures of Naive-Bayes structures can model the data as accurate as Bayesian networks. In this paper we relax the constraints of the mixture model of Naive-Bayes structures to that of the mixture models of arbitrary low dependence structures. Furthermore we propose an on-line algorithm for the maintenance of a mixture model of arbitrary Bayesian networks. We empirically show that speed-up is achieved with no decrease in performance.

Recently, research in image processing has raised much interest in the security surveillance systems community. Weapon detection is one of the greatest challenges facing by the community recently. In order to overcome this issue, application of the popularly used SVM classifier is performed to focus on the need of detecting dangerous weapons. However, PCA is used to explore the usefulness of each feature and reduce the multi dimensional features to simplified features with no underlying hidden structure. In this paper, we take advantage of the simplified features and classifier to categorize images object with the hope to detect dangerous weapons effectively. In order to validate the effectiveness of the SVM classifier, several classifiers are used to compare the overall accuracy and computational speed of the system with the compliment from the features reduction of PCA. These classifiers include Neural Network, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes and k-Nearest Neighbor methods. The final outcome of this research clearly indicates that SVM has the ability in improving the classification accuracy using the extracted features. Besides, it is also shown that PCA is able to speed-up the computational time with the reduced dimensionality of the features while maintaining the classification accuracy.

For such applications, travel direction is a significant parameter, In this study, we proposed a novel method to identify the travel direction of cellular phones based on the handoff information from cellular network. The focus of this research is to identify the travel direction of cellular phone based on 2 attributes, i.e., 1) number of Intersection Member (IM) and 2) Accumulated number of Intersected Member (AIM) using Naive Bayes model. The experimental results show promising performance with accuracy up to 100%. This suggests a step forward to the use of cellular-based information as road traffic information.

However. the availability of road traffic data is currently limited due to the high investment of traffic sensors and associated infrastructure. Using cellular phone information as road traffic data becomes an attractive alternative because of its low cost, widespread of cellular networks, and a large number of phones as potential road traffic probes. However, in practice, the collected cellular data consists of various types of mobility, either related or unrelated to the road traffic. In this paper, we proposed a method to classify two types of mobility, i.e., sky train and pedestrian, from cellular phone information. Two key attributes, i.e., 1) the number of unique cell ID and 2) the average cell dwell time (if unique cell ID are used in Navies Bayes classification model. The experimental results show promising performance with accuracy up to 93.1 %. This suggests a potential use of cellular phone information as road traffic data.

Hundreds of new malware variants are released every day with novel twists and greater complexity inside the code so as to escape malware detection techniques. Due to the ever-changing nature of this problem, it has been necessary for us to describe in this paper up-to-date experimental results of our new malware detection methodology. Our approach utilizes naive-Bayes filtering for automatic malware adjudication. We have identified two major problems in our approach: (i) feature selection and (ii) group-boundary determination. We have attempted several techniques to solve these problems in order to achieve accuracy of detection in conjunction with a lower rate of false positive.	[Rafiq, A. N. M.

This combines the results of several classifiers into a unique score, producing an optimal ranking of the individuals. We apply our method to the identification of new members of a protein family. Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes classifiers exploit complementary features to compute probability estimates. A great advantage of the GS is that it produces an understandable algorithm revealing the interest of the classifiers. Due to the large volume of candidate sequences, ranking quality is of crucial importance. Consequently, our fitness criterion is based on the Area Under the ROC Curve rather than on classification error rate. We discuss the performances obtained for a particular family, the cytokines and show that this technique is an efficient means of ranking the protein sequences.

RBNBC's design is based on generic ideas that can apply to other domains where the data is organized as collections of sequences. Specifically, RBNBC uses a novel formulation of Naive Bayes that incorporates repeated occurrences of subsequences within each sequence. Our extensive experiments on two collections of protein families show flint it performs as well as existing state-of-the-art probabilistic classifiers for bio-sequences.

We model these phenomenon using Hidden Conditional Random Fields(HCRFs) with three kinds of features: transition features, polarity features and reversal (of polarity) features. Polarity features and reversal features are doubly added to each word, and each weight of the features are trained by the common structure of positive and negative corpus in, for example, assuming that reversal phenomenon occured for the same reason (features) in both polarity corpus.

Application of Multiple Decision Trees for Condition Monitoring in Induction Motors	2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS, VOLS 1-8	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks	JUN 01-08, 2008	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE			ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS; FAULT-DETECTION; DIAGNOSIS; DESIGN	Induction machines (IMs) play a pivotal role in industry and there is a strong demand for their reliable and safe operation. IMs are susceptible to problems such as stator current imbalance and broken bars, usually detected when the equipment is already broken, and sometimes after irreversible damage has occurred. Condition monitoring can significantly reduce maintenance costs and the risk of unexpected failures through the early detection of potential risks. Several techniques are used to classify the condition of machines. This paper presents a new case study on the application of multiple decision trees in the on-tine condition monitoring of induction motors. Some advantages can be seen, such as the improved performance of classification systems, in addition to the capacity to explain examples. The database was developed through a simplified mathematical model of the machine, considering the effects caused by asymmetries in the phase impedances of motors. A comparative analysis is performed for individual running (based on the neural networks, k-Nearest neighbor and Naive Bayes) and a multi-classifier (based on the Bagging and Adaboost) approaches. Results demonstrate that the multi-classifier systems obtain better results than those of the individual experiments.

The large percentage of the total traffic over the internet is thee-mail. E-mail data is also growing rapidly, creating needs for automated analysis. So, to detect crime, to organize bundles of emails, a spectrum of techniques should be applied to discover and identify patterns and make predictions. Data mining has emerged to address problems of understanding ever-growing volumes of information for structured data, finding patterns within data that are used to develop useful knowledge. Earlier Statistical methods are used to characterize user behavior, classifying spam and detecting novel email viruses. However, previous techniques have not examined the contributions of these features to their classification and they need some improvements. By applying data mining classification techniques we can achieve this very efficiently. In this paper we show that Naive Bayes classification approach is useful for predicting user's behavior and to organize the emails according to users constraints.	[Shekar, D. V. Chandra; Imambi, S.

Based on the concept of Thai character cluster, a Thai running text is preliminarily segmented into a sequence of inseparable units, called TCCs. To enable the handling of a large-scaled text, a sorted sistring (or suffix array) is applied to calculate a number of statistics of each TCC. Using these statistics, we applied three alternative supervised machine learning techniques, naive Bayes, centroid-based and k-NN, to learn classifiers for keyword identification. Our method is evaluated using a medical text extracted from WWW. The result showed that k-NN achieves the highest performance of 79.5% accuracy.

From the application viewpoint, however, BNCs sometimes produce models too complicated to interpret easily. In this paper, we propose k-Bayesian Network Classifier (k-BNC), which is a new method to reconstruct the attribute-dependency relationship from data for health promotion planning. From the health promotion viewpoint, it would be highly advantageous if occupational physicians could make effective plans for employees, and if employees could carry out the plans easily. Therefore, we focus on the attribute dependencies in classification models represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and find the effective attributes by measuring the standardized Kullback-Leibler divergence from parent attributes to their children. In experimental evaluation, we firstly compare the accuracy of k-BNC with that of Naive Bayes Classifiers, and other well-known Bayesian Networks and structure learning methods (k2 algorithm etc) on some public datasets. We show that our proposed k-BNC method successfully produces classification models for the prioritization of health promotion plans on our health checkup data.

The first step learns the capabilities of the available techniques, and the second step finds the configuration that best meets the goals of the radio, subject to the channel conditions. This approach allows a good segmentation of the problem and provides the freedom to research each part independently of the other. We propose a reference design based on Bayes' rule and a brute force search for the learning and optimization stages, respectively. This reference design is to be used as a baseline for the comparison of future implementations. In this paper we also investigate the applicability of the Naive and Semi-Naive Bayes' models for learning and a binary search for optimization. The Semi-Naive Bayes' model and a binary search are found to provide good alternatives to the learning and optimization segments of the reference design by requiring the estimation of fewer parameters and fewer searches, respectively. However, the non-reference system sacrifices performance optimality for speed and memory savings as compared to the reference design(1).	[Volos, Haris I.; Phelps, Chris I.; Buehrer, R.

In this approach, the discrimination power of each feature is directly used for ranking various features through a criterion named overall-divergence, which is based on the divergence measures evaluated between various class density function pairs. Compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g. IG and CHI), the proposed approach shows more discrimination power for classifying confusing classes, and achieves better or comparable performance oil evaluation data sets.

There exist interactions among, predictive attributes towards the decisive attribute. The contribution rate of each combination of predictive attributes, including each singleton, towards the decisive attribute can be re presented by a fuzzy measure. We use Double Nonlinear Integrals with respect to the signed fuzzy measure to project data to 2-Dimension space. Then classify the virtual value in the 2-D space projected by Nonlinear Integrals. In our experiments, we compare our classifier based on projection with Double Nonlinear Integrals with the classical method-Naive Bayes. The results show that our classification model is better than Naive Bayes.

This paper proposes a new method that improves automatic keyphrase extraction by using semantic information of candidate keyphrases. Our method is realized in two stages. In selecting candidates stage, after extraction of all phrases from document, a word sense disambiguation method is used to get senses of phrases, then term conflation is performed by using case folding, stemming, and semantic relatedness between candidates. In filtering stage, four features are used to compute for each candidate: the TFXIDF measure describing the specificity of a phrase, first occurrence of a phrase in the document, length of a phrase, and coherence score which measure the semantic relatedness between the phrase and other candidates. A Naive Bayes scheme builds a prediction model training data with known keyphrases, and then uses the model to calculate the overall probability for each candidate. We evaluate semantically improved method against the well known Kea system by using a more effective semantically enhanced evaluation method.

The intra-domain experiment shows our method is competitive with Kea++ algorithm, and not domain-specific.

The approach is based on the premise that frequently visiting certain types of content indicates that the user is interested in that content. The proposed approach can be divided into three steps: monitoring the user's navigational data; using the cumulative weight to determine a Web page's content; and employing the Naive Bayes Model for updating the user's interest model. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, experimental software is developed to analyze a user's interests in sports. The experimental results demonstrate that the approach can effectively model the user's interest. The proposed model could be integrated with personalized Web services.

Naive Bayes Classification of Adaptive Broadband Wireless Modulation Schemes with Higher Order Cumulants	ICSPCS: 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems	DEC 01-17, 2008	Gold Coast, AUSTRALIA	IEEE, Nebraska Sect, IEEE, Queensland Sect, Australian Res Council Commun Res Network, Coll Engn, Univ Nebraska, Peter Kiewit Inst, Australian Natl Univ, Coll Engn & Comp Sci		Modulatiuon Classification; Naive Bayes Network; OFDM; Broadband Wireless	ALGORITHMS	Adaptive modulation schemes have been proposed to optimize Shannon's channel capacity in recent orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based broadband wireless standard proposals. By adapting the modulation type (effectively changing the number of bits per symbol) at the transmitter end one can improve the bit error rate (BER) during transmission at designated SNR. Blind detection of the transmitted modulation type is desirable to optimise the bandwidth available at the receivers. Hence, there is a need for an intelligent modulation classification engine at the receiver end. In this work, we evaluate some higher order statistical measures coupled with a classical Naive Bayes classifier for fast identification of adaptive modulation schemes. We also benchmark the experimental results with the optimal Maximum Likelihood Classifier, and Support Vector Machine based Classifier using the same feature set.	[Wong, M. L.

There are two classification methods: hybrid classification and single classification. Hybrid classification includes two steps, step one is attribute selection by search method using genetic search and results are compared by three evaluators: 1) Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) 2) Consistency-based Subset Evaluation and 3) Wrapper Subset Evaluation. Step two is the classification of data set by using selected attributed from step one and four classification algorithms. Next, Simple classification used classification algorithms only without attribute selection. The four classification algorithms that used in this experiment for comparing in two methods are : 1) Naive Bayes classifier 2) Baysian Belief Network 3) C4.5 algorithm and 4) RIPPER algorithm. The measurements of classification efficiency had been obtained by using the k-fold Cross Validation technique. From the experiment, it was found that hybrid classification technique using genetic search and CFS evaluator with C4.5 algorithm, gives the highest accuracy rate at 82.52%. However, results from F-measure evaluation showed that C4.5 algorithm did not fit for all data types. The hybrid classification technique using genetic search and wrapper subset with Baysian belief network can give a better precision value which can be seen in the F-measure, and it gives the accuracy rate at 82.42%.

To solve the class imbalance problem, a new multi-relational Naive Bayesian classifier named R-NB is proposed. the attribute filter criterion based on mutual information is upgraded to deal with multi-relational data directly and the basic sampling methods include under-sampling and over-sampling are adopted to eliminate or minimize rarity by altering the distribution of relational examples. Experiments show, with the help of attribute filter method, R-NB can get better results than those without that. And, experiments show that multi-relational classifiers with under-sampling methods can provide more accurate results than that with over-sampling methods considering the ROC Curve.

Compared with methods based on ILP, Graph-NB is more efficient. However, Graph-NB without pruning has poor accuracy because of statistical bias. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a multi-relational Naive Bayesian classifier towards relational individual (RI-MRNBC). Its counting method is based on relational individual instead of tuples in current table. Accordingly, RI-MRNBC gives improved Naive Bayesian formula towards relational individual. Experiments show RI- MRNBC can get high efficiency and good accuracy.

Interaction is a critical success factor that affects group learning. In this study, we propose a useful grouping method to help teachers improve group-learning in e-learning by first establishing effective groups based on the naive Bayes method. Personal characteristics will affect the communication modes within the group learning process. We identify four different attributes for further research of high-interaction and high-satisfaction groups - learning periods (Time), Region, Age, and Value types. Field observations and quantitative evidence show the validity and practicability of the proposed method.

We proposed one method called Incremental Bayes Classification Based on Feature Vector to solve these two problems. And the way to gain feature vector was given through combining vector principle with Euclid Distance. The procedure of incremental classification was described elaborately. At last, the ability of incremental classification of our algorithm was proved better, and the time complexity was lower through doing experiments. At the same time, we analyzed efficiency of our algorithm.

Document indexing plays a very important role in the process of classification. This paper proposes an improved method of computing term weights which is called tfidfie (term frequency, inverted document tfidf frequency and inverted entropy). In comparison with the I h (term frequency and inverted document frequency) function, the tfidfie function adds an information entropy factor, H, which represents the distribution of documents in the training set in which the term occurs. Then, we discuss the effects of training set in medical document categorization. An imbalanced training set decreases the performance of classifier. Considering the characteristics of medical documents, the medical classifiers are constructed by the methods of Naive Bayes and Rocchio respectively. The experiment results show that tfidfie improves the classification performance and Naive Bayes outperforms Rocchio.

Firms as well as the nations have more relationships with each other. Even relatively closed economies or industries are becoming more open, Australia and China are examples of this case. The benefits generated from collaboration and the motivations to form collaboration are investigated by some researchers. However, the widely studied relationships between collaboration and profits are based on tangible assets and turnovers whereas most intangible assets and benefits are neglected during the economic analysis. In the present paper, two methods, naive Bayes and neural network, from computing intelligence are used to study the benefits acquired from collaboration. These two methods are used to learn the relationship and make prediction for a specified collaboration. The proposed method has been applied to a practical case of WE-MOSOFT, an independent development department under MOBOT. The predication accuracies are 87.18% and 92.31%, for neural network and naive Bayes, respectively. Experimental result demonstrates that the proposed method is an effective and efficient way to prediction the benefit of collaboration and choose the appropriate collaborator.

In this paper features are ranked and a comparison is made of the number of features used within several topical algorithms, namely, Naive Bayes (NB), KStar and Multi-Layer Perceptron. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) graphs showing the relationship between sensitivity and specificity where used as a comparison mechanism. The outcome showed that reducing the input feature set from 20 to 4 did not have a significant impact on the ROC performance of all three models. Overall, NB provided the best performance, but this tailed off significantly when the input feature set was reduced to less than the top four.

In recent years, a number of learning algorithms for regression have been introduced. Unfortunately, there are few projects that compared the performance of these methods by experiment. In this paper, we present a empirical comparison between ten algorithms used for regression: k-nearest neighbor (KNN), k-nearest-neighbor with distance weighted (KNNDW), linear regression (LR), locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), model trees (M5P), reduced error pruning tree (REPTree), naive Bayes (NB), genetic programming (GP), back propagation (BP), and support vector machine (SVM). We test these ten different regression algorithms on the whole 36 data sets recommended by Weka. The ten-folds cross validation (CV) criteria is used to compare these algorithms. Finally we test the experimental results via two-tailed t-test with significantly different probability of 95% to compare the performance of each pair of algorithms in terms of the relative absolute error.

In practical application, limited to satisfying independence assumption, it is hard to gain better classification. In this paper an simple and intuitive extended haves model was constructed, which can get better classification effect. The extended bayes model replaces primary attribute group with new attribute group (except categorical attribute) and rearrange weights according to the comparison of the expectation of attribute importance, to reinforce the effect of important attributes and weak the effect of subordinate attributes. The extended bayes model was applied in customer classification prediction and was veried with examples. Firstly, customers were clustered with K-means algorithm, the cluster result as a pretreatment step was used in customer classification Prediction by weighted Bayes algorithm, it combines the advantages of the two algorithms to improve the accuracy of customer classification. So a customer segmentation model can be built on a basis of customer lifetime value, customer loyalty degree, client capital credit and etc.	[Zu, Qiaohong; Li Wenfeng] WHUT, Sch Logist Engn, Wuhan 430063, Peoples R China	Zu, QH (reprint author), WHUT, Sch Logist Engn, Wuhan 430063, Peoples R China.	zuqiaohong@whut.edu.cn; liwf@whut.edu.cn					Derrig RA, 1995, J RISK INSUR, V62, P447, DOI 10.2307/253819; RUD OP, 2005, PRACTICE DATA MINING, P56; TANG BY, 2005, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHI, P42; Tsymbal A., 2003, Information Fusion, V4, DOI 10.1016/S1566-2535(03)00004-6	4	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-1-4244-2020-9				2008							22	25		10.1109/ICPCA.2008.4783580		4	Computer Science, Software Engineering; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BJK54	WOS:000266697900005

Effective database processing for classification and regression with continuous variables	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							LEARNING BAYESIAN NETWORKS; PROBABILISTIC NETWORKS	This article proposes a method for manipulating a database of instances relative to discrete and continuous variables. A fuzzy partition is used to discretize continuous domains. A reorganized form of representing a relational database is proposed. The new form of representation is called an effective database. The effective database is tested on classification and regression problems using general Bayesian networks and Naive Bayes classifiers. The structures and the parameters of the classifiers are estimated from the effective database. An algorithm for updating with soft evidence is used to test the induced models, when continuous variables are present. The experiments show that the effective database procedure produces a selection of relevant information from data, which improves in some cases the prediction accuracy of the classifiers.

For the purpose, this paper presents a semi-supervised method for classifying evaluative expressions, that is, tuples of subjects, their attributes. and evaluative words, that indicate either favorable or unfavorable opinions towards a specific subject. Due to its characteristics, our semi-supervised method can classify evaluative expressions in a corpus by their polarities, starting from a very small set of seed training examples and using contextual information in the sentences the expressions belong to. Our experimental results with real Weblog data as our corpus show that this bootstrapping approach can improve the accuracy of methods for classifying favorable and unfavorable opinions. We also show that a reasonable amount of evaluative expressions can be really acquired.

In order to improve the applicability with higher privacy and better accuracy, we present a novel Privacy Preserving Naive Bayes (PPNB) classification method that consists of two steps: first, the original data set is distorted by a new. randomization approach; second, a naive Bayes classifier is implemented on the distorted data set to predict the class labels for unknown samples. Besides being analyzed in applicability, privacy, accuracy, and efficiency, the effectiveness of our PPNB classification method is also validated by the experiments.

In order to avoid that the number of cases of the compound attributes be too high, a grouping procedure is applied each time after two variables are merged. This method tries to group two or more cases of the new variable into an unique value. In an emperical study, we show as this approach outperforms the naive Bayes classifier in a very robust way and reaches the performance of the Pazzani's semi-naive Bayes [1] without the high cost of a wrapper search.

In a dynamic environment like a peer-to-peer network, Agents have to be generated frequently and dispatched to the network. Thus they will certainly consume a certain amount of bandwidth of each link in the network if there are too many agents migration through one or several links at the same time, they will introduce too much transferring overhead to the links eventually, these links will be busy and indirectly block the network traffic, therefore, there is a need of developing routing algorithms that consider about traffic load. In this paper we seek to create cooperation between a probabilistic manner according to the quality measure of the network traffic situation and the agent's migration decision making to the next hop based on decision tree learning algorithms.

OLMAM has been shown to obtain excellent solutions in difficult classification problems where other computational intelligence techniques usually achieve inferior performances. In this paper we apply OLMAM to the problem of author identification of e-mail messages which is a challenging classification problem due to the special characteristics of the data. We performed a number of experiments with a corpus of real-world e-mail messages (Enron corpus). The performance of the proposed method was compared with the performances achieved by Naive-Bayes and SVM classifiers. Author identification with OLMAM was found to be significantly better compared with the other methods even if the author wrote about different topics.

Several methods based on statistical information have been proposed. However with the linguistic complexity of the texts, semantic-based approaches have been investigated. In this paper, we propose a Semantic Kernel for semi-structured biomedical documents. The semantic meanings of words are extracted using the UMLS framework. The kernel, with a SVM classifier, has been applied to a text categorization task on a medical corpus of free text documents. The results have shown that the Semantic Kernel outperforms the Linear Kernel and the Naive Bayes classifier Moreover, this kernel was ranked in the top ten of the best algorithms among 44 classification methods at the 2007 CMC Medical NLP International Challenge.

Therefore, it is not surprising that it is a field of ongoing research. Here, we propose an approach that utilizes hierarchy information in the classification process. In contrast to other methods, the hierarchy information is used independently of the classifier rather than integrating it directly. This enables the use of arbitrary standard classification methods. Furthermore, we discuss how hierarchical classification in general and our setting in specific can be evaluated appropriately. We present our algorithm and evaluate it on two datasets of web pages using Naive Bayes and SVM as baseline classifiers.

The motivation behind our research is that often, in online catalogues, items to be recommended are described both by textual features and by non-textual features. For example, books on Amazon.com are described by title, authors, abstract, but also by price and year of publication. Both types of features are useful to decide whether the item should be recommended to the customer. We propose an approach which integrates non-standard inference services and a Naive Bayes profiling system able to analyze the textual features of the items by advanced natural language processes and to learn seman-tic user profiles exploited in the recommendation process.

The challenge in the automatic classification of a pair of documents to belong to the same or different writer, are both (i)The task of proper selection and extraction of features from the handwritten document and (ii)The use of a proper model that is capable of utilizing the trite discriminatory power of these features for classification. This paper describes the use of content specific skeleton based features for characters and pairs of characters (bigrams) and ascertains their discriminatory power. A triangulation skeletonisation procedure is first used to obtain the skeleton of the character(s), and features are computed from the skeleton. Experiments and results are conducted on content specific features extracted for two most frequently occurring bigrams (th, he), and characters (d and f). A neural network based on a Bayesian formulation was used to ascertain the discriminability power of these features. To combine these features with previously existing writer verification features, an alternative Naive Bayes model is also described and evaluated. From the results obtained, we conclude that bigram th has the highest discriminatory power followed by character d, f and bigram he. Also the paper highlights the significant increase in performance of writer verification (similar to 15% more) with the use of Bayesian neural networks as against the Naive Bayes model.

Users consider only the first 20 or 30, but documents are often sorted according to the query and the results are perhaps not relevant to the users' needs. This situation is even more problematic when non expert users have difficulties in expressing their information requirements. One solution to this problem could be the use of a user model which would complement the query in order to find the best solutions for the user. Most personalized retrieval systems have a single user model for each user which works on the basis that this user will have always the same information needs. Our proposal however is a personalization method based on the current objective of the user. To this end, we have developed two probabilistic algorithms NBM and WNBM which support different kinds of multi parameter databases and in this paper we present new experiments with these algorithms in METIORE(1) to validate our proposal.

In a recent paper [1] we introduced a new Signal Processing approach to Distributional Clustering which reached categorization results on 20 Newsgroups' dataset similar to those obtained by other information-theoretic approaches [3] [4] [5]. Here we re-validate our method by showing that the 90-categories Reuters-21578 2 benchmark collection can be indexed with a minimum loss of categorization accuracy (around 2% with Naive Bayes categorizer) with only 50 clusters.

The Rocchio classifier and second generation wavelets - art. no. 65760F	Independent Component Analyses, Wavelets, Unsupervised Nano-Biomimetic Sensors, and Neural Networks V	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Independent Component Analyses, Wavelets, Unsupervised Nano-Biomimetic Sensors, and Neural Networks V	APR 10-13, 2007	Orlando, FL			classification; categorization; text classification; Rocchio classifier; second generation wavelets; naive Bayes; machine learning		Classification and characterization of text is of ever growing importance in defense and national security. The text classification task is an instance of classification using sparse features residing in a high dimensional feature space. Two standard (of a wide selection of available) algorithms for this task are the naive Bayes classifier and the Rocchio linear classifier. Naive Bayes classifiers are widely applied; the Rocchio algorithm is primarily used in document classification and information retrieval. Both these classifiers are popular because of their simplicity and ease of application, computational speed and reasonable performance. One aspect of the Rocchio approach, inherited from its information retrieval origin, is that it explicitly uses both positive and negative models. Parameters have been introduced which make it adaptive to the particulars of the corpora of interest and thereby improve its performance. The ideas inherent in these classifiers and in second generation wavelets can be recombined into new algorithms for classification. An example is a classifier using second generation wavelet-like functions for class probes that mimic the Rocchio positive template - negative template approach.

Learning Bayesian networks consistent with the optimal branching	ICMLA 2007: SIXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications	DEC 13-15, 2007	Cincinnati, OH	Assoc Machine Learning & Applicat, IEEE			PROBABILISTIC INFERENCE; BELIEF NETWORKS	We introduce a polynomial-time algorithm to learn Bayesian networks whose structure is restricted to nodes with in-degree at most k and to edges consistent with the optimal branching, that we call consistent k-graphs (CkG). The optimal branching is used as an heuristic for a primary causality order between network variables, which is subsequently refined, according to a certain score, into an optimal CkG Bayesian network. This approach augments the search space exponentially, in the number of nodes, relatively to trees, yet keeping a polynomial-time bound. The proposed algorithm can be applied to scores that decompose over the network structure, such as the well known LL, MDL, AIC, BIC, K2, BD, BDe, BDeu and MIT scores. We tested the proposed algorithm in a classification task. We show that the induced classifier always score better than or the same as the Naive Bayes and Tree Augmented Naive Bayes classifiers. Experiments on the UCI repository show that, in many cases, the improved scores translate into increased classification accuracy.

In this paper, we aim to reduce the dimensionality of the original feature space by removing irrelevant and redundant features. A correlation-based feature selection algorithm is proposed for selecting a subset of most informative features. Six data sets retrieved from UCI databases and an intrusion detection benchmark data set, DARPA KDD99, are used to train and to test C4.5 and naive bayes machine learning algorithms. We compare our proposed approach with two correlation-based feature selection algorithms, CFS and FCBF and the results indicate that our approach achieves the highest averaged accuracies. Our feature selection algorithm could effectively reduce the size of data set.

Rocchio is the classic method for text classification in information retrival. Based on these three approaches and using classifier fusion methods, we propose a novel approach in text classification. Our approach is a supervised method, meaning that the list of categories should be defined and a set of training data should be provided for training the system. In this approach, documents are represented as vectors where each component is associated with a particular word. We propose voting methods and OWA operator and Decision Template method for combining classifiers. Experimental results show that these methods decrese the classification error 15 percent as measured on 2000 training datafrom 20 newsgroups dataset.

NB has been extensively used for modeling knowledge in many different applications and has been the focus of many works related to classification tasks. This work proposes and discusses a Naive Bayesian classifier named Weighted Naive Bayesian (WNB) classifier. The central idea of WNB is that more relevant attributes should have more influence in the classification estimation process. A weighting strategy is adopted to modify the traditional NB. Experiments performed with six UCI domains show that WNB is promising.	[de S.

This paper presents the evaluation of a color segmentation technique, based on standard supervised classification algorithms. The whole approach uses a general purpose classifier, which is parameterized and adapted to the problem of separating image pixels into three different classes: parasite, blood red cells and background. Assessment included not only four different supervised classification techniques - KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM and MLP - but different color spaces -RGB, normalized RGB, HSV and YCbCr-. Results show better performance for the KNN classifiers along with an improving feature characterization in the normalized RGB color space.

Predicting peptide bond conformation using feature selection and the Naive Bayes approach	2007 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-16	PROCEEDINGS OF ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY		English	Proceedings Paper	29th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	AUG 22-26, 2007	Lyon, FRANCE	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			SECONDARY STRUCTURE INFORMATION; CIS-TRANS ISOMERIZATION; CIS/TRANS ISOMERIZATION; PSI-BLAST; PROTEINS; SEQUENCE; SERVER	Distinguishing cis peptide bonds from trans isomers in protein sequences facilitates the exploration of protein structures and functions. In this study, we evaluated the effect of a large and informative feature vector, towards the reliable prediction of peptide bond conformation between any two amino acids. We used multiple sequence alignment, secondary structure information, real valued solvent accessibility predictions for each amino acid and physicochemical properties of the surrounding residues. A three stage schema was developed, comprising of feature extraction, feature selection and peptide bond classification between any two amino acids. We also explored the performance achieved when using the full feature vector without performing feature selection. The best discriminating ability was achieved using a Naive Bayes classifier, combined with wrapper feature selection. The proposed approach yielded prediction accuracy 86%, sensitivity 82% and specificity 90% in discriminating cis and trans peptide bond conformations.

In this paper, we propose a discriminative method that is based on KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence to learn TAN classifier. First, we use EAR (explaining away residual) method to learn the structure of TAN, and then optimize TAN parameters by an objective function based on KL divergence. The results of the experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach produces better classification rate.

In order to provide personalized recommendations, recommender systems need to collect information about user preferences. Since users are reluctant to invest much time in explicitly expressing their interests, preferences often need to be implicitly inferred through data gathered by monitoring user behavior. Which is, alas, less reliable. This article addresses the problem of learning TV preferences based on tracking the programs users have watched, whilst dealing with the varying degrees of reliability in such information. Three approaches to the problem are discussed: use all information equally; weight information by its reliability or simply discard the most unreliable information. Experimental results for these three approaches are presented and compared using a content-based filtering recommender built on a Naive Bayes classifier.

Improving revisitation browsers capability by using a dynamic bookmarks personal toolbar	WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS ENGINEERING - WISE 2007, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering (WISE 2007)	DEC 03, 2007	Nancy, FRANCE	Nancy Univ, INRIA, Loria, Lorraine Reg, I 3, Grand Nancy, EMISA				In this paper we present a new approach to add intelligence to Internet browsers user interface. Our contribution is based on improving browsers revisitation capabilities by learning a model from user's navigation behaviour, that later is used to predict a set of bookmarks likely to be used next. These set of bookmarks must be a list of moderate size (<= 10) because our goal is to show them in the browser bookmarks personal toolbar. We think that dealing with this part of the user interface is beneficial for revisitation because it is always visible and on the contrary to history or bookmarks list (tree) the user can access the desired web page by using a single mouse click. In this work we focus on performing the comparison of several (computationally) simple classifiers in order to identify a good candidate to be used as user navigation model. From the experiments carried out we identify that a combination of Naive Bayes with OneR could be a good choice.

This paper presents a comparative study of using supervised probabilistic and predictive machine learning techniques for intrusion detection. Two probabilistic techniques Naive Bayes and Gaussian and two predictive techniques Decision Tree and Random Forests are employed. Different training datasets constructed from the KDD99 dataset are employed for training. The ability of each technique for detecting four attack categories (DoS,Probe,R2L and U2R) have been compared. The statistical results to show the sensitivity of each technique to the population of attacks in a dataset have also been reported. We compare the performance of the techniques and also investigate the robustness of each technique by calculating their standard deviations with respect to the detection rate of each attack category.

In this paper, we take a selection of pre-processing methods-focusing specifically on discretization and feature selection-and empirically examine their combined effect on classifier performance. In our experiments, we take 11 standard datasets and a selection of standard machine learning algorithms, namely one-R, ID3, naive Bayes, and IB1, and explore the impact of different forms of preprocessing on each combination of dataset and algorithm. We find that in general the combination of wrapper-based forward selection and naive supervised methods of discretization yield consistently above-baseline results.

Our approach is based on probabilistically modeling the distribution of the differences between the sensor measurements as a mixture of gaussians and then classifying further instances of the sensor differences using a naive bayes classifier. We demonstrate the applicability of this technique to the diagnosis of the sensors/photosites of a CCD array, using sensor array data comprising of randomly selected images. Our technique performs well for different combinations of parameter settings at the detection of the faulty photosites of a CCD array.

In this paper, we present a new multi-view approach for semi-supervised document classification by incorporating both semantic and syntactic information. For this purpose, a co-training style algorithm Co-features is proposed, in active querying, we assign a weight to each sample according to its uncertainty factor, the most informative samples are selected and labeled by other "teachers". In contrast to batch training mode, an incremental Naive Bayes update method is realized, which allow more efficient classifier training even with large pool of unlabeled data Experimental results show that our algorithm works successfully on Reuters-21578 and WebKB, and is superior to Co-testing in the learning efficiency.

In this paper, we investigate machine learning techniques for tongue diagnosis. To do this, we first identify tongue properties and classes. In tongue property identification, we identify 21 properties from tongue substance and coating, whereas in tongue classification, we derive 24 tongue classes. Machine learning techniques are then applied to a tongue dataset. In performance analysis, we use the Weka machine learning environment for conducting the experiment. Five different machine learning algorithms including 1133, J48, Naive Bayes, BayesNet and SMO are used and applied to a tongue dataset of 457 instances. The performance results have shown that the Support Vector Machine algorithm SMO has the best performance for tongue diagnosis based on accuracy and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC).

Semantic video segmentation using probabilistic relaxation - Submitted to VMDL07 and ICIAP07	14TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON IMAGE ANALYSIS AND PROCESSING WORKSHOPS, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing	SEP 10-14, 2007	Modena, ITALY	Imagelab, Univ Studi Modena & Reggio Emilia, Comune Modena, GIRPR, Int Assoc Pattern Recognit, CPS Color, Franco Cosimo Panini, Banca Popolare, Emilia Romagna, Accad Mil Modena, CNA Modena				In this paper we propose a method for temporal segmentation of strongly structured videos on a semantic level. The proposed method is based on a naive Bayes classifier on low level visual features, followed by a two-stage probabilistic relaxation process. The first stage relaxation is on successive video frames that have been classified with the naive Bayes classifier into structural tokens and aims to improve the initial classification result. The second relaxation process is applied on successive video segments and uses knowledge from temporal relations of structural tokens that are characteristic for each broadcasting format and results so to the video segmentation on a semantic level. The experiments carried out, show that the proposed method can be successfully applied to magazine broadcastings.

With this model, we calculate posterior class probabilities for a pattern W combining the observations of W in the training set with prior class probabilities that are obtained recursively from the observations of patterns that are strictly more generic than W. The model achieved performance improvements over standard Bayesian network methods like Naive Bayes and Tree Augmented Naive Bayes, over Bayesian Networks where traditional conditional probability tables were substituted by Noisy-or gates, Default Tables, Decision Trees and Decision Graphs, and over Bayesian Networks constructed after a cardinality reduction preprocessing phase using the Agglomerative Information Bottleneck method.

RoughTree uses the attribute dependence detecting measure in Rough Sets and splits the dataset into subspaces according to the selected attributes, which hold the maximum values by the attribute dependence measure. This process continues the same way a decision tree splits until the stopping criterion is satisfied. Then, the result is a tree-like model and each leaf in the RoughTree is replaced by a Naive-Bayesian classifier. RoughTree eliminates the attribute dependences in its leaves and the experimental results show that RoughTree can achieve better performance than Naive Bayesian classifier.

We show that naive Bayes classifier is a special case of GAB under the conditional independence assumption. GAB relaxes the conditional independence assumptions and takes into account of the influences on an attribute from all other attributes, and extends naive Bayes with the capability in expressiveness of non-linearly separable concepts. We conduct experiments by using datasets from the University of California at the Irvine repository. The experimental results show that the classifier extends naive Bayes with significant improvement in accuracy.

Previous approaches mostly learn either the structure or the parameters in a discriminative manner based on the scoring(+) search paradigm. Many works have focused on structure learning by optimizing a discriminative scoring function but the resulted structure is still generative in the sense that the class variable is not conditioned on attribute variables. On the other hand, searching Markov Blanket in a constrained space can generate a hybrid generative-discriminative structure. In this paper, we propose a new Hybrid Generative-Discriminative (HGD) algorithm for learning Bayesian network structure. The algorithin searches the neighboring structures by Optimizing a cross-validated classification rate (CR) criterion to give a really discriminative structure. We select the initial structure and design neighborhood operators appropriately such that the learning procedure is computationally feasible. Our empirical study on a large suite of bench-mark datasets shows that the proposed HGD+ CR algorithm yields better classification results than BN classifiers with only discriminative scores.

Since classifying web pages of an interesting class is often the first step of mining the web, web page categorization/classification is one of the essential techniques for web mining. One of the main challenges of web page classification is the high dimensional text vocabulary space. In this research, we propose a Hidden Naive Bayes based method for web page classification. We also propose to use the ReliefF feature selection method for selecting relevant words to improve the classification performance. Comparisons with traditional techniques are provided. Results on benchmark dataset show that the proposed methods are promising for accurate web page classification.

The removal is based on a risk-ratio-based criterion and can be supported by our previously developed data mining methods and medical experts. A series of experiments in which two domain experts decided exceptional patients to be removed show that our proposed method is effective and promising from various viewpoints such as obtaining new hypotheses and improving skills of domain experts. Another series of experiments in which exceptional patients were removed automatically led us to a rediscovery of a piece of knowledge, which had been reported in an article of a medical journal as the main result of the article.

In the system, a domain model for stepper motors was designed and a user overlay model was created based on the domain model. Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC), commonly used in adaptive educational hypermedia systems, was preferred in the application for modeling students in vocational education. Students were classified using NBC as "beginner", "intermediate" or "advanced" based on their knowledge level about the domain model. The system gathers data from the users (students) on-line as well as updates the user models continuously. Thus, the system got the on-line adaptability. Moreover, the system has such abilities as guiding and serving additional explanations according to the users' preferences and defects in the knowledge domain.	[Kahraman, H.

This great interest is owning to the advantages offered by special structure of Bayesian networks, which allows them to be very efficient in modeling domains with inherent uncertainty. Bayesian networks techniques can be successfully applied to mining various types of biomedical data.

Iterative denoising using jensen-renyi divergences with an application to unsupervised document categorization	2007 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, Vol II, Pts 1-3	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)		English	Proceedings Paper	32nd IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	APR 15-20, 2007	Honolulu, HI	IEEE Signal Proc Soc		unsupervised learning; clustering methods; information theory; text processing	TREES	Iterative denoising trees were used by Karakos et al. [1] for unsupervised hierarchical clustering. The tree construction involves projecting the data onto low-dimensional spaces, as a means of smoothing their empirical distributions, as well as splitting each node based on an information-theoretic maximization objective. In this paper, we improve upon the work of [1] in two ways: (i) the amount of computation spent searching for a good projection at each node now adapts to the intrinsic dimensionality of the data observed at that node; (ii) the objective at each node is to find a split which maximizes a generalized form of mutual information, the Jensen-Renyi divergence; this is followed by an iterative Naive Bayes classification. The single parameter a of the Jensen-Renyi divergence is chosen based on the "strapping" methodology [2], which learns a meta-classifer on a related task. Compared with the sequential Information Bottleneck method [3], our procedure produces state-of-the-art results on an unsupervised categorization task of documents from the "20 Newsgroups" dataset.

The standard solution of having many random starting points for the EM algorithm is often too expensive computationally. We propose to obtain better starting points for EM by splitting and merging components in models with already estimated parameters. This way we extend our previous work, where only a component splitting was used and the need for a component merging was noticed. We discuss theoretical properties of a component merging. We propose an algorithm that learns latent class models by performing component splitting and merging. In the experiments with real-world data sets, our algorithm in a majority of cases performs better than the standard algorithm. A promising extension would be to apply our method for learning cardinalities and parameters of hidden variables in Bayesian networks.

Traditional query processing techniques that focus on the strict soundness of answer tuples often ignore tuples with critical missing attributes, even if they wind up being relevant to a user query. Ideally we would like the mediator to retrieve such relevant uncertain answers and gauge their relevance by accessing their likelihood of being relevant answers to the query. However the autonomous nature of the databases poses several challenges, such as the restricted access privileges, limited query patterns, and sensitivity of database and network resource consumption in the web environment. We introduce a novel query rewriting and optimization framework QPIAD that tackles these challenges to retrieve relevant uncertain answers. Our technique involves reformulating the user query based on approximate functional dependencies (AFDs) among the database attributes and ranking these queries using value distributions learned from Naive Bayes Classifiers. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in retrieving relevant uncertain answers with high precision, high recall and manageable cost.

Some special structure BNCs have been proposed and demonstrate promise performance. However, recent researches show that structure learning in BNs may lead to a non-negligible posterior problem, i.e, there might be many structures have similar posterior scores. In this paper, we propose a generalized additive Bayesian network classifiers, which transfers the structure learning problem to a generalized additive models (GAM) learning problem. We first generate a series of very simple BNs, and put them in the framework of GAM, then adopt a gradient-based algorithm to learn the combining parameters, and thus construct a more powerful classifier. On a large suite of benchmark data sets, the proposed approach outperforms many traditional BNCs, such as naive Bayes, TAN, etc, and achieves comparable or better performance in comparison to boosted Bayesian network classifiers.

The key problem causing these car accidents is mainly because that the drivers failed to perceive the changes of the traffic lights or the unexpected conditions happening accidentally on the roads. In this paper, we devised a quantitative analysis for ongoing assessment of driver's cognitive responses by investigating the neurobiological information underlying electroencephalographic (EEG) brain dynamics in traffic-fight experiments in a virtual-reality (VR) dynamic driving environment. Three different feature extraction methods including Nonparametric Weighted Feature Extraction (NWFE), Principlal Component Analysis (PCA), Discriminant Analysis Feature Extraction (DAFE) are applied to reduce the feature dimension and project the measured EEG signals to a feature space spanned by their eigenvectors. After that, the mapped data can be classified with fewer features and their classification results are compared by utilizing three different classifiers including Gaussian classifier (GC), k Nearest neighbor classification (KNNC), and Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC). Experimental results show that the successful rate of Nonparametric Weighted Feature Extraction combined with Gaussian classifier is higher more than 10% compared with other combinations. It also demonstrates the feasibility of detecting and analyzing single-trail ERP signals that represent operators' cognitive states and responses to task events.

However, it is limited by the development Of soil erosion mode by far. This paper presents a region-scaled soil erosion qualitative evaluation model based on naive Bayes. Firstly, the model takes the E'Dong Mountain as case study area, chooses the four factor indexes affected erosion intensity, and then calculates the naive Bayes probability of each index of soil erosion based on the observed plot sample data. Secondly, the model abstracts affected factors parameters of soil erosion by RS(Remote Sensing) and GIS(Geography Information System) in study region. Finally, the erosion intensity of region is classified into six classes in terms of the naive Bayes probability: extreme, very high, high, moderate, low, very low. Therefore, the model provides a new method for assessing the soil erosion in regional scale.

Naive Bayes assumes positional independence, which makes the computation of the joint probability value easier at the expense of the accuracy or the underlying reality. In addition, the prior probabilities of positive and negative instances are computed from the training instances, which often do not accurately reflect the real prior probabilities. In this paper we address these two issues. We have developed algorithms that automatically perturb the computed prior probabilities and search around the neighborhood to maximize a given objective function. To improve the prediction accuracy we introduce limited dependency on the underlying pattern. We have demonstrated the importance of these extensions by applying them to solve the problem in discriminating a TATA box from putative TATA boxes found in promoter regions of plant genome. The best prediction accuracy of a naive Bayes with 10 fold cross validation was 69% while the second extension gave the prediction accuracy of 79% which is better than the best solution from an artificial neural network prediction.

Following advances in computer science, a lot of new methods have been proposed in recent years, such as artificial neural networks, decision trees, fuzzy set and Bayesian Networks, etc. As a probabilistic network, Bayesian Networks is a powerful tool for handling uncertainty in data mining and many other domains. Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) is a simple and effective classification method, which is built on the assumption of conditional independence between the class attributes. This topology structure can not describe the inherent relation among the features. In this paper, we apply Bayesian Networks Augmented Naive Bayes (BAN) for the texture classification of aerial images, which relaxes the independent assumption in NBC. A new method for learning the networks topology structure based on training samples is adopted in this paper. Comparison experiments show higher accuracy of BAN classifier than NBC. The results also show the potential applicability of the proposed method.

These domains can have important structural or functional properties. When a protein's sequence, but not structure, is known, being able to predict the division of the sequence into its domains may ease structural or functional analysis of the protein. However, predicting domain boundaries from sequence is still an open problem. This research uses machine learning approaches to the prediction problem. It starts with several standard methods - naive Bayes, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks. The results of these methods are combined using a mixture of experts (MoE) approach that gives the final boundary predictions. We show both a simple MoE approach, and one using context in the form of a window of predictions from the machine learning methods. Both MoE methods, especially the windowed MoE, show greatly increased predictive performance relative to the individual machine learning predictors.

This is a simple technique that calculates the sum of ratios of word frequency in each category. However, in FRAM, feature terms can be used without limit. Therefore, we propose the use of the character N-gram and the word N-gram as feature terms using the above-described property of FRAM. Next, we evaluate the proposed technique through a number of experiments. In these experiments, we classify newspaper articles from Japanese CD-Mainichi 2002 and English Reuters-21578 using the Naive Bayes method (baseline method) and the proposed method. As a result, we show that the classification accuracy of the proposed method is far better than that of the baseline method. Specifically, the classification accuracy of the proposed method is 87.3% for Japanese CD-Mainichi 2002 and 86.1% for English Reuters-21578. Thus, the proposed method has very high performance. Although the proposed method is a simple technique, it provides a new perspective and has a high potential and is language-independent Thus, the proposed method can be expected to be developed further in the future.

However, architectural documentation is often unavailable or out-of-date. In this paper, we explore the use of Bayesian learning methods for automatic recovery of a software system's architecture, given incomplete or out-of-date documentation. We employ software modules with known classifications to train the Naive Bayes Classifier. We then use the classifier to place new instances, i.e. new software modules, into appropriate sub-systems. We evaluate the performance of the classifier by conducting experiments on a software system, and compare the results obtained with a manually prepared architecture. We present an analysis of the results, and also discuss the assumptions under which the results are expected to be meaningful.

In supervised learning, a set of previously annotated images is required to train a classifier. Annotating a large quantity of images by hand is a tedious and time consuming process; so an alternative approach is to label manually a small subset of images, using the other ones under a semi-supervised approach. In this paper, a new semi-supervised ensemble of classifiers, called WSA, for automatic image annotation is proposed. WSA uses naive Bayes as its base classifier. A set of these is combined in a cascade based on the AdaBoost technique. However, when training the ensemble of Bayesian classifiers, it also considers the unlabeled images on each stage. These are annotated based on the classifier from the previous stage, and then used to train the next classifier. The unlabeled instances are weighted according to a confidence measure based on their predicted probability value; while the labeled instances are weighted according to the classifier error, as in standard AdaBoost. WSA has been evaluated with benchmark data sets, and 2 sets of images, with promising results.

Its interpretation is subjective, dependent upon the expertise and experience of the clinical scientist. It? this study we investigated the role of machine learning for pattern classification in this domain. We extracted features from the ABRs of 85 test subjects (550 waveforms) and compared four complimentary supervised classification methods: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Multi-Layer Perceptron and KStar The ABR dataset comprised both high level and near threshold recordings, labeled as 'response' or 'no response' by the human expert. Features were extracted from single averaged recordings to make the classification process straightforward. A best classification accuracy of 83.4% was obtained using Naive Bayes and five relevant features extracted from time and wavelet domains. Naive Bayes also achieved the highest specificity (863%). The highest sensitivity (93.1%) was obtained with Support Vector Machine-based classification models. In terms of the overall classification accuracy, four classifiers have shown the consistent, relatively high performance, indicating the relevance of selected features and the feasibility of using machine learning and statistical classification models in the analysis of ABR.

The aim of this study was to discover significant rules discriminating ER+ and ER-cases of breast cancer. We compared both statistical accuracy and biological validity of the results using common statistical methods and Gene Ontology. Some worth noting characteristics of these systems have been observed and analysed even giving some possible interpretations of findings. With this study we tried to show how intelligent systems can be employed in the design of experimental pipeline in disease processes investigation and how deriving high-throughput results can be validated using new computational tools. Results returned by this approach seem to encourage new efforts in this field.

We use R-red, G-green, and B-blue 1D histograms to estimate the histogram to be equalized using a Naive Bayes rule. The histogram equalization is performed by shift hue-preserving transformations. Our method has linear time and space complexities, which complies with real-time applications requirements. A subjective assessment comparing our method and other three is performed. Experiments showed that our method is more robust than the others in the sense that neither unrealistic colors nor over-enhancement are produced.

One way to implement this principle in practice is to compute the Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) distribution for a given parametric model class. Unfortunately this is a computationally infeasible task for many model classes of practical importance. In this paper we present a fast algorithm for computing the NML for the Naive Bayes model class, which is frequently used in classification and clustering tasks. The algorithm is based on a relationship between powers of generating functions and discrete convolution. The resulting algorithm has the time complexity of O(n(2)), where n is the size of the data.

Two kinds of work are done by us. Firstly, in order to overcome the sparse data problem, which is almost suffered from by all the corpus based supervised learning classifiers, we propose to incorporate the smoothing algorithm into the naive bayes (NB) model. Secondly, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is good at the classification task with the high dimension feature space, and has the good generalization in small-scale samples. A high-efficient SVM is presented to reduce the storage requirement and decrease the time computing complexity. Thirdly, a specialty, word extraction algorithm based on Information Entropy is presented in this paper, which can improve the performance of Chinese Word Segmentation, accordingly, improve the spam filter task in English and in Chinese Experiments show that the improvement in NB acquires by 1.38% precision, and it is 0.69% higher precision than the SVM.

Bayesian model needs the feature independent assumption; Artificial Neural Network suffers from the overfitting problem; Support vector machine (SVM) does not do well in real-value feature. This paper proposes to combine entropy and machine learning techniques for document classification. Firstly, the cross entropy and average mutual information are presented to effectively extract the features. Secondly, the support vector machine and maximum entropy model is adopted respectively to perform the classification task in the feature space. Furthermore, an improved feature description instead the binary feature with the real-value is presented in this text, since the prior knowledge of each word is helpful to document classification. Finally, we compare our method with the traditional methods, and the experiment showed our method increased 2.78 % F-measures than basic ME model, and 0.95% than naive bayes model which was smoothed by Good-Turing algorithm.

Firstly, we adopt the tri-gram language model to perform word segmentation in the Chinese Email. In order to overcome the sparse data problem, the Absolute Discount Smoothing algorithm is applied. Secondly, the different factoid words are identified by the Automaton Machine, so as to acquire the approximate syntactic and semantic usage of factoid words in the anti-spam filter task. Thirdly, we apply Support Vector Machine to filter the spam, where the Emails are permitted to be written by the cross language, including Chinese and English. The experiments in the large-scale corpora with the cross language show that the SVM can improve the generalization than the Naive Bayes (Smoothed by Lidstone algorithm) by 4.09% precision, and 8.18% higher precision than the Maximum Entropy Model.

The oracle assigns different training(testing) samples to 2 sub-classifiers of the same type using hyperplane splits in or er to increase the diversity of voting results since errors are or shared across sub-classifiers. Eleven classifiers were evaluated for performance as the base classifier including k nearest neighbor (kNN), naive Bayes classifier (NBC), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), learning vector quantization (LVQ1), polytomous logistic regression (PLOG), artificial neural networks (ANN), constricted particle swarm optimization (CPSO), kernel regression (KREG), radial basis function networks (RBFN), gradient descent support vector machines (SVMGD), and least squares support vector machines (SVMLS). Logistic ensembles (PLOG) resulted in the best performance when used as a base classifier for RSLO.

This is often at the cost of lengthy wait-times for the user between each query iteration. We deal with a real-world information extraction task, extracting attribute-value pairs from product descriptions, where the learning system needs to be interactive and the users time needs to be used efficiently. The first step uses coEM with naive Bayes as the semi-supervised algorithm. This paper focuses on the second step which is an interactive active learning phase. We present an approximation to coEM with naive Bayes that can incorporate user feedback almost instantly and can use any sample-selection strategy for active learning. Our experimental results show high levels of accuracy while being orders of magnitude faster than using the standard coEM with naive Bayes, making our IE system practical by optimizing user time.

Even though various techniques exist for the extraction of domain specific concepts from unstructured texts, very little concentration is in the semantic class labeling for concepts. In this paper we propose the Semantic Class Labeling(SCL) problem and differentiate it from the Named Entity Classification(NEC) problem. We also present a Naive Bayes solution to SCL. Experiments suggest that Naive Bayes learning method with specified features achieves high classification accuracy. Empirical and statistical evaluation on the significance of attributes for SCL is also presented.

Using Discourse Analysis to Improve Text Categorization in MEDLINE	MEDINFO 2007: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 12TH WORLD CONGRESS ON HEALTH (MEDICAL) INFORMATICS, PTS 1 AND 2: BUILDING SUSTAINABLE HEALTH SYSTEMS	Studies in Health Technology and Informatics		English	Proceedings Paper	12th World Congress on Health (Medical) Informatics	AUG 20-24, 2007	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	Hlth Informat Soc Australia		text mining; abstracting andiIndexing; information storage and retrieval; natural language processing; libraries; medical; artificial intelligence		PROBLEM: Automatic keyword assignment has been largely studied in medical informatics in the context of the MEDLINE database, both for helping search in MEDLINE and in order to provide an indicative "gist" of the content of an article. Automatic assignment of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), which is formally an automatic text categorization task, has been proposed using different methods or combination of methods, including machine learning (naive Bayes, neural networks ...), linguistically-motivated methods (syntactic parsing, semantic tagging, or information retrieval. METHODS: In the present study, we propose to evaluate the impact of the argumentative structures of scientific articles to improve the categorization effectiveness of a categorizer, which combines linguistically-motivated and information retrieval methods. Our argumentative categorizer which uses representation levels inherited from the field of discourse analysis, is able to classify sentences of an abstract in four classes: PURPOSE; METHODS,RESULTS and CONCLUSION. For the evaluation, the OHSUMED collection, a sample of MEDLINE, is used as a benchmark. For each abstract in the collection, the result of the argumentative classifier, i.e. the labeling of each sentence with an argumentative class, is used to modify the original ranking of the MeSH categorizer RESULTS: The most effective combination (+2%, p<0.003) strongly over-weights the METHODS section and moderately the RESULTS and CONCLUSION section. CONCLUSION: Although modest, the improvement brought by argumentative features for text categorization confirms that discourse analysis methods could benefit text mining in scientific digital libraries.

Detection of Cognitive States from fMRI data using Machine Learning Techniques	20TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence	JAN 06-12, 2007	Hyderabad, INDIA					Over the past decade functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful technique to locate activity of human brain while engaged in a particular task or cognitive state. We consider the inverse problem of detecting the cognitive state of a human subject based on the fMRI data. We have explored classification techniques such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbour and Support Vector Machines. In order to reduce the very high dimensional fMRI data, we have used three feature selection strategies. Discriminating features and activity based features were used to select features for the problem of identifying the instantaneous cognitive state given a single fMRI scan and correlation based features were used when fMRI data from a single time interval was given. A case study of visuo-motor sequence learning is presented. The set of cognitive states we are interested in detecting are whether the subject has learnt a sequence, and if the subject is paying attention only towards the position or towards both the color and position of the visual stimuli. We have successfully used correlation based features to detect position-color related cognitive states with 80% accuracy and the cognitive states related to learning with 62.5% accuracy.

The existing classification algorithms and single level execution of them are insufficient on web data. Moreover, because of the variety in the context and structure of even common domain Websites, there is a lack of training data. In this paper we had three experiences: 1- using information in domain ontology about the layers of classes to train classifiers (layered classification) with improvement up to 10% on accuracy of classification. 2- experience on problem of training dataset and using clustering as a preprocess. 3- using ensembles to benefit from both two methods. Beside the improvement of accuracy from these experiences, we found out that with ensemble we can dispense with the algorithm of classification and use a simple classification like Naive Bayes and have the accuracy of complex algorithms like SVM.

We apply Inductive logic programming (ILP) as a strong learner in ICT. The objective of this research is to evaluate the potential of the strong learner in order to boost the performance of the weak learner of ICT. We compare the result with the supervised Naive Bayes, which is the well-known algorithm for the text classification problem. The performance of our learning algorithm is also compare with other semi-supervised learning algorithms which are Co-Training and EM. The experimental results show that ICT algorithm outperforms those algorithms and the performance of the weak learner can be enhanced by ILP system.

However, this intensity has been under utilized as a feature for image classification because it does not represent true terrain radiance. In areas with minimal topographic relief, such as beaches, we show that segmenting intensity images rather than elevation images has great potential for scene analysis. Several intensity-based features are extracted from ALSM data collected along a beach and partitioned into three classes to detect the water line. Class-conditional probability density functions are estimated for each feature to asses which are most informative. Results indicate significant class separation using centroidal features. Their classification performance is evaluated using a naive Bayes classifier and the area under. receiver operating characteristic curves. The method presented provides a novel feature extraction and a systematic feature selection procedure for high-resolution ALSM intensity data.	[Starek, Michael J.; Vemula, Raghav K.; Slatton, K.

But most Of the previous approaches treated the attribute relation in the same way for all class labels. In practice, this relation may be different for different class labels. This paper proposes a novel approach, by which the posterior probability of different class label is evaluated using different attribute relation. Experiment results indicate that the new approach obtains comparative performance relative to other modem Bayesian classifiers on some datasets, and on some other datasets it outperforms the others.

This is a simple technique that adds up the maximum ratios of term frequency among categories. However, in MFRAM, feature terms can be used without limit. Therefore, we propose the use of Character N-gram and Word N-gram as feature terms using the above-described property of MFRAM. Next, we evaluate the proposed technique through some experiments. Our experiments classify articles from Japanese newspaper "CD-Mainichi 2002" using the Naive Bayes method (baseline method) and the proposed method. As a result, we show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline method greatly. That is, the classification accuracy of the proposed method was 88.7%. Thus, the proposed method has a very high performance. Though the proposed method is a simple technique, it has a new viewpoint, a high potential, so it can be expected the development in the future.

Class membership probabilities are important in many applications in document classification, in which multiclass classification is often applied. In the proposed method, we first make an accuracy table by counting the number of correctly classified training samples in each range or cell of classification scores. We then apply smoothing methods such as a moving average method with coverage to the accuracy table. In order to determine the class membership probability of an unknown sample, we first calculate the classification scores of the sample, then find the range or cell that corresponds to the scores and output the values associated in the range or cell in the accuracy table. Through experiments on two different datasets with both Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes classifiers, we empirically show that the use of multiple classification scores is effective in the estimation of class membership probabilities, and that the proposed smoothing methods for the accuracy table work quite well. We also show that the estimated class membership probabilities by the proposed method are useful in the detection of the misclassified samples.

Our network models the generative story among speech recognition-based features, treating pronunciation variants and reading mistakes as distinct but not independent cues to a qualitative perception of reading ability. This Bayesian approach allows us to estimate the probabilistic dependencies among many highly-correlated features, and to calculate soft decision scores based on the posterior probabilities for each class. With all proposed features, the best version of our network outperforms the C4.5 decision tree classifier by 17% and a Naive Bayes classifier by 8%, in terms of correlation with speaker-level reading scores on the Tball data set. This best correlation of 0.92 approaches the expert inter-evaluator correlation, 0.95.

Ten different feature vectors are obtained from authorship attributes, n-grams and various combinations of these feature vectors that are extracted from documents, which the authors are intended to be identified. Comparative performance of every feature vector is analyzed by applying Naive Bayes, SVM, k-NN, RE and MLP classification methods. The most successful classifiers are MLP and SVM. In document classification process, it is observed that n-grams give higher accuracy rates than authorship attributes. Nevertheless, using n-gram and authorship attributes together, gives better results than when each is used alone.

Statistical models for defect prediction can be built on project repositories. Project repositories store software metrics and defect information. This information is then matched with software modules. Naive Bayes is a well known, simple statistical technique that assumes the 'independence' and 'equal importance' of features, which are not true in many problems. However, Naive Bayes achieves high performances on a wide spectrum of prediction problems. This paper addresses the 'equal importance' of features assumption of Naive Bayes. We propose that by means of heuristics we can assign weights to features according to their importance and improve defect prediction performance. We compare the weighted Naive Bayes and the standard Naive Bayes predictors' performances on publicly available datasets.

In this article, we present FiberID, a simple yet effective method for identifying and distinguishing three fibrous protein subclasses from their primary sequences. Using a combination of amino acid composition and fast Fourier measurements, FiberID can classify fibrous proteins belonging to these subclasses with high accuracy by using two standard machine learning techniques (decision trees and Naive Bayesian classifiers). After presenting our results, we present several fibrous sequences that are regularly misclassified by FiberID as sequences of potential interest for further study. Finally, we analyze the decision trees developed by FiberID for potential insights regarding the structure of these proteins. Proteins 2007;66:127-135. (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

However, many different versions of Bayes model consider only one aspect of a particular word. In this paper we define an information criterion, Projective Information Gain, to decide which representation is appropriate for a specific word. Based on this, the conditional independence assumption is extended to make it more efficient and feasible and then we propose a novel Bayes model, General Naive Bayes (GNB), which can handle two representations concurrently. Experimental results and theoretical justification that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach are presented.

In this paper, we study the selective AODE problem and propose(] a Cross-Entropy based method to search the optimal subset over the whole onee-dependence estimators. We experimentally test our algorithm in term of classification accuracy, using the 36 UCI data sets recommended by Weka, and compare it to C4.5[5], naitive Bayes, CL-TAN[6], HNB[7], AODE and LAODE[3]. The experiment results show that our method significantly outperforms all the other algorithms used to compare, and remarkably reduces the number of one-deperidence estimators used compared to AODE.

Averaged One-Dependence Estimators, simply AODE, is a recently proposed semi-naive Bayes algorithm and demonstrates significantly high classification accuracy at a modest cost. In many data mining applications, however, accurate probability estimation is more desirable when making optimal decisions. Usually, probability estimation performance is measured by conditional log likelihood (CLL). In this paper, we first study the probability estimation performance of AODE and compare it to naive Bayes, Tree-Augumented naive Bayes, CLLTree, C4.4 (the improved version of C4.5 for better probability estimation) and Support Vector Machines. From our experiments, we find that AODE performs significantly better than the algorithms used to compare except C4.4, and performs slightly better than C4.4 although its classification accuracy is significantly better than C4.5. We then propose an efficient forward greedy feature selection algorithm for A ODE and use the CLL score for attribute selection. The experimental results show that our algorithm achieves substantially improvement over AODE and significantly outperforms C4.4. Our experiments are conducted on the basis of 36 UCI data sets that cover a wide range of domains and data characteristics and we run all the algorithms within the Weka platform.

Recent success of language modeling in information retrieval have let us consider again about multinomial Naive Bayes for text classification. In this paper, we propose a semantic smoothing method for Naive Bayes model, biomedical documents were indexed by the concept of UMLS, and at the same time concept pairs which are context-sensitive were extracted as topic signature, the translation between concept pair and concept is attained using EM algorithm. Then classification model is estimated by a mixture model combined with this semantic smoothing method. Ontology-based document representation can deal with synonym and reduce the concept vector. The semantic smoothing method can partly solve the sparseness of data. Our method is evaluated on OHSUMED and genomic track collection, and proper results were attained. We found this semantic smoothing method can attain better results than other simple smoothing method, also this method is significant because of its simpleness, comprehensibility.

Spam mail filters are a popular example hereof. A naive Bayes filter assumes conditional independence of the feature vector components. We use the context tree weighting method as an application of the minimum description length principle to allow for dependencies between the feature vector components. It turns out that, due to the limited amount of training data, we must assume conditional independence between groups of vector components. We consider several ad-hoc algorithms to find good groupings and good conditional models.

The proposed method considers the features as the word stems. The fact that the number of the features exceeds the practical computing limits each document represented by a number of features as in the document classes. Each word stem in a document analyzed in different classes and the sum of the usage frequency in the document classes given the feature value of that document. To speed up the process of extracting usage frequencies of word stems and analyzing it in different document classes Trie tree structure has been used. In thus study, we have selected five different classes which are economy, healthy, magazine, sports and politics.

However, researchers in the classification area were not interested in Bayesian networks until the simplest kind of Bayesian networks, Naive Bayes Classifiers (NBC), came forth. From that time on, their success led to a recent furry of algorithms for learning Bayesian networks from raw data and triggered experts to explore more deeply into Bayesian networks as classifiers. Although many of learners produce good results on some benchmark data sets, there are still several problems: nodes ordering requirement, computational complexity, lack of publicly available learning tools. Therefore, this paper puts up a new method, Bayesian networks with hidden nodes, which adds some hidden nodes between correlated feature variables to Bayesian networks based on the maximal covariance criterion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient and effective, and outperforms NBC and Bayesian Network Augmented Naive Bayes (BAN).

Tissue distribution in each modality can provide important information about the elastic characteristics of breast which is useful for computer-aided diagnosis. In this paper, the Naive Bayes (NB) fusion rule is utilized to combine a group of Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural learners in a multiple classifier system for classification of breast tissues. The empirical results show the NB fusion rule may effectively diminish the mean-squared errors, and also improve approximately 15% classification accuracy, which is significantly better than the component RBF neural learners. Moreover, the NB fusion rule also outperforms the widely used simple average and majority voting fusion rules.

The approach, FOA, takes the delayed reward into account and subsequently labels newly crawled web pages online. To minimize the bad effect of the naive Bayes classifiers, we adopt the fuzzy center-averaged clustering method to label crawled web pages, and using the calculated fuzzy memberships as class weights when calculating the fuzzy averaged Q values that map hyperlinks to future discounted rewards. The candidate hyperlinks are ranked according to their corresponding fuzzy averaged Q values, and the hyperlink with the optimal Q value is the best one to be crawled in the next step. Experiments of topic crawling tasks have shown FOA collects high harvest rate.

Feature selection for gene expression data aims at finding a set of genes that best discriminate biological samples of different types. In this paper, we present a two-stage selection algorithm by combining ReliefF and mRMR: In the first stage, ReliefF is applied to find a candidate gene set; In the second stage, mRMR method is applied to directly and explicitly reduce redundancy for selecting a compact yet effective gene subset from the candidate set. We also perform comprehensive experiments to compare the mRMR-ReliefF selection algorithm with ReliefF, mRMR and other feature selection methods using two classifiers as SVM and Naive Bayes, on seven different datasets. The experimental results show that the mRMR-ReliefF gene selection algorithm is very effective.

Its capacity to significantly improve naive Bayes' accuracy without undue time complexity has attracted substantial interest. Forward Sequential Selection and Backwards Sequential Elimination are effective wrapper techniques to identify and repair harmful interdependencies which have been profitably applied to naive Bayes. However, their straightforward application to AODE has previously proved ineffective. We investigate novel variants of these strategies. Our extensive experiments show that elimination of child attributes from within the constituent ODEs results in a significant improvement in probability estimate and reductions in bias and error relative to unmodified AODE. In contrast, elimination of complete constituent ODEs and the four types of attribute addition are found to be less effective and do not demonstrate any strong advantage over AODE. These surprising results lead to effective techniques for improving AODE's prediction accuracy.

B			Miyazaki, T; Paik, I; Wei, D					Ensembles of region based classifiers	2007 CIT: 7TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	7th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology	OCT 16-19, 2007	Aizu-Wakamatsu City, JAPAN	Univ Aizu				In machine learning, ensemble classifiers have been introduced for more accurate pattern classification than single classifiers. We propose a new ensemble learning method that employs a set of region based classifiers. Since the distribution of data can be different in different regions in the feature space, we split the data and generate classifiers based on each region and apply a weighted voting among the classifiers. We used I I data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to compare the performance of our new ensemble method with that of individual classifiers as well as other ensemble methods such as bagging and boosting. As a result, we found that our method improve performance, particularly when the base learner is Naive Bayes or SVM.									0	0	0	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA			978-0-7695-2983-7				2007							41	46				6	Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BHB72	WOS:000252104400009

In this paper, a spam detection model was presented based on Naive Bayes classifier. Through analyzing text pre-processing methods (such as stop word elimination, word stemming, and feature selection), some new conclusions are drawn, which differs from original opinion in some cases. Then we introduce an approach to modify the Naive Bayes classifier by simply introduce weight and class prior probability adjustment that can help to improve the classification accuracy efficiently. And a fast simplification algorithm using feedback was proposed, which can be applied to the large-scale email corpus. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

We automatically discover low-level, short-range byte data structure patterns from a document data stream by extracting all byte sub-sequences within a sliding window to form an augmented (or bounded-length) string spectrum feature map and using a modified suffix trie data structure (called the coloured generalized suffix tree or CGST) to efficiently store and manipulate the feature map. Using the CGST we are able to efficiently compute the stream's bounded-length sequence spectrum kernel. We compare the performance of two classifier algorithms to categorize the data streams, namely, the SVM and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers. Experiments have provided good classification performance results on a variety of document byte streams, particularly when using the NB classifier under certain parameter settings. Results indicate that the bounded-length kernel is superior to the standard fixed-length kernel for semi-structured documents.

To reveal the error correcting code characteristics, several researchers have applied a statistical-mechanical approach to this problem. In our research, we have treated the error correcting code as a Bayes inference framework. Carrying out the inference in practice, we have applied the NMF (naive mean field) approximation to the MPM (maximizer of the posterior marginals) inference, which is a kind of Bayes inference. In the field of artificial neural networks, this approximation is used to reduce computational cost through the substitution of stochastic binary units with the deterministic continuous value units. However, few reports have quantitatively described the performance of this approximation. Therefore, we have analyzed the approximation performance from a theoretical viewpoint, and have compared our results with the computer simulation.

These methods learn labeled text documents and then construct classifiers. The generated classifiers can predict which category is located for a new coming text document. The keywords in the document are often used to form rules to categorize text documents, for example "kw = computer" can be a rule for the IT documents category. However, the number of keywords is very large. To select keywords from the large number of keywords is a challenging work. Recently, a rule generation method based on enumeration of all possible keywords combinations has been proposed [2]. In this method, there remains a crucial problem: how to prune irrelevant combinations at the early stages of the rule generation procedure. In this paper, we propose a method than can effectively prune irrelative keywords at an early stage.

They present good complementarities in detecting different kinds of attacks. However, both of them generate a high number of false negatives. This paper proposes a hybrid classifier that exploits complentaries between decision trees and naive bayes. In order to reduce false negative rate, we propose to reexaminate decision trees and Bayes nets outputs by an anomaly-based detection system.

In this paper, a probabilistic approach to handle such uncertainty in RoboCup 3D is proposed, specifically a Naive Bayes classifier. Although its conditional independence assumption is not always accomplished, it has proved to be successful in a whole range of applications. Typically, the Naive Bayes model assumes discrete attributes, but in RoboCup 3D the attributes are continuous. In literature, Naive Bayes has been adapted to handle continuous attributes mainly using Gaussian distributions or discretizing the domain, both of which present certain disadvantages. In the former, the probability density of attributes is not always well-fitted by a normal distribution. In the latter, there can be loss of information. Instead of discretizing, the use of a Fuzzy Naive Bayes classifier is proposed in which attributes do not take a single value, but a set of values with a certain membership degree. Gaussian and Fuzzy Naive Bayes classifiers are implemented for the pass evaluation skill of 3D agents. The classifiers are trained with different number of training examples and different number of attributes. Each generated classifier is tested in a scenario with three teammates and four opponents. Additionally, Gaussian and Fuzzy approaches are compared versus a random pass selector. Finally, it is shown that the Fuzzy Naive Bayes approach offers very promising results in the RoboCup 3D domain.

The key idea is to use grip-pattern, which is naturally produced when a user tries to use the mobile device, as a clue to determine an application to be launched. To this end, a capacitive touch sensor system is carefully designed and installed underneath the housing of the mobile device to capture the information of the user's grip-pattern. The captured data is then recognized by a minimum distance classifier and a naive Bayes classifier. The recognition test is performed to validate the feasibility of the proposed user interface system.

Though the classification of audio into single type such as music, speech, environmental sound and silence is well studied, classification of mixed type audio data, such as clips having speech with music as background, is still considered a difficult problem. In this paper, we present a mixed type audio classification system based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). In order to capture characteristics of different types of audio data, besides selecting audio features, we also design four different representation formats for each feature. Our SVM-based audio classifier can classify audio data into five types: music, speech, environment sound, speech mixed with music, and music mixed with environment sound. The experimental results show that our system outperforms other classification systems using k Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Neural Network (NN), and Naive Bayes (NB).

In factored classification the class, label is factored into a vector of class features. A topic-based mixture model to factored classification of text documents in which each document is assumed to be generated by a mixture of class features is presented. Another three algorithms based on Naive Bayes model are compared with the topic-based mixture model. Experiments in factored text classification problems show that topic-based mixture model can outperform the other three approaches for categories with especially sparse training data.

Personalized spam filtering with semi-supervised classifier ensemble	2006 IEEE/WIC/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WEB INTELLIGENCE, (WI 2006 MAIN CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT 2006)	DEC 18-22, 2006	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, WIC, ACM				The proliferation of unsolicited emails, also known as spam, poses significant burden to email users worldwide. Recent researches on spam filtering have shown that high accuracies can be obtained if labeled emails examples are available from the particular user of the spam filter However, the time consuming process of providing personalized labeled training examples is often inconvenient or impossible due to privacy issues. In this paper a semi-supervised personalized spam filter based on classifier ensemble is proposed that classifies user emails accurately by learning on both generic labeled emails and personalized unlabeled emails. The proposed multi-stage classification process begins learning a SVM model from labeled generic data. Unlabeled user emails are then fed to this SVM to generate personalized labeled data for constructing personalized naive Bayes classifiers. Furthermore, some personalized labeled examples are generated by exploiting rare word distributions and then fed into a semi-supervised classifier The multi-stage results are integrated with SVMs learned from generic labeled emails to produce the final classification results. Experimental results show that the proposed approaches can significantly increases the classification accuracy in spam filtering.

We extract the signal intensity and frequency energy of audio as the attributes of input instances for the machine learning techniques. The audio is synthesized from MDI files, providing exact information of onset events. We test three state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks (AW), and Naive Bayes (NB) with Ada boosting, for learning and classifying audio onsets. We found that SVMs perform best in general, based on the average of training and 10-fold cross validation errors as the evaluation criterion. We then test the SVM and NN, the two best performing methods, on Bach's Prelude in C major BWV 943, transposed to different keys and time-stretched to various tempi. The error rates ranged from 23.91% (when training set key and tempo equals those of the test set) to 37.22% (when the key is off by four accidentals) and 37.91% (when tempo is 20 beats per minute faster). The results show that audio onset detection performs significantly better when the key and tempo attributes of the test and training sets concur, than when they are different, thus supporting the utility of tempo and key knowledge in designing onset detection systems, or in prescribing confidence statistics to onset detection outcomes.

In fact, some studies compared feature selection techniques or feature space transformation whereas some others compared the performance of different algorithms. Recently, following the rising interest towards the Support Vector Machine, various studies showed that the SVM outperforms other classification algorithms. So should we just not bother about other classification algorithms and opt always for SVM? We have decided to investigate this issue and compared SVM to kNN and naive Bayes on binary classification tasks. An important issue is to compare optimized versions of these algorithms, which is what we have done. Our results show all the classifiers achieved comparable performance on most problems. One surprising result is that SVM was not a clear winner, despite quite good overall performance. If a suitable preprocessing is used with kNN, this algorithm continues to achieve very good results and scales up well with the number of documents, which is not the case for SVM. As for naive Bayes, it also achieved good performance.

In this context, an important regulatory mechanisms are the promoters regions, which promote the initialization of the gene expression process. In this paper, we present an empirical comparison of machine learning techniques such as Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks to the task of promoter prediction. In order to do so, we first build a hybrid dataset of promoter and nonpromoter sequences for six different species of Bacillus: subtilis, liqueniformis, cereus, megaterium, thurigiensis, and firmus.

Our unsupervised approach uses an Expectation Maximization (EM) based clustering algorithm and the supervised approach uses the Naive Bayes classifier.

Sequences of data mining algorithms offer room for improvement that are yet unexploited. If it is known that an algorithm is the first of a sequence of algorithms and there will be future runs of other algorithms, the first algorithm can determine intermediate results that the succeeding algorithms need. The anteceding algorithm can also determine helpful statistics for succeeding algorithms. As the anteceding algorithm has to scan the data anyway, computing intermediate results happens as a by-product of computing the anteceding algorithm's result. On the one hand, a succeeding algorithm can save time because several steps of that algorithm have already been pre-computed. On the other hand, additional information about the analysed data can improve the quality of results such as the accuracy of classification, as demonstrated in experiments with synthetical and real data.

Visualizing distributions and classification accuracy	Information Visualization			English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Information Visualization (IV06)	JUL 05-07, 2006	London, ENGLAND					Data mining is the search for novel, actionable information within data. It is important to note that the number of records in the data being analyzed is only one (and perhaps a small) factor in determining the complexity of a given data mining technique. Most complexity in data mining arises from the distribution of values contained in the data - not the number of records. In this paper we utilize straightforward histogram-based visualizations to gain insight into how the performance of a well-studied data mining technique, the naive-Bayes classifier, performs under various discretization schemes for both continuous and discrete values. The resulting visualization system provides users with a tool that describes the underlying model of the data used by the classifier. Exploratory visualizations of the distributions of training, data can be selected based on expert domain knowledge and then combined to apply to the test data.

The naive Bayes model is one of the first statistical models that have been applied to EE for learning extraction patterns from labeled data. In spite of the simplicity and popularity of the naive Bayes model, we have observed a formulation problem in previous work on naive Bayes IE. In this paper, we present a formal naive Bayes modeling for IE, by which the derived formula for the filler probability, estimation is more theoretically sound. We also address smoothing techniques in order to overcome the data sparseness problem. Our proposed smoothing strategy is shown to be critical to the robustness of a naive Bayes IE system. Experimental results show that our naive Bayes IE systems achieve better extraction performance compared to related work.

All these needs necessitate automatically distinguishing subjective weblog contents from objective ones, namely subjectivity categorization. Since weblogs contain various topics from different domains, limited training data can hardly cover all the topics and "unseen words" becomes a serious problem for categorization tasks. In this paper, Part-Of-Speech (POS) based smoothing is proposed to alleviate the "unseen words" problem. In conjunction with a naive Bayes model constructed from limited training data, the probability of an unseen word in a new domain can be well smoothed by the probability of its POS result. Empirical studies on five datasets show that our approach consistently outperforms the basic naive Bayes with Laplace smoothing. In a cross-domain experiment, our approach achieves 22.0% improvement in Macro Fl and 24.4% in Micro Fl over basic naive Bayes. These verify that POS based smoothing can indeed benefit subjectivity categorization, especially in the cases with a large number of unseen words.

In this paper a new junk email (spam) filtering model, 2LSI-SF, is proposed and it is based on the augmented category LSI spaces and classifies email messages by their content. The model utilizes the valuable discriminative information in the training data and incorporates several pertinent feature selection and message classification algorithms. The experiments of 2LSI-SF on a benchmark spam testing corpus (PU1) and a newly compiled Chinese spam corpus (ZH1) have been conducted. The results from the experiments and performance comparison with the popular Support Vector Machines (SVM) and naive Bayes classifiers have shown that 2LSI-SF is capable of filtering spam effectively.

Software metrics are the key tool in software quality management. In this paper we propose to use Naive Bayes and RIPPER for software quality classification and use Random Projection to improve the performance of classifiers. Feature extraction via Random Projection has attracted considerable attention in recent years. The approach has interesting theoretical underpinnings and offers computational advantages. Results on benchmark dataset MIS, using Accuracy and Recall as performance measures, indicate that Random Projection can improve the classification performance of all four learners we investigate: Naive Bayes, RIPPER, MLP and IB1. With the help of Random Projection, Naive Bayes and RIPPER are better than MLP and IB1 in finding fault-high software modules, which can be sought as potentially highly faulty modules where most of our testing and maintenance effort should be focused.

This assumption can be restrictive in many real world classification tasks. We describe RNBL-MN, which relaxes this assumption by constructing a tree of Naive Bayes classifiers for sequence classification, where each individual NB classifier in the tree is based on a multinomial event model (one for each class at each node in the tree). In our experiments on protein sequence and text classification tasks, we observe that RNBL-MN substantially outperforms NB classifier. Furthermore, our experiments show that RNBL-MN outperforms C4.5 decision tree learner (using tests on sequence composition statistics as the splitting criterion) and yields accuracies that are comparable to those of support vector machines (SVM) using similar information.

A molecular computing algorithm to evolve DNA-encoded genetic patterns has been previously reported in [1], [2]. Here we improve on the previous work by studying the convergence behavior of the molecular evolutionary algorithm in the context of text classification problems. In particular, we study the error reduction behavior of the evolutionary learning algorithm, both theoretically and experimentally. The individuals represent decision lists of variable length and the whole population takes part in making probabilistic decisions. The evolutionary process is to change each individual towards correct classification of training data, which is based on an error minimization strategy. The evolved molecular classifiers show a performance competitive to the standard algorithms such as naive Bayes and neural network classifiers on the data set we studied. The possibility of molecular implementation by use of DNA-encoded individuals combined with simple molecular operations on a very big population distinguishes this approach from other existing evolutionary algorithms.

Extended naive Bayes classifiers also rely on independence assumptions, but break them down to artificial subclasses, in this way becoming more powerful than ordinary naive Bayes classifiers. Since the involved computations for Bayes classifiers are basically generalised mean value calculations, they easily render themselves to incremental and online learning. However, for the extended naive Bayes classifiers it is necessary, to choose and construct the subclasses, a problem whose answer is not obvious, especially in the case of online learning. In this paper we propose an evolving extended naive Bayes classifier that can learn and evolve in an online manner.

This gradual change introduces new challenges in web page and web site classification. HTML is used for presentation of content. XML represents content in a hierarchical manner. XSLT is used to transform XML documents into different formats such as HTML, WML. There are certain drawbacks in HTML and XML classifications for classifying a web page. In this paper we propose a new classification method based on XSLT which is able to combine the advantages of HTML and XML classifications. We also introduce a web classification framework utilizing XSLT classification. Finally we show that using Naive Bayes classifier XSLT classification outperfoms both HTML and XML classifications.

The first method is naive Bayes attempt adopted to the probabilistic model of sequential decision problem in which, the assumption of Markov dependence in the sequence of recognized patterns is made.

We sample a virtual example from a Bayesian network constructed with the original training set. The usefulness of a sampled virtual example for learning is measured by the increment of the network's conditional likelihood. A qualified virtual example is saved and used to update the network for the next sampling. By repeating this process we can generate candidate virtual example sets of various sizes. Among these candidates, an appropriately sized virtual example set for a target learning algorithm is chosen through statistical significance tests. Experiments have shown that the virtual examples collected this way can help various learning algorithms to derive classifiers of improved accuracy.

Table is one of the commonest modes for presenting information. Table extraction has applications in information retrieval, knowledge acquisition, and text mining. Automatic information extraction from table is a challenge. Existing methods was mainly focusing on table extraction from web pages (formatted table extraction). So far the problem of table extraction on plain text, to the best of our knowledge, has not received sufficient attention. In this paper, unformatted table extraction is formalized as unformatted table block detection and unformatted table row identification. We concentrate particularly on the table extraction from Chinese documents. We propose to conduct the task of table extraction by combining machine learning methods and document structure. We first view the task as classification and propose a statistical approach to deal with it based on Naive Bayes. We define features in the classification model. Next, we use document structure to improve the detection performance. Experimental results indicate that the proposed methods can significantly outperform the baseline methods for unformatted table extraction.			ljz@keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn; j-tang02@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; sq02@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; xp@keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn					CHEN HH, 2002, P 18 INT C COMP LING; COHEN W, 2002, P WWW2002 HON HAW; Klein B., 2001, Proceedings of Sixth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, DOI 10.1109/ICDAR.2001.953842; Ng H., 1999, P 37 ANN M ASS COMP, P443, DOI 10.3115/1034678.1034746; Pinto D., 2003, P 26 ANN INT ACM SIG; PYREDDY P, 1997, P 2 INT C DIG LIBR; Wang HM, 2004, CHINESE EDUC SOC, V37, P7; TANG J, 2005, J DATA SEMANTICS; TENGLI A, P 20 INT C COMP LING; ZHANG K, 2005, J TSINGHUA SCI TECHN, V45	10	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743		3-540-31142-4	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2006	3841						818	823				6	Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BDV60	WOS:000235658000079

The intuition is that naive Bayesian classifiers work better than decision trees when the sample data set is small. Therefore, after several attribute splits when constructing a decision tree, it is better to use naive Bayesian classifiers at the leaves than to continue splitting the attributes. In this paper, we propose a learning algorithm to improve the conditional probability estimation in the diagram of Naive Bayes Tree. The motivation for this work is that, for cost-sensitive learning where costs are associated with conditional probabilities, the score function is optimized when the estimates of conditional probabilities are accurate. The additional benefit is that both the classification accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC) could be improved. On a large suite of benchmark sample sets, our experiments show that the CLL tree outperforms the state-of-art learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes Tree and naive Bayes significantly in yielding accurate conditional probability estimation and improving classification accuracy and AUC.

In this technique, loss of information versus preservation of privacy is always a trade off. The question is, how much are the users willing to compromise their privacy? This is a choice that changes from individual to individual. In this paper, we propose an individually adaptable perturbation model, which enables the individuals to choose their own privacy level. Hence our model provides different privacy guarantees for different privacy preferences. We test our new perturbation model by applying different reconstruction methods to the perturbed data sets. Furthermore, we build decision tree and Naive Bayes classifier models on the reconstructed data sets both for synthetic and real world data sets. For the synthetic data set, our experimental results indicate that our model enables the users to choose their own privacy level without reducing the accuracy of the data mining results. For the real world data sets, we got very interesting results, hence we pose the question of whether the perturbation reconstruction model-based privacy preserving data mining is applicable for real-world data?

Fuzzy Partition Clustering Method (FPCM) was presented and used to obtain a few labeled texts and some external clusters automatically by measuring the similarity degree of clustering correlation texts. So classification bases were found for supervised learning. Naive Bayes augment learning manner was further combined to design and learn classifiers, and the way of estimating the loss of classing error was used to balance the selection of those example candidates. The combination of those two methods has advanced the precision of text classification and makes classification learning of non-labeled training example with more potential applications.

E-mail packets are inferred in transit and tagged with an intra-packet spam score to indicate whether the packet forms a legitimate or spam e-mail. During e-mail packet reassembly, tags for an e-mail are aggregated to give an inter-packet spam score. The naive Bayes inference technique is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach compared to the full e-mail classification approach. Our simulation results show that the proposed approach exhibits a comparable spam precision (and confidence) to the full e-mail classification approach. Spam recall increases from 63% to 85% depending to the maximum transmission unit size, approaching the 87% of the full e-mail classification. For 67% spam-to-legitimate ratio, we obtain reduction of end servers's workload by 42% to 57% (across all maximum transmission unit sizes tested) of the total e-mail traffic. Thus, the proposed approach can complement existing anti-spam systems by pre-processing e-mail packets on upstream nodes. Layer-3 e-mail processing requires reduced processing complexity as compared to layer-7 processing and is viable for high throughput hardware-based implementations.

In particular, we classify a sentence for an event into four time-slots; morning, daytime, evening, and night. To realize our goal, we focus on expressions associated with time-slot (time-associated words). However, listing up all the time-associated words is impractical, because there are numerous time-associated expressions. We therefore use a semi-supervised learning method, the Naive Bayes classifier backed up with the Expectation Maximization algorithm, in order to iteratively extract time-associated words while improving the classifier. We also propose to use Support Vector Machines to filter out noisy instances that indicates no specific time period. As a result of experiments, the proposed method achieved 0.864 of accuracy and outperformed other methods.

We apply this procedure in the residential areas detection. A simple case of Bayesian network called naive Bayes classifier is used to learn the positive and negative samples and to infer about the unknown regions. In this paper each texture feature vector is labeled using Fuzzy C-mean clustering, and the learning in general Bayesian networks provide the beliefs about the dependency of the regions for residential areas and non-residential areas with the of texture feature. In the learning process, the proposed methodology also handles unknown cases that are not correctly classified using existing samples and will be taken as samples in next learning process. Experimental results of residential areas detection on panchromatic remote sensing images are presented to illustrate the merit and feasibility of the proposed method.

Then, this framework is for discovering causality existing between causative antecedent and effective consequent discourse units. There are three main problems in the causality or cause-effect extraction; cause-effect identification, causality ordering and cause-effect boundary determination. The cause-effect identification and the causality ordering problems can be solved by teaming verb pairs among different elementary discourse units and teaming lexico syntactic pattern (i.e., NP(1) V NP(2)) within a single elementary discourse unit from annotated corpus, by using the Naive Bayes classifier. WordNet will be used in this teaming for providing the concept for the verb pairs and NP pair of the lexico syntactic pattern after translation of Thai words to English words by using the Thai-English dictionary. The cause-effect boundary determination problem can be solved by using centering theory and interesting cue phrase or causality link, where the interesting cue phrase would include the discourse markers and verb phrases. Our model of causality extraction shows the precision and recall of 86% and 70% respectively, where our evaluation is based on the expert's results.

In a DMS, security mechanisms like encryption of documents and enforcement of policies are implemented to protect from information leakage. These security schemes, essentially applications of Digital Rights Management technologies, while effective against external attacks, are ineffective against insider attacks. The typical insider in a DMS already has access to documents and hence, his capabilities for information leakage are much higher. In this work, we address an important, yet unexplored problem of masquerading users in a DMS, a threat for which the DMS inherently has no protection. We approach the problem by monitoring the pattern and mannerism of user actions on documents and building a profile of each user using the resulting logs. In order to illustrate our ideas, we built user profiles of 41 users working on Microsoft Word and applied two algorithms, viz., IPAM and Naive Bayes to distinguish between them. When supplied with appropriately interpreted command sequences of a DMS, IPAM was able to distinguish between users effectively, while Naive Bayes failed to produce any meaningful results. We recorded an average detection rate of 58% with a false positive of 14%.

This paper adopts general naive Bayes to handle continuous variables, and proposes a kind of kernel function constructed by orthogonal polynomials, which is used to estimate the density function of prior distribution in Bayes network. The paper then makes further researches into optimality of the kernel estimation of density and derivatives. When the sample is fixed, the estimators can keep continuity and smoothness, and when the sample size tends to infinity, the estimators can keep good convergence rates.

AutoClass is a classical Bayesian clustering algorithm that uses Naive-Bayes in combination with EM algorithm to find the probability distribution parameters to best fit the data. In this study, we introduce a robust approach, which is similar to AutoClass, it can arbitrarily impose any Bayesian classifiers in combination with EM algorithm to enhance cluster's performance. This paper focuses on how clustering techniques can benefit from classification. We provide experimental evidence that more accurate than original results of clustering in the t-test on most of the benchmark data sets.

The estimation algorithm derived is able to infer the saliency of words with respect to the mixture modelling objective. We demonstrate experimental results showing that common stop-words as well as other corpus-specific common words are automatically down-weighted and this enhances our ability to capture the essential structure in the data, ignoring irrelevant details. As a classifier, our approach improves over the class prediction accuracy of the Naive Bayes classifier in all our experiments. Compared with a recent state of the art text classification method (Dirichlet Compound Multinomial model) we obtained improved results in two out of three benchmark text collections tested, and comparable results on one other data set.

In this paper we develop a multi-stage linear classifier fusion system based on Efron's bootstrap sampling for predicting subcellular locations of yeast proteins. Three different types of classifiers, i.e. the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier, Radial Basis Function (RBF) network, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), are utilized to construct the component modules in the fusion system. Ten bootstrapped instance sets are generated for training each type of component classifiers respectively. The linear fusion models, updated by the Least-Mean-Square (LMS) algorithm, are used to integrate the local decisions of the component classifiers and derive the final predictions. The empirical results show that the RBF classifiers can reach at slightly higher accuracy and better precision versus the NB or MLP ones. The linear fusion system consistently improves the overall prediction accuracy, in particular 6.65%, 1.77%, and 3.21%, superior to the NB, REF, and MLP component classifiers, respectively.

In this paper, a two-layered spam detection flow was used, which showed the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Then we discussed Naive Bayes classifiers ensemble based on Bagging. By casting spam detection in a decision theoretic framework, a Naive Bayes Bagging spam detection model based on embedded decision tree is proposed Then this model was reduced by strict likelihood score bound limitation of the Naive Bayes classifiers. Finally, an improved method based on classifier error weighted is presented The experiment results show that the modification is effective.

Our approach is a combination of dictionary based approach and machine learning based approach. Based on a gene name dictionary, an edit distance approximate string searching algorithm was used to improve the recall rate of gene recognition which is greatly lowered due to a lack of standard gene-naming conventions. Then the naive Bayes and SVM classifiers were adopted to filter out false recognitions, therefore improving the precision rate of gene recognition. The experiments show that classifiers greatly improve precision with slight loss of recall, resulting in a much better F-score (from 53.7% to 67.6%).

For each classifier, performances of feature sets obtained by feature selection and dimensionality reduction methods are also evaluated. Finally, classification accuracy is improved by combining different classifiers. A 10 genre data set of 1000 pieces is used in the experiments. Using a set of different classifiers, a test genre classification accuracy of around 79.6 +/- 4.2 is obtained. This performance is better than 71.1 +/- 7.3% which is the best that has been reported on this data set. Also, by combining different classifiers 80% classification accuracy is obtained.

The role is dynamically assigned to the service requester according to the context. If the service requester requests a service that is not permitted for his role, Naive Bayes classifier is used to make decision based on the service provider's own prior knowledge as well as the recommendations for the service requester. Our trust model can dynamically make decisions due to the changing context and each service provider's own judging standard. It is also scalable since the role-based architecture used in our trust model is potential for reducing the complexity in large network. In addition, our trust model is suitable to make decision with limited information, which is usually the case in a real scenario.

GPA improves on other decision list algorithms by introducing a new objective function for rule selection and a set of novel search algorithms that allow application to large scale real world problems. GPA achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy on the protein secondary structure prediction problem in bioinformatics and the English part of speech tagging problem in computational linguistics. For both domains GPA produces a rule set that human experts find easy to interpret, a marked advantage in decision support environments. In addition, we compare GPA to other decision list induction algorithms as well as support vector machines, C4.5, naive Bayes, and a nearest neighbor method on a number of standard data sets from the UCI machine learning repository.

The arguments for specific examples are a special form of experts knowledge which the expert uses to substantiate the class value for the chosen example. Mozina et al. developed the ABCN2 algorithm - an extension of the well known rule learning in algorithm CN2 - that can use argumented examples in the learning process. In this work we present an application of ABCN2 in the medical domain which deals with severe bacterial infections in geriatric population. The elderly population, people over 65 years of age is rapidly growing as well as the costs of treating this population. In our study, we compare ABCN2 to CN2 and show that using arguments we improve the characteristics of the model. We also report the results that C4.5, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression achieve in this domain.

To improve the performance of Bayesian classifier, we present a novel algorithm called Evolutional. One-dependence Augmented Naive Bayes(EANB), which selects the attributes' parents by carrying an evolutional search through the whole space of attributes. Experimentally testing on the whole 36 UCI datasets recommended by Weka [1], we compare our algorithm to NB, SBC [2], TAN [3] and C4.5[4]. The result shows that our algorithm outperforms NB, SBC and TAN significantly, and outperforms C4.5 slightly in term of classification accuracy.

To maintain the simple structure and low computational cost, many researches focus on the one-dependence estimator. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm called one-dependence estimator based on multi-parents (MPODE). In MPODE, each attribute has multi-parents; we use the mean dependence probability between the attribute and its parents as one dependence estimator. Experimentally testing on the whole 36 UCI datasets recommended by Weka [1], we compare our algorithm with NB, C4.5 [2], SBC [3], TAN [4] and AODE [5]. The result shows that our algorithm outperforms NB, C4.5, SBC, and TAN significantly, and is almost same to AODE in term of classification accuracy.

On the basis of the initial classification results obtained from the content-based Naive Bayes method, this approach uses neural networks to model the citation link structures of the scientific papers for refining the class labels of the documents. The approach is examined and compared with the Naive Bayes method on a standard paper classification data set with increasing training set sizes. The results suggest that using citation link structures, neural networks can significantly improve the system performance over the content-based naive Bayes method for all the training set sizes.

This paper presents a new type fault decision model based on rough set theory. The traditional dissolved gas-in-oil analysis (DGA) for power transformers' condition evaluation and rough set theory based fault diagnosis are combined in the diagnostic model. The results of using the proposed model to analyze some known samples of testing data of faulty transformers shows that the model possesses strong solving ability to deal with uncertain facts. Moreover, by comparing with popular diagnosis methods like Naive Bayes classification, there is less fault data discriminated by the rough set model and the accuracy for power transformer fault diagnosis is improved using our proposed model.

In this paper, we propose and investigate three algorithm selectors, one with a LDA Classifier and the other two with Bayes Classifiers using either a Naive Bayes Probabilistic Model or a Bayes Probabilistic Model, to select the best mobile location estimation algorithms from our previous work in order to combine their merits, and provide a more accurate estimation for location services. We have tested these three algorithm selectors with real data taken in Hong Kong. Experiment results have shown that they are all useful in particular, and the one with a Bayes Probabilistic Model outperforms all other existing location algorithms among different kinds of terrains in terms of average errors.

Two common practices are to adopt either data cleansing to enhance data consistency or simply take noisy data as quality sources and feed them into the data mining algorithms. Either way may substantially sacrifice the mining performances. In this paper, we consider an error awareness data mining framework, which takes advantage of statistical error information (such as noise level and noise distribution) to improve data mining results. We assume such noise knowledge is-available in advance, and propose a solution to incorporate it into the mining process. More specifically, we use noise knowledge to restore original data distributions, and then use the restored information to modify the model built from noise corrupted data. We present an Error Awareness Naive Bayes (EA_NB) classification algorithm, and provide extensive experimental comparisons to demonstrate the effectiveness of this effort.

However, the parameter estimation for this model sometimes generates inappropriate probabilities. In this paper, we propose a topic document model for the multinomial naive Bayes text classification, where the parameters are estimated from normalized term frequencies of each training document. Experiments are conducted on Reuters 21578 and 20 Newsgroup collections, and our proposed approach obtained a significant improvement in performance compared to the traditional multinomial naive Bayes.

J	Clayton, MK; Petkau, AJ				Clayton, MK; Petkau, AJ			Evaluation of asymptotic approximations for a two-stage Bernoulli bandit	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE			English	Article						continuous time model; discounting; dynamic programming; free boundary problem; sequential decisions; Wiener process	SEQUENTIAL MEDICAL TRIALS	We consider a two-stage procedure for allocating two treatments to yield a total of N dicholomous responses, where one of the treatments has a known probability of success. In the first stage. observations may be made on either of the treatments and observed successes are discounted by a factor beta. One of the treatments must be chosen for the second stage, where observed successes are no longer discounted. We adopt a Bayesian approach and develop a continuous time approximation for this problem that turns out to be identical to one developed in Petkau Q. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 73 (1978) 328). Examination of both stopping boundaries and Bayes risks demonstrates that suboptimal strategies provided by the solution of the continuous time problem are excellent approximations to the optimal strategies for the discrete time problem. A "continuity correction" developed by Cheroff and Petkau (Ann. Probab. 4 (1976) 875) plays an important role in enhancing the naive approximation provided by the solution of the continuous time problem. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
