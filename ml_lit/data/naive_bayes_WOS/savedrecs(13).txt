There are also several variations available from local herbal markets, for example, the roots of B. falcatum, B. bicaule, and B. marginatum var. stenophyllum. In the current study, we collected 64 Chaihu samples, including 33 authenticated samples and 31 commercial samples. Test solutions of all the examples were analysed by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) to assess the principal bio-active components (saikosaponins). The HPTLC fluorescent images acquired were analyzed by sophisticated image processing techniques for comprehensive quantification. High dimensional features for both gray-scale and true color images were constructed for the raw images. Classical classification algorithms, including naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors, neural network and logistic, were used to construct prediction models. To gain an insight into the principal components while evaluating the Chaihu sample, feature selection and ensemble feature selection methods were further combined with the classifiers to enhance the discrimination power. Ensemble feature selection was shown to achieve superior performance. Experimental results demonstrated that the roots of Chaihu from different species of the genus Bupleurum could be readily distinguished so that commercial samples could be easily classified.

J	Sen, B; Peker, M				Sen, Baha; Peker, Musa			Novel approaches for automated epileptic diagnosis using FCBF selection and classification algorithms	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						EEG signals; classification algorithms; FCBF selection algorithm; epilepsy disease	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; EEG; MODEL; PREDICTION; TRANSFORM	This paper presents a new application for automated epileptic detection using the fast correlation-based feature (FCBF) selection and classification algorithms. This study consists of 3 stages: feature extraction, feature selection from electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and the classification of these signals. In the feature extraction phase, 16 attribute algorithms are used in 5 categories, and 36 feature parameters are obtained from these algorithms. In the feature selection phase, the FCBF algorithm is chosen to select a set of attributes that best represent the EEG signals. The resulting attributes are used as input parameters for the classification algorithms. In the classification phase, the problem is classified with 6 different classification algorithms. The results obtained with the different classification algorithms are provided in order to compare the calculation times and the accuracy rates. The evolution of the proposed system is conducted using k-fold cross-validation, classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values, and a confusion matrix. The proposed approach enables 100% classification accuracy with the use of the multilayer perceptron neural network and naive Bayes algorithm. The stated results show that the proposed method is capable of designing a new intelligent assistance diagnostic system.

The architecture is service-oriented, allowing application architects to combine services provided by the system platform in order to satisfy application needs. A typical user application may require a set of those services. Because of the sensor nodes' resource limitation, some services may not keep Quality of Service (QoS) levels stable over a long period, which could lead to Service Layer Agreement (SLA) violations. To maintain SLA, QoS levels must be estimated so that services can be properly invoked and combined to satisfy the user's QoS requirements. This paper proposes a novel approach to estimate QoS levels of web services. On the basis of monitored values of QoS parameters, a Naive Bayes estimation model is developed to select the best-suited services. This paper also presents approaches adopted to monitor QoS levels of web services in the IDEA environment.

The classification in this method doesn't need a learning corpus; it uses the input text to do that. First, we cluster the document sentences to exploit the diversity of topics, then we use a learning algorithm (here we used Naive Bayes) on each cluster considering it as a class. After obtaining the classification model, we calculate the score of a sentence in each class, using a scoring model derived from classification algorithm. These scores are used, then, to reorder the sentences and extract the first ones as the output summary. We conducted some experiments using a corpus of scientific papers, and we have compared our results to another summarization system called UNIS.(1) Also, we experiment the impact of clustering threshold tuning, on the resulted summary, as well as the impact of adding more features to the classifier. We found that this method is interesting, and gives good performance, and the addition of new features (which is simple using this method) can improve summary's accuracy.

In the context of medical decision making, these models have been explored to help in medical diagnosis and prognosis. In this paper, we discuss the Bayesian network formalism in building medical support systems and we learn a tree augmented naive Bayes Network (TAN) from gastrointestinal bleeding data. The accuracy of the TAN in classifying the source of gastrointestinal bleeding into upper or lower source is obtained. The TAN achieves a high classification accuracy of 86% and an area under curve of 92%. A sensitivity analysis of the model shows relatively high levels of entropy reduction for color of the stool, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, consistency and the ratio of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine. The TAN facilitates the identification of the source of GIB and requires further validation.

In this paper, we proposed a "WDMAC" model for worm's detection using data mining techniques by combination of classifiers (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Network) in multi classifiers to be adaptive for detecting known/unknown worms depending on behavior-anomaly detection approach, to achieve higher accuracies and detection rate, and lower classification error rate. Our results show that the proposed model has achieved higher accuracies and detection rates of classification, where detection known worms are at least 98.30%, with classification error rate 1.70%, while the unknown worm detection rate is about 97.99%, with classification error rate 2.01%.

To survive in the competitive industries these tourism organisations must have innovative strategies to carry on their business. One of the tools is tourism market segmentation which is used for strategic planning. This study presents inbound tourist market segmentation with combined algorithms using K-Means and Decision Tree. The study was divided into two phases. In the clustering phase, the segmentation was performed by Self Organisation Map (SOM) and K-Means. SOM used for determining the appropriate number of cluster. Then, K-Means used for refined the tourist clusters. The results of clustering phase were analyzed. In the classification phase, three classifiers were compared the performances of predictability by using the output provided by K-Means, i.e. Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The experimental results indicated that SOM provided 6 clusters and K-Means gave better performance than SOM guided by Silhouette, Root Means Square Standard Deviation (RMSSTD) and R Square (RS). The predictive ability of J48 Decision Tree outperformed both of MLP and Naive Bayes based on the tourist variables. J48 Decision Tree indicated the accuracy as 99.57%. The results of this study can be used for tourism management products and services.

The main advantage of this method is to reduce the number of sampling frequency of standard ring projection method. The proposed method is compared with the ring projection and local binary patterns according to the computational speed of the feature extraction and classification accuracy. By incrementally rotating first image of each texture class by 30 and 45 degrees enrich the dataset and yield two texture datasets having totally 1332 and 888 samples from the original Brodatz texture image dataset, respectively. Throughout the study Weka machine learning and data mining tool is utilized. As a classifier Naive Bayes, Bagging and J48 decision tree are used due to their simplicity and speed. Classification performance is evaluated via 10 fold cross validation technique. It is observed that, the proposed method outperforms other alternatives in terms of classification accuracy and feature extraction speed.

With this test, several parameters are measured such as forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) of patients. These parameters indicate different types of lung disorders. Main constraint in diagnosis is to selection of important parameters among test results. In this study, five results of pulmonary function test (PFT) are evaluated with machine learning methods and feature selections with test results are achieved. Feature selections are performed with using Naive bayes, support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and k-nearest neighbor classifier (k-NN) methods. The test results of 436 patients are obtained from Ataturk Chest Diseases and Thoracic Surgery Training and Research Hospital in Ankara/Turkey. SVM method has a highest performance values with 89,6% accuracy, 87,4 % specificity, 71,6% sensitivity respectively. Thus, it is found with feature selection that importance order of test results are FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, PEF ve FEF25/75 respectively. In this study, obtained performance values are higher than most of studies in the literature.

Some people create fake accounts with unreal information and try to cheat people in material and/or spiritual manner. Some of them pretend lower age to target child abuse or target to cheat people by pretending themselves with an opposite sex of what they really are, or showing themselves with higher education level. So identifying the real identity of people in social media can be very useful to preventing formations of e-crimes. In this study, a system developed for identifying gender, age, and education level by analyzing comments on Facebook pages. Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) used as classifier and the results of them compared. The Naive Bayes classifier with an accuracy of 90.85% for Gender, 89.67% for age and 86.15% for Education level gave the best results.

The feature vector being used to represent texts, consists of stem words as features and their weight values, which are obtained by applying 14 different term weighting schemes. The performances of these feature vectors for 3 different datasets in the author detection are tested with some classification methods such as Naive Bayes Multinominal (NBM), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (C4.5), and Random Forrest (RF), and are compared with each other. As a result of that, the most successful classifier, which can predict the author of an article, is found as SVM classifier with 98.75% mean accuracy; the most successful term weighting scheme is found as ACTF.IDF.(ICF+1) with 91.54% general mean accuracy.

In this study, we address the decision-making problem in diagnosing Down syndrome from the machine learning perspective aiming to decrease invasive tests. We employ Naive Bayes and Bayesian Networks classification algorithms as probabilistic methods. This probabilistic classification approach is one of the leading work in medical domain. We use George Washington University dataset in our study. We also benchmark our probabilistic classifiers with widely used non-probabilistic classifiers in machine learning literature. Finally the results of the experiments show that probabilistic classifiers enable acceptable prediction of Trisomy 21 case and the classification performance can be improved by using the proposed techniques in this study.

While the majority of existing researches compute recommendation by considering only users and items, Context Aware Recommendation Systems (CARS) consider, in addition to users and items, others features related to the context. A first issue in CARS studies is to identify the contextual features. In this paper, we investigate the use of Text Classification techniques to extract contextual features from users' reviews. We conduct experiments to identify the best classification algorithm for our dataset. We evaluate our approach on hotel reviews. We focus on extracting the trip type, as contextual information, from these reviews. Results show that the Multinomial Naive Bayes performs best in our dataset, with a F1 score of 60.1%. Since contextual information are not always provided in the reviews, we think that our results are promising. We conclude that this research area needs deeper studies.

With the aim of selecting small sets of genes, that have strong predictive correlations with a disease, the Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are being increasingly used. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach, using methods of feature selection and a classifier based on GA as a tool to identifying a subset of relevant genes and developing high- level classification rules for the cancer dataset NCI60, revealing concise and relevant information about the application domain. As a result it was obtained a set of IF- THEN rules with few genes per class and high predictive power that can be used as a classifier and assist experts to understand the biologic relationship between the genes and the classes of cancer. Moreover, the accuracy of the proposed approach overcame the results obtained by traditional classification methods such as PART, J48, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and IBK, demonstrating that the rules balance interpretability, comprehensibility and prediction precision.

This makes classification of these data sets extremely challenging. In this paper we propose the use of genetic programming (GP) for subset feature selection in LC-MS data which works by maximizing the signal to noise ratio of the selected features by GP. The proposed method was applied to eight LC-MS data sets with different sample sizes and different levels of concentration of the spiked biomarkers. We evaluated the accuracy of selection from the list of biomarkers and also using the classification accuracy of the selected features via the support vector machines (SVMs) and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers. Features selected by the proposed GP method managed to achieve perfect classification accuracy for most of the data sets. The results show that the proposed method strikes a reasonable compromise between the detection rate of the biomarkers and the classification accuracy for all data sets. The method was also compared to linear Support Vector Machine-Recursive Features Elimination (SVM-RFE) and t-test for feature selection and the results show that the biomarker detection rate of the proposed approach is higher.

Investigating the Impact of Various Classification Quality Measures in the Predictive Accuracy of ABC-Miner	2013 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION (CEC)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	JUN 20-23, 2013	Cancun, MEXICO	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc			ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION; LEARNING BAYESIAN NETWORKS; ALGORITHM; CLASSIFIERS	Learning classifiers from datasets is a central problem in data mining and machine learning research. ABC-Miner is an Ant-based Bayesian Classification algorithm that employs the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) meta-heuristics to learn the structure of Bayesian Augmented Naive-Bayes (BAN) Classifiers. One of the most important aspects of the ACO algorithm is the choice of the quality measure used to evaluate a candidate solution to update pheromone. In this paper, we explore the use of various classification quality measures for evaluating the BAN classifiers constructed by the ants. The aim of this investigation is to discover how the use of different evaluation measures affects the quality of the output classifier in terms of predictive accuracy. In our experiments, we use 6 different classification measures on 25 benchmark datasets. We found that the hypothesis that different measures produce different results is acceptable according to the Friedman's statistical test.

In this work, we propose a new filter dimension reduction algorithm (PSOPRSE) using binary particle swarm optimisation and probabilistic rough set theory. PSOPRSE aims to maximise a classification performance measure and minimise a newly developed measure reflecting the number of attributes. Both measures are formed by probabilistic rough set theory. PSOPRSE is compared with two existing PSO based algorithms and two traditional filter dimension reduction algorithms on six discrete datasets of varying difficulty. Five continues datasets including a large number of attributes are discretised and used to further examine the performance of PSOPRSE. Three learning algorithms, namely decision trees, nearest neighbour algorithms and naive Bayes, are used in the experiments to examine the generality of PSOPRSE. The results show that PSOPRSE can significantly decrease the number of attributes and maintain or improve the classification performance over using all attributes. In most cases, PSOPRSE outperforms the first PSO based algorithm and achieves better or much better classification performance than the second PSO based algorithm and the two traditional methods, although the number of attributes is slightly large in some cases. The results also show that PSOPRSE is general to the three different classification algorithms.

The method relies on a memory list which contains some correctly labelled instances and is formed by classifiers evolved by GP. The class label of a new instance will be determined by combining its most similar instances in the memory list and the output of GP classifier on this instance. The results show that this proposed method can outperform conventional GP-based classification approach. Compared with conventional classification methods such as Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees, and conventional kNN, this method can also achieve better or comparable accuracies on a set of binary problems. The evaluation cost of this hybrid method is much lower than that of conventional kNN.

Twitter has become one of social media with expanded users within every sectors of society. There are so many part both individual as well as organization/enterprise which utilize twitter as tool for communication, business, customer relation, and other activities. Through the twitter's ever-expanding users with those particular purposes, the precise method to effectively and efficiently analyzing opinion-contained sentences become crucially needed. Therefore this research made for method analyzing through lexical based and model based approaches by machine learning to classify opinion-contained tweets using those 2 methods. The tested machine learning method are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Maximum Entropy (ME), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN). Based on the test outcome, lexical based approach highly depended on lexical database which became opinion classification matrix. Whilst machine learning approach can produce better accuracy due to its capability in new training data modeling based on outcome model. However, machine learning model based approach depends on various factors in analyzing sentiment.

Smart phone camera is used as image acquisition device. Smartphone is working as a client and high speed computer act as a server. Our system is a feature based novel approach that requires huge computing power and stand-alone smart phone is not capable for performing the whole task. So we have used the smart phone as image acquisition and rendering device, it is also worked as a client and high speed computer server is used as a major computing unit like a cloud. We have adapted the bag of words approach for training features of multiclass objects with the usage of visual codebooks which are having significant applications in the natural language processing. Our work is mainly focused on classification and recognition of multiclass natural objects which can be utilized either for augmented reality and also video surveillance applications. We use Scale Invariant Feature Transforms (SIFT) for feature extraction. We form visual codebook from the high dimensional feature vectors using clustering algorithm and classify and recognize using naive Bayes classifier.

Prediction of different types of liver diseases using rule based classification model	TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE			English	Article						Classification; machine learning; rule based classification (RBCM); liver diseases	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; HEART-DISEASE; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEM; FAILURE	BACKGROUND: Diagnosing different types of liver diseases clinically is a quite hectic process because patients have to undergo large numbers of independent laboratory tests. On the basis of results and analysis of laboratory test, different liver diseases are classified. Hence to simplify this complex process, we have developed a Rule Base Classification Model (RBCM) to predict different types of liver diseases. The proposed model is the combination of rules and different data mining techniques. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to propose a rule based classification model with machine learning techniques for the prediction of different types of Liver diseases. METHOD: A dataset was developed with twelve attributes that include the records of 583 patients in which 441 patients were male and rests were female. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Rule Induction (RI), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) data mining techniques with K-cross fold technique are used with the proposed model for the prediction of liver diseases. The performance of these data mining techniques are evaluated with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and kappa parameters as well as statistical techniques (ANOVA and Chi square test) are used to analyze the liver disease dataset and independence of attributes. RESULT: Out of 583 patients, 416 patients are liver diseases affected and rests of 167 patients are healthy. The proposed model with decision tree (DT) technique provides the better result among all techniques (RI, SVM, ANN and NB) with all parameters (Accuracy 98.46%, Sensitivity 95.7%, Specificity 95.28% and Kappa 0.983) while the SVM exhibits poor performance (Accuracy 82.33%, Sensitivity 68.03%, Specificity 91.28% and Kappa 0.801). It is also found that the best performance of the model without rules (RI, Accuracy 82.68%, Sensitivity 86.34%, Specificity 90.51% and Kappa 0.619) is almost similar to the worst performance of the rule based classification model (SVM, Accuracy 82.33%, Sensitivity 68.03%, Specificity 91.28% and Kappa 0.801 and the accuracy of chi square test is 76.67%. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that there is a significant difference between the proposed rules based classification model and the model without rules for the liver diseases prediction and the rule based classification model with decision tree (DT) technique provides most accurate result. This model can be used as a valuable tool for medical decision making.

The objective is to implement the system for fast recognition using low-complexity algorithms in a low-budget processor. Recognition is achieved using tailored band energy ratios, modified frequency centroid and a periodicity test based on spectrum autocorrelation. These lightweight feature extraction techniques are adapted to the particular task of recognition of blowing sound types. The classification is achieved by a naive Bayes classifier. The algorithm can be implemented in real-time (latency <= 100 ms) and experimental test results show average recognition rates over 94%.

The lesion detection problem is formulated as finding a region with maximal score. The developed method employs an over-segmentation algorithm to generate the superpixels (small regions) and adapts the Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor (NBNN) classifier to score the superpixels. Then, the connected superpixels with positive scores are aggregated as the detected regions. The performance of the method is evaluated on a data set consisting of 442 CT slices of 129 patients acquired in portal venous phase of contrast enhancement. The pixel-wise accuracy for classification and recall for detection can achieve 93% and 62%, respectively. The method can work well for hyperdense, hypodense, and heterogeneous liver lesions.

Therefore, a fast and efficient method to process these data is required. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-naive Bayes classification method based on stochastic discrimination theory and implement it in hardware. The hardware implemented on a FPGA with massively parallel computation enables fast and efficient processing, because the algorithm of the proposed method is very suitable for parallel computation. The implemented hardware takes 0.378 mu s at 106MHz clock to process given one test data. In addition, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method through experiments on various datasets. In the experimental results, our proposed method shows competitive performance compared with conventional machine learning methods.

Further improvements in feature selection will positively affect a wide array of applications in fields such as pattern recognition, machine learning, or signal processing. Bio-inspired method called Bat Algorithm hybridized with a Naive Bayes classifier has been presented in this work. The performance of the proposed feature selection algorithm was investigated using twelve benchmark datasets from different domains and was compared to three other well-known feature selection algorithms. Discussion focused on four perspectives: number of features, classification accuracy, stability, and feature generalization. The results showed that BANB significantly outperformed other algorithms in selecting lower number of features, hence removing irrelevant, redundant, or noisy features while maintaining the classification accuracy. BANB is also proven to be more stable than other methods and is capable of producing more general feature subsets.

Our contributions are threefold. First, considering that skeleton positions in different actions at different time are similar, we adopt the Naive-Bayes-Nearest-Neighbor (NBNN) method for classification. Second, to avoid different but similar actions which would decrease recognition rate obviously, we present a hierarchical model and increase the recognition rate significantly. Third, for a real-time application, we apply the sliding window to buffer the input and the threshold presented by the ratio of the second nearest distance and the nearest distance to smooth the output. Our method also rejects undefined actions. Experimental results on the Microsoft Research Action3D dataset demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art methods both in recognition rate and computing speed. Our algorithm increases the recognition rate by about 10% at the speed of 30fps averagely (with resolution 640x480).

They are employed for purposes beyond merely making phone calls. Among the mobile operating systems, Android is the most popular due to its availability as an open source operating system. Due to the proliferation of Android malwares, it is crucial to study the best classifiers that can detect these malwares effectively and accurately through selecting the most suitable network traffic features as well as comprehensive comparison with related works. This study evaluates five machine learning classifiers, namely Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbour, decision tree, multi-layer perceptron, and support vector machine. The evaluation was validated using malware data samples from the Android Malware Genome Project. The data sample is a collection of malwares gathered between August 2010 and October 2011 by the University of North Carolina. Among various network traffic characteristics, three network features were selected: connection duration, TCP size and number of GET/POST parameters. From the experiment, it is found that k-nearest neighbour provides the optimum results in terms of performance among the classifiers. The experimental results also indicate a true positive rate as high as 99.94% and false positive of 0.06% for the k-nearest neighbour classifier.

The most common method of screening is the Pap test or cytology. When abnormalities are reported in the result, the patient is referred to a dysplasia clinic for colposcopy. During this test, a solution of acetic acid is applied, which produces a color change in the tissue and is known as acetowhitening phenomenon. This reaction aims to obtaining a sample of tissue and its histological analysis let to establish a final diagnosis. During the colposcopy test, digital images can be acquired to analyze the behavior of the acetowhitening reaction from a temporal approach. In this way, we try to identify precursor lesions of cervical cancer through a process of automatic classification of acetowhite temporal patterns. In this paper, we present the performance analysis of three classification methods: kNN, Naive Bayes and C4.5. The results showed that there is similarity between some acetowhite temporal patterns of normal and abnormal tissues. Therefore we conclude that it is not sufficient to only consider the temporal dynamic of the acetowhitening reaction to establish a diagnosis by an automatic method. Information from cytologic, colposcopic and histopathologic disciplines should be integrated as well.

The main objective of this research is develop an effective bridge SHM system to meet the urgent necessity of monitoring the large amount of old and aging bridges in the world. To solve the unique and complicated problem, the dynamic scouring effect is carefully considered in the bio-inspired bridge SHIM system. The array expression data format is proposed for the development of the SHIM algorithm to transplant the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) array concept from molecular biology to the field of SHIM. A two-tier auto-regression with exogenous (AR-ARX) process is used to extract the expression array from the recorded ambient vibration response. The scouring depth of the bridge is then determined by the proposed SHM algorithm based on Naive Bayes (NB). To verify the performance and reliability of the SHIM algorithm, a series of experiment on a scaled down single-column bridge model with dynamic scour impact under flooding was conducted with various settings of initial scour depth to clarify the complicated fluid-solid-coupling effect. Test results from the dynamic flooding test showed that the scouring depth of the bridge can be reliably identified by the proposed SHM system. The performance of the bio-inspired bridge SHIM system has been successfully demonstrated.

To improve the efficiency of the present image definition identification methods with a high accuracy, an algorithm based on the compound model of Lifting Wavelet Transform and Naive Bayes classifier is proposed. Firstly, the two-dimensional Lifting Wavelet Transform is used to extract the image feature, and 28 statistical values obtained from 7 wavelet components by statistical process are treated as image eigenvalues for the follow-up identification. Then Naive Bayes classifier is used to achieve the identification, which has a high computational efficiency and competitive accuracy, and the classifier applied to the experiments of this paper is from OpenCV. The experiment consists of two phases. In phase one, the compound model is trained by 200 images from the training set. Similarly, in phase two, the model is tested by 100 images from the testing set. The results show that the algorithm based on the compound model is very effective, and obtains a high recognition rate.

The proposed method is developed in two distinct stages: calculation of descriptors and their classification. In the first stage we compute a vector of thirty-three statistical features: seven are related to statistics of the first level order, fifteen to that of second level where thirteen are calculated by means of co-occurrence matrices and two with absolute gradient; finally the last eleven are calculated using run-length matrices. In the second phase, using the descriptors already calculated, there is the actual image classification. Naive Bayes, RBF, Support Vector-Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest and Random Tree classifiers are used. The results obtained applying the proposed system both on textured and on medical images show a very high accuracy.

Plant recognition can be performed by human experts manually but it is a time consuming and low-efficiency process. Automation of plant recognition is an important process for the fields working with plants. This paper presents an approach for plant recognition using leaf images. Shape and color features extracted from leaf images are used with k-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest classification algorithms to recognize plant types. The presented approach is tested on 1897 leaf images and 32 kinds of leaves. The results demonstrated that success rate of plant recognition can be improved up to 96% with Random Forest method when both shape and color features are used.

This implies that a highly accurate and fast sentiment classifier can be built using a simple Naive Bayes model that has linear training and testing time complexities. We achieved an accuracy of 88.80% on the popular IMDB movie reviews dataset. The proposed method can be generalized to a number of text categorization problems for improving speed and accuracy.

For categorical attributes, there is often no canonical flat data table, since they can often be considered in different levels of granularity (like continent, country or local region). The choice of the best level of granularity for a data mining task can be very tedious, especially when a larger number of attributes with different levels of granularities is involved. In this paper we propose two approaches to automatically select the granularity levels in the context of a naive Bayes classifier. The two approaches are based on the. 2 independence test including correction for multiple testing and the minimum description length principle.

However, the anonymized data may not be useful to applications that have specific requirements for the data they use. In this paper, we propose a method for data users to describe some characteristics of the anonymized data, as a special requirement of some classification applications, and a heuristic anonymization algorithm that incorporates the user-specified requirements into a generalization technique. Our preliminary results show that the specification format and the anonymization algorithm can significantly improve the utility of the anonymized data for a number of data mining applications that learn decision trees, Naive Bayes Classifier and Classification Rules.

Researchers have developed various models for spam detection in social media, but there has been little analysis on the effects of spam on Twitter's trending topics. We gathered over 9 million tweets in Twitter's hourly trending topics over a 7 day period and extracted tweet features identified by previous research as relevant to spam detection. Hand-labeling a random sample of 1500 tweets allowed us to train a moderately accurate naive Bayes classifier for tweet classification. Our findings suggest that spammers do not drive the trending topics in Twitter, but may opportunistically target certain topics for their messages.

In this research paper, we focus on the usage of text mining for sentiment classification. Illustration is performed on Tunisian users' statuses on "Facebook" posts during the "Arabic Spring" era. Our aim is to extract useful information, about users' sentiments and behaviors during this sensitive and significant period. For that purpose, we propose a method based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes. We also construct a sentiment lexicon, based on the emoticons, interjections and acronyms', from extracted statuses updates. Moreover, we perform some comparative experiments between two machine learning algorithms SVM and Naive Bayes through a training model for sentiment classification.

A Random-Forest-based Efficient Comparative Machine Learning Predictive DNA-Codon Metagenomics Binning Technique For WMD Events & Applications	2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TECHNOLOGIES FOR HOMELAND SECURITY (HST)			English	Proceedings Paper	13th IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)	NOV 12-14, 2013	Waltham, MA	IEEE, IEEE USA, IEEE Biometr Council, Massport, Govt Technol and Serv Coalit, Boston Prod Management Assoc, Massachusetts High Technol Council, Market Res Media, IEEE Women Engn, Domest Preparedness Com, DPJ Weekly Brief, DomPrep Journal, IEEE Boston Sect		Bioinformatics; Metagenomics; Binning; k-mers; codon; Next generation Sequencing; Pattern Classification; Machine learning; Random forest; bagged decision tree; Computational intelligence; Reduction methods; forwaord sequential feature selection	GENOMIC SIGNATURE; SEQUENCES; CLASSIFICATION; SEARCH	In many counter-terrorism, or natural disasters, geographically distributed large scale sensor-based bio-chemicals agent or microorganisms target identification and prediction applications, such as in WMD events, as well as in many health care and medical applications, efficient large scale metagenomics is crucial for purpose such as rapid and timely decontamination for normal environment restoration, or rapid and timely discovery of the right drug/therapy for the injured individuals. Metagenomics is the study of all bio-chemical and organisms collected directly from large natural environments including geographically distributed disastrous ones. Most of these collected bio-chemical and organisms cannot be cultivated in a laboratory and hence cannot be sequenced as individual organisms. Thus, metagenomics methods allow relatively rapid sequencing of organism genomes obtained directly from a natural environment, and which cannot be cultured in a laboratory. Sequencing random fragments obtained from whole genome shotgun into taxa-based groups is known as binning. Currently, there are two different methods of binning: sequence similarity methods and sequence composition methods. Sequence similarity methods are usually based on sequence alignment to known genome like BLAST, or MEGAN. Sequence composition methods are based on compositional features of a given DNA sequence like K-mers, or other genomic signature(s) like TETRA, Phylopythia, CompostBin, likelyBin. In this paper we propose a machine learning predictive DNA sequence feature selection algorithms to solve binning problems. In our prior work we showed feature selection/reduction and binning prediction based on direct nucleotide k-mers. Here we use a combination of 2 Codons (amino acids) as features to differentiate between sequences. There are 20 different amino acids which are found proteins. The combination of 2 amino acids produce 400 features which we use to differentiate between the metagenomics sequence. The data reads used in this work has an average length of 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 base pairs. Experimental results of the codon-based feature reduction and binning prediction algorithms, namely using respectively a Random forest classifier and a Bayes classifier, are presented along with their comparison to their DNA-based k-mers counterparts. The proposed algorithm accuracy is tested on a variety of data sets and our findings show that the classification/prediction accuracy achieved is between 59% - 92% for various data sets using Random forest classifier and 44% - 64% using Naive Bayes classifier. Random forest Classifier did better in classification in all the datasets compared to Naive Bayes.

Often during large-scale disasters, cell towers become overloaded, and the only way of communication is through text messages. It becomes important to gather information from text messages sent to emergency numbers in order to respond quickly and efficiently with life-saving efforts. In addition, responders are unable to manually handle the large volume of incoming texts. To add to this difficult problem, these data sources tend to be microtext. This research developed a methodology to summarize text messages sent during an emergency, including analysis of locations. The real-time disaster needs were then input into a mixed integer programming resource allocation model for distribution of resources for disaster aid. Prior research included resource allocation and text modeling, but the combination of the two is a novel application not only in this arena, but more broadly across domains.

This work focuses on the application and the comparison of three classification techniques over a text corpus composed of reviews of commercial products in order to detect opinions about them. The chosen domain is about "perfumes", and user opinions composing the corpus are written in Italian language. The proposed approach is completely data-driven: a Term Frequency / Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) terms selection procedure has been applied in order to make computation more efficient, to improve the classification results and to manage some issues related to the specific classification procedure adopted.

These are important for our daily life because we use their applications anywhere and anytime. With the variety of applications available on these devices, however, it becomes more difficult to choose an appropriate application. Therefore we need a mechanism that recommends us suitable applications, which should depend on a user's context because he/she uses his/her devices differently in every context. This paper shows that it follows a power law what applications a user executes in daily life, and proposes a novel approach to find context-aware applications in the mobile devices. This approach is based on the term frequency - inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), which is used for extracting important keywords in a document. Moreover, we propose an application recommendation mechanism using this approach. Experimental results show that this recommendation mechanism is more effective than the mechanism using Naive Bayes.

Real-Time Noise Identification in DSL Systems Using Computational Intelligence Algorithms	2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES FOR COMMUNICATIONS (ATC)	Proceedings International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)	OCT 16-18, 2013	Ho Chi Minh City, VIETNAM			DSL; data mining; noise identification; real time systems; monitoring; network measurement; backhaul	CROSSTALK CANCELER	Despite the advances and improvements in the Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technology, noise is still the main impairment. In special, far-end crosstalk, Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) and Impulsive Noise (IN) are of greatest concern and study. In DSL world, there are many noise mitigation techniques, but to know the impairment as a priori knowledge is a step necessary to apply the appropriate technique. In this paper we propose a new methodology for noise identification on real-time. Computational Intelligence (CI) algorithms are used in order to classify in real time the absence of noise or the predominance of IN, crosstalk or RFI. The algorithms are applied to a database composed by management information base (MIB) metrics. In order to ensure the database diversity, several DSL topologies using real cables were created and evaluated. In order to choose the best CI algorithm, a benchmarking was performed comparing the results achieved by naive Bayes, Bayesian belief networks and artificial neural networks based on backpropagation and on Radial Basis Function (RBF). The results demonstrate the potential use of CI for noise identification in DSL networks through MIB metrics and the most difficult noise to be identified is pointed. Tests indicate the RBF algorithm achieving the best result with 99.6% of accuracy.	[Farias, F. S.; Borges, G. S.; Rodrigues, Roberto M.; Santana, A. L.; Costa, J. C. W.

The network traffic generated by these network protocols and applications needs to be categorised which is an important task of network management. Among these, p2p has the largest share of the bandwidth. This great demand in the bandwidth has increased the importance of network traffic engineering. So, in order to meet the current demand and develop new architectures which help in improving the network performance, a broad understanding of the network traffic properties is required. The flow based methods classify p2p and non-p2p traffic using the characteristics of flows on the internet. In this paper, Naive Bayes estimator is used to categorize the traffic into p2p and non-p2p. Our results show that with the right set of features and good training data, high level of accuracy is achievable with the simplest of Naive Bayes estimator.

Current approaches use association rule mining techniques which are applied to only small item sets. Association rule mining techniques increase rule generation complexity as the size of data increases. This paper proposes the use of Naive Bayes text classifier prior to the prediction process to control the transaction length thereby reducing rule generation complexity. The lengthy transactions are reduced by classification to shorter transactions; the length of which have an upper bound determined by the number of classes that are in the training dataset. The prediction of missing classes uses a graph based approach. Graph based approaches offer an advantage of low memory requirements and require just one pass over the database. The proposed approach offers advantages of prediction at a higher level of abstraction and reduced rule generation complexity.

Moreover, choosing the discriminating algorithm for classification using these features is highly demanding. It is required to choose the right approach and the technique, or the best combinations of techniques from a large set of options available in the literature for the specific problem. The paper addresses this issue by comparing different approaches and techniques for multiclass classification using a particular feature derived from the real data sets. A number of performance metrices are used to compare the performance.	[Babu, Ferose T.

The primary problem of feature selection is the criterion which evaluates a feature set. In the context of classification problems, optimal criterion would be the Bayesian error rate for selected subset of features. The Bayesian error rate bounds to some values that are related to mutual information. This interval shrinks as the mutual information increases. In this paper, we investigated the relationship between dependency and the Naive Bayes error; dependency of the selected features is calculated as mutual information between the selected features and class. We designed some experiments to examine it about a two classes and two binary features problem. We found that in binary feature selection problem, the Naive Bayes error increases as dependency increases; however, we showed that there are some states that the Naive Bayes classifier is optimal while its default assumption is strongly violated (dependency is more than 0.8).

In this research paper, we focus on the usage of text mining for sentiment classification. Illustration is performed on Tunisian users' statuses on Facebook posts during the "Arabic Spring" era. Our aim is to extract useful information, about users' sentiments and behaviors during this sensitive and significant period. For that purpose, we propose a method based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes. We also construct a sentiment lexicon, based on the emoticons, interjections and acronyms', from extracted statuses updates. Moreover, we perform some comparative experiments between two machine learning algorithms SVM and Naive Bayes through a training model for sentiment classification.

Machine learning technologies are widely used in sentiment classification because of their ability to "learn" from the training dataset to predict or support decision making with relatively high accuracy. However, when the dataset is large, some algorithms might not scale up well. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the scalability of Naive Bayes classifier (NBC) in large datasets. Instead of using a standard library (e.g., Mahout), we implemented NBC to achieve fine-grain control of the analysis procedure. A Big Data analyzing system is also design for this study. The result is encouraging in that the accuracy of NBC is improved and approaches 82% when the dataset size increases. We have demonstrated that NBC is able to scale up to analyze the sentiment of millions movie reviews with increasing throughput.

These are important for our daily life because we use their applications anywhere and anytime. With the variety of applications available on these devices, however, it becomes more difficult to choose an appropriate application. Therefore we need a mechanism that recommends us suitable applications, which should depend on a user's context because he/she uses his/her devices differently in every context. This paper shows that it follows a power law what applications a user executes in daily life, and proposes a novel approach to find context-aware applications in the mobile devices. This approach is based on the term frequency - inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), which is used for extracting important keywords in a document. Moreover, we propose an application recommendation mechanism using this approach. Experimental results show that this recommendation mechanism is more effective than the mechanism using Naive Bayes.

Privacy-preserving knowledge discovery, if done correctly, can alleviate this problem. One of the most important and widely used data mining techniques is that of classification. We consider the model where a single provider has centralized access to a dataset and would like to release a classifier while protecting privacy to the best extent possible. Recently, the model of differential privacy has been developed which provides a strong privacy guarantee even if adversaries hold arbitrary prior knowledge. In this paper, we apply this rigorous privacy model to develop a Naive Bayes classifier, which is often used as a baseline and consistently provides reasonable classification performance. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach, and discuss how it could be potentially deployed in PaaS clouds.

Building an Initial Fitness Function Based On An Identified Melodic Feature Set for Classical and Non-Classical Melody Classification	2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS (ICISA 2013)	International Conference on Information Science and Applications		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Information Science and Applications (ICISA)	JUN 24-26, 2013	Pattaya, THAILAND	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Korea Ind Secur Forum, Inst Creat & Adv Technologies		Artificial Intelligence; computer music; melodic evaluation; music features; music genre classification		Algorithmic Composition for music is a progressive field of study. The success of an automated music-generating algorithm, however, depends heavily on the fitness function that is used to score the generated music. Artificial intelligence in this context of music scoring can use a fitness function that is generally based on music features that a given algorithm is programmed to measure. This study explores the features that are important for melody generation by investigating those that can separate classical from non-classical music in the context of melody. The jSymbolic tool was used to collect 160 standard features from 400 music files. Using C4.5 algorithm to select significant features used in a classical vs. non-classical melody classification challenge, and then performing a comparison with a suggested feature set by running Naive-Bayes and SVM classifiers, the study was able to determine a candidate set of melodic features that can be used for building an initial fitness function that separates classical from non-classical melodies with high accuracy as revealed by SVM ten-fold cross validation.

Twenty one features are extracted from measurement of the voltage and frequency at the point of common coupling (PCC) in order to identify islanding occurrence with high accuracy. An IEEE 34-bus system was used in this paper to generate islanding and non-islanding cases. Multiple locations for the DGs were used and also multiple DGs were also connected. Naive Bayes Classifier then was used to discriminate between islanding and non-islanding. In order to test the accuracy of the Naive Bayesian Classifier, Cross-Validation was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed islanding detection technique. Also, the algorithm was tested against Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results show the superiority of the Naive Bayes Classifier over the SVM.

This opens new opportunities to explore cyber robotics algorithms (robotics sensors and human motor plant). To make these devices more adaptive to the environmental conditions, user behavior, and user preferences, it is important to allow the sensor-equipped devices to efficiently adapt and respond to user activities (e. g., disable incoming phone calls in an elevator, activate video recording while car driving). This paper hence presents a situation awareness system (SAS) for head-mounted smartphones. After collecting data from inertial sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes), and video data (camera), SAS performs activity classification in three steps. Step 1 transforms inertial sensor data into a head orientation-independent and stable normalized coordinate system. Step 2 extracts critical features (statistical, physical, GIST). Step 3 classifies activities (Naive Bayes classifier), distinguishes between environments (Support Vector Machine), and finally combines both results (Hidden Markov Model) for further improvement. SAS has been implemented on a sensor-equipped eyeglasses prototype and achieved high accuracy (81.5%) when distinguishing between 20 real-world activities.

An example of such data in Software Engineering is the large, ever-growing volume of forum discussions on how to use particular APIs. We have conducted a study to explore the question as to how well machine learning algorithms can be applied to categorize API discussions based on their content. Our goal is two-fold: (1) Can a relatively straightforward algorithm such as Naive Bayes work sufficiently well for this task? (2) If yes, how can we control its performance? We have achieved the best test accuracy mean (TAM) of 94.1% with our largest training data set for the AWT/Swing API, which consists of 833 forum discussions distributed over eight categories/topics. We have also investigated factors that impact classification accuracy, with the most important two being the size of the training set and multi-label documents (the phenomenon that some discussions involve more than one category).

In this paper, we introduce a maximum entropy classification method with feature selection for large dimensional data such as text datasets that is generative in nature. To tackle the curse of dimensionality of large data sets, we employ conditional independence assumption (Naive Bayes) and we perform feature selection simultaneously, by enforcing a 'maximum discrimination' between estimated class conditional densities. For two class problems, in the proposed method, we use Jeffreys (J) divergence to discriminate the class conditional densities. To extend our method to the multi-class case, we propose a completely new approach by considering a multi-distribution divergence: we replace Jeffreys divergence by Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence to discriminate conditional densities of multiple classes. In order to reduce computational complexity, we employ a modified Jensen-Shannon divergence (JS(GM)), based on AM-GM inequality. We show that the resulting divergence is a natural generalization of Jeffreys divergence to a multiple distributions case. As far as the theoretical justifications are concerned we show that when one intends to select the best features in a generative maximum entropy approach, maximum discrimination using J-divergence emerges naturally in binary classification. Performance and comparative study of the proposed algorithms have been demonstrated on large dimensional text and gene expression datasets that show our methods scale up very well with large dimensional datasets.

Most of these methods use either header-based or content-based features. Spammers, however, can bypass these methods easily-especially the ones that deal with header features. In this paper, we report a novel spam classification method that uses features based on email content-language and readability combined with the previously used content-based task features. The features are extracted from four benchmark datasets viz. CSDMC2010, SpamAssassin, LingSpam, and Enron-Spam. We use five well-known algorithms to induce our spam classifiers: Random Forest (RF), BAGGING, ADABOOSTM1, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB). We evaluate the classifier performances and find that BAGGING performs the best. Moreover, its performance surpasses that of a number of state-of-the-art methods proposed in previous studies. Although applied only to English language emails, the results indicate that our method may be an excellent means to classify spam emails in other languages, as well.

Uncertainty sampling, arguably the most frequently utilized active learning strategy, selects instances which are uncertain according to the model. In this paper, we propose a framework that distinguishes between two types of uncertainties: a model is uncertain about an instance due to strong and conflicting evidence (most-surely uncertain) vs. a model is uncertain about an instance because it does not have conclusive evidence (least-surely uncertain). We show that making a distinction between these uncertainties makes a huge difference to the performance of active learning. We provide a mathematical formulation to distinguish between these uncertainties for naive Bayes, logistic regression and support vector machines and empirically evaluate our methods on several real-world datasets.

Furthermore, there is interest in understanding how concerned the population is about a disease outbreak. Twitter can serve as an important data source to provide this information in real time. In this paper, we focus on sentiment classification of Twitter messages to measure the Degree of Concern (DOC) of the Twitter users. In order to achieve this goal, we develop a novel two-step sentiment classification workflow to automatically identify personal tweets and negative tweets. Based on this workflow, we present an Epidemic Sentiment Monitoring System (ESMOS) that provides tools for visualizing Twitter users' concern towards different diseases. The visual concern map and chart in ESMOS can help public health officials to identify the progression and peaks of concern for a disease in space and time, so that appropriate preventive actions can be taken. The DOC measure is based on the sentiment-based classifications. We compare clue-based and different Machine Learning methods to classify sentiments of Twitter users regarding diseases, first into personal and neutral tweets and then into negative from neutral personal tweets. In our experiments, Multinomial Naive Bayes achieved overall the best results and took significantly less time to build the classifier than other methods.

An improved Naive Bayes nearest neighbor approach denoted as (ONBNN)-N-2 that was recently introduced for image classification, is adapted here to the radar target recognition problem. The original (ONBNN)-N-2 is further modified here by using a K-local hyperplane distance nearest neighbor (HKNN) instead of the plain nearest neighbor (1-NN) method. The proposed classifier outperforms minimum divergence (MD) based approaches with Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Performance of the proposed modified (ONBNN)-N-2 classifier was analyzed using collected radar measurements for variety of signal-to-noise (SNR) levels and sizes of training data.			aharon.barhillel@gm.com; igal.bilik@gm.com; ron.hecht@gm.com					Bar-Hillel A, 2011, 2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION (ICCV), P65, DOI 10.1109/ICCV.2011.6126226; Behmo R., 2010, P ECCV; Bilik I, 2005, RADAR CONF, P910; Bilik I, 2006, IEEE T AERO ELEC SYS, V42, P267, DOI 10.1109/TAES.2006.1603422; Bilik I., 2007, WILEY SERIES; Bilik I., 2004, P RADAR; Bilik I., 2012, IEEE T AEROSPACE ELE, V48; Bilik I, 2007, IEEE T AERO ELEC SYS, V43, P1510, DOI 10.1109/TAES.2007.4441755; Boiman O., 2008, P CVPR; Cai CJ, 2005, RADAR CONF, P895; Chen VC, 2005, RADAR CONF, P348; Chen VC, 2006, IEEE T AERO ELEC SYS, V42, P2, DOI 10.1109/TAES.2006.1603402; Chen VC, 2000, PROCEEDINGS OF THE TENTH IEEE WORKSHOP ON STATISTICAL SIGNAL AND ARRAY PROCESSING, P463, DOI 10.1109/SSAP.2000.870167; Duda R O, 2001, PATTERN CLASSIFICATI; Frome A., 2004, ECCV; Grauman K., 2005, P IEEE INT C COMP VI; Jahangir M, 2003, IEE P-RADAR SON NAV, V150, P33, DOI 10.1049/ip-rsn:20030027; Jahangir M, 2002, IEE CONF PUBL, P162, DOI 10.1109/RADAR.2002.1174674; Kim Y, 2009, IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE, V47, P1328, DOI 10.1109/TGRS.2009.2012849; Liaqat S., 2011, P INN INT SYST APPL, P164; Nanzer JA, 2009, IEEE MICROW WIREL CO, V19, P338, DOI 10.1109/LMWC.2009.2017620; Neal R.

Furthermore, NFRs may also be externally imposed via government regulations or industry standards. As some NFRs represent emergent system proprieties, those NFRs require appropriate analysis and design efforts to ensure they are met. When the specified NFRs are not met, projects incur costly re-work to correct the issues. The goal of our research is to aid analysts in more effectively extracting relevant non-functional requirements in available unconstrained natural language documents through automated natural language processing. Specifically, we examine which document types (data use agreements, install manuals, regulations, request for proposals, requirements specifications, and user manuals) contain NFRs categorized to 14 NFR categories (e. g. capacity, reliability, and security). We measure how effectively we can identify and classify NFR statements within these documents. In each of the documents evaluated, we found NFRs present. Using a word vector representation of the NFRs, a support vector machine algorithm performed twice as effectively compared to the same input to a multinomial naive Bayes classifier. Our k-nearest neighbor classifier with a unique distance metric had an F1 measure of 0.54, outperforming in our experiments the optimal naive Bayes classifier which had a F1 measure of 0.32. We also found that stop word lists beyond common determiners had no minimal performance effect.

Up to now there are very few researches conducted on sentiment analysis for Persian documents. This paper considers the problem of sentiment classification for online customer reviews in Persian language. One of the challenges of Persian language is using of a wide variety of declensional suffixes. Another common problem of Persian text is word spacing. In Persian in addition to white space as inter-words space, an intra-word space called pseudo-space separates word's part. One more noticeable challenge in customer reviews in Persian language is that of utilizing many informal or colloquial words in text. In this paper we study these challenges by proposing a model for sentiment classification of Persian review documents. The proposed model is based on a lemmatization approach for Persian language and is employed Naive Bayes learning algorithm for classification. Additionally we present a new feature selection method based on the mutual information method to extract the best feature collection from the initial extracted features. Finally we evaluate the performance of the model on a manually gathered collection of cellphone reviews, where the results show the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Due to the high dimensionality of microarray data sets, choosing reliable feature selection and classification algorithms with a high degree of accuracy and a low complexity is a crucial task in bioinformatics. Toward this goal, this paper aims to maximize the cancer classification accuracy using two reliable ensemble-based classifiers namely the ensemble of naive bayes and the ensemble of k-nearest neighbor. Simulation results show that our classifiers have considerably better accuracy than some conventional classification techniques such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and artificial neural networks in the field of multicategory microarray cancer classification based on fourteen cancer data set. However, the run time of the introduced ensemble-based classifiers is longer when the schemes use whole features. To reduce the time complexity while preserving the same classification accuracy as before, we use the recursive feature elimination based on the multiple support vector machine classifier to select more informative genes before applying the ensemble-based classifiers. Numerical evaluations show at least 30% improvement in the classification accuracy of our schemes when compared to the SVM-one versus one rule. In addition, our schemes are much more robust to the feature elimination and display a high accuracy in the case of low number of features.

Extensive automated testing and code inspections may mitigate their effect, but some code fragments are necessarily more likely to be faulty than others, and automated identification of fault prone modules helps to focus testing and inspections, thus limiting wasted effort and potentially improving detection rates. However, software metrics data is often extremely noisy, with enormous imbalances in the size of the positive and negative classes. In this work, we present a new approach to predictive modelling of fault proneness in software modules, introducing a new feature representation to overcome some of these issues. This rank sum representation offers improved or at worst comparable performance to earlier approaches for standard data sets, and readily allows the user to choose an appropriate trade-off between precision and recall to optimise inspection effort to suit different testing environments. The method is evaluated using the NASA Metrics Data Program (MDP) data sets, and performance is compared with existing studies based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) Classifiers, and with our own comprehensive evaluation of these methods.

Research on sentiment and opinion mining for online review analysis has attracted increasingly more attention because such study helps leverage information from online reviews for potential economic impact. In this paper, we apply sentiment analysis and machine learning methods to study the relationship between the online reviews for a movie and the movie's box office revenue performance. We show that a simplified version of the sentiment-aware autoregressive model proposed in [5] can produce very good accuracy for predicting the box office sale using online review data. Our simplified version considers only positive and negative sentiments, and uses a very simple set of features with 14 affective key words for representing the sentiments in a review. In this way we obtain a simpler model which could be more efficient to train and use. Experiments indicate that the autoregressive model using both review sentiment data and the previous days' sale data results in higher accuracy than just using previous sale data alone. In addition, we create a classification model using Naive Bayes Classifier for predicting the trend of the box office revenue from the review sentiment data.

Hierarchical Classification of Bird Species Using Their Audio Recorded Songs	2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC 2013)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 13-16, 2013	Manchester, ENGLAND	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc		Bird species identification; Audio classification; Hierarchical classification; Hierarchical Naive Bayes classifier	RECOGNITION; SOUNDS	In this paper we address the task of hierarchical bird species identification from audio recordings. We evaluate three types of approaches to deal with hierarchical classification problems: the flat classification approach, the local-model per parent node classifier approach and the global-model hierarchical-classification approach. For the flat and local-model classification approach we employ the classic Naive Bayes algorithm. For the global-model approach we use the Global Model Naive Bayes (GMNB) algorithm. As in the classical Naive Bayes, the algorithm computes prior probabilities and likelihoods, but these computations take into account the hierarchical classification scenario: it assumes that any example which belongs to a given class will also belong to all its ancestor classes. In the current application, the employed class hierarchy is the standard scientific taxonomy of birds used in Biology. In order to deal with the bird songs we obtain features by computing several acoustic quantities from intervals of the audio signal. We conduct three experiments in order to compare the three different approaches to the hierarchical bird species identification problem. Our experimental results show that the use of the GMNB hierarchical classification algorithm outperforms both the flat and local-model approaches (Using the Hierarchical F-measure metric); hence the use of a global-model approach (such as the GMNB) can be a feasible way to improve the classification performance for problems with a large number of classes.

First, extracting the variables that represent a student's engagement in learning and defining the causal relationships among them can be difficult. Such variables are often implicit due to the unobservable nature of mental model. Second, identifying the evidence from student interaction log to infer a student's engagement level is also a major challenge. Such challenge stemmed mainly because students are granted the freedom to formulate and evaluate hypotheses in computer-based scientific inquiry learning environments; not all interactions can be useful to infer the student's engagement level. As such, the assumption that the frequency of interactions correlates with the level of student engagement can often be misleading. Therefore, this research work attempted to identify the variables of student engagement and to determine the Bayesian Network that can capture the causal relationships between the variables. In this study, two variations of Bayesian Network model were hand-crafted with the prior probabilities learned using the interaction logs of 54 students. The predictive accuracy of proposed models were benchmarked against Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine. The empirical findings showed that the Bayesian Network model with convergence arc directions outperformed other models, suggesting it is an optimal model for modeling student engagement in INQPRO.

Diagnosis of Lymphatic Diseases Using A Naive Bayes Style Possibilistic Classifier	2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC 2013)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 13-16, 2013	Manchester, ENGLAND	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc		Computer-aided diagnosis; Naive Bayes Style Possibilistic Classifier; lymphatic diseases		This paper investigates a Naive Bayes Style Possibilistic Classifier (NBSPC) to make decision from the categorical and subjective medical information included by the lymphography dataset of University of California Irvine (UCI). Main focus of the work is to improve the classification accuracy. NBSPC simultaneously relies on the structure of the Naive Bayes classifier as a good classifier for categorical features, and on the possibility theory as an interesting framework to model and fuse subjective medical data. Possibilistic measures are estimated within the NBSPC using maximum likelihood estimation and then the probability-possibility transformation method of Dubois et al. Results show that the proposed classifier outperforms other classification techniques which have been already evaluated on the same data.

This paper focuses on missing data and high dimensionality; both of which are known to affect classification and the design of decision support systems. Naive Bayes classifier was employed to explore how both complexities are handled. Experimental result showed that imputing missing values does not improve the performance of naive Bayes. However, a wrapper subset evaluator that employed forward and backward search strategies for reducing the data dimension had an effect on performance. The methods determined an optimal set of features and reduced numerical and time complexity while maintaining a high degree of accuracy. These methods were compared in two different datasets; a lifelab and iris dataset.

An Exploratory Study into Automated Real-Time Categorisation of Engineering E-Mail	2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC 2013)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 13-16, 2013	Manchester, ENGLAND	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc		Engineering Communication; E-Mail; Naive Bayes; Latent Semantic Analysis	CAPTURING DESIGN RATIONALE; COMMUNICATION; KNOWLEDGE; TEAMS	For large, spatially and temporally distributed engineering projects, e-mail is a central means for the discussion of engineering work and sharing of digital assets that define the product and its production process. The importance of communication and the value of its content for resolving issues post facto are universally accepted. More recently, the potential value of its content to predict events, issues and states a priori has been explored with some success. However, while in the former context (post facto) trends and patterns can be established through iteration and refinement over time; for prediction, heuristics need to be established in advance and closer to real-time analysis becomes necessary due to the critical and very often short timescales. It is this challenge of making predictions from the content of e-mail that is considered in this paper. In particular, the paper deals with engineering e-mail and the ability to automatically predict its purpose from its content rather than relying solely on the subject line. The work builds upon previous studies by the authors concerning the characterisation of the content of e-mail: what they are about, why they were sent and how the content is expressed. The paper summarises the previous work and looks at the potential of identifying the purpose of e-mail through the use of Naive Bayes and an adapted Latent Semantic Analysis approach. While the techniques have only been applied to an initial exploratory study of 98 e-mails, the results suggest the potential for automated real-time categorisation of engineering e-mails through achieving an accuracy of 66%. Such a capability would both support prioritisation of e-mail for engineers and macro level characterisation of project e-mail dynamics. The latter provides the opportunity for real-time analysis of an engineering projects status and correspondingly, modes of management intervention.

In this paper, we go beyond basic sentiment classification (positive, negative and neutral) and target deeper emotion classification of Twitter data. We have focused on emotion identification into Ekman's six basic emotions i.e. JOY, SURPRISE, ANGER, DISGUST, FEAR and SADNESS. We have employed two diverse machine learning algorithms with three varied datasets and analyzed their outcomes. We show how equal distribution of emotions in training tweets results in better learning accuracies and hence better performance in the classification task.

It is universal and can be used in various environments. Learning speed of the proposed method and reinforcement learning algorithm are compared in a Farmer-Pest problem with delayed rewards. Farmer-Pest problem is chosen for the comparison because it is designed especially for learning algorithms benchmarking. It has several dimensions which change environment characteristics and allows to test algorithms in various conditions.

Anomaly-based intrusion detection methods, which employ machine learning algorithms, are able to identify unforeseen attacks. Regrettably, the foremost challenge of this method is to minimize false alarm while maximizing detection and accuracy rate. We propose an integrated machine learning algorithm across K-Means clustering and Naive Bayes Classifier called KMC+NBC to overcome the aforesaid drawbacks. K-Means clustering is applied to labeling and gathers the entire data into corresponding cluster sets based on the data behavior, i.e., i.e. normal and attack, while Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) is applied to reorder the misclassified clustered data into correct categories. Experiments have been performed to evaluate the performance of KMC+NBC and NBC against ISCX 2012 Intrusion Detection Evaluation Dataset. The result shows that KMC+NBC significantly improves the accuracy, detection rate up to 99% and 98.8%, respectively, while decreasing the false alarm to 2.2%.			izura@fsktm.upm.edu.my					Carlos A.C., 2012, COMPUTERS ELECT ENG, V38, P1062; Chung YY, 2012, APPL SOFT COMPUT, V12, P3014, DOI 10.1016/j.asoc.2012.04.020; Elbasiony Reda M., 2013, AIN SHAMS ENG J, V4, P753, DOI DOI 10.1016/J.ASEJ.2013.01.003; Horng SJ, 2011, EXPERT SYST APPL, V38, P306, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2010.06.066; Koc L, 2012, EXPERT SYST APPL, V39, P13492, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2012.07.009; Lee W., 1998, P 7 USENIX SEC S, P120; Panda M, 2012, PROCEDIA ENGINEER, V30, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.proeng.2012.01.827; Patcha A, 2007, COMPUT NETW, V51, P3448, DOI 10.1016/j.comnet.2007.02.001; Shiravi A, 2012, COMPUT SECUR, V31, P357, DOI 10.1016/j.cose.2011.12.012; Tsai CF, 2010, PATTERN RECOGN, V43, P222, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2009.05.017; Tsang CH, 2007, PATTERN RECOGN, V40, P2373, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2006.12.009; Yingbing Y., 2012, J COMPUTER SCI, V28, P9	12	1	1	0	0	UNIV UTARI MALAYSIA-UUM	SINTOK	COLL ARTS & SCI, INFOR TECHNOL BLDG, SINTOK, KEDAH 06010, MALAYSIA	2289-3784		978-983-2078-78-4	PROC INT CONF COMP			2013							298	303				6	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BA2ON	WOS:000333716800044

That is, our goal is to determine whether the whole document has positive or negative opinion regardless of its subject. In order to enhance the performance of the classification, transfer learning is applied from unlabeled Twitter data to labeled political columns. A variation of self-taught learning has been proposed, and implemented for the classification. Different machine learning techniques, including support vector machine, maximum entropy classification, and Naive-Bayes has been used for the supervised learning phase. In our experiments we have obtained up to 26 % increase in the accuracy of the classification with the inclusion of the Twitter data into the sentiment classification of Turkish political columns using transfer learning.

Turkish Lexical SampleDataset has been used in the experiments. We took the samples of ambiguous verbs and nouns of the dataset and used bag-of-word properties as context information. The experi-ments have been repeated for different window sizes based on several machine learning algorithms. We follow 2/3 splitting strategy (2/3 for training, 1/3 for test-ing) and determine the most frequently used words in the training part. After re-moving stop words, we repeated the experiments by using most frequent 100, 75, 50 and 25 content words of the training data. Our findings show that the usage of most frequent 75 words as features improves the accuracy in results for Turkish verbs. Similar results have been obtained for Turkish nouns when we use the most frequent 100 words of the training set. Considering this information, selected al-gorithms have been tested on varying window sizes {30, 15, 10 and 5}. Our find-ings show that Naive Bayes and Functional Tree methods yielded better accuracy results. And the window size +/-5 gives the best average results both for noun and the verb groups. It is observed that the best results of the two groups are 65.8 and 56% points above the most frequent sense baseline of the verb and noun groups respectively.

Cognitive impairment is, however, difficult to detect. Apart from the traditional features used in P300 experiments (e. g. amplitude and latency at different electrodes), we want to investigate the value of network-features on the classification of MS patients as cognitively intact or impaired. We included 305 MS patients, recruited at the National MS Center Melsbroek (Belgium). About half of them was denoted cognitively impaired (143). We divided this patient group in a training set (on which we used 10-fold crossvalidation) and an independent test set. Results are reported on this last group to increase the generalizability. We found the correlations linking electrodes from one hemisphere with the other significantly different between the two groups MS patients. Especially in the parietal region this difference was very significant (1.5e(-12)). Using a simple cutoff on this variable, lead to a Percentage Correctly Classified (PCC) of 0.70 and an Area Under Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) of 0.76. The network parameters that were calculated showed a comparable result for the total number of edges included in the network. Combining these features in a logistic regression model, artificial neural networks or Naive Bayes resulted in a PCC's of 0.68-0.70. These results support the recent suggestion that cognitive dysfunction in MS is caused by a disconnection mechanism in the cerebellum. We have obtained these results applying graph theoretical analyses on EEG data instead of the more common fMRI-analyses. The classification accuracy obtained is, however, not yet sufficient for application in clinical practice.

Link-based classification (LBC) is the problem of predicting the class attribute of a target entity given the attributes of entities linked to it. In this paper we propose a new relational Bayes net classifier method for LBC, which assumes that different links of an object are independently drawn from the same distribution, given attribute information from the linked tables. We show that this assumption allows very fast multi-relational Bayes net learning. We define three more independence assumptions for LBC to unify proposals from different researchers in a single novel hierarchy. Our proposed model is at the top and the well-known multi-relational Naive Bayes classifier is at the bottom of this hierarchy. The model in each level of the hierarchy uses a new independence assumption in addition to the assumptions used in the higher levels. In experiments on four benchmark datasets, our proposed link independence model has the best predictive accuracy compared to the hierarchy models and a variety of relational classifiers.

First, we automatically collected Twitter corpus in positive and negative tweets. Second, we built a simple sentiment classifier by utilizing the Naive Bayes model to determine the positive and negative sentiment of a tweet. Third, we tested the classifier against a collection of users' opinions from five interesting domains of Twitter, i.e., news, finance, job, movies, and sport. The experimental results show that it is feasible to use Twitter corpus alone to classify new tweet for a certain domain applications.

J	Do, QH; Chen, JF				Do, Quang Hung; Chen, Jeng-Fung			A Neuro-Fuzzy Approach in the Classification of Students' Academic Performance	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							INFERENCE SYSTEM; NETWORK; PREDICTION; ANFIS	Classifying the student academic performance with high accuracy facilitates admission decisions and enhances educational services at educational institutions. The purpose of this paper is to present a neuro-fuzzy approach for classifying students into different groups. The neuro-fuzzy classifier used previous exam results and other related factors as input variables and labeled students based on their expected academic performance. The results showed that the proposed approach achieved a high accuracy. The results were also compared with those obtained from other well-known classification approaches, including support vector machine, Naive Bayes, neural network, and decision tree approaches.

The proposed hand tracking component includes three methods: a color-thresholding model, naive Bayes analysis and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect the human hand. Next, it performs stereo matching on the region where the hand was detected to find relative 3D coordinates. The list of coordinates returned is expectedly noisy due to the way the human hand can alter its apparent shape while moving, the inconsistencies in human motion and detection failures in the cluttered environment. Therefore, the system analyzes the list of coordinates to determine a path for the robot to move, by smoothing the data to reduce noise and looking for significant points used to determine the path the robot will ultimately take. The proposed system was applied to pairs of videos recording the motion of a human hand in a, real. environment to move the end-affector of a SCARA robot along the same path as the hand of the person in the video. The correctness of the robot motion was determined by observers indicating that motion of the robot appeared to match the motion of the video.

This work was undertaken to investigate the feasibility of using artificial intelligence in certain aspects of the mining industry. If successful, artificial intelligence systems could lead to improved safety and reduced electrical energy consumption. The results show neural networks to he more efficient when compared with support vector machines, a naive Bayes' classifier and in particular, decision trees in terms of predicting underground dam levels. Artificial neural networks showed 60% accuracy, out-performing support vector machine, naive Bayes' classifier and decision trees. For the prediction of water pump energy consumption, an artificial neural network and a naive Bayes' classifier had the same accuracy of 99.0%, whereas a support vector machine and decision trees achieved a lower accuracy.

In this paper, we explore how a consumer depth sensor can assist with upper-body detection and pose estimation more precisely in the field of assistive technology for people with disabilities, and a novel real-time upper-body pose (orientation) estimation method is presented. At first, the Haar cascade based upper-body detection is conducted, and the depth information in a fixed subregion is extracted as the input feature vector. Then, support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayes classifier are compared for estimating the upper-body orientation. Further, in order to acquire the continuous estimation data during a long time for behavioral analysis, we also adopt the support vector regression (SVR) to train a regression model. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Intrusion Detection in Role Administrated Database: Transaction-Based Approach	2013 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER ENGINEERING & SYSTEMS (ICCES)			English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Computer Engineering and Systems (ICCES)	NOV 26-28, 2013	Cairo, EGYPT	IEEE Egypt Sect, Ain Shams Univ, Fac Engn, Comp Engn & Syst Dept		Database security; Anomaly detection; Database intrusion detection; Role-based profiling		Most of valuable information resources for all organizations are stored in database. It's a serious subject to protect this information against intruders. However, conventional security mechanisms haven't been designed to detect anomalous actions of database users. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) deliver an extra layer of security that cannot be guaranteed by built-in security tools. IDS provide the ideal solution to defend databases from intruders. In this paper, we suggest an anomaly detection approach that summarizes the raw transactional SQL queries into compact data structure called hexplet, which can model normal database access behavior (abstract the user's role profile) and recognize impostors specifically tailored for role-based access control (RBAC) database system. This hexplet allows us to preserve the correlation among SQL statements in the same transaction by exploiting the information in the transaction-log entry. Our target is to improve detection accuracy, specially the detection of those intruders inside the organization who behave strange behavior. Our model utilizes Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) as a simple technique for evaluating the legitimacy of transaction. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed model in the term of error equal rate.

In the virtual environments, procedures are performed by a team of professionals acting simultaneously, as in real surgical rooms. It is important to verify if the group performed the procedure correctly or not. The assessment systems utilizes user and users data from the execution of the virtual procedure, generated by the virtual reality system, to be compared with predefined classes of performance. Previous approaches basically used fuzzy rule based expert systems and presented some problems with respect to calibration which was performed in phases. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on Fuzzy Naive Bayes to perform the calibration in a single phase, without lost of accuracy in the assessment of the performance.

Owing to the high feature space dimensions in most of data types, reduction of feature space and improving classification accuracy is important and difficult problem. A rough set theory is a powerful tool to deal with uncertainty, so it is a good tool for feature reduction. Bayesian networks are also one of the most powerful tools in design of expert systems located in an uncertainty framework. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm for data classification that first, it uses rough set theory and conditional entropy for feature selection and then through rough membership degree concept, it classifies objects with high membership degree, certainly. For classification of other objects, we use Bayesian network classifiers for instance Tree Augmented Naive Bayes and general Bayesian classifier with two different search approaches.

The most correct method to classify or approximate the GPS GDOP is to use inverse matrix on all the combinations and choosing the lowest one, but inversing a matrix puts a lot of computational burden on the navigator's processor. This approach however is a time-consuming task. To overcome the problem, basic back propagation neural network (BPNN) was used. Since the BPNN is too slow for practical problems, including the GPS GDOP classification, in this paper several methods, namely, resilient back propagation (RBP) to train a NN, naive Bayes classifier, Fisher's linear discriminant (FLD) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) for classification of the GPS GDOP are proposed. Simulation results show that these methods are much more efficient to classify the GPS GDOP data than previous methods.

The challenge that we aim to solve is finding the eyes on faces expressing emotions - this is extremely difficult because the shape of the facial features changes drastically when the subject goes through an emotional state. We attempt to solve this challenge by looking for eye patterns in an image and categorizing them using neural network classification approaches. The image features used are integral projections encoded by TESPAR method, thus reducing the dimensionality of the problem to vectors of 60 elements - we observed that the network classification ability becomes more robust on input samples computed in this manner and the computational complexity is lowered, such that the system gets closer to making real-time decisions. The paper presents experimental results of three classifiers (SVM, Naive Bayes and MLP) obtained on the Cohn-Kanade reference database. The measurements show that by tuning each classifier properly and by performing a post-processing step, we can obtain accuracies of over 90%.

The logic of propositions has been employed here to construct program segments to be used for cognitive load analysis and classification. Electroencephalogram signals acquired from the subjects during program analysis are first fuzzified and the resultant fuzzy membership functions are then submitted to the input of a fuzzy rule-based classifier to determine the class of the cognitive load of the subjects. Experimental results envisage that the proposed classifier has a good classification accuracy of 86.2%. Performance analysis of the fuzzy classifier further reveals that it outperforms two most widely used classifiers: Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes classifier.

The steered response power (SRP) using the phase transform (SRP-PHAT) method has been proved robust, but the algorithm may fail to locate the sound source in highly reverberant noisy environment. The Naive-Bayes localization algorithm based on classification of cross-correlation functions outperforms the SRP-PHAT in highly reverberant noisy environment. This paper proposes the improved Naive-Bayes localization algorithm using principal eigenvector. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm provides higher localization accuracy than the Naive-Bayes algorithm in reverberant noisy environment.

Furthermore, we have proven practically that 3D shape-based descriptors are more suitable for this type of recognition due to low shape intra-class variance, as opposed to image texture-based. In addition, we have also shown how an efficient Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor (NBNN) classifier can scale to a large hierarchical RGB-D Object Dataset [2] and achieve, with a single descriptor type, an accuracy close to state-of-art learning based approaches using combined descriptors.

People share their experiences, opinions or simply talk just about whatever concerns them online. The large amount of available data attracts system developers, studying on automatic mining and analysis. In this paper, the primary and underlying idea is that the fact of knowing how people feel about certain topics can be considered as a classification task. People's feelings can be positive, negative or neutral. A sentiment is often represented in subtle or complex ways in a text. An online user can use a diverse range of other techniques to express his or her emotions. Apart from that, s/he may mix objective and subjective information about a certain topic. On top of that, data gathered from the World Wide Web often contain a lot of noise. Indeed, the task of automatic sentiment recognition in online text becomes more difficult for all the aforementioned reasons. Hence, we present how sentiment analysis can assist language learning, by stimulating the educational process and experimental results on the Naive Bayes Classifier.

Metagenomics studies use DNA fragments obtained directly from a natural environment using whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing. Sequencing random fragments obtained from whole genome shotgun into taxa-based groups is known as binning. Currently, there are two different methods of binning sequence similarity methods and sequence composition methods. Sequence similarity methods are usually based on sequence alignment to known genome like BLAST, or MEGAN. As only a very small fraction of species is available in the current databases, similarity methods do not yield good results. As a given database of organisms grows, the complexity of the search will also grow. Sequence composition methods are based on compositional features of a given DNA sequence like K-mers, or other genomic signature(s). Most of these current methods for binning have two major issues: they do not work well with short sequences and closely related genomes. In this paper we propose new machine learning related predictive DNA sequence feature selection algorithms to solve binning problems in more accurate and efficient ways. In this work we use Oligonucleotide frequencies from 2-mers to 4-mers as features to differentiate between sequences. 2-mers produces 16 features, 3-mers produces 64 features and 4-mers produces 256 features. We did not use feature higher than 4-mers as the number of feature increases exponentially and for 5-mers the number of feature would be 1024 features. We found out that the 4-mers produces better results than 2-mers and 3-mers. The data used in this work has an average length of 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 base pairs. Experimental results of the proposed algorithms are presented to show the potential value of the proposed methods. The proposed algorithm accuracy is tested on a variety of data sets and the classification/prediction accuracy achieved is between 78% - 99% for various simulated data sets using Random forest classifier and 37% - 95% using Naive Bayes classifier.

Everyday millions of the spam mails are sent over internet to targeted population to advertise services, products and dangerous software etc. A number of spam detection algorithms have been proposed to classify emails on content based, but could not gain accuracy. Our proposed work mainly focuses on cognitive (spam) words for classification. This feature is sequential unique and closed patterns which are extracted from the message content. We show that this feature have good impact in classifying spam from legitimate messages. Our method, which can be easily implemented, compares amiably with respect to popular algorithms, like Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Naive Bayes and Random Forest using polynomial kernel as filter. We outperform the accuracy higher compared to related methods. In addition our method is resilient against irrelevant and bothersome words.

Although, there is a wide range of supervised machine learning methods have been applied to categorize English, relatively, only a few studies have been done on Malay text categorization. This paper reports our comparative evaluation of three machine learning methods on Malay text categorization. Two feature selection methods (Information gain (IG) and Chi-square) and three machine learning methods (K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Naive Bayes (NB) and N-gram) were investigated. The three supervised machine learning models were evaluated on categorized Malay corpus, and experimental results showed that the k-NN with the Chi-square feature selection gave the best performance (Macro-F1 = 96.14).

As much as 50 sentences out of 400 sentences from Malay syntax-prosody speech text has been selected as training and testing data set. SVM was trained to classify the prominent syllable in the sentences according to the feature presented. A prominent word can be categorized as prominent syllables but the prominent syllable has the potential not to classify as prominent word. Using training data, we trained it to obtain a model and the model will be used to predict instances with testing data set. The kernel function namely Radial Basis Function (RBF) is used to find the best cross validation accuracy of training data with parameter, C and gamma. The SVM technique also compared with a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier and the comparison clearly claims that the proposed technique based architecture outperforms on all experiments. Using SVM classifier, the percentage accuracy of the classification archived rate of 88.7304 % while 88.3024 % using the Naive Bayes (NB). The results showed that SVM is conveniently classified because the performance shown is better than NB. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In educational practices, the analysis of classroom questions asked by teachers is of particular benefits. This paper investigates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques on analyzing teacher's classroom questions by automatically classifying them into different cognitive levels identified in Bloom's taxonomy. More specifically, this paper reports on three of the most effective machine learning techniques for text classification: k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine using term frequency as a term selection approach. In doing so, a dataset of questions has been collected and classified manually into Bloom's cognitive levels. Preprocessing steps have been applied to convert questions into a representation suitable for machine learning techniques. Using this dataset, the performance of the three machine learning techniques has been evaluated. The results show a comparable performance of k-Nearest Neighbor and Naive Bayes and a superior performance of Support Vector Machine in term of F-1 and accuracy. Moreover the results also indicate that machine learning techniques show different levels of sensitivity to the number of terms used for question representation. (C) 2013 The Authors.

The performance of matching and classification is evaluated in terms of matching rate and classification accuracy along with the computation times. This comparison will help in determining the applicability of classification or matching in future works including real time applications. Highest classification accuracy is found to be 86%, in 0.0619sec, while the best matching rate obtained is 96% in 0.0041 sec. Thus Image matching is suitable for real time applications taking less computation time while providing significant performance improvement at the same time. (C) 2013 The Authors.

The focus is on multiclass classification, not on sequence labeling. Five methods are evaluated, including naive Bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), support vector machine (SVM) and sparse network of Winnow (SNoW). Using DT on Roth and Yih data set, the best precision and recall are achieved on both tasks of named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE). SNoW is not so good as DT, but it performs better than the other approaches. SVM performs better on precision and worse on recall. In contrast, the simplest methods NB and kNN has relative poor performance but they are not sensitive to learning tasks and classes.

Tracking is frequently failed and can hardly find the object again when the object moves fast or occluded completely. In addition, on-line tracking will generate cumulative errors during updating when the state of the object and the environment changes. In this paper, we propose a fast on-line boosting tracking algorithm based on cascade filters of multi-features. Algorithm generates detection windows with various positions and sizes during initialization. Cascade detection screenings possible object windows by using multi-features: the manner of object motion, variance of detection windows, Object Similarity Statistic (OSS) model, color distribution and overlap ratio in turn. The left candidate object windows are passed to the strong classifier of on-line boosting and the object is located finally In order to exert the advantage of boosting, naive Bayes classifier is used to replace the original simple threshold classifier in HBT. Experiment results on various videos show that the robustness, accuracy and real-time ability are improved.

But how a creditor decides whether to cut back your credit? This paper introduces to build a classification model to determine if a customer is a good risk for credit card by looking at factors such as occupation, credit experience, credit history, etc. In this paper, we consider four models: Naive Bayes Classifier; Linear Discriminant Analysis; Logistic Regression; Decision Tree; and then give an ensemble model. We used net profit as our criterion to assess the performance of the various models.

Naive Bayes (NB) classification is one of the popular classification methods for stream mining because it is an incremental classification method whose model can be easily updated as new data arrives. It has been observed in the literature that the performance of the NB classifier improves when irrelevant features are eliminated from the modeling process. This paper reports studies that were conducted to identify efficient computational methods for selecting relevant features for NB classification based on the sliding window method of stream mining. The paper also provides experimental results which demonstrate that continuous feature selection for NB stream mining provides high levels of predictive performance.

It is especially essential in the task of newspaper article topics identification. This paper presents a method based on general topic model normalisation for finding a threshold defining the boundary between the "correct" and the "incorrect" topics of a newspaper article. The proposed method is used to improve the topic identification algorithm which is a part of a complex system for acquisition and storing large volumes of text data. The topic identification module uses the Naive Bayes classifier for the multiclass and multi-label classification problem and assigns to each article the topics from a defined quite extensive topic hierarchy - it contains about 450 topics and topic categories. The results of the experiments with the improved topic identification algorithm are presented in this paper.

Few studies on detecting packing algorithms have been conducted during last two decades. In this paper, we propose a method to classify packing algorithms of given packed executables. First, we convert entropy values of the packed executables loaded in memory into symbolic representations. Our proposed method uses SAX (Symbolic Aggregate Approximation) which is known to be good at large data conversion. Due to its advantage of simplifying complicated patterns, symbolic representation is commonly used in bio-informatics and data mining fields. Second, we classify the distribution of symbols using supervised learning classifications, i.e., Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines. Results of our experiments with a collection of 466 programs and 15 packing algorithms demonstrated that our method can identify packing algorithms of given executables with a high accuracy of 94.2%, recall of 94.7% and precision of 92.7%. It has been confirmed that packing algorithms can be identified using entropy analysis, which is a measure of uncertainty of running executables, without a prior knowledge of the executable.

However, road panels detection still remains a challenge in computer vision due to the huge variability of types of traffic panels, as the information depicted in them is not restricted. This paper presents a method to detect traffic panels in street-level images as an application to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), since the main purpose can be to make an automatic inventory of the traffic panels located in a road to support maintenance and to assist drivers in order to improve human quality of life. The proposed method extracts local descriptors at some interest points after applying a color detection method for blue and white pixels. Then, the images are modeled using a Bag of Visual Words technique and classified using Naive Bayes theory and SVM. Experimental results on real images from Google Street View prove the efficiency of the proposed method and give way to using street-level images for different applications on robotics and ITS.

This article has proposed one kind of classification based on machine learning's web database. The experiment has indicated that after this taxonomic approach undergoes few sample training, it can achieve the very good classified effect, and along with training sample's increase, this classifier's performance maintains stable and the rate of accuracy and the recalling rate fluctuate in the very small scope.

The proposed method makes learning possible from a continuous inflow of a potentially unlimited amount of data without the requirement for storage. It highlights the use of unlabelled data for better parameter estimation, especially when labelled data is scarce and expensive unlike unlabelled data. We introduce an algorithm for learning from labelled and unlabelled samples based on the combination of novel online ensemble of the Randomized Naive Bayes classifiers and a novel incremental variant of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. We make use of a weighting factor to modulate the contribution of unlabelled data. An empirical evaluation of the proposed method on Tamil handwritten base character recognition proves efficacy of the proposed method to carry out incremental semi-supervised learning and producing accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art batch learning method. Online handwritten Tamil characters from the IWFHR 2006 competition dataset was used for evaluating the proposed method.

Taking feedback from students at the end of the semester, however, has the disadvantage of not benefitting the students that have already taken the course. To benefit the cur-rent students, feedback should be given in real time and addressed in real time. This would enable students and lecturers to address teaching and learning issues in the most beneficial way for the students. Analysing students' feedback using sentiment analysis techniques can identify the students' positive or negative feelings, or even more refined emotions, that students have towards the current teaching. Feedback can be collected in a variety of ways, with previous research using student response systems such as clickers, SMS and mobile phones. This paper will discuss how feedback can be collected via social media such as Twitter and how using sentiment analysis on educational data can help improve teaching. The paper also introduces our proposed system Sentiment Analysis for Education (SA-E).

The paper compares the results of two automatic music genres classification systems implemented by using two different yet simple classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbor & Naive Bayes). First a 10-12 second sample is selected and features are extracted from it, and then based on those features results of both classifiers are represented in the form of accuracy table and confusion matrix. An experiment carried out on test 60 taken from middle of a song represents the true essence of its genre as compared to the samples taken from beginning and ending of a song. The novel techniques have achieved an accuracy of 91% and 78% by using Naive Bayes and KNN classifiers respectively.

This scenario can arise, e. g., when a group of experts is asked to individually provide a class label for each instance. We particularize the generalized expectation maximization (GEM) algorithm in [1] to learn BCs with different structural complexities: naive Bayes, averaged one-dependence estimators or general conditional linear Gaussian classifiers. An evaluation conducted on eight datasets shows that BCs learned with GEM perform better than those using either the classical Expectation Maximization algorithm or potentially wrong class labels. BCs achieve similar results to the multivariate Gaussian classifier without having to estimate the full covariance matrices.

Its accuracy can be improved by relaxing these assumptions. One classifier which does that is the semi-naive Bayes. The state-of-the-art algorithm for learning a semi-naive Bayes from data is the backward sequential elimination and joining (BSEJ) algorithm. We extend BSEJ with a second step which removes some of its unwarranted independence assumptions. Our classifier outperforms BSEJ and five other Bayesian network classifiers on a set of benchmark databases, although the difference in performance is not statistically significant.

In this paper, we explore extracting action patterns using temporal self-similarity from time sequential skeletons recovered from such data. For each body joint, action patterns are extracted locally in the temporal extent of a given video. Then, the standard bag-of-words framework is employed to assemble these local patterns for action modeling. Action recognition is performed using Naive-Bayes-Nearest-Neighbors classifier with also considering the spatial independence of body joints. Experimental result on the benchmarking dataset: UCF Kinect dataset, suggested the effectiveness and promise of the proposed action patterns.

We conduct several experiments to identify the best Text Representation settings and the best classification algorithm for our dataset. We carry out our experiments on hotel reviews. We focus on extracting the trip type, as contextual information, from these reviews. Results show that the Naive Bayes classifier yields the best results with up to 72.2% in terms of F1-measure. To extract context from user reviews with text classification techniques, we recommend to use raw text rather than employing stemming, to use the normalized frequency based weighting rather than the presence based one, to remove terms that occur once in the data set, and to combine unigrams, bigrams and trigrams.

While there has been a significant amount of work on the development of learning algorithms for LR in recent years, pre-processing methods for LR are still very scarce. However, some methods, like Naive Bayes for LR and APRIORI-LR, cannot deal with real-valued data directly. As a make-shift solution, one could consider conventional discretization methods used in classification, by simply treating each unique ranking as a separate class. In this paper, we show that such an approach has several disadvantages. As an alternative, we propose an adaptation of an existing method, MDLP, specifically for LR problems. We illustrate the advantages of the new method using synthetic data. Additionally, we present results obtained on several benchmark datasets. The results clearly indicate that the discretization is performing as expected and in some cases improves the results of the learning algorithms.

Due to the lack of linguistic data for the Arabic language, we work on non-annotated corpus and with the help of four annotators; we were able to annotate the different samples containing the ambiguous words. Since that, we test the naive bayes algorithm, the decision lists and the exemplar based algorithm. During the experimental study, we test the influence of the window size on the disambiguation quality, the derivation and the technique of smoothing for the (2n+1)-grams. We find that the exemplar based algorithm achieves the best rate of precision.

We analyzed volumetric measures of critical brain areas by using different Data Mining methods. Structural magnetic resonance images, generated in our university, were preprocessed using a fully automated segmentation method and the extracted volumetric information was then analyzed by using different binary classifiers. We performed three binary classification experiments considering different data mining algorithms and neurological diseases. Naive Bayes outperformed all the others classifiers in two experiments, obtaining respectively 93.75% and 95.00% accuracy, while in the third experiment the best classifier was SVM but with a lower accuracy (58,56%). Afterwards, using the Stacking technique we combined the predictions from the best detected three models to build a meta-learner. Meta-learner classification results suggest that the application of the Stacking technique needs more experimentation and the test of additional stackers.

This makes it essential to analyze them in the search for PD biomarkers. This study aims at classifying patients suffering from iRBD or PD based on features reflecting eye movements (EMs) during sleep. A Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model was developed based on features extracted from two electrooculographic (EOG) signals measured as parts in full night polysomnographic (PSG) recordings from ten control subjects. The trained model was tested on ten other control subjects, ten iRBD patients and ten PD patients, obtaining a EM topic mixture diagram for each subject in the test dataset. Three features were extracted from the topic mixture diagrams, reflecting "certainty","fragmentation" and "stability" in the timely distribution of the EM topics. Using a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier and the features "certainty" and "stability" yielded the best classification result and the subjects were classified with a sensitivity of 95 %, a specificity of 80% and an accuracy of 90 %.

The prevalence of sleep disorders has increased significantly, now affecting up to 50 % of the general population. Sleep is usually analyzed by extracting a hypnogram containing sleep stages. The gold standard method polysomnography (PSG) requires subjects to stay overnight in a sleep laboratory and to wear a series of obtrusive devices. This work presents an easy to use method to perform somnography at home using unobtrusive motion sensors. Ten healthy male subjects were recorded during two consecutive nights. Sensors from the Shimmer platform were placed in the bed to record accelerometer data, while reference hypnograms were collected using a SOMNOwatch system. A series of filters were used to extract a motion feature in 30 second epochs from the accelerometer signals. The feature was used together with the ground truth information to train a Naive Bayes classifiers that distinguished wakefulness, REM and non-REM sleep. Additionally the algorithm was implemented on an Android mobile phone. Averaged over all subjects, the classifier had a mean accuracy of 79.0 % (SD 9.2%) for the three classes. The mobile phone implementation was able to run in realtime during all experiments. In future this will lead to a method for simple and unobtrusive somnography using mobile phones.

The main point was to use Half-Against-Half (HAH) architecture in classification. HAH structure was used with Support Vector Machines (SVMs), k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) method and Naive Bayes (NB) methods. Furthermore, Multinomial Logistic Regression (MNLR) was tested for the dataset. HAH-SVM with the linear kernel achieved clearly the best accuracy being 76.9% which was a good result with the dataset tested. From the other classification methods HAH-k-NN with cityblock metric, HAH-NB and MNLR methods achieved above 60% accuracy. Around 77% accuracy is a good result compared to previous researches with the same dataset.

To elucidate the effect of each kinase on neurite elongation and regeneration from a small set of experiments, we applied machine learning methods to synthetic datasets based on a biologically feasible model. The result showed the ridged partial least squares (RPLS) algorithm performed better than other standard algorithms such as naive Bayes classifier, support vector machines and random forest classification. This suggests the effectiveness of dimension reduction done in RPLS.

However, it fails to identify specific sub-groups of the patients or their corresponding (subset of) the biomarkers. This paper therefore proposes a novel framework that is capable of discovering disease sub-groups (types) and associated subset of biomarkers, which is expected to lead to enable the discovery of personalized biomarker set. The framework is based on the utilization of a histogram obtained by using the Euclidean distances between the samples in a given data set. The t-test method is used for the selection of sub-set(s) of the biomarkers whereas the classification is performed by means of k-nearest neighbor, support vector machines and naive Bayes (NBayes) classifiers. For the assessment of the methods, leave-out-out cross validation is employed. As a case study, the method is applied in the analysis of male hypertension microarray data that consists of 159 patients and 22184 gene expressions. The method has helped identify specific subgroups of the patients and their corresponding bio-marker sub-sets. The results therefore suggest that the generalized bio-marker sub-sets are not representative of the disease and therefore more focus should be on the sub-groups of the patients and their biomarker subsets identified through the proposed approach. It is particularly observed that the threshold values over the histogram are crucial to discover both sub-sets of the samples and biomarkers, and therefore can be used to determine complexity level of the study.

The objective of the present study is to develop a novel approach to extract pain-related features from single-trial laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) for classification of pain perception. The single-trial LEP feature extraction approach combines a spatial filtering using common spatial pattern (CSP) and a multiple linear regression (MLR). The CSP method is effective in separating laser-evoked EEG response from ongoing EEG activity, while MLR is capable of automatically estimating the amplitudes and latencies of N2 and P2 from single-trial LEP waveforms. The extracted single-trial LEP features are used in a Naive Bayes classifier to classify different levels of pain perceived by the subjects. The experimental results show that the proposed single-trial LEP feature extraction approach can effectively extract pain-related LEP features for achieving high classification accuracy.

Unsupervised Learning applied in MER and ECG Signals through Gaussians Mixtures with the Expectation-Maximization Algorithm and Variational Bayesian Inference	2013 35TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 03-07, 2013	Osaka, JAPAN	IEEE Engn Med Biol Soc, Japanese Soc Med & Biol Engn				Automatic identification of biosignals is one of the more studied fields in biomedical engineering. In this paper, we present an approach for the unsupervised recognition of biomedical signals: Microelectrode Recordings (MER) and Electrocardiography signals (ECG). The unsupervised learning is based in classic and bayesian estimation theory. We employ gaussian mixtures models with two estimation methods. The first is derived from the frequentist estimation theory, known as Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The second is obtained from bayesian probabilistic estimation and it is called variational inference. In this framework, both methods are used for parameters estimation of Gaussian mixtures. The mixtures models are used for unsupervised pattern classification, through the responsibility matrix. The algorithms are applied in two real databases acquired in Parkinson's disease surgeries and electrocardiograms. The results show an accuracy over 85% in MER and 90% in ECG for identification of two classes. These results are statistically equal or even better than parametric (Naive Bayes) and nonparametric classifiers (K-nearest neighbor).

Support Vector Machines and Maximum Entrophy Learners are the most common methods used to solve this problem, but we consider it from the point-of-view of probabilistic graphical models. We hypothesize that graphical models are well-suited to this task, as they can capture feature inter-dependencies that cannot be exploited by SVMs. Using progressively more connected graphical models, we show that these models out-perform SVMs on reduced feature sets. Furthermore, on full feature sets, even naive Bayes increases accuracy from 82.06% to 83.41% over SVMs on a 5-language classification task.

The approaches to this task can largely be divided into two categories: filter-based and wrapper-based methods. Generally, the latter produces better results than the former with regard to given learning methods, though it consumes more computational resources for searches over the feature subset space. In this paper, we propose an Efficient wRapper based on a Paired t-Test (ERPT) for choosing features from large-scale data consisting of thousands of variables, such as microarrays. Statistical tests are a reasonable option when the number of features is very large because they have more predictable behavior and can be more efficient than most search methods. The proposed method consists of two phases: decrement phase and increment phase. In the decrement phase, it selects strongly relevant features. In the increment phase, it adds weakly relevant features, given the previously selected features. Our method, combined with naive Bayes classifiers, has been tested in an extensive set of experiments on University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository data. The results showed that the performance of the proposed method is comparable to that of the backward search-based wrapper and superior to that of the forward search-based wrapper. Furthermore, it demonstrated much better performance than the forward search-based wrapper when applied to three microarray data sets, for which the backward search-based wrapper was impractical because of the computational burden involved. The proposed method has the following three merits: (1) it is applicable to data sets having thousands of variables, (2) it provides a theoretically sound and controllable criterion for thresholding features, and (3) it finds feature subsets for the maximizing of classification performance on sparse domains.

When it is severe, learning algorithms fail to retrieve the rarer classes and common assessment metrics become uninformative. In this work, class imbalance is approached using neuropsychological data, with the aim of differentiating Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and predicting the conversion from MCI to AD. The effect of the imbalance on four learning algorithms is examined through the application of bagging, Bayes risk minimization and MetaCost. Plain decision trees were always outperformed, indicating susceptibility to the imbalance. The naive Bayes classifier was robust but suffered a bias that was adjusted through risk minimization. This strategy outperformed all other combinations of classifiers and meta-learning/ensemble methods. The tree-augmented naive Bayes classifier also benefited from an adjustment of the decision threshold. In the nearly balanced datasets, it was improved by bagging, suggesting that the tree structure was too strong for the attribute dependencies. Support vector machines were robust, as their plain version achieved good results and was never outperformed.

The proposed model is expected to be useful in developing an overall aesthetic model of web pages, leading to better evaluation of web page usability. We identified two feature sets describing aesthetics of an animated video. Based on the feature sets, we developed a Naive-Bayes classifier by applying Co-training, a semi-supervised machine learning technique. The model classifies the videos as good, average or bad in terms of their aesthetic quality. We designed 18 videos and got those rated by 17 participants for use as the initial training set.

For example, credit scoring is frequently determined based on the records of past credit data together with statistical prediction techniques. Needless to say, such determinations must be nondiscriminatory and fair in sensitive features, such as race, gender, religion, and so on. The goal of fairness-aware classifiers is to classify data while taking into account the potential issues of fairness, discrimination, neutrality, and/or independence. In this paper, after reviewing fairness-aware classification methods, we focus on one such method, Calders and Verwer's two-naive-Bayes method. This method has been shown superior to the other classifiers in terms of fairness, which is formalized as the statistical independence between a class and a sensitive feature. However, the cause of the superiority is unclear, because it utilizes a somewhat heuristic post-processing technique rather than an explicitly formalized model. We clarify the cause by comparing this method with an alternative naive Bayes classifier, which is modified by a modeling technique called hypothetical fair-factorization. This investigation reveals the theoretical background of the two-naive-Bayes method and its connections with other methods. Based on these findings, we develop another naive Bayes method with an actual fairfactorization technique and empirically show that this new method can achieve an equal level of fairness as that of the two-naive-Bayes classifier.

The media traffic, which carries the voice on Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), is subjected to variation in transmitted packet sizes and content due to the usage of Variable Bit Rate (VBR) codecs. In the absence of session level information, the RTP header does not uniquely identify the VBR voice codecs defined as dynamic payload type. In this paper we present a method to classify VoIP traffic coded with three VBR codecs - iSAC, SILK and Speex. We first formulate features to characterize an RTP flow based on packet size and entropy values of the packet content. The features are used for classification of RTP traffic based on codec using machine learning techniques. The paper reports classification results using the three machine learning algorithms, namely 1-NN, C4.5 and Naive Bayes. The results show an accuracy of over 98% for offline classification with the reduced feature set. The paper also presents the performance of the classifiers with varying size of available traffic.

A recommender system helps user to come to a decision quickly. In the conventional recommendation system only the reviewer's ratings are taken into consideration. However, contextual information pertaining to each user should be incorporated in the recommendation system, making the recommendation personalized. As some features can enhance the performance of a recommendation system and also certain irrelevant features might degrade it, feature selection becomes an essential aspect of context aware recommendation system. In our paper we have devised a novel approach which first selects relevant contextual variables based on the contextual information of the reviewers and their ratings for a class of entities, with naive Bayes classifier. Once the relevant contextual variables are extracted, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is applied for extracting most significant features corresponding to each entity. This information is used by the recommendation system in analyzing the contextual information of the user in recommending him entities that are of interest to him. The proposed method also determines the best contextual variable and feature space for each entity. This enables the context aware recommendation system more efficient and personalized. Moreover, with the proposed method an overall increase in F-score of 30% was obtained thereby improving the reliability of the recommender system.

For example, we have great amount of news articles everyday. But there are small amount of useful information in the articles and it is hard to extract useful information manually. As a result, there are lots of news articles but, it is hard to read all of articles and find informative news manually. One of solutions on this problem is to summarize texts in the article. There are many studies on the text summarization techniques, but small number of studies to predict whether the article should be summarized or not. If we don't know about that, it is likely to waste computing resources to summarize unnecessary articles. In this paper, we propose a method to model the pattern of user's summarization needs on news articles. We perform experiments using news articles and apply data mining techniques (C4.5 and Naive Bayes) to model common preprocessor to execute the automatic summarization.

Consumers in homes and small shops need cheap systems that ensure automatic detection of armed robberies and provide automatic response. The Kinect sensor is a versatile sensor that can automatically detect and track individuals through the Kinect API. This sensor has been successfully used in the game industry and is an excellent starting point for tracking individuals in other consumer applications.

A system is proposed that can automatically locate four important facial regions from which the uniform LBPs features are extracted and concatenated to form a 236 dimensional enhanced feature vector to be used for six fundamental expressions recognition. The features are trained using three widely used classifiers: Naive bayes, Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) and three layered Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP3). The notable feature of the proposed method is the use of few preferred regions of the face to extract the LBPs features as opposed to the use of entire face. The experimental results obtained from MMI database show proficiency of the proposed features extraction method.

The paper focuses on the identification of language varieties, which is a known weakness of general purpose language identification methods. This question was addressed by a number of studies in the recent years, most of them relying on character n-gram language models. In this paper, I experiment simple bag-of-words and compare the results with previously proposed n-gram-based approaches. To perform these classification experiments three algorithms were used: Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the J48 classifier.

In this paper, a method is applied to transform the multiclass case to a single-label classification by creating merged classes. To train merged classes, each feature must be defined in a very small domain, and the range of each feature must be binary, i.e., {0, 1}. It is not a contradiction to consider that the range of each feature is binary when the naive Bayes classifier is employed in the bag-of-keypoints method. Thus, a fuzzy extension technique is proposed that enables us to consider the range of each feature as continuous, i.e., [0, 1]. By using the weighted average operation of the fuzzy vector, the ordinary Bayes classifier can be applied to solve multiclass cases. The experimental results verify that the classifier correctly detects 1) multiclass targets, and 2) targets in the incomplete case, in which the target is not properly extracted.

Automatic Text Categorization of Marathi Documents Using Clustering Technique	2013 15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES (ICACT)			English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Advanced Computing Technologies (ICACT)	SEP 21-22, 2013	Rajampet, INDIA	IEEE		Text categorization; Clustering; Information filtering; Internet search; Information retrieval		The purpose of the present work is creating an intelligent system to retrieve desired documents in Marathi language. The system also focuses on providing the personalized documents in Marathi language to the end user based on their interests identified from the browsing history. This paper presents the automatic categorization of Marathi documents and the literature survey of the related work done in automatic categorization of text documents. Several supervised learning techniques are exists for the classification of text documents namely Decision trees, Support Vector machine (SVM), Neural Network, Ada Boost and Naive Bayes etc. Several clustering techniques are also available for text categorization namely K-means, Suffix Tree Clustering (STC), Semantic Online Hierarchical Clustering (SHOC), Label Induction Grouping Algorithm (LINGO) etc. In the literature survey it is found that vector space model (VSM) gives better result than probabilistic model. This paper presents categorization of the Marathi text documents using Lingo Clustering algorithm based on VSM. The data set consists of 107 Marathi documents of 3 different categories- Tourism, Health Programmes and Maharashtra festivals. The result shows that the performance of the LINGO clustering algorithm is good for categorizing the Marathi text documents. For the Marathi documents overall accuracy of the system is 91.10%.

Some of these tools, which target the organization and extraction of useful knowledge from this huge amount of data, rely on machine learning and data or text mining techniques, specifically automatic document classification algorithms. However, these algorithms are still a computational challenge because of the volume of data that needs to be processed. Some of the strategies available to address this challenge are based on the parallelization of ADC algorithms. In this work, we present GPU-NB, a parallel version of one of the most widely used document classification algorithms, the Naive Bayes, that uses graphics processing units (GPUs). In our evaluation using 6 different document collections, we show that the GPU-NB can maintain the same classification effectiveness (in most cases) while increasing the efficiency by up to 34x faster than its sequential version using CPU. GPU-NB is also up to 11x faster than a CPU-based parallel implementation of Naive Bayes running with 4 threads. Moreover, assuming an optimistic behavior of the CPU parallelization, GPU-NB should outperform the CPU-based implementation with up to 32 cores, at a small fraction of the cost. We also show that the efficiency of the GPU-NB parallelization is impacted by features of the document collections, particularly the number of classes, although the density of the collection (average number of occurrences of terms per document) has a significant impact as well.

Sample covariance matrix estimation has been studied recently and a number of solutions are proposed for such problem. Naive Bayes approach assumes that the covariates are independent in high dimensional settings and showed that this assumption theoretically results in high classification accuracy. Here, we study the performance of other covariance estimators when the sparseness is not assumed to be huge, which comes at some computational cost compared to naive Bayes. Our study shows that in some cases, we might gain by taking a covariance matrix with controlled sparseness. Then, we cast the covariance selection problem into the framework of empirical risk minimization, and propose the supervised covariance learning which uses the labels information in covariance matrix selection. The empirical results show that the use of controlled sparseness and labels information improves the classification accuracy compared to the naive Bayes.

Although machine learning methods have been successfully used with biological sequences in a supervised framework, their accuracy usually suffers when a classifier is learned on a source domain and applied to a different, less studied domain, in a domain adaptation framework. To address this issue, we propose to use an algorithm that combines labeled sequences from a well studied organism, the source domain, with labeled and unlabeled sequences from a related, less studied organism, the target domain. Our experimental results show that this algorithm has high classifying accuracy on the target domain.

Data Mining based Methodologies for Cardiac Risk Patterns Identification	BIOINFORMATICS 2013: PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS MODELS, METHODS AND ALGORITHMS			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Bioinformatics Models, Methods and Algorithms (BIOINFORMATICS)	FEB 11-14, 2013	Barcelona, SPAIN	Inst Syst & Technologies Informat, Control & Commun, Biomed Engn Soc, European Soc Engn & Med, Assoc Advancement Artificial Intelligence, Univ Vic		Data Mining; Artificial Neural Network; Clustering; Arterial Distension Waveform; Cardiovascular Diseases	SYSTEM	Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death in the world. The pulse wave analysis provides a new insight in the analysis of these pathologies, while data mining techniques can contribute for an efficient diagnostic method. Amongst the various available techniques, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are well established in biomedical applications and have numerous successful classification applications. Also, clustering procedures have proven to be very useful in assessing different risk groups in terms of cardiovascular function in healthy populations. In this paper, a robust data mining approach was performed for cardiac risk patterns identification. Eight classifiers were tested: C4.5, Random Forest, RIPPER, Naive Bayes, Bayesian Network, Multy-layer perceptron (MLP) (1 and 2-hidden layers) and radial basis function (RBF). As for clustering procedures, k-means clustering (using Euclidean distance) and expectation-maximization (EM) were the chosen algorithms. Two datasets were used as case studies to perform classification and clustering analysis. The accuracy values are good with intervals between 88.05% and 97.15%. The clustering techniques were essential in the analysis of a dataset where little information was available, allowing the identification of different clusters that represent different risk group in terms cardiovascular function. The three cluster analysis has allowed the characterization of distinctive features for each of the clusters. Reflected wave time (T_RP) and systolic wave time (T_SP) were the selected features for clusters visualization. Data mining methodologies have proven their usefulness in screening studies due to its descriptive and predictive power.	[Almeidal, V. G.; Borba, J.; Pereira, T.; Pereira, H.

To evaluate the power of ultrasounds to help in the lesions diagnosis, first some phantoms were developed trying mimicking the human skin tissue. Thus, several gelatin-based phantoms have been constructed with scattering agents as flour, starch and glass microspheres. Then, A-Scan lines were extracted using the pulse echo approach, followed by the ultrasound velocity. The obtained results for the considered acoustical parameter present good concordance with the ones found in literature. Methodologies were developed to analyze the using phantoms and human images with and without lesions. Two approaches were considered: (1) the identification of the superficial skin boundary working as a skin lesion discriminator, (2) and binary classification, characterizing the presence/absence of lesions, using several regions of interest by the Support Vector Machine and the Naive Bayes classifiers.

Immune profiling with a Salmonella Typhi antigen microarray identifies new diagnostic biomarkers of human typhoid	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PROTEIN MICROARRAY; FRANCISELLA-TULARENSIS; ANTIBODY-RESPONSES; PARATYPHOID FEVER; PREDICTION; DISCOVERY; SIGNATURE; CHILDREN; REVEALS; VIETNAM	Current serological diagnostic assays for typhoid fever are based on detecting antibodies against Salmonella LPS or flagellum, resulting in a high false-positive rate. Here we used a protein microarray containing 2,724 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi antigens (>63% of proteome) and identified antibodies against 16 IgG antigens and 77 IgM antigens that were differentially reactive among acute typhoid patients and healthy controls. The IgG target antigens produced a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 80%, whereas the IgM target antigens produced 97% and 91% sensitivity and specificity, respectively. Our analyses indicated certain features such as membrane association, secretion, and protein expression were significant enriching features of the reactive antigens. About 72% of the serodiagnostic antigens were within the top 25% of the ranked antigen list using a Naive bayes classifier. These data provide an important resource for improved diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccine development against an important human pathogen.

J	Li, FF; Li, C; Xiao, BL; Wang, YZ				Li, Fangfang; Li, Chang; Xiao, Benlin; Wang, Yanzhen			Mapping large-scale distribution and changes of aquatic vegetation in Honghu Lake, China, using multitemporal satellite imagery	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						shallow lake; aquatic vegetation; change detection; polar coordinate map	RADAR BACKSCATTER; BIOMASS; MACROPHYTES; WETLANDS; CLARITY; JERS-1; WATERS	Honghu Lake, one of the seven largest fresh-water lakes in China, is well known for its ecological and economic importance, as well as its rapid changes in recent years. This study investigates the potential of using remote sensing to map and monitor aquatic vegetation changes in Honghu Lake on a large scale. Landsat TM/ETM+ images dated July 27, 2000, July 9, 2002, and July 17, 2008, and CBERS image dated August 12, 2005, are employed to map the aquatic vegetation distribution in the lake. A hybrid classification method, combining the power of the decision tree classifier, naive Bayes classifier, and supporting vector machine classifier is used to distinguish different wetland types. A novel polar coordinate map method is proposed to map the changes of aquatic vegetation on a large scale. The map demonstrates vegetation patch size changes and percentage changes in the whole lake directions during four periods. Validation using in situ surveys and historical ancillary data suggests that this approach could map the distribution and monitor the changes of aquatic vegetation on a large scale efficiently.

J	Moraes, R; Valiati, JF; Neto, WPG				Moraes, Rodrigo; Valiati, Joao Francisco; Gaviao Neto, Wilson P.			Document-level sentiment classification: An empirical comparison between SVM and ANN	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Sentiment classification; Opinion mining; Text classification; Artificial Neural Networks; Support Vector Machines; Comparative study	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; FEEDFORWARD NEURAL-NETWORKS; ALGORITHM; REVIEWS	Document-level sentiment classification aims to automate the task of classifying a textual review, which is given on a single topic, as expressing a positive or negative sentiment. In general, supervised methods consist of two stages: (i) extraction/selection of informative features and (ii) classification of reviews by using learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB). SVM have been extensively and successfully used as a sentiment learning approach while Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have rarely been considered in comparative studies in the sentiment analysis literature. This paper presents an empirical comparison between SVM and ANN regarding document-level sentiment analysis. We discuss requirements, resulting models and contexts in which both approaches achieve better levels of classification accuracy. We adopt a standard evaluation context with popular supervised methods for feature selection and weighting in a traditional bag-of-words model. Except for some unbalanced data contexts, our experiments indicated that ANN produce superior or at least comparable results to SVM's. Specially on the benchmark dataset of Movies reviews, ANN outperformed SVM by a statistically significant difference, even on the context of unbalanced data. Our results have also confirmed some potential limitations of both models, which have been rarely discussed in the sentiment classification literature, like the computational cost of SVM at the running time and ANN at the training time.

The recognition of MAs is an essential step in the diagnosis and grading of diabetic retinopathy. The proposed method realizes MA detection through the analysis of directional cross-section profiles centered on the local maximum pixels of the preprocessed image. Peak detection is applied on each profile, and a set of attributes regarding the size, height, and shape of the peak are calculated subsequently. The statistical measures of these attribute values as the orientation of the cross-section changes constitute the feature set that is used in a naive Bayes classification to exclude spurious candidates. We give a formula for the final score of the remaining candidates, which can be thresholded further for a binary output. The proposed method has been tested in the Retinopathy Online Challenge, where it proved to be competitive with the state-of-the-art approaches. We also present the experimental results for a private image set using the same classifier setup.

J	Dejaeger, K; Verbraken, T; Baesens, B				Dejaeger, Karel; Verbraken, Thomas; Baesens, Bart			Toward Comprehensible Software Fault Prediction Models Using Bayesian Network Classifiers	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Software fault prediction; Bayesian networks; classification; comprehensibility	KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; LEARNING ALGORITHM; DEFECT PREDICTION; METRICS; CLASSIFICATION; CRITIQUE; INDUCTION; SELECTION; MODULES; SYSTEMS	Software testing is a crucial activity during software development and fault prediction models assist practitioners herein by providing an upfront identification of faulty software code by drawing upon the machine learning literature. While especially the Naive Bayes classifier is often applied in this regard, citing predictive performance and comprehensibility as its major strengths, a number of alternative Bayesian algorithms that boost the possibility of constructing simpler networks with fewer nodes and arcs remain unexplored. This study contributes to the literature by considering 15 different Bayesian Network (BN) classifiers and comparing them to other popular machine learning techniques. Furthermore, the applicability of the Markov blanket principle for feature selection, which is a natural extension to BN theory, is investigated. The results, both in terms of the AUC and the recently introduced H-measure, are rigorously tested using the statistical framework of Demsar. It is concluded that simple and comprehensible networks with less nodes can be constructed using BN classifiers other than the Naive Bayes classifier. Furthermore, it is found that the aspects of comprehensibility and predictive performance need to be balanced out, and also the development context is an item which should be taken into account during model selection.

The online algorithms try not to remember irrelevant information instead of synthesizing all available information (as opposed to classic batch learning algorithms). In this study, we attempted to increase the prediction accuracy of an incremental version of Naive Bayes model by integrating instance based learning. We performed a large-scale comparison of the proposed method with other state-of-the-art algorithms on several datasets and the proposed method produce better accuracy in most cases.

Models can be a useful support for decision making and may reduce the total cost of care. The objective of this study was to propose and evaluate a procedure to develop a simple locally customized decision-support system. Methods We analysed 3182 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the University Hospital of Siena, Italy. Univariate statistical tests were performed to identify a set of preoperative and intraoperative variables as likely independent features for planning transfusion quantities. These features were utilized to design a naive Bayes classifier. Model performance was evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation approach. All computations were done using spss and matlab code. Results The overall correct classification percentage was not particularly high if several classes of patients were to be identified. Model performance improved appreciably when the patient sample was divided into two classes (transfused and non-transfused patients). In this case the naive Bayes model correctly classified about three quarters of patients with 71.2% sensitivity and 78.4% specificity, thus providing useful information for recognizing patients with transfusion requirements in the specific scenario considered. Conclusions Although the classifier is customized to a particular setting and cannot be generalized to other scenarios, the simplicity of its development and the results obtained make it a promising approach for designing a simple model for different heart surgery centres needing a customized decision-support system for planning transfusion requirements in intensive care unit.

This procedure is based on the application of a naive Bayes statistical classifier comprising the use of several descriptors. The class frontiers can be depicted so that the proportion of identified regions may be measured. To demonstrate the results, assembly of an RGB image, where each plane (R, G, and B) is associated with a particular region (class), was labeled according to its biospeckle dynamics. A high brightness in one color means a high probability of the pixel belonging to the corresponding class, and vice versa.

J	Hummel, KA; Hess, A				Hummel, Karin Anna; Hess, Andrea			Movement activity estimation and forwarding effects for opportunistic networking based on urban mobility traces	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article						mobility modeling; movement activity classification; opportunistic networking	MODEL	Opportunistic, mobility-assisted, or encounter networking is a method based on ad hoc networking and introduced to disseminate data in a store-and-forward manner by means of spontaneously connecting mobile devices. Although, in many networked systems, mobility is treated as a challenge requiring additional management, in opportunistic networks, movement facilitates networking as it creates additional contacts between devices. These new networking opportunities can be exploited in addition to traditional wireless infrastructure networks or in absence of these networks. Hereby, algorithms for opportunistic data dissemination make use of information about social ties, regularities in movement, and the future path of mobile entities. The availability of this information is reasonable for areas such as campuses or conference venues, where social or professional ties are strong or when traveling by, for example, public transport lines or vehicles following a navigation system. Other movement activities of humans in larger areas often lack this information, and new techniques are required to derive similar useful movement information. By observing movement characteristics of network users such as average velocities or revisiting patterns, estimates about the likelihood of getting in contact with other devices can be estimated. Our approach goes one step further by introducing users' movement activities derived from movement patterns typical in, for example, tourist movement, shopping activities, or evening activities. Movement activities are notions summarizing a particular movement situation that is meaningful to users and can be used to further estimate user needs and user-generated network traffic. In case movement patterns are uncertain or fragmentary, knowledge about activities may help to faster estimate average movement characteristics. The main objective of this paper is to detail the approach of relating activities to observed multivariate mobility characteristics on the basis of the Naive Bayes classifier. The approach is applied to four typical urban movement use case activities including pedestrian and vehicular movement. Results are presented on the basis of two different experimental training sets consisting of GPS outdoor traces: first, a training set of emulated movement activities and, second, a training set consisting of labeled real-world daily activities over one month tracked by volunteers. The results of the classification study confirm that movement can be characterized as proposed. By using mobility activities and corresponding distributions of movement characteristics, the impact of activities on opportunistic forwarding performance in terms of contact and inter-contact time, forwarding distance and coverage of an area, and predictability of the future path of a moving device is investigated.

The relational Naive Bayes classifier exploits independence assumptions to achieve scalability. We introduce a weaker independence assumption to the effect that information from different data tables is independent given the class label. The independence assumption entails a closed-form formula for combining probabilistic predictions based on decision trees learned on different database tables. Logistic regression learns different weights for information from different tables and prunes irrelevant tables. In experiments, learning was very fast with competitive accuracy.

J	Kurtcephe, M; Guvenir, HA				Kurtcephe, Murat; Guvenir, H. Altay			A DISCRETIZATION METHOD BASED ON MAXIMIZING THE AREA UNDER RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Data mining; discretization; area under ROC curve	ROC CURVE; ATTRIBUTES; CLASSIFICATION	Many machine learning algorithms require the features to be categorical. Hence, they require all numeric-valued data to be discretized into intervals. In this paper, we present a new discretization method based on the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) Curve (AUC) measure. Maximum area under ROC curve-based discretization (MAD) is a global, static and supervised discretization method. MAD uses the sorted order of the continuous values of a feature and discretizes the feature in such a way that the AUC based on that feature is to be maximized. The proposed method is compared with alternative discretization methods such as ChiMerge, Entropy-Minimum Description Length Principle (MDLP), Fixed Frequency Discretization (FFD), and Proportional Discretization (PD). FFD and PD have been recently proposed and are designed for Naive Bayes learning. ChiMerge is a merging discretization method as the MAD method. Evaluations are performed in terms of M-Measure, an AUC-based metric for multi-class classification, and accuracy values obtained from Naive Bayes and Aggregating One-Dependence Estimators (AODE) algorithms by using real-world datasets. Empirical results show that MAD is a strong candidate to be a good alternative to other discretization methods.	[Kurtcephe, Murat; Guvenir, H.

J	Tao, Q; Veldhuis, R				Tao, Qian; Veldhuis, Raymond			Robust Biometric Score Fusion by Naive Likelihood Ratio via Receiver Operating Characteristics	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY			English	Article						Biometric fusion; logarithm likelihood ratio; Naive Bayes classifier; ROC	LEVEL FUSION; COMBINING CLASSIFIERS; VERIFICATION; FACE; QUALITY; SYSTEMS	This paper presents a novelmethod of fusing multiple biometrics on the matching score level. We estimate the likelihood ratios of the fused biometric scores, via individual receiver operating characteristics (ROC) which construct the Naive Bayes classifier. Using a limited number of operation points on the ROC, we are able to realize reliable and robust estimation of the Naive Bayes probability without explicit estimation of the genuine and impostor score distributions. Different from previous work, the method takes into consideration a particular characteristic of the matching score: its quantitative value is already an indication of the sample's likelihood of being genuine. This characteristic is integrated into the proposed method to improve the fusion performance while reducing the inherent algorithmic complexity. We demonstrate by experiments that the proposed method is reliable and robust, suitable for a wide range of matching score distributions in realistic data and public databases.

For this purpose, the detection of relevant peakbins in MS data is currently under intense research. Data from mass spectrometry are challenging to analyze because of their high dimensionality and the generally low number of samples available. To tackle this problem, the scientific community is becoming increasingly interested in applying feature subset selection techniques based on specialized machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we present a performance comparison of some metaheuristics: best first (BF), genetic algorithm (GA), scatter search (SS) and variable neighborhood search (VNS). Up to now, all the algorithms, except for GA, have been first applied to detect relevant peakbins in MS data. All these metaheuristic searches are embedded in two different filter and wrapper schemes coupled with Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Rodriguez, JD; Perez, A; Lozano, JA				Rodriguez, Juan D.; Perez, Aritz; Lozano, Jose A.			A general framework for the statistical analysis of the sources of variance for classification error estimators	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Supervised classification; Error estimation; Prediction error; Sensitivity analysis; Sources of variance; Model selection	FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION; MULTIPLE DATA SETS; DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS; RATES; CLASSIFIERS	Estimating the prediction error of classifiers induced by supervised learning algorithms is important not only to predict its future error, but also to choose a classifier from a given set (model selection). If the goal is to estimate the prediction error of a particular classifier, the desired estimator should have low bias and low variance. However, if the goal is the model selection, in order to make fair comparisons the chosen estimator should have low variance assuming that the bias term is independent from the considered classifier. This paper follows the analysis proposed in [1] about the statistical properties of k-fold cross-validation estimators and extends it to the most popular error estimators: resubstitution, holdout, repeated holdout, simple bootstrap and 0.632 bootstrap estimators, without and with stratification. We present a general framework to analyze the decomposition of the variance of different error estimators considering the nature of the variance (irreducible/reducible variance) and the different sources of sensitivity (internal/external sensitivity). An extensive empirical study has been performed for the previously mentioned estimators with naive Bayes and C4.5 classifiers over training sets obtained from assorted probability distributions. The empirical analysis consists of decomposing the variances following the proposed framework and checking the independence assumption between the bias and the considered classifier. Based on the obtained results, we propose the most appropriate error estimations for model selection under different experimental conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Comparison of binary discrimination methods for high dimension low sample size data	JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Asymptotic analysis; Binary discrimination; High dimensional data; Machine learning	DISTANCE-WEIGHTED DISCRIMINATION	A comparison of some binary discrimination methods is done in the high dimension low sample size context for Gaussian data with common diagonal covariance matrix. In particular we obtain results about the asymptotic behavior of the methods Support Vector Machine, Mean Difference (i.e. Centroid Rule), Distance Weighted Discrimination, Maximal Data Piling and Naive Bayes when the dimension d of the data sets tends to infinity and the sample sizes of the classes are fixed. It is concluded that, under appropriate conditions, the first four methods are asymptotically equivalent, but the Naive Bayes method can have a different asymptotic behavior when d tends to infinity.

This was done for a database, obtained from a large Korean mobile telephone service provider, of 533 customer calls to call centers in 2009. After eliminating calls not containing customer complaints or comments, the remaining 383 comments were classified by an expert panel into four domains and 27 complaint categories. The four domains were Transaction-related (189 comments, 49%), Product-related (120 comments, 31%), Customer Service or Support-related (38 comments, 10%) and Customer Outreach and Marketing-related (36 comments, 9%). The comments were then randomly assigned to either a training set (257 cases, 67%) or test set (126 cases, 33%). The training set was used to develop a Naive Bayes classifier that correctly predicted the domain 75% of the time and the specific subcategory 51% of the time for the test set. Prediction accuracy was strongly related to prediction strength for both sets of predictions, suggesting that simple filtering strategies where difficult to understand comments are flagged for expert review and easy comments are automatically classified are both technically feasible and likely to be practically valuable. Several strong predictors were also identified that corresponded to categories more detailed than those originally assigned. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Most modeling techniques have been designed with a static data model in mind and are not suitable for coping with the dynamic nature of time series. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are often used to process time series, but only a few training algorithms exist for RNNs which are complex and often yield poor results. Therefore, researchers often turn to traditional machine learning approaches, such as support vector machines (SVMs), which can easily be set up and trained and combine them with feature extraction (FE) and selection (FS) to process the high-dimensional temporal data. Recently, a new approach, called echo state networks (ESNs), has been developed to simplify the training process of RNNs. This approach allows modeling the dynamics of a system based on time series data in a straightforward way. The objective of this study is to explore the advantages of using ESN instead of other traditional classifiers combined with FE and FS in classification problems in the intensive care unit (ICU) when the input data consists of time series. While ESNs have mostly been used to predict the future course of a time series, we use the ESN model for classification instead. Although time series often appear in medical data, little medical applications of ESNs have been studied yet. Methods and material: ESN is used to predict the need for dialysis between the fifth and tenth day after admission in the ICU. The input time series consist of measured diuresis and creatinine values during the first 3 days after admission. Data about 830 patients was used for the study, of which 82 needed dialysis between the fifth and tenth day after admission. ESN is compared to traditional classifiers, a sophisticated and a simple one, namely support vector machines and the naive Bayes (NB) classifier. Prior to the use of the SVM and NB classifier, FE and FS is required to reduce the number of input features and thus alleviate the curse dimensionality. Extensive feature extraction was applied to capture both the overall properties of the time series and the correlation between the different measurements in the time series. The feature selection method consists of a greedy hybrid filter-wrapper method using a NB classifier, which selects in each iteration the feature that improves prediction the best and shows little multicollinearity with the already selected set. Least squares regression with noise was used to train the linear readout function of the ESN to mitigate sensitivity to noise and overfitting. Fisher labeling was used to deal with the unbalanced data set. Parameter sweeps were performed to determine the optimal parameter values for the different classifiers. The area under the curve (AUC) and maximum balanced accuracy are used as performance measures. The required execution time was also measured. Results: The classification performance of the ESN shows significant difference at the 5% level compared to the performance of the SVM or the NB classifier combined with FE and FS. The NB+FE+FS, with an average AUC of 0.874, has the best classification performance. This classifier is followed by the ESN, which has an average AUC of 0.849. The SVM+ FE+FS has the worst performance with an average AUC of 0.838. The computation time needed to pre-process the data and to train and test the classifier is significantly less for the ESN compared to the SVM and NB. Conclusion: It can be concluded that the use of ESN has an added value in predicting the need for dialysis through the analysis of time series data. The ESN requires significantly less processing time, needs no domain knowledge, is easy to implement, and can be configured using rules of thumb. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This confidence estimation provides a diagnosis module with precise reported information to quickly identify the origin of equipment failure. We studied the factors affecting CLFI, such as measurement system reliability, production context, position of sensors in the acquisition chains, type of products, reference metrology, preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance based on historical data and feedback information generated by production equipments. We introduced the new 'CLFI' concept based on the Dynamic Bayesian Network approach and Tree Augmented Naive Bayes model. Our contribution includes an on-line confidence computation module for production equipment data, and an algorithm to compute CLFI. We suggest it to be applied to the semiconductor manufacturing industry. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Two significant phases are usually involved in object recognition. The first phase is the object representation phase, in which the most suitable features that provide the best discriminative power under constraints such as lighting, resolution, scale, and view variations are chosen to describe the objects. The second phase is to use this representation space to develop models for each object class using discriminative classifiers. In this paper, we focus on composite objects, i.e., objects with two or more simpler classes that are interconnected in a complicated manner. One classic example of such a scenario is a bicyclist. A bicyclist consists of a bicycle and a human who rides the bicycle. When we are faced with the task of classifying bicyclists and pedestrians, it is counterintuitive and often hard to come up with a discriminative classifier to distinguish the two classes. We explore global image analysis based on bag of visual words to compare the results with local image analysis, in which we attempt to distinguish the individual parts of the composite object. We also propose a unified naive Bayes framework and a combined histogram feature method for combining the individual classifiers for enhanced performance.

Sensitivity and specificity of machine learning classifiers for glaucoma diagnosis using Spectral Domain OCT and standard automated perimetry	ARQUIVOS BRASILEIROS DE OFTALMOLOGIA			English	Article						Glaucoma/diagnosis; Diagnostic techniques, ophthalmological/classification; Tomography; optical coherence/instrumentation; Sensitivity and specificity	NERVE-FIBER LAYER; OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY; HEIDELBERG RETINA TOMOGRAPH; RELEVANCE VECTOR MACHINE; VISUAL-FIELD; STRATUS OCT; EYES; THICKNESS; ACCURACY	Purpose: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of machine learning classifiers (MLCs) for glaucoma diagnosis using Spectral Domain OCT (SD-OCT) and standard automated perimetry (SAP). Methods: Observational cross-sectional study. Sixty two glaucoma patients and 48 healthy individuals were included. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination, achromatic standard automated perimetry (SAP) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) imaging with SD-OCT (Cirrus HD-OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc., Dublin, California). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were obtained for all SD-OCT parameters and global indices of SAP. Subsequently, the following MLCs were tested using parameters from the SD-OCT and SAP: Bagging (BAG), Naive-Bayes (NB), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), Random Forest (RAN), Ensemble Selection (ENS), Classification Tree (CTREE), Ada Boost M1(ADA), Support Vector Machine Linear (SVML) and Support Vector Machine Gaussian (SVMG). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (aROC) obtained for isolated SAP and OCT parameters were compared with MLCs using OCT+SAP data. Results: Combining OCT and SAP data, MLCs' aROCs varied from 0.777(CTREE) to 0.946 (RAN). The best OCT+SAP aROC obtained with RAN (0.946) was significantly larger the best single OCT parameter (p<0.05), but was not significantly different from the aROC obtained with the best single SAP parameter (p=0.19). Conclusion: Machine learning classifiers trained on OCT and SAP data can successfully discriminate between healthy and glaucomatous eyes. The combination of OCT and SAP measurements improved the diagnostic accuracy compared with OCT data alone.

Exploratory Analysis of Methods for Automated Classification of Laboratory Test Orders into Syndromic Groups in Veterinary Medicine	PLOS ONE			English	Article							OUTBREAK DETECTION; SURVEILLANCE; BIOTERRORISM; DISEASES	Background: Recent focus on earlier detection of pathogen introduction in human and animal populations has led to the development of surveillance systems based on automated monitoring of health data. Real-or near real-time monitoring of pre-diagnostic data requires automated classification of records into syndromes-syndromic surveillance-using algorithms that incorporate medical knowledge in a reliable and efficient way, while remaining comprehensible to end users. Methods: This paper describes the application of two of machine learning (Naive Bayes and Decision Trees) and rule-based methods to extract syndromic information from laboratory test requests submitted to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory. Results: High performance (F-1-macro = 0.9995) was achieved through the use of a rule-based syndrome classifier, based on rule induction followed by manual modification during the construction phase, which also resulted in clear interpretability of the resulting classification process. An unmodified rule induction algorithm achieved an F1-micro score of 0.979 though this fell to 0.677 when performance for individual classes was averaged in an unweighted manner (F1-macro), due to the fact that the algorithm failed to learn 3 of the 16 classes from the training set. Decision Trees showed equal interpretability to the rule-based approaches, but achieved an F1-micro score of 0.923 (falling to 0.311 when classes are given equal weight). A Naive Bayes classifier learned all classes and achieved high performance (F1-micro = 0.994 and F1-macro = .955), however the classification process is not transparent to the domain experts. Conclusion: The use of a manually customised rule set allowed for the development of a system for classification of laboratory tests into syndromic groups with very high performance, and high interpretability by the domain experts. Further research is required to develop internal validation rules in order to establish automated methods to update model rules without user input.	[Dorea, Fernanda C.; McClure, J.

Our purpose is to suggest the model frame to describe possibility of exposure with low-dose VOC chemicals for long time under normal circumstances at working place. Forensic rhetoric terms, non-exclusion exposure suspicion (NES) and exclusion exposure suspicion (EES), were defined and various statistical methods were combined basis of Bayesian approach. Decision-tree (DT) methods of linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and naive Bayes model were evaluated to classify 3 VOCs (toluene, xylene, and ehtybenzene) by means of the results of urinary test, gene expression and methylation expression experiments. Overall procedure is conducted by leave-one-out cross-validation that error rate of NES resulted in 11%.

J	Vinh, NX; Bailey, J				Vinh, Nguyen X.; Bailey, James			Comments on supervised feature selection by clustering using conditional mutual information-based distances	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Feature selection; Conditional mutual information; Mutual information properties; Clustering; Classification; Naive Bayes classifier		Supervised feature selection is an important problem in pattern recognition. Of the many methods introduced, those based on the mutual information and conditional mutual information measures are among the most widely adopted approaches. In this paper, we re-analyze an interesting paper on this topic recently published by Sotoca and Pla (Pattern Recognition, Vol. 43 Issue 6, June, 2010, pp. 2068-2081). In that work, a method for supervised feature selection based on clustering the features into groups is proposed, using a conditional mutual information based distance measure. The clustering procedure minimizes the objective function named the minimal relevant redundancy-mRR criterion. It is proposed that this objective function is the upper bound of the information loss when the full set of features is replaced by a smaller subset. We have found that their proof for this proposition is based on certain erroneous assumptions, and that the proposition itself is not true in general. In order to remedy the reported work, we characterize the specific conditions under which the assumptions used in the proof, and hence the proposition, hold true. It is our finding that there is a reasonable condition, namely when all features are independent given the class variable (as assumed by the popular naive Bayes classifier), under which the assumptions as required by Sotoca and Pla's framework hold true.

J	Sang, Y; Jin, YW; Li, KQ; Qi, H				Sang, Yu; Jin, Yingwei; Li, Keqiu; Qi, Heng			UniDis: a universal discretization technique	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Discretization; Inconsistency; Entropy; J4.8 decision tree; Naive Bayes classifier	CONTINUOUS ATTRIBUTES; ALGORITHM; SELECTION; MODEL; SETS	Discretization techniques have played an important role in machine learning and data mining as most methods in such areas require that the training data set contains only discrete attributes. Data discretization unification (DDU), one of the state-of-the-art discretization techniques, trades off classification errors and the number of discretized intervals, and unifies existing discretization criteria. However, it suffers from two deficiencies. First, the efficiency of DDU is very low as it conducts a large number of parameters to search good results, which does not still guarantee to obtain an optimal solution. Second, DDU does not take into account the number of inconsistent records produced by discretization, which leads to unnecessary information loss. To overcome the above deficiencies, this paper presents a Uni versal Dis cretization technique, namely UniDis. We first develop a non-parametric normalized discretization criteria which avoids the effect of relatively large difference between classification errors and the number of discretized intervals on discretization results. In addition, we define a new entropy-based measure of inconsistency for multi-dimensional variables to effectively control information loss while producing a concise summarization of continuous variables. Finally, we propose a heuristic algorithm to guarantee better discretization based on the non-parametric normalized discretization criteria and the entropy-based inconsistency. Besides theoretical analysis, experimental results demonstrate that our approach is statistically comparable to DDU evaluated by a popular statistical test and it yields a better discretization scheme which significantly improves the accuracy of classification than previously other known discretization methods except for DDU by running J4.8 decision tree and Naive Bayes classifier.

James, Jr.; Akella, Ram; Kim, Sunghun			Reducing Features to Improve Code Change-Based Bug Prediction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Reliability; bug prediction; machine learning; feature selection	PRONE SOFTWARE MODULES; SELECTION TECHNIQUES; DEFECT PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; METRICS; FAULTS	Machine learning classifiers have recently emerged as a way to predict the introduction of bugs in changes made to source code files. The classifier is first trained on software history, and then used to predict if an impending change causes a bug. Drawbacks of existing classifier-based bug prediction techniques are insufficient performance for practical use and slow prediction times due to a large number of machine learned features. This paper investigates multiple feature selection techniques that are generally applicable to classification-based bug prediction methods. The techniques discard less important features until optimal classification performance is reached. The total number of features used for training is substantially reduced, often to less than 10 percent of the original. The performance of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers when using this technique is characterized on 11 software projects. Naive Bayes using feature selection provides significant improvement in buggy F-measure (21 percent improvement) over prior change classification bug prediction results (by the second and fourth authors [28]). The SVM's improvement in buggy F-measure is 9 percent. Interestingly, an analysis of performance for varying numbers of features shows that strong performance is achieved at even 1 percent of the original number of features.

Activity logging using lightweight classification techniques in mobile devices	PERSONAL AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING			English	Article						Activity recognition; Life logging; Pattern recognition; Context awareness; Mobile application; Personal health	ACTIVITY RECOGNITION; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; PHONE	Automated activity recognition enables a wide variety of applications related to child and elderly care, disease diagnosis and treatment, personal health or sports training, for which it is key to seamlessly determine and log the user's motion. This work focuses on exploring the use of smartphones to perform activity recognition without interfering in the user's lifestyle. Thus, we study how to build an activity recognition system to be continuously executed in a mobile device in background mode. The system relies on device's sensing, processing and storing capabilities to estimate significant movements/postures (walking at different paces-slow, normal, rush, running, sitting, standing). In order to evaluate the combinations of sensors, features and algorithms, an activity dataset of 16 individuals has been gathered. The performance of a set of lightweight classifiers (Naive Bayes, Decision Table and Decision Tree) working on different sensor data has been fully evaluated and optimized in terms of accuracy, computational cost and memory fingerprint. Results have pointed out that a priori information on the relative position of the mobile device with respect to the user's body enhances the estimation accuracy. Results show that computational low-cost Decision Tables using the best set of features among mean and variance and considering all the sensors (acceleration, gravity, linear acceleration, magnetometer, gyroscope) may be enough to get an activity estimation accuracy of around 88 % (78 % is the accuracy of the Naive Bayes algorithm with the same characteristics used as a baseline). To demonstrate its applicability, the activity recognition system has been used to enable a mobile application to promote active lifestyles.

Features such as yellow, red, and far-red fluorescence at UV, blue, green, and red excitations, and other fluorescence ratios were acquired from the healthy and HLB-infected leaves of different cultivars. The classification studies were performed with these features as well as selective fluorescence features. Results indicated that the bagged decision tree classifier yielded 97% classification accuracy in case of the healthy and symptomatic samples. Although the asymptomatic samples from the HLB-infected trees could not be classified based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis results, the Naive-Bayes classifier grouped most of the asymptomatic samples as HLB. We found that a few fluorescence features such as yellow fluorescence (UV), far-red fluorescence (UV), yellow to far red fluorescence (UV), simple fluorescence ratio (green), and yellow fluorescence (green) could result in classification accuracies similar to those of the entire dataset.

Automatic detection of freezing of gait events in patients with Parkinson's disease	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Freezing of gait; Parkinson's disease; Classification	QUESTIONNAIRE; LEVODOPA; EPISODES; ONSET	The aim of this study is to detect freezing of gait (FoG) events in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) using signals received from wearable sensors (six accelerometers and two gyroscopes) placed on the patients' body. For this purpose, an automated methodology has been developed which consists of four stages. In the first stage, missing values due to signal loss or degradation are replaced and then (second stage) low frequency components of the raw signal are removed. In the third stage, the entropy of the raw signal is calculated. Finally (fourth stage), four classification algorithms have been tested (Naive Bayes, Random Forests, Decision Trees and Random Tree) in order to detect the FoG events. The methodology has been evaluated using several different configurations of sensors in order to conclude to the set of sensors which can produce optimal FoG episode detection. Signals recorded from five healthy subjects, five patients with PD who presented the symptom of FoG and six patients who suffered from PD but they do not present FoG events. The signals included 93 FoG events with 405.6 s total duration. The results indicate that the proposed methodology is able to detect FoG events with 81.94% sensitivity, 98.74% specificity, 96.11% accuracy and 98.6% area under curve (AUC) using the signals from all sensors and the Random Forests classification algorithm.

Based on functional images, which are subject to noise and segmentation/registration inaccuracies, regional heart motion analysis is acknowledged as a difficult problem and, therefore, incorporation of prior knowledge is desirable to enhance accuracy. Given noisy data and a nonlinear dynamic model to describe myocardial motion, an unscented Kalman smoother is proposed in this study to estimate the myocardial points. Due to the similarity between the statistical information of normal and abnormal heart motions, detecting and classifying abnormality is a challenging problem. We use the Shannon's differential entropy of the distributions of potential classifier features to detect and locate regional heart motion abnormality. A naive Bayes classifier algorithm is constructed from the Shannon's differential entropy of different features to automatically detect abnormal functional regions of the myocardium. Using 174 segmented short-axis magnetic resonance cines obtained from 58 subjects (21 normal and 37 abnormal), the proposed method is quantitatively evaluated by comparison with ground truth classifications by radiologists over 928 myocardial segments. The proposed method performed significantly better than other recent methods, and yielded an accuracy of 86.5% (base), 89.4% (mid-cavity) and 84.5% (apex). The overall classification accuracy was 87.1%. Furthermore, standard kappa statistic comparisons between the proposed method and visual wall motion scoring by radiologists showed that the proposed algorithm can yield a kappa measure of 0.73.

Nevertheless, extant methods to examine small-molecule interactions with plasma protein have various limitations, thus creating a need for alternative methods. Herein we present a comprehensive and cross-validated in silico workflow for the prediction of small-molecule binding to Human Serum Albumin (HSA), the most ubiquitous plasma protein. This protocol reliably predicts small-molecule interactions with HSA, including a binding affinity calculation using multiple linear regression methods, binding site prediction using a naive-Bayes classifier, and a three-dimensional binding pose using induced fit docking. Furthermore, this workflow is implemented in a portable and automated format that can be downloaded and used by other end users, either as is or with customization.

J	Mikulka, J; Gescheidtova, E; Kabrda, M; Perina, V				Mikulka, Jan; Gescheidtova, Eva; Kabrda, Miroslav; Perina, Vojtech			Classification of Jaw Bone Cysts and Necrosis via the Processing of Orthopantomograms	RADIOENGINEERING			English	Article						Image processing; image classification; follicular cyst; radicular cyst; live-wire; level set; OPG; RTG		The authors analyze the design of a method for automatized evaluation of parameters in orthopantomographic images capturing pathological tissues developed in human jaw bones. The main problem affecting the applied medical diagnostic procedures consists in low repeatability of the performed evaluation. This condition is caused by two aspects, namely subjective approach of the involved medical specialists and the related exclusion of image processing instruments from the evaluation scheme. The paper contains a description of the utilized database containing images of cystic jaw bones; this description is further complemented with appropriate schematic representation. Moreover, the authors present the results of fast automatized segmentation realized via the live-wire method and compare the obtained data with the results provided by other segmentation techniques. The shape parameters and the basic statistical quantities related to the distribution of intensities in the segmented areas are selected. The evaluation results are provided in the final section of the study; the authors correlate these values with the subjective assessment carried out by radiologists. Interestingly, the paper also comprises a discussion presenting the possibility of using selected parameters or their combinations to execute automatic classification of cysts and osteonecrosis. In this context, a comparison of various classifiers is performed, including the Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Neural Network, k-NN, SVM, and LDA classification tools. Within this comparison, the highest degree of accuracy (85% on the average) can be attributed to the Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Neural Network classifiers.

Allergens are small antigens that commonly provoke an IgE antibody response. There are two types of bioinformatics-based allergen prediction. The first approach follows FAO/WHO Codex alimentarius guidelines and searches for sequence similarity. The second approach is based on identifying conserved allergenicity-related linear motifs. Both approaches assume that allergenicity is a linearly coded property. In the present study, we applied ACC pre-processing to sets of known allergens, developing alignment-independent models for allergen recognition based on the main chemical properties of amino acid sequences. Results: A set of 684 food, 1,156 inhalant and 555 toxin allergens was collected from several databases. A set of non-allergens from the same species were selected to mirror the allergen set. The amino acids in the protein sequences were described by three z-descriptors (z(1), z(2) and z(3)) and by auto-and cross-covariance (ACC) transformation were converted into uniform vectors. Each protein was presented as a vector of 45 variables. Five machine learning methods for classification were applied in the study to derive models for allergen prediction. The methods were: discriminant analysis by partial least squares (DA-PLS), logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB) and k nearest neighbours (kNN). The best performing model was derived by kNN at k = 3. It was optimized, cross-validated and implemented in a server named AllerTOP, freely accessible at http://www.pharmfac.net/allertop. AllerTOP also predicts the most probable route of exposure. In comparison to other servers for allergen prediction, AllerTOP outperforms them with 94% sensitivity. Conclusions: AllerTOP is the first alignment-free server for in silico prediction of allergens based on the main physicochemical properties of proteins. Significantly, as well allergenicity AllerTOP is able to predict the route of allergen exposure: food, inhalant or toxin.

We propose the solutions to two different versions of the ensemble problem for each of the optimization frameworks. We hypothesize that the reliability of predictions of each classifier differs among the various output classes. Thus, in an ensemble system it is necessary to find out either the eligible classes for which a classifier is most suitable to vote (i.e., binary vote based ensemble) or to quantify the amount of voting for each class in a particular classifier (i.e., real vote based ensemble). We use seven diverse classifiers, namely Naive Bayes, Decision Tree (DT), Memory Based Learner (MBL), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Maximum Entropy (ME), Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to build a number of models depending upon the various representations of the available features that are identified and selected mostly without using any domain knowledge and/or language specific resources. The proposed technique is evaluated for three resource-constrained languages, namely Bengali, Hindi and Telugu. Results using multiobjective optimization (MOO) based technique yield the overall recall, precision and F-measure values of 94.21%, 94.72% and 94.74%, respectively for Bengali, 99.07%, 90.63% and 94.66%, respectively for Hindi and 82.79%, 95.18% and 88.55%, respectively for Telugu. Results for all the languages show that the proposed MOO based classifier ensemble with real voting attains the performance level which is superior to all the individual classifiers, three baseline ensembles and the corresponding single objective based ensemble.

Discretization of continuous features in clinical datasets	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							MODEL CONSTRUCTION; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; INFORMATICS; ASSOCIATION; VALIDATION; ALGORITHM; MEDICINE; NETWORK	Background The increasing availability of clinical data from electronic medical records (EMRs) has created opportunities for secondary uses of health information. When used in machine learning classification, many data features must first be transformed by discretization. Objective To evaluate six discretization strategies, both supervised and unsupervised, using EMR data. Materials and methods We classified laboratory data (arterial blood gas (ABG) measurements) and physiologic data (cardiac output (CO) measurements) derived from adult patients in the intensive care unit using decision trees and naive Bayes classifiers. Continuous features were partitioned using two supervised, and four unsupervised discretization strategies. The resulting classification accuracy was compared with that obtained with the original, continuous data. Results Supervised methods were more accurate and consistent than unsupervised, but tended to produce larger decision trees. Among the unsupervised methods, equal frequency and k-means performed well overall, while equal width was significantly less accurate. Discussion This is, we believe, the first dedicated evaluation of discretization strategies using EMR data. It is unlikely that any one discretization method applies universally to EMR data. Performance was influenced by the choice of class labels and, in the case of unsupervised methods, the number of intervals. In selecting the number of intervals there is generally a trade-off between greater accuracy and greater consistency. Conclusions In general, supervised methods yield higher accuracy, but are constrained to a single specific application. Unsupervised methods do not require class labels and can produce discretized data that can be used for multiple purposes.

Since the seminal work by Celermajer in flow-mediated dilation (FMD) based on B-mode ultrasound measurement of the brachial artery dilation following limb ischemia, many attempts have been made toward applying this method to clinical, non-invasive endothelial dysfunction assessment. One major obstacle toward achieving this objective has been the relative high cost of the required setup and skilled manpower. Such limitations have prompted the investigation of other non-invasively accessible signals such as the photoplethysmogram (PPG) in relation to FMD. It is in the above context that this paper proposes to use a modified version of an existing differential model of the human upper vasculature in order to discriminate between healthy and diabetic subjects. PPG from 46 subjects (23 healthy and 23 diabetic) were utilized to identify the model parameters. Once the model parameters were identified, singular value decomposition was applied to reduce the number of features and increase the separability. Finally, a naive Bayes classifier resulted in an overall accuracy of 93.5% (Spec. 87.0% and Sens. 100%). Taking into account subjects' gender further improved the overall accuracy. It is thought that the application of the proposed method to endothelial dysfunction assessment may positively impact the deployment of FMD in clinical settings.

LOCAL MODELS-THE KEY TO BOOSTING STABLE LEARNERS SUCCESSFULLY	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						boosting; local models; stable learners	VECTOR MACHINES; CLASSIFICATION; CLASSIFIERS; ALGORITHM; ADABOOST	Boosting has been shown to improve the predictive performance of unstable learners such as decision trees, but not of stable learners like Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors and Naive Bayes classifiers. In addition to the model stability problem, the high time complexity of some stable learners such as SVM prohibits them from generating multiple models to form an ensemble for large data sets. This paper introduces a simple method that not only enables Boosting to improve the predictive performance of stable learners, but also significantly reduces the computational time to generate an ensemble of stable learners such as SVM for large data sets that would otherwise be infeasible. The method proposes to build local models, instead of global models; and it is the first method, to the best of our knowledge, to solve the two problems in Boosting stable learners at the same time. We implement the method by using a decision tree to define local regions and build a local model for each local region. We show that this implementation of the proposed method enables successful Boosting of three types of stable learners: SVM, k-nearest neighbors and Naive Bayes classifiers.

A comparison of GP-based classification with classical classifiers including support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, and random forest is conducted. In addition, the use of GP in discovering small knowledge-preserving subsets of features in high-dimensional datasets of haptic-based signatures is investigated and several approaches are explored. Subsets of features extracted from GP-generated models (analytic functions) are also exploited to determine the importance and relevance of different haptic data types (e.g., force, position, torque, and orientation) in user identity verification. The results revealed that GP classifiers compare favorably with the classical methods and use a much fewer number of attributes (with simple function sets).

Experiments show that the proposed feature sets possess value in plant recognition when compared with other feature sets. Both methods approximate a distance distribution of an object, either by resampling or by approximation of the distribution with a high degree Legendre polynomial. In the latter case, the polynomial coefficients constitute a feature set. The methods have been tested through a discrimination process where two similar plant species are to be distinguished into their respective classes. The used performance assessment is based on the classification accuracy of 4 different classifiers (a k-Nearest Neighbor, Naive-Bayes, Linear Support Vector Machine, Nonlinear Support Vector Machine). Another set of 21 well-known shape features described in the literature is used for comparison. The used data consisted of 139 samples of cornflower (Centaura cyanus L.) and 63 samples of nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.). The highest discrimination accuracy was achieved with the Legendre Polynomial feature set and amounted to 97.5%. This feature set consisted of 10 numerical values. Another feature set consisting of 21 common features achieved an accuracy of 92.5%. The results suggest that the Legendre Polynomial feature set can compete with or outperform the commonly used feature sets.

Human Daily Activity Recognition With Sparse Representation Using Wearable Sensors	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Compressed sensing; human activity recognition; pervasive healthcare; sparse representation; wearable computing		Human daily activity recognition using mobile personal sensing technology plays a central role in the field of pervasive healthcare. One major challenge lies in the inherent complexity of human body movements and the variety of styles when people perform a certain activity. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we present a novel human activity recognition framework based on recently developed compressed sensing and sparse representation theory using wearable inertial sensors. Our approach represents human activity signals as a sparse linear combination of activity signals from all activity classes in the training set. The class membership of the activity signal is determined by solving a l(1) minimization problem. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of our sparse representation-based approach by recognizing nine most common human daily activities performed by 14 subjects. Our approach achieves a maximum recognition rate of 96.1%, which beats conventional methods based on nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, and support vector machine by as much as 6.7%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by using random projection, the task of looking for "optimal features" to achieve the best activity recognition performance is less important within our framework.

It can also be directly used to provide critical information on general tertiary structure of a protein which has a profound impact on protein function determination and drug design. Despite tremendous enhancements made by pattern recognition-based approaches to solve this problem, it still remains as an unsolved issue for bioinformatics that demands more attention and exploration. In this study, we propose a novel feature extraction model that incorporates physicochemical and evolutionary-based information simultaneously. We also propose overlapped segmented distribution and autocorrelation-based feature extraction methods to provide more local and global discriminatory information. The proposed feature extraction methods are explored for 15 most promising attributes that are selected from a wide range of physicochemical-based attributes. Finally, by applying an ensemble of different classifiers namely, Adaboost.M1, LogitBoost, naive Bayes, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM) we show enhancement of the protein structural class prediction accuracy for four popular benchmarks.

J	Sniezynski, B; Dajda, J				Sniezynski, Bartlomiej; Dajda, Jacek			Comparison of strategy learning methods in Farmer-Pest problem for various complexity environments without delays	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Multi-agent systems; Machine learning; Supervised learning; Reinforcement learning	RULE INDUCTION; GENERATION	In this paper effectiveness of several agent strategy learning algorithms is compared in a new multi-agent Farmer Pest learning environment. Learning is often utilized by multi-agent systems which can deal with complex problems by means of their decentralized approach. With a number of learning methods available, a need for their comparison arises. This is why we designed and implemented new multidimensional Farmer Pest problem domain, which is suitable for benchmarking learning algorithms. This paper presents comparison results for reinforcement learning (SARSA) and supervised learning (Naive Bayes, C4.5 and Ripper). These algorithms are tested on configurations with various complexity with not delayed rewards. The results show that algorithm performances depend highly on the environment configuration and various conditions favor different learning algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

EDSD Study Grp	Robust Automated Detection of Microstructural White Matter Degeneration in Alzheimer's Disease Using Machine Learning Classification of Multicenter DTI Data	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; DIFFUSION-TENSOR; DIAGNOSTIC UTILITY; TRACT INTEGRITY; WORK GROUP; BRAIN; MRI; DAMAGE; AD; BIOMARKERS	Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based assessment of white matter fiber tract integrity can support the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The use of DTI as a biomarker, however, depends on its applicability in a multicenter setting accounting for effects of different MRI scanners. We applied multivariate machine learning (ML) to a large multicenter sample from the recently created framework of the European DTI study on Dementia (EDSD). We hypothesized that ML approaches may amend effects of multicenter acquisition. We included a sample of 137 patients with clinically probable AD (MMSE 20.6 +/- 5.3) and 143 healthy elderly controls, scanned in nine different scanners. For diagnostic classification we used the DTI indices fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) and, for comparison, gray matter and white matter density maps from anatomical MRI. Data were classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier. We used two cross-validation approaches, (i) test and training samples randomly drawn from the entire data set (pooled cross-validation) and (ii) data from each scanner as test set, and the data from the remaining scanners as training set (scanner-specific cross-validation). In the pooled cross-validation, SVM achieved an accuracy of 80% for FA and 83% for MD. Accuracies for NB were significantly lower, ranging between 68% and 75%. Removing variance components arising from scanners using principal component analysis did not significantly change the classification results for both classifiers. For the scanner-specific cross-validation, the classification accuracy was reduced for both SVM and NB. After mean correction, classification accuracy reached a level comparable to the results obtained from the pooled cross-validation. Our findings support the notion that machine learning classification allows robust classification of DTI data sets arising from multiple scanners, even if a new data set comes from a scanner that was not part of the training sample.

GeneRIF indexing: sentence selection based on machine learning	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							BIOMEDICAL ARTICLES	Background: A Gene Reference Into Function (GeneRIF) describes novel functionality of genes. GeneRIFs are available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene database. GeneRIF indexing is performed manually, and the intention of our work is to provide methods to support creating the GeneRIF entries. The creation of GeneRIF entries involves the identification of the genes mentioned in MEDLINE (R) citations and the sentences describing a novel function. Results: We have compared several learning algorithms and several features extracted or derived from MEDLINE sentences to determine if a sentence should be selected for GeneRIF indexing. Features are derived from the sentences or using mechanisms to augment the information provided by them: assigning a discourse label using a previously trained model, for example. We show that machine learning approaches with specific feature combinations achieve results close to one of the annotators. We have evaluated different feature sets and learning algorithms. In particular, Naive Bayes achieves better performance with a selection of features similar to one used in related work, which considers the location of the sentence, the discourse of the sentence and the functional terminology in it. Conclusions: The current performance is at a level similar to human annotation and it shows that machine learning can be used to automate the task of sentence selection for GeneRIF annotation. The current experiments are limited to the human species. We would like to see how the methodology can be extended to other species, specifically the normalization of gene mentions in other species.

J	Ren, FJ; Kang, X				Ren, Fuji; Kang, Xin			Employing hierarchical Bayesian networks in simple and complex emotion topic analysis	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Emotion classification; Emotion topic model; Complex emotion; Hierarchical Bayesian network		Traditional emotion models, when tagging single emotions in documents, often ignore the fact that most documents convey complex human emotions. In this paper, we join emotion analysis with topic models to find complex emotions in documents, as well as the intensity of the emotions, and study how the document emotions vary with topics. Hierarchical Bayesian networks are employed to generate the latent topic variables and emotion variables. On average, our model on single emotion classification outperforms the traditional supervised machine learning models such as SVM and Naive Bayes. The other model on the complex emotion classification also achieves promising results. We thoroughly analyze the impact of vocabulary quality and topic quantity to emotion and intensity prediction in our experiments. The distribution of topics such as Friend and Job are found to be sensitive to the documents' emotions, which we call emotion topic variation in this paper. This reveals the deeper relationship between topics and emotions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, L; Shao, L; Rockett, P				Liu, Li; Shao, Ling; Rockett, Peter			Human action recognition based on boosted feature selection and naive Bayes nearest-neighbor classification	SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Feature selection; AdaBoost; Naive Bayes nearest-neighbor classifier	ADABOOST; HMM	In this paper we propose a method of feature selection using the AdaBoost algorithm for action recognition. Instead of detecting spatio-temporal interest points and using a 'bag of features' approach, we use densely sampled descriptors, either 3D-SIFT or 3D-HOG, and select the most discriminative subset using the AdaBoost algorithm. We obtain maximal accuracy with just 200 of the 3217 possible raw 3D features from each video sequence. Using the extremely simple naive Bayes nearest-neighbor (NBNN) classifier with the most discriminative 3D-SIFT features, we obtain accuracies of: 92.7%, 99.4%, 92.3% and 38.1% on the KTH, Weizmann, IXMAS and HMDB51 datasets, respectively. We also observe that the errors are reasonably equitably distributed across the different action classes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

LTC: A latent tree approach to classification	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th European Conference on Symbolic and Quantitative Approaches to Reasoning with Uncertainty (ECSARU)	JUN 29-JUL 01, 2011	Belfast, NORTH IRELAND			Bayesian network classifier; Latent tree model	BAYESIAN NETWORKS; MODEL SELECTION; NAIVE BAYES; LIKELIHOOD; DISCOVERY	Latent tree models were proposed as a class of models for unsupervised learning, and have been applied to various problems such as clustering and density estimation. In this paper, we study the usefulness of latent tree models in another paradigm, namely supervised learning. We propose a novel generative classifier called latent tree classifier (LTC). An LTC represents each class-conditional distribution of attributes using a latent tree model, and uses Bayes rule to make prediction. Latent tree models can capture complex relationship among attributes. Therefore, LTC is able to approximate the true distribution behind data well and thus achieves good classification accuracy. We present an algorithm for learning LTC and empirically evaluate it on an extensive collection of UCI data. The results show that LTC compares favorably to the state-of-the-art in terms of classification accuracy. We also demonstrate that LTC can reveal underlying concepts and discover interesting subgroups within each class. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Jiang, LX; Cai, ZH; Zhang, H; Wang, DH				Jiang, Liangxiao; Cai, Zhihua; Zhang, Harry; Wang, Dianhong			Naive Bayes text classifiers: a locally weighted learning approach	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						text classification; naive Bayes; locally weighted learning; multinomial naive Bayes; complement naive Bayes; the one-versus-all-but-one model	OPTIMALITY	Due to being fast, easy to implement and relatively effective, some state-of-the-art naive Bayes text classifiers with the strong assumption of conditional independence among attributes, such as multinomial naive Bayes, complement naive Bayes and the one-versus-all-but-one model, have received a great deal of attention from researchers in the domain of text classification. In this article, we revisit these naive Bayes text classifiers and empirically compare their classification performance on a large number of widely used text classification benchmark datasets. Then, we propose a locally weighted learning approach to these naive Bayes text classifiers. We call our new approach locally weighted naive Bayes text classifiers (LWNBTC). LWNBTC weakens the attribute conditional independence assumption made by these naive Bayes text classifiers by applying the locally weighted learning approach. The experimental results show that our locally weighted versions significantly outperform these state-of-the-art naive Bayes text classifiers in terms of classification accuracy.

The success of these models is strongly related to their capacity to represent and handle dependence relations. Some forms of Bayesian networks have been successfully applied in many classification tasks. In particular, naive Bayes classifiers have been used for intrusion detection and alerts correlation. This paper analyses the advantage of adding expert knowledge to probabilistic classifiers in the context of intrusion detection and alerts correlation. As examples of probabilistic classifiers, we will consider the well-known Naive Bayes, Tree Augmented Na < ve Bayes (TAN), Hidden Naive Bayes (HNB) and decision tree classifiers. Our approach can be applied for any classifier where the outcome is a probability distribution over a set of classes (or decisions). In particular, we study how additional expert knowledge such as "it is expected that 80 % of traffic will be normal" can be integrated in classification tasks. Our aim is to revise probabilistic classifiers' outputs in order to fit expert knowledge. Experimental results show that our approach improves existing results on different benchmarks from intrusion detection and alert correlation areas.

J	Zhang, XN; Song, SJ; Wu, C				Zhang, Xunan; Song, Shiji; Wu, Cheng			Robust Bayesian Classification with Incomplete Data	COGNITIVE COMPUTATION			English	Article						Bayesian classification; Incomplete data; EM algorithm; Propensity scores	KERNEL DENSITY-ESTIMATION; MISSING DATA; NAIVE BAYES; RECOGNITION; CLASSIFIERS; MODELS	In this paper, we address the Bayesian classification with incomplete data. The common approach in the literature is to simply ignore the samples with missing values or impute missing values before classification. However, these methods are not effective when a large portion of the data have missing values and the acquisition of samples is expensive. Motivated by these limitations, the expectation maximization algorithm for learning a multivariate Gaussian mixture model and a multiple kernel density estimator based on the propensity scores are proposed to avoid listwise deletion (LD) or mean imputation (MI) for solving classification tasks with incomplete data. We illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms on some artificial and benchmark UCI data sets by comparing with LD and MI methods. We also apply these algorithms to solve the practical classification tasks on the lithology identification of hydrothermal minerals and license plate character recognition. The experimental results demonstrate their good performance with high classification accuracies.

J	Turhan, B; Misirli, AT; Bener, A				Turhan, Burak; Misirli, Ayse Tosun; Bener, Ayse			Empirical evaluation of the effects of mixed project data on learning defect predictors	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Cross project; Within project; Mixed project; Defect prediction; Fault prediction; Product metrics	OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN; STATIC CODE ATTRIBUTES; SOFTWARE; MODELS	Context: Defect prediction research mostly focus on optimizing the performance of models that are constructed for isolated projects (i.e. within project (WP)) through retrospective analyses. On the other hand, recent studies try to utilize data across projects (i.e. cross project (CP)) for building defect prediction models for new projects. There are no cases where the combination of within and cross (i.e. mixed) project data are used together. Objective: Our goal is to investigate the merits of using mixed project data for binary defect prediction. Specifically, we want to check whether it is feasible, in terms of defect detection performance, to use data from other projects for the cases (i) when there is an existing within project history and (ii) when there are limited within project data. Method: We use data from 73 versions of 41 projects that are publicly available. We simulate the two above-mentioned cases, and compare the performances of naive Bayes classifiers by using within project data vs. mixed project data. Results: For the first case, we find that the performance of mixed project predictors significantly improves over full within project predictors (p-value < 0.001), however the effect size is small (Hedges' g = 0.25). For the second case, we found that mixed project predictors are comparable to full within project predictors, using only 10% of available within project data (p-value = 0.002, g = 0.17). Conclusion: We conclude that the extra effort associated with collecting data from other projects is not feasible in terms of practical performance improvement when there is already an established within project defect predictor using full project history. However, when there is limited project history, e.g. early phases of development, mixed project predictions are justifiable as they perform as good as full within project models.

Radial basis function network, k-nearest neighborhood search, support vector machines, naive bayes, functional trees, and k-means clustering algorithm were applied to the test datasets. Several features were employed and the classification accuracies of each method for these features were examined. The assessment results of the methods on test images were also experimentally compared with those of two experts. According to the results of our experimental work, a combination of functional trees and the naive bayes classifier gave the best prognostic scores indicating very good kappa agreement values (kappa = 0.899 and kappa = 0.949, p<0.001) with the experts. This combination also gave the best dichotomization rate (96.3%) for assessment of estrogen receptor status. Wavelet color features provided better classification accuracy than Laws texture energy and co-occurrence matrix features. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

To enhance limited human cognitive abilities, we developed a human augmented cognition system that can offer appropriate information or services by actively responding to the user's intention. This article mainly describes a framework for probing human implicit intentions for the purpose of augmented cognition. The type of user intention, either task-free human implicit intention or task-oriented human implicit intention, can be predicted based on fixation count, fixation length, and pupil size variation induced by eye response. Further, these features are used to detect the transition point between task-free human implicit intention and task-oriented human implicit intention. Maximum a Posteriori in Naive Bayes classification model is used for selecting relevant query keywords to search and retrieve specific information from a personalized knowledge database. The experimental results show that the proposed human intention recognition and probing models are suitable for achieving the goal of augmented cognition. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The identification system was constructed from feature extraction and classification algorithms. The feature extraction was based on wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and energy measures. Feature fitness was established through the statistical t-test method. The extracted features were used as training and test data for a competitive 10-fold cross-validated analysis of six classification algorithms. This analysis showed that, with an accuracy of 95.8%, the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm outperforms naive Bayes classification (NBC), fuzzy Sugeno classifier (FSC), probabilistic neural network (PNN), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and decision tree (DT). The 10-fold stratified cross-validation instilled reliability in the result, therefore we are confident when we state that EEG signals can be used to automate both diagnosis and treatment monitoring of alcoholic patients. Such an automatization can lead to cost reduction by relieving medical experts from routine and administrative tasks.

Therefore, the prediction of energy values is the most important task aiming to secure the optimal usage of coal energy value. The goal of paper is to identify, examines and evaluate most influential artificial intelligence algorithms that have been widely used in the data mining community, on a real problem of predicting coal quality. Our researches are based on the data achieved under laboratory conditions during the period of five years (2005-2010), and include 33256 coal samples from "Kreka" Coal Mine Company. The goal of the research is to build, based on the described data, a prediction model that will be used for predicting the coal quality class of unknown samples. Four algorithms have been identified: C4.5, kNN, Naive Bayes and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The idea is to find the best model through the following stages: each of the algorithms is calibrated in order to find appropriate model division techniques which maximize the performance of the algorithms, to assess the importance of input attributes and ultimate comparison of the algorithm orders them with respect to their performance. The final evaluation of the outcomes allowed singling out the MLP to be the best predicting methods for the given domain with optimal structure for input, hidden and output layer.

J	Faust, O; Yanti, R; Yu, WW				Faust, Oliver; Yanti, Ratna; Yu, Wenwei			Automated Detection of Alcohol Related Changes in Electroencephalograph Signals	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Alcohol; Electroencephalograph; Computer Aided Diagnosis; Higher Order Spectra; Wavelet Packet Decomposition	EEG SIGNALS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; IDENTIFICATION; SYSTEMS; CLASSIFICATION; PARAMETERS; COUNTRIES; DRINKING; DISEASE; DESIGN	It is difficult to detect and treat alcoholism, because statistics show that statements from patients about their drinking habits are unreliable and diagnosable symptoms appear only in advanced stages of the disease. To address this problem, we propose an automatic system that characterizes alcohol related abnormalities in Electroncephalography (EEG) signals. This system enables clinicians, patients and all other people involved to manage the condition better. Furthermore, it provides deeper insights into the phenomena and thereby it reveals important clinical information about alcohol related changes in EEG signals. For this work, we adopt the widely held, and evidence supported, belief that EEG recordings are fundamentally nonlinear. As direct consequence, the nonlinear feature of Higher Order Spectra (HOS) cumulants was used to extract information about alcohol related changes from the EEG signals. The decision whether or not a particular EEG signal shows alcohol related changes, was established with six different classification algorithms: Decision Tree (DT), Fuzzy Sugeno Classifier (FSC), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). To establish the functionality, we tested the proposed diagnosis support system with 300 EEG data sets. The individual classification algorithms achieved different accuracy values, they ranged from 77% (NBC) to 92.4% (FSC). The (FSC) classification result supports our thesis that HOS based cumulants features can be used to discriminate alcohol and normal EEG signals. The fact that there was a wide range of classification accuracies supports our decision to test four different classification algorithms.

J	Bhowan, U; Johnston, M; Zhang, MJ; Yao, X				Bhowan, Urvesh; Johnston, Mark; Zhang, Mengjie; Yao, Xin			Evolving Diverse Ensembles Using Genetic Programming for Classification With Unbalanced Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						Classification; class imbalance learning; genetic programming (GP); multiobjective machine learning (ML)	NEURAL-NETWORKS; STRATEGIES; ALGORITHM; ACCURATE; SYSTEMS	In classification, machine learning algorithms can suffer a performance bias when data sets are unbalanced. Data sets are unbalanced when at least one class is represented by only a small number of training examples (called the minority class), while the other class(es) make up the majority. In this scenario, classifiers can have good accuracy on the majority class, but very poor accuracy on the minority class(es). This paper proposes a multiobjective genetic programming (MOGP) approach to evolving accurate and diverse ensembles of genetic program classifiers with good performance on both the minority and majority of classes. The evolved ensembles comprise of nondominated solutions in the population where individual members vote on class membership. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of two popular Pareto-based fitness strategies in the MOGP algorithm (SPEA2 and NSGAII), and investigates techniques to encourage diversity between solutions in the evolved ensembles. Experimental results on six (binary) class imbalance problems show that the evolved ensembles outperform their individual members, as well as single-predictor methods such as canonical GP, naive Bayes, and support vector machines, on highly unbalanced tasks. This highlights the importance of developing an effective fitness evaluation strategy in the underlying MOGP algorithm to evolve good ensemble members.

The current classification algorithms show little consideration of this problem. So when using this traditional classification algorithms to resolve this problem, classification performance is not good for samples in overlapping region. To meet this critical challenge, in this paper, we pay a systematic study on the class overlapping problem and propose a new classification algorithm based on NB for class overlapping problem (CANB). CANB uses NB to find class overlapping region and use this region and non-overlapping region in NB classification model learning separately. Experimental results on bench mark and real-world data sets demonstrate that CANB can improve the classification performances for class overlapping problem stably and effectively.

A novel artificial immune clonal selection classification and rule mining with swarm learning model	CONNECTION SCIENCE			English	Article						artificial immune system; clonal selection algorithm; particle swarm optimisation; hybrid; mutation	OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; SYSTEM; ACCURACY; NETWORK; AIRS	Metaheuristic optimisation algorithms have become popular choice for solving complex problems. By integrating Artificial Immune clonal selection algorithm (CSA) and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm, a novel hybrid Clonal Selection Classification and Rule Mining with Swarm Learning Algorithm (CS2) is proposed. The main goal of the approach is to exploit and explore the parallel computation merit of Clonal Selection and the speed and self-organisation merits of Particle Swarm by sharing information between clonal selection population and particle swarm. Hence, we employed the advantages of PSO to improve the mutation mechanism of the artificial immune CSA and to mine classification rules within datasets. Consequently, our proposed algorithm required less training time and memory cells in comparison to other AIS algorithms. In this paper, classification rule mining has been modelled as a miltiobjective optimisation problem with predictive accuracy. The multiobjective approach is intended to allow the PSO algorithm to return an approximation to the accuracy and comprehensibility border, containing solutions that are spread across the border. We compared our proposed algorithm classification accuracy CS2 with five commonly used CSAs, namely: AIRS1, AIRS2, AIRS-Parallel, CLONALG, and CSCA using eight benchmark datasets. We also compared our proposed algorithm classification accuracy CS2 with other five methods, namely: Naive Bayes, SVM, MLP, CART, and RFB. The results show that the proposed algorithm is comparable to the 10 studied algorithms. As a result, the hybridisation, built of CSA and PSO, can develop respective merit, compensate opponent defect, and make search-optimal effect and speed better.

J	Bigdeli, B; Samadzadegan, F; Reinartz, P				Bigdeli, Behnaz; Samadzadegan, Farhad; Reinartz, Peter			Band Grouping versus Band Clustering in SVM Ensemble Classification of Hyperspectral Imagery	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SELECTION; FUSION; CLASSIFIERS	Due to the dense sampling of spectral signatures of land covers, hyperspectral images have a better discrimination among similar ground cover classes than traditional remote sensing data. However, these images are usually composed of tens or hundreds of spectrally close bands, which result in high redundancy and great amount of computation time in hyperspectral image classification. In addition, the large number of spectral bands, but limited availability of training samples creates the problem of Hughes phenomenon. Consequently, traditional classification strategies have often limited performance in classification of hyperspectral imagery. Referring to the limitation of single classifiers in these situations, classifier ensemble system may exhibit better performance. This paper presents a method for classification of hyperspectral data based on two concepts of Band Clustering (BC) and Band Grouping (BC) through a Support Vector machine (svm) ensemble system. The proposed method uses the BC\BG strategies to split data into few band portions. After this step, we applied svm on each band cluster\group that is produced in previous step. Finally, Naive Bayes as a classifier fusion method combines the decisions of SVM classifiers. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the classification accuracy in comparison to the standard svm and to feature selection methods.

For that purpose, many prediction methods for protein complexes from protein-protein interactions have been developed such as MCL, MCODE, RNSC, PCP, RRW, and NWE. These methods have dealt with only complexes with size of more than three because the methods often are based on some density of subgraphs. However, heterodimeric protein complexes that consist of two distinct proteins occupy a large part according to several comprehensive databases of known complexes. In this paper, we propose several feature space mappings from protein-protein interaction data, in which each interaction is weighted based on reliability. Furthermore, we make use of prior knowledge on protein domains to develop feature space mappings, domain composition kernel and its combination kernel with our proposed features. We perform ten-fold cross-validation computational experiments. These results suggest that our proposed kernel considerably outperforms the naive Bayes-based method, which is the best existing method for predicting heterodimeric protein complexes.

Method actors were asked to self-induce nine emotional states (anger, disgust, envy, fear, happiness, lust, pride, sadness, and shame) while in an fMRI scanner. Using a Gaussian Naive Bayes pooled variance classifier, we demonstrate the ability to identify specific emotions experienced by an individual at well over chance accuracy on the basis of: 1) neural activation of the same individual in other trials, 2) neural activation of other individuals who experienced similar trials, and 3) neural activation of the same individual to a qualitatively different type of emotion induction. Factor analysis identified valence, arousal, sociality, and lust as dimensions underlying the activation patterns. These results suggest a structure for neural representations of emotion and inform theories of emotional processing.

J	Ren, FJ; Sohrab, MG				Ren, Fuji; Sohrab, Mohammad Golam			Class-indexing-based term weighting for automatic text classification	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Text classification; Indexing; Term weighting; Machine learning; Feature selection; Classifier	FEATURE-SELECTION; NAIVE BAYES; CATEGORIZATION; RETRIEVAL; MACHINE	Most of the previous studies related on different term weighting emphasize on the document-indexing-based and four fundamental information elements-based approaches to address automatic text classification (ATC). In this study, we introduce class-indexing-based term-weighting approaches and judge their effects in high-dimensional and comparatively low-dimensional vector space over the TF.IDF and five other different term weighting approaches that are considered as the baseline approaches. First, we implement a class-indexing-based TF.IDF.ICF observational term weighting approach in which the inverse class frequency (ICF) is incorporated. In the experiment, we investigate the effects of TF.IDF.ICF over the Reuters-21578, 20 Newsgroups, and RCV1-v2 datasets as benchmark collections, which provide positive discrimination on rare terms in the vector space and biased against frequent terms in the text classification (TC) task. Therefore, we revised the ICF function and implemented a new inverse class space density frequency (ICS delta F), and generated the TF.IDF.ICS delta F method that provides a positive discrimination on infrequent and frequent terms. We present detailed evaluation of each category for the three datasets with term weighting approaches. The experimental results show that the proposed class-indexing-based TF.IDF.ICS delta F term weighting approach is promising over the compared well-known baseline term weighting approaches.

A novel KFDA kernel parameters optimization criterion is presented for maximizing the uniformity of class-pair separabilities and class separability in kernel space simultaneously. The presented criterion is also applied to the kernel parameters selection of spectral regression kernel discriminant analysis (SRKDA). Minimum distance classifier, k nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier, and naive Bayes classifier are used to evaluate the feature extraction performance. Experiments on fourteen benchmark multiclass data sets show that, comparing with the criterion for merely maximizing the class separability in kernel space, the presented criterion can search the optimum KFDA kernel parameters more accurately, and do better in SRKDA kernel parameters selection.

Alzheimer's Dis Neuroimaging	Functional activity maps based on significance measures and Independent Component Analysis	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Alzheimer's Disease (AD); Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD); Relative Entropy; Independent Component Analysis (ICA); Naive Bayes Classifier; Support Vector Machines (SVM); PET and SPECT	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; FEATURE-SELECTION; BRAIN IMAGES; SPECT IMAGES; DIAGNOSIS; CLASSIFICATION; MODELS; PET; SEGMENTATION; CLASSIFIERS	The use of functional imaging has been proven very helpful for the process of diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In many cases, the analysis of these images is performed by manual reorientation and visual interpretation. Therefore, new statistical techniques to perform a more quantitative analysis are needed. In this work, a new statistical approximation to the analysis of functional images, based on significance measures and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is presented. After the images preprocessing, voxels that allow better separation of the two classes are extracted, using significance measures such as the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon U-Test (MWW) and Relative Entropy (RE). After this feature selection step, the voxels vector is modelled by means of ICA, extracting a few independent components which will be used as an input to the classifier. Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are used in this work. The proposed system has been applied to two different databases. A 96-subjects Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) database from the "Virgen de las Nieves" Hospital in Granada, Spain, and a 196-subjects Positron Emission Tomography (PET) database from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Values of accuracy up to 96.9% and 91.3% for SPECT and PET databases are achieved by the proposed system, which has yielded many benefits over methods proposed on recent works.

Improvement of HIV-1 coreceptor tropism prediction by employing selected nucleotide positions of the env gene in a Bayesian network classifier	JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY			English	Article						Bayesian classifier; maraviroc; wrapper	HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; GP120 ENVELOPE GLYCOPROTEIN; DRUG-RESISTANCE MUTATIONS; V3 LOOP; VIROLOGICAL RESPONSE; GENOTYPIC PREDICTION; EXPERIENCED PATIENTS; PHENOTYPIC ASSAY; IN-VITRO; TYPE-1	This study aimed to develop a genotypic method to predict HIV-1 coreceptor usage by employing the nucleotide sequence of the env gene in a tree-augmented naive Bayes (TAN) classifier, and to evaluate its accuracy in prediction compared with other available tools. A wrapper data-mining strategy interleaved with a TAN algorithm was employed to evaluate the predictor value of every single-nucleotide position throughout the HIV-1 env gene. Based on these results, different nucleotide positions were selected to develop a TAN classifier, which was employed to predict the coreceptor tropism of all the full-length env gene sequences with information on coreceptor tropism currently available at the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database. Employing 26 nucleotide positions in the TAN classifier, an accuracy of 95.6, a specificity (identification of CCR5-tropic viruses) of 99.4 and a sensitivity (identification of CXCR4/dual-tropic viruses) of 80.5 were achieved for the in silico cross-validation. Compared with the phenotypic determination of coreceptor usage, the TAN algorithm achieved more accurate predictions than WebPSSM and Geno2pheno [coreceptor] (P0.05). The use of the methodology presented in this work constitutes a robust strategy to identify genetic patterns throughout the HIV-1 env gene differently present in CCR5-tropic and CXCR4/dual-tropic viruses. Moreover, the TAN classifier can be used as a genotypic tool to predict the coreceptor usage of HIV-1 isolates reaching more accurate predictions than with other widely used genotypic tools. The use of this algorithm could improve the correct prescribing of CCR5 antagonist drugs to HIV-1-infected patients.

For this, we prove a polynomial type large deviation inequality for the quasi likelihood random field. Then it becomes crucial to prove nondegeneracy of a key index chi(0). By nature of the sampling setting, chi(0) is random. This makes it difficult to apply a naive sufficient condition, and requires a new machinery. In order to establish a quasi likelihood analysis, we need quantitative estimate of the nondegeneracy of chi(0). The existence of a nondegenerate local section of a certain tensor bundle associated with the statistical random field solves this problem. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A Clinical Risk Stratification Tool for Predicting Treatment Resistance in Major Depressive Disorder	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Antidepressant; depression; machine learning; prediction; risk stratification; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; treatment-resistant depression	DIAGNOSTIC SCREENING QUESTIONNAIRE; ILLNESS RATING-SCALE; QUICK INVENTORY; BREAST-CANCER; SYMPTOMATOLOGY; REGRESSION; MODELS; VALIDATION; SELECTION; BURDEN	Background: Early identification of depressed individuals at high risk for treatment resistance could be helpful in selecting optimal setting and intensity of care. At present, validated tools to facilitate this risk stratification are rarely used in psychiatric practice. Methods: Data were drawn from the first two treatment levels of a multicenter antidepressant effectiveness study in major depressive disorder, the STAR*D (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression) cohort. This cohort was divided into training, testing, and validation subsets. Only clinical or sociodemographic variables available by or readily amenable to self-report were considered. Multivariate models were developed to discriminate individuals reaching remission with a first or second pharmacological treatment trial from those not reaching remission despite two trials. Results: A logistic regression model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve exceeding .71 in training, testing, and validation cohorts and maintained good calibration across cohorts. Performance of three alternative models with machine learning approaches-a naive Bayes classifier and a support vector machine, and a random forest model-was less consistent. Similar performance was observed between more and less severe depression, men and women, and primary versus specialty care sites. A web-based calculator was developed that implements this tool and provides graphical estimates of risk. Conclusion: Risk for treatment resistance among outpatients with major depressive disorder can be estimated with a simple model incorporating baseline sociodemographic and clinical features. Future studies should examine the performance of this model in other clinical populations and its utility in treatment selection or clinical trial design.

Diverse classification rules and techniques are being applied by human experts. Increasing number of confidential information in organizations is making difficult to classify all the documents carefully with human effort. The recommended frameworks in this study classify the internal documents of TUBITAK UEKAE (National Research Institute of Electronics and Cryptology of Turkey) by using classification algorithms naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVMs) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFISs). A hybrid approach involving support vector classifiers and adaptive neuro-fuzzy classifiers exposes the most successful accuracy rates of expert system classification. This study also states preprocessing tasks required for document classification with natural language processing. To represent term-document relations, a recommended metric TF-IDF was chosen to construct a weight matrix. Agglutinative nature of Turkish documents is handled by Turkish stemming algorithms. At the end of the article, some experimental results and success metrics are projected with accuracy rates and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

J	Feng, YH; Wang, TJ				Feng Yanghe; Wang Tengjiao			Identification of Human Protein Drug Targets Homologues with Data Mining	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Drug Target; Drug discovery; One Class Classification; Bayesian network; Naive Bayes; SVM; C4.5	GENE ONTOLOGY; PREDICTION; BIOLOGY; GENOME	Identification and validation of potential target proteins is the first step for drug discovery and design. An accurate drug target classifier is helpful to test a new drug target more efficiently and economically. In this paper, we analyzed 522 drug targets and 5371 non-drug targets with 38 chemical and physical properties to identify differences on their chemical and physical properties. It shows the significant differences can be summarized into 9 properties. Based on these sequence features we used four data mining techniques to train drug target classifiers and gained lists of the potential target proteins. The results of 10 fold cross validation show that the accuracy of support vector machine (SVM) is 81.4% which is the highest in these classifiers. By integration of the lists predicted from our classifiers, a drug targets homologues set is identified to help drug discovery.

Data mining approach to fault detection for isolated inverter-based microgrids	IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION			English	Article								This study investigates the problem of fault protection in a microgrid containing inverter-based distributed generators (IBDGs). Owing to the low magnitude of short circuit currents generated by IBDGs, traditional protection techniques which relay on current (fuses and overcurrent relays) may fail to protect such networks. This study addresses the problem of finding suitable features derived from local electrical measurements that can be used by statistical classifiers to better discriminate fault events from normal network events. Given a series of simple electrical features, a study of feature selection and data mining techniques is conducted in the context of fault detection in isolated microgrids with IBDGs. Two statistical classifiers are compared and implemented in this framework: Naive Bayes and decision trees. The proposed approach is tested on a facility scale microgrid consisting of three IBDGs.

We extended the PARADIGM algorithm (Vaske et al., 2010, Bioinformatics, 26, i237-i245), a pathway analysis method for combining multiple '-omics' data types, to learn the strength and direction of 9139 gene and protein interactions curated from the literature. Using genomic and mRNA expression data from 1936 samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, we learned interactions that provided support for and relative strength of 7138 (78%) of the curated links. Gene set enrichment found that genes involved in the strongest interactions were significantly enriched for transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation and response to tumor cells. Within the TCGA breast cancer cohort, we assessed different interaction strengths between breast cancer subtypes, and found interactions associated with the MYC pathway and the ER alpha network to be among the most differential between basal and luminal A subtypes. PARADIGM with the Naive Bayesian assumption produced gene activity predictions that, when clustered, found groups of patients with better separation in survival than both the original version of PARADIGM and a version without the assumption. We found that this Naive Bayes assumption was valid for the vast majority of co-regulators, indicating that most co-regulators act independently on their shared target.

J	Ma, ZY; Sun, AX; Cong, G				Ma, Zongyang; Sun, Aixin; Cong, Gao			On Predicting the Popularity of Newly Emerging Hashtags in Twitter	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						text mining; content filtering; automatic classification		Because of Twitter's popularity and the viral nature of information dissemination on Twitter, predicting which Twitter topics will become popular in the near future becomes a task of considerable economic importance. Many Twitter topics are annotated by hashtags. In this article, we propose methods to predict the popularity of new hashtags on Twitter by formulating the problem as a classification task. We use five standard classification models (i. e., Naive bayes, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, support vector machines, and logistic regression) for prediction. The main challenge is the identification of effective features for describing new hashtags. We extract 7 content features from a hashtag string and the collection of tweets containing the hashtag and 11 contextual features from the social graph formed by users who have adopted the hashtag. We conducted experiments on a Twitter data set consisting of 31 million tweets from 2 million Singapore-based users. The experimental results show that the standard classifiers using the extracted features significantly outperform the baseline methods that do not use these features. Among the five classifiers, the logistic regression model performs the best in terms of the Micro-F1 measure. We also observe that contextual features are more effective than content features.

Alleviating Naive Bayes Attribute Independence Assumption by Attribute Weighting	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						classification; naive Bayes; attribute independence assumption; weighted naive Bayes classification	NETWORK CLASSIFIERS	Despite the simplicity of the Naive Bayes classifier, it has continued to perform well against more sophisticated newcomers and has remained, therefore, of great interest to the machine learning community. Of numerous approaches to refining the naive Bayes classifier, attribute weighting has received less attention than it warrants. Most approaches, perhaps influenced by attribute weighting in other machine learning algorithms, use weighting to place more emphasis on highly predictive attributes than those that are less predictive. In this paper, we argue that for naive Bayes attribute weighting should instead be used to alleviate the conditional independence assumption. Based on this premise, we propose a weighted naive Bayes algorithm, called WANBIA, that selects weights to minimize either the negative conditional log likelihood or the mean squared error objective functions. We perform extensive evaluations and find that WANBIA is a competitive alternative to state of the art classifiers like Random Forest, Logistic Regression and A1DE.

One of the main problems affecting this service is the proliferation of unsolicited messages (usually denoted by spam) which, despite the efforts made by the research community, still remains as an inherent problem affecting this Internet service. In this perspective, this work proposes and explores the concept of a novel symbiotic feature selection approach allowing the exchange of relevant features among distinct collaborating users, in order to improve the behavior of anti-spam filters. For such purpose, several Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) are explored as optimization engines able to enhance feature selection strategies within the anti-spam area. The proposed mechanisms are tested using a realistic incremental retraining evaluation procedure and resorting to a novel corpus based on the well-known Enron datasets mixed with recent spam data. The obtained results show that the proposed symbiotic approach is competitive also having the advantage of preserving end-users privacy.

J	Sopharak, A; Uyyanonvara, B; Barman, S				Sopharak, Akara; Uyyanonvara, Bunyarit; Barman, Sarah			Simple hybrid method for fine microaneurysm detection from non-dilated diabetic retinopathy retinal images	COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS			English	Article						Diabetic retinopathy; Microaneurysms; Naive Bayes classifier	AUTOMATIC DETECTION; FLUORESCEIN ANGIOGRAMS; FUNDUS IMAGES; NETWORK; TOOL	Microaneurysms detection is an important task in computer aided diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. Microaneurysms are the first clinical sign of diabetic retinopathy, a major cause of vision loss in diabetic patients. Early microaneurysm detection can help reduce the incidence of blindness. Automatic detection of microanethysms is still an open problem due to their tiny sizes, low contrast and also similarity with blood vessels. It is particularly very difficult to detect fine microaneurysms, especially from non-dilated pupils and that is the goal of this paper. Simple yet effective methods are used. They are coarse segmentation using mathematic morphology and fine segmentation using naive Bayes classifier. A total of 18 microaneurysms features are proposed in this paper and they are extracted for naive Bayes classifier. The detected microaneurysms are validated by comparing at pixel level with ophthalmologists' hand-drawn ground-truth.

J	Hsiao, WF; Chang, TM				Hsiao, Wen-Feng; Chang, Te-Min			Term expansion on the categorization of summarized documents	COMPUTER SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						distributional clustering; term expansion; text summarization; document categorization		Several researches emphasize on the application of using documents' summaries as feature vector inputs in text categorization tasks. The performance of this kind of approach is often poor when the coverage rate of summarization is low with oversimplified feature vectors. Therefore, in this study we propose to expand the terms in the summaries using supervised distributional clustering method to improve the categorization performance. In the training stage of our approach, we input documents' summaries to generate classifiers (KNN and Naive Bayes) and term clusters (using KI. divergence as dissimilarity measure) as well. In the test stage, we classify a new document by inputting its expanded feature vector of its summary into the generated classifiers. That is, terms in the feature vector will be expanded using related terms in the same cluster in order to alleviate the term mismatch problem. Three experiments are conducted accordingly. The results show that our proposed approach can effectively resolve the problem of term mismatch problem and improve the categorization accuracy. In a word, our approach makes the idea of using automatic summarization to replace for the feature selection in text categorization tasks more practical and feasible.

J	Tavares, G; Faisal, A				Tavares, Gabriela; Faisal, Aldo			Scaling-Laws of Human Broadcast Communication Enable Distinction between Human, Corporate and Robot Twitter Users	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HUMAN DYNAMICS; PATTERNS	Human behaviour is highly individual by nature, yet statistical structures are emerging which seem to govern the actions of human beings collectively. Here we search for universal statistical laws dictating the timing of human actions in communication decisions. We focus on the distribution of the time interval between messages in human broadcast communication, as documented in Twitter, and study a collection of over 160,000 tweets for three user categories: personal (controlled by one person), managed (typically PR agency controlled) and bot-controlled (automated system). To test our hypothesis, we investigate whether it is possible to differentiate between user types based on tweet timing behaviour, independently of the content in messages. For this purpose, we developed a system to process a large amount of tweets for reality mining and implemented two simple probabilistic inference algorithms: 1. a naive Bayes classifier, which distinguishes between two and three account categories with classification performance of 84.6% and 75.8%, respectively and 2. a prediction algorithm to estimate the time of a user's next tweet with an R-2 approximate to 0.7. Our results show that we can reliably distinguish between the three user categories as well as predict the distribution of a user's inter-message time with reasonable accuracy. More importantly, we identify a characteristic power-law decrease in the tail of inter-message time distribution by human users which is different from that obtained for managed and automated accounts. This result is evidence of a universal law that permeates the timing of human decisions in broadcast communication and extends the findings of several previous studies of peer-to-peer communication.

Using a multi-staged strategy based on machine learning and mathematical modeling to predict genotype-phenotype risk patterns in diabetic kidney disease: a prospective case-control cohort analysis	BMC NEPHROLOGY			English	Article						Prediction; Diabetic kidney disease; Genotypes; Phenotypes; Machine learning; Random forest; Support vector machine	CHINESE PATIENTS; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; GENE POLYMORPHISMS; METABOLIC SYNDROME; NEPHROPATHY; UTEROGLOBIN; POPULATION; UNDERLIE	Background: Multi-causality and heterogeneity of phenotypes and genotypes characterize complex diseases. In a database with comprehensive collection of phenotypes and genotypes, we compared the performance of common machine learning methods to generate mathematical models to predict diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Methods: In a prospective cohort of type 2 diabetic patients, we selected 119 subjects with DKD and 554 without DKD at enrolment and after a median follow-up period of 7.8 years for model training, testing and validation using seven machine learning methods (partial least square regression, the classification and regression tree, the C5.0 decision tree, random forest, naive Bayes classification, neural network and support vector machine). We used 17 clinical attributes and 70 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 54 candidate genes to build different models. The top attributes selected by the best-performing models were then used to build models with performance comparable to those using the entire dataset. Results: Age, age of diagnosis, systolic blood pressure and genetic polymorphisms of uteroglobin and lipid metabolism were selected by most methods. Models generated by support vector machine (svmRadial) and random forest (cforest) had the best prediction accuracy whereas models derived from naive Bayes classifier and partial least squares regression had the least optimal performance. Using 10 clinical attributes (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, age of diagnosis, triglyceride, white blood cell count, total cholesterol, waist to hip ratio, LDL cholesterol, and alcohol intake) and 5 genetic attributes (UGB G38A, LIPC -514C > T, APOB Thr71Ile, APOC3 3206T > G and APOC3 1100C > T), selected most often by SVM and cforest, we were able to build high-performance models. Conclusions: Amongst different machine learning methods, svmRadial and cforest had the best performance. Genetic polymorphisms related to inflammation and lipid metabolism warrant further investigation for their associations with DKD.	[Leung, Ross K. K.; Tsui, Stephen K.

J	Raizada, RDS; Lee, YS				Raizada, Rajeev D. S.; Lee, Yune-Sang			Smoothness without Smoothing: Why Gaussian Naive Bayes Is Not Naive for Multi-Subject Searchlight Studies	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DISTRIBUTED PATTERNS; HUMAN BRAIN; FMRI; CLASSIFIERS; RECOGNITION; SPEECH; CORTEX; TASK	Spatial smoothness is helpful when averaging fMRI signals across multiple subjects, as it allows different subjects' corresponding brain areas to be pooled together even if they are slightly misaligned. However, smoothing is usually not applied when performing multivoxel pattern-based analyses (MVPA), as it runs the risk of blurring away the information that fine-grained spatial patterns contain. It would therefore be desirable, if possible, to carry out pattern-based analyses which take unsmoothed data as their input but which produce smooth images as output. We show here that the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) classifier does precisely this, when it is used in "searchlight" pattern-based analyses. We explain why this occurs, and illustrate the effect in real fMRI data. Moreover, we show that analyses using GNBs produce results at the multi-subject level which are statistically robust, neurally plausible, and which replicate across two independent data sets. By contrast, SVM classifiers applied to the same data do not generate a replication, even if the SVM-derived searchlight maps have smoothing applied to them. An additional advantage of GNB classifiers for searchlight analyses is that they are orders of magnitude faster to compute than more complex alternatives such as SVMs. Collectively, these results suggest that Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers may be a highly non-naive choice for multi-subject pattern-based fMRI studies.

Thus, exploring their effect on viability of seven different cell lines representing different organs of the human body is highly important. Methods: The toxicological effects of Co-Fe NPs were studied by in-vitro exposure of A549 and NCIH441 cell-lines (lung), precision-cut lung slices from rat, HepG2 cell-line (liver), MDCK cell-line (kidney), Caco-2 TC7 cell-line (intestine), TK6 (lymphoblasts) and primary mouse dendritic-cells. Toxicity was examined following exposure to Co-Fe NPs in the concentration range of 0.05 - 1.2 mM for 24 and 72 h, using Alamar blue, MTT and neutral red assays. Changes in oxidative stress were determined by a dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate based assay. Data analysis and predictive modeling of the obtained data sets were executed by employing methods of Knowledge Discovery from Data with emphasis on a decision tree model (J48). Results: Different dose-response curves of cell viability were obtained for each of the seven cell lines upon exposure to Co-Fe NPs. Increase of oxidative stress was induced by Co-Fe NPs and found to be dependent on the cell type. A high linear correlation (R-2=0.97) was found between the toxicity of Co-Fe NPs and the extent of ROS generation following their exposure to Co-Fe NPs. The algorithm we applied to model the observed toxicity belongs to a type of supervised classifier. The decision tree model yielded the following order with decrease of the ranking parameter: NP concentrations (as the most influencing parameter), cell type (possessing the following hierarchy of cell sensitivity towards viability decrease: TK6 > Lung slices > NCIH441 > Caco-2 = MDCK > A549 > HepG2 = Dendritic) and time of exposure, where the highest-ranking parameter (NP concentration) provides the highest information gain with respect to toxicity. The validity of the chosen decision tree model J48 was established by yielding a higher accuracy than that of the well-known "naive bayes" classifier. Conclusions: The observed correlation between the oxidative stress, caused by the presence of the Co-Fe NPs, with the hierarchy of sensitivity of the different cell types towards toxicity, suggests that oxidative stress is one possible mechanism for the toxicity of Co-Fe NPs.

Language translation for file paths	DIGITAL INVESTIGATION			English	Article						Digital forensics; File paths; Machine translation; Dictionary; Character distribution; Unicode; Naive Bayes inference		Forensic examiners are frequently confronted with content in languages that they do not understand, and they could benefit from machine translation into their native language. But automated translation of file paths is a difficult problem because of the minimal context for translation and the frequent mixing of multiple languages within a path. This work developed a prototype implementation of a file-path translator that first identifies the language for each directory segment of a path, and then translates to English those that are not already English nor artificial words. Brown's LA-Strings utility for language identification was tried, but its performance was found inadequate on short strings and it was supplemented with clues from dictionary lookup, Unicode character distributions for languages, country of origin, and language-related keywords. To provide better data for language inference, words used in each directory over a large corpus were aggregated for analysis. The resulting directory-language probabilities were combined with those for each path segment from dictionary lookup and character-type distributions to infer the segment's most likely language. Tests were done on a corpus of 50.1 million file paths looking for 35 different languages. Tests showed 90.4% accuracy on identifying languages of directories and 93.7% accuracy on identifying languages of directory/file segments of file paths, even after excluding 44.4% of the paths as obviously English or untranslatable. Two of seven proposed language clues were shown to impair directory-language identification. Experiments also compared three translation methods: the Systran translation tool, Google Translate, and word-for-word substitution using dictionaries. Google Translate usually performed the best, but all still made errors with European languages and a significant number of errors with Arabic and Chinese. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Gases/Odors Identification With Artificial Immune Recognition System Using Thick Film Gas Sensor Array Responses	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Artificial immune recognition system; cross validation; neural classifier; sensor array; thick-film	NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFIER; SENSITIVITY	This paper discusses the robustness of the artificial immune recognition system (AIRS) for the gases/odors identification problem. The steady state responses of a thick-film sensor array with four sensor elements with exposure of four gases, viz., H-2, CO, CH4, and LPG, are used as input data. The AIRS algorithm with its versions including AIRS1, AIRS2, and parallel AIRS is applied to classify the unseen gases/odors data with duly trained networks. The classification accuracy of the AIRS algorithm is compared with radial basis function neural network, naive bayes, and learning vector quantization methods. The results obtained with the AIRS are found more promising in this experiment. The results are verified using a cross-validation scheme.	[Mishra, Sunny V. N.; Dwivedi, R.; Das, R.

Highly parallel assays of tissue-specific enhancers in whole Drosophila embryos	NATURE METHODS			English	Article							CIS-REGULATORY MODULES; GENE-EXPRESSION; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; MESODERM DEVELOPMENT; PHAGE PHI-C31; LAME DUCK; PROMOTERS; INTEGRASE; IDENTIFICATION; DISSECTION	Transcriptional enhancers are a primary mechanism by which tissue-specific gene expression is achieved. Despite the importance of these regulatory elements in development, responses to environmental stresses and disease, testing enhancer activity in animals remains tedious, with a minority of enhancers having been characterized. Here we describe 'enhancer-FACS-seq' (eFS) for highly parallel identification of active, tissue-specific enhancers in Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Analysis of enhancers identified by eFS as being active in mesodermal tissues revealed enriched DNA binding site motifs of known and putative, previously uncharacterized mesodermal transcription factors. Naive Bayes classifiers using transcription factor binding site motifs accurately predicted mesodermal enhancer activity. Application of eFS to other cell types and organisms should accelerate the cataloging of enhancers and understanding how transcriptional regulation is encoded in them.

The original naive Bayes scheme, does, however, have a serious weakness, namely, the harmful effect of redundant predictors. In this paper, we study how to apply a regularization technique to learn a computationally efficient classifier that is inspired by naive Bayes. The proposed formulation, combined with an L-1-penalty, is capable of discarding harmful, redundant predictors. A modification of the LARS algorithm is devised to solve this problem. We tackle both real-valued and discrete predictors, assuring that our method is applicable to a wide range of data. In the experimental section, we empirically study the effect of redundant and irrelevant predictors. We also test the method on a high-dimensional data set from the neuroscience field, where there are many more predictors than data cases. Finally, we run the method on a real data set than combines categorical with numeric predictors. Our approach is compared with several naive Bayes variants and other classification algorithms (SVM and kNN), and is shown to be competitive.

O.; Glen, Robert C.; Bender, Andreas			In Silico Target Predictions: Defining a Benchmarking Data Set and Comparison of Performance of the Multiclass Naive Bayes and Parzen-Rosenblatt Window	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							SMALL-MOLECULE; DRUG DESIGN; PHARMACOLOGY; DESCRIPTORS; CHEMISTRY; DATABASES; LINKING; SEARCH	In this study, two probabilistic machine-learning algorithms were compared for in silico target prediction of bioactive molecules, namely the well-established Laplacian-modified Naive Bayes classifier (NB) and the more recently introduced (to Cheminformatics) Parzen-Rosenblatt Window. Both classifiers were trained in conjunction with circular fingerprints on a large data set of bioactive compounds extracted from ChEMBL, covering 894 human protein targets with more than 155,000 ligand-protein pairs. This data set is also provided as a benchmark data set for future target prediction methods due to its size as well as the number of bioactivity classes it contains. In addition to evaluating the methods, different performance measures were explored. This is not as straightforward as in binary classification settings, due to the number of classes, the possibility of multiple class memberships, and the need to translate model scores into "yes/no" predictions for assessing model performance. Both algorithms achieved a recall of correct targets that exceeds 80% in the top 1% of predictions. Performance depends significantly on the underlying diversity and size of a given class of bioactive compounds, with small classes and low structural similarity affecting both algorithms to different degrees. When tested on an external test set extracted from WOMBAT covering more than 500 targets by excluding all compounds with Tanimoto similarity above 0.8 to compounds from the ChEMBL data set, the current methodologies achieved a recall of 63.3% and 66.6% among the top 1% for Naive Bayes and Parzen-Rosenblatt Window, respectively. While those numbers seem to indicate lower performance, they are also more realistic for settings where protein targets need to be established for novel chemical substances.

J	Yang, DH; Yu, G				Yang, Dong-Hui; Yu, Guang			A method of feature selection and sentiment similarity for Chinese micro-blogs	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Chinese micro-blogs; feature selection; Karhunen-Loeve transform; sentiment similarity	IDENTIFICATION; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEMS	Sentiment analysis of messages posted on micro-blogs is helpful in determining the current usefulness and acceptability of target products or services. It is the basis for finding users with similar attitudes. In this paper, we propose a new sentiment similarity technique to analyse Chinese micro-blog accounts. However, the Chinese text features have not been well studied. Therefore, we first chose four types of feature sets and selected principle features by combining information gain and support vector machine techniques. Next, we compared the four types of features to determine which type of feature contributed more than others. Here we used three classification techniques: decision tree, support vector machines and naive Bayes. Finally, we used Karhunen-Loeve transform technique and average precision between positive and negative features to measure sentiment similarity. Experiment evaluations demonstrated that this new method is efficient and performs better than original average distance for Chinese micro-blogs.

J	Myslin, M; Zhu, SH; Chapman, W; Conway, M				Myslin, Mark; Zhu, Shu-Hong; Chapman, Wendy; Conway, Mike			Using Twitter to Examine Smoking Behavior and Perceptions of Emerging Tobacco Products	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						social media; twitter messaging; smoking; natural language processing	UNITED-STATES; HEALTH; SURVEILLANCE; SEARCH; MEDIA; YOUNG	Background: Social media platforms such as Twitter are rapidly becoming key resources for public health surveillance applications, yet little is known about Twitter users' levels of informedness and sentiment toward tobacco, especially with regard to the emerging tobacco control challenges posed by hookah and electronic cigarettes. Objective: To develop a content and sentiment analysis of tobacco-related Twitter posts and build machine learning classifiers to detect tobacco-relevant posts and sentiment towards tobacco, with a particular focus on new and emerging products like hookah and electronic cigarettes. Methods: We collected 7362 tobacco-related Twitter posts at 15-day intervals from December 2011 to July 2012. Each tweet was manually classified using a triaxial scheme, capturing genre, theme, and sentiment. Using the collected data, machine-learning classifiers were trained to detect tobacco-related vs irrelevant tweets as well as positive vs negative sentiment, using Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Finally, phi contingency coefficients were computed between each of the categories to discover emergent patterns. Results: The most prevalent genres were first- and second-hand experience and opinion, and the most frequent themes were hookah, cessation, and pleasure. Sentiment toward tobacco was overall more positive (1939/4215, 46% of tweets) than negative (1349/4215, 32%) or neutral among tweets mentioning it, even excluding the 9% of tweets categorized as marketing. Three separate metrics converged to support an emergent distinction between, on one hand, hookah and electronic cigarettes corresponding to positive sentiment, and on the other hand, traditional tobacco products and more general references corresponding to negative sentiment. These metrics included correlations between categories in the annotation scheme (phi(hookah-positive)=0.39; phi(e-cigs-positive)=0.19); correlations between search keywords and sentiment (chi(2)(4)=414.50, P<.001, Cramer's V=0.36), and the most discriminating unigram features for positive and negative sentiment ranked by log odds ratio in the machine learning component of the study. In the automated classification tasks, SVMs using a relatively small number of unigram features (500) achieved best performance in discriminating tobacco-related from unrelated tweets (F score=0.85). Conclusions: Novel insights available through Twitter for tobacco surveillance are attested through the high prevalence of positive sentiment. This positive sentiment is correlated in complex ways with social image, personal experience, and recently popular products such as hookah and electronic cigarettes. Several apparent perceptual disconnects between these products and their health effects suggest opportunities for tobacco control education. Finally, machine classification of tobacco-related posts shows a promising edge over strictly keyword-based approaches, yielding an improved signal-to-noise ratio in Twitter data and paving the way for automated tobacco surveillance applications.

Frank			Sensor Feature Selection and Combination for Stress Identification Using Combinatorial Fusion	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS			English	Article						Combinatorial Fusion; Feature Selection; Feature Fusion; Stress Identification; Sensor Fusion	CRITERIA; RANK	The identification of stressfulness under certain driving condition is an important issue for safety, security and health. Sensors and systems have been placed or implemented as wearable devices for drivers. Features are extracted from the data collected and combined to predict symptoms. The challenge is to select the feature set most relevant for stress. In this paper, we propose a feature selection method based on the performance and the diversity between two features. The feature sets selected are then combined using a combinatorial fusion. We also compare our results with other combination methods such as naive Bayes, support vector machine, C4.5, linear discriminant function (LDF), and k-nearest neighbour (kNN). Our experimental results demonstrate that combinatorial fusion is an efficient approach for feature selection and feature combination. It can also improve the stress recognition rate.

In order to evaluate the usability of protein biomarkers for pre-screening purposes several different approaches were used, including machine learning algorithms. Methods: All persons involved in the study had diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) was diagnosed by capturing 7-field fundus images, evaluated by two independent ophthalmologists. 165 eyes were examined (from 119 patients), 55 were diagnosed healthy and 110 images showed signs of DR. Tear samples were taken from all eyes and state-of-the-art nano-HPLC coupled ESI-MS/MS mass spectrometry protein identification was performed on all samples. Applicability of protein biomarkers was evaluated by six different optimally parameterized machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine, Recursive Partitioning, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor. Results: Out of the six investigated machine learning algorithms the result of Recursive Partitioning proved to be the most accurate. The performance of the system realizing the above algorithm reached 74% sensitivity and 48% specificity. Conclusions: Protein biomarkers selected and classified with machine learning algorithms alone are at present not recommended for screening purposes because of low specificity and sensitivity values. This tool can be potentially used to improve the results of image processing methods as a complementary tool in automatic or semiautomatic systems.

We have begun to evaluate the relative composition of the inflammatory infiltrates, i.e. percentages of inflammatory cell types in inflammatory infiltrates, as an alternate classification tool that may potentially improve tissue diagnostics, subgrouping in clinical trials, and understanding of pathogenesis of inflammatory and noninflammatory arthropathies. Methods: Synovial tissue specimens (normal synovium, n=15; orthopedic arthropathies, n=6; osteoarthritis, n=26; early undifferentiated arthritis, n=10; rheumatoid arthritis, n=26; chronic septic arthritis, n=11) were stained for CD15, CD68, CD3, CD20, and CD38. Densities of cells expressing a given marker were determined in the superficial subintima. Binary and multicategory receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and naive Bayes classifier were used to compare the abilities of (1) the absolute densities of cells expressing a given marker (absolute method) with (2) the percentages of these cells in the inflammatory cell population (relative method) to differentiate among the six tissue classes. Results: The inflammatory infiltrates in normal synovium and the orthopedic arthropathies consisted almost exclusively of CD68+ and CD3+ cells. Notable fractions of CD20+ and CD38+ cells appeared in a subset of osteoarthritis samples, and increased further in early, rheumatoid and chronic septic arthritis. ROC analyses and naive Bayes classifier ranked the absolute method above the relative method in terms of overall discriminatory ability. The relative method became slightly superior when the samples were also stratified according to the total number of inflammatory cells/mm(2). Conclusions: This exploratory investigation featuring a variety of joint disorders revealed that measuring the relative proportions of inflammatory cell types may aid in synovial tissue classification if the samples are also stratified according to the intensity of inflammation.

Full "Laplacianised" posterior naive Bayesian algorithm	JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS			English	Article						Naive Bayes; Laplacian Corrected Modified Naive Bayes; Classifications; Cheminformatics		Background: In the last decade the standard Naive Bayes (SNB) algorithm has been widely employed in multi-class classification problems in cheminformatics. This popularity is mainly due to the fact that the algorithm is simple to implement and in many cases yields respectable classification results. Using clever heuristic arguments "anchored" by insightful cheminformatics knowledge, Xia et al. have simplified the SNB algorithm further and termed it the Laplacian Corrected Modified Naive Bayes (LCMNB) approach, which has been widely used in cheminformatics since its publication. In this note we mathematically illustrate the conditions under which Xia et al.'s simplification holds. It is our hope that this clarification could help Naive Bayes practitioners in deciding when it is appropriate to employ the LCMNB algorithm to classify large chemical datasets. Results: A general formulation that subsumes the simplified Naive Bayes version is presented. Unlike the widely used NB method, the Standard Naive Bayes description presented in this work is discriminative (not generative) in nature, which may lead to possible further applications of the SNB method. Conclusions: Starting from a standard Naive Bayes (SNB) algorithm, we have derived mathematically the relationship between Xia et al.'s ingenious, but heuristic algorithm, and the SNB approach. We have also demonstrated the conditions under which Xia et al.'s crucial assumptions hold. We therefore hope that the new insight and recommendations provided can be found useful by the cheminformatics community.

A balanced iterative random forest for gene selection from microarray data	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC-LEUKEMIA; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER; CANCER CLASSIFICATION; CLUSTERING ANALYSIS; EXPRESSION DATA; RECOGNITION; PATTERNS	Background: The wealth of gene expression values being generated by high throughput microarray technologies leads to complex high dimensional datasets. Moreover, many cohorts have the problem of imbalanced classes where the number of patients belonging to each class is not the same. With this kind of dataset, biologists need to identify a small number of informative genes that can be used as biomarkers for a disease. Results: This paper introduces a Balanced Iterative Random Forest (BIRF) algorithm to select the most relevant genes for a disease from imbalanced high-throughput gene expression microarray data. Balanced iterative random forest is applied on four cancer microarray datasets: a childhood leukaemia dataset, which represents the main target of this paper, collected from The Children's Hospital at Westmead, NCI 60, a Colon dataset and a Lung cancer dataset. The results obtained by BIRF are compared to those of Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE), Multi-class SVM-RFE (MSVM-RFE), Random Forest (RF) and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers. The results of the BIRF approach outperform these state-of-the-art methods, especially in the case of imbalanced datasets. Experiments on the childhood leukaemia dataset show that a 7%similar to 12% better accuracy is achieved by BIRF over MSVM-RFE with the ability to predict patients in the minor class. The informative biomarkers selected by the BIRF algorithm were validated by repeating training experiments three times to see whether they are globally informative, or just selected by chance. The results show that 64% of the top genes consistently appear in the three lists, and the top 20 genes remain near the top in the other three lists. Conclusion: The designed BIRF algorithm is an appropriate choice to select genes from imbalanced high-throughput gene expression microarray data. BIRF outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, especially the ability to handle the class-imbalanced data. Moreover, the analysis of the selected genes also provides a way to distinguish between the predictive genes and those that only appear to be predictive.

Researchers have studied surrogate, neuroanatomic biomarkers provided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that may help in the early diagnosis of this condition. In this article, four classification models (naive Bayes, multivariate filter-based nave Bayes, filter selective naive Bayes and support vector machines, SVM) have been applied to evaluate their capacity to discriminate between cognitively intact patients with Parkinson's disease (PDCI), PDMCI and PDD. For this purpose, the MRI studies of 45 subjects (16 PDCI, 15 PDMCI and 14 PDD) were acquired and post-processed with Freesurfer, obtaining 112 variables (volumes of subcortical structures and thickness of cortical parcels) per subject. A multivariate filter-based naive Bayes model was found to be the best classifier, having the highest cross-validated sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Additionally, the most relevant variables related to dementia in PD, as predicted by our classifiers, were cerebral white matter, and volumes of the lateral ventricles and hippocampi.

J	Giannakopoulos, G; Palpanas, T				Giannakopoulos, George; Palpanas, Themis			Revisiting the effect of history on learning performance: the problem of the demanding lord	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Concept drift; Adaptive learning; Demanding lord problem; User modeling; Incremental learning	DRIFTING CONCEPTS; CLASSIFICATION; ENVIRONMENTS; CLASSIFIERS; ALGORITHMS; REGRESSION; TESTS; SIZE	In a variety of settings ranging from recommendation systems to information filtering, approaches which take into account feedback have been introduced to improve services and user experience. However, as also indicated in the machine learning literature, there exist several settings where the requirements and target concept of a learning system changes over time, which consists a case of "concept drift". In several systems, a sliding window over the training instances has been used to follow drifting concepts. However, no general analytic study has been performed on the relation between the size of the sliding window and the average performance of a learning system, since previous works have focused on instantaneous performance and specific underlying learners and data characteristics. This work proposes an analytic model that describes the effect of memory window size on the prediction performance of a learning system that is based on iterative feedback. The analysis considers target concepts changing over time, either periodically or randomly, using a formulation termed "the problem of the demanding lord". Using a signal-to-noise approach to sketch learning ability of underlying machine learning algorithms, we estimate the average performance of a learning system regardless of its underlying algorithm and, as a corollary, propose a stepping stone toward finding the memory window that maximizes the average performance for a given drift setting and a specific modeling system. We experimentally support the proposed methodology with very promising results on three synthetic and four real datasets, using a variety of learning algorithms including Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbor and Decision Trees on classification and regression tasks. The results validate the analysis and indicate very good estimation performance in different settings.

Design To detect clinical events, we used rules and Conditional Random Fields. We built Random Forest models to identify event modality and polarity. To identify temporal expressions we built on the HeidelTime system. To detect temporal relations, we systematically studied their breakdown into distinct situations; we designed an oracle method to determine the most prominent situations and the most suitable associated classifiers, and combined their results. Results We achieved F-measures of 0.8307 for event identification, based on rules, and 0.8385 for temporal expression identification. In the temporal relation task, we identified nine main situations in three groups, experimentally confirming shared intuitions: within-sentence relations, section-related time, and across-sentence relations. Logistic regression and Naive Bayes performed best on the first and third groups, and decision trees on the second. We reached a 0.6231 global F-measure, improving by 7.5 points our official submission. Conclusions Carefully hand-crafted rules obtained good results for the detection of events and temporal expressions, while a combination of classifiers improved temporal link prediction. The characterization of the oracle recall of situations allowed us to point at directions where further work would be most useful for temporal relation detection: within-sentence relations and linking History of Present Illness events to the admission date. We suggest that the systematic situation breakdown proposed in this paper could also help improve other systems addressing this task.

Comparative assessment of feature selection and classification techniques for visual inspection of pot plant seedlings	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Computer vision; Machine learning; Agricultural; Sorting	COMPUTER VISION	Homogeneity plays an important role in ornamental plant and flower production. As assessing the quality of seedlings is an effective way of predicting plant growth performance, a vision system capable of performing this task is desirable. Yet, the optical sorting of agricultural products must find ways to incorporate knowledge from human experts into the computational solution. Our aim is evaluating feature selection techniques with respect to the performance of vision-based inspection and classification of pot plant seedlings. A large feature set was initially obtained from seedlings images and several subsets were generated with various features selection techniques. The performance of each subset was compared to some of the most popular classifiers in the literature: Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, C4.5, Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron as well as Partial Least Squares and Support Vector Machine Discriminant Analysis. The best classifier and subset configuration is presented; our results show that feature selection was indeed advantageous, generating accuracy gains of up to 7.4%. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate the contribution of machine learning algorithms in the differentiation of glioblastomas multiforme (GB) from metastases, we developed and tested a pattern recognition system based on 3T magnetic resonance (MR) data. Materials and Methods Single and multi-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI scans were performed on 49 patients with solitary brain tumors (35 glioblastoma multiforme and 14 metastases). Metabolic (NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, (Lip Lac)/Cr) and perfusion (rCBV) parameters were measured in both intratumoral and peritumoral regions. The statistical significance of these parameters was evaluated. For the classification procedure, three datasets were created to find the optimum combination of parameters that provides maximum differentiation. Three machine learning methods were utilized: Na < ve-Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and -nearest neighbor (KNN). The discrimination ability of each classifier was evaluated with quantitative performance metrics. Results Glioblastoma and metastases were differentiable only in the peritumoral region of these lesions (). SVM achieved the highest overall performance (accuracy 98 %) for both the intratumoral and peritumoral areas. Na < ve-Bayes and KNN presented greater variations in performance. The proper selection of datasets plays a very significant role as they are closely correlated to the underlying pathophysiology. Conclusion The application of pattern recognition techniques using 3T MR-based perfusion and metabolic features may provide incremental diagnostic value in the differentiation of common intraaxial brain tumors, such as glioblastoma versus metastasis.

Physical activity classification utilizing SenseWear activity monitor in manual wheelchair users with spinal cord injury	SPINAL CORD			English	Article						spinal cord injury; physical activity; manual wheelchair users; machine learning; energy expenditure; multisensor activity monitor	ENERGY-EXPENDITURE	Study design: Validation. Objectives: The primary aim of this study was to develop and evaluate activity classification algorithms for a multisensor-based SenseWear (SW) activity monitor that can recognize wheelchair-related activities performed by manual wheelchair users (MWUs) with spinal cord injury (SCI). The secondary aim was to evaluate how the accuracy in activity classification affects the estimation of energy expenditure (EE) in MWUs with SCI. Setting: University-based laboratory. Methods: Forty-five MWUs with SCI wore a SW on their upper arm and participated in resting, wheelchair propulsion, arm-ergometery and deskwork activities. The investigators annotated the start and end of each activity trial while the SW collected multisensor data and a portable metabolic cart collected criterion EE. Three methods including linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and Naive Bayes (NB) were used to develop classification algorithms for four activities based on the training data set from 36 subjects. Results: The classification accuracy was 96.3% for QDA and 94.8% for NB when the classification algorithms were tested on the validation data set from nine subjects. The average EE estimation errors using the activity-specific EE prediction model were 5.3 +/- 21.5% and 4.6 +/- 22.8% when the QDA and NB classification algorithms were applied, respectively, as opposed to 4.9 +/- 20.7% when 100% classification accuracy was assumed. Conclusion: The high classification accuracy and low EE estimation errors suggest that the SW can be used by researchers and clinicians to classify and estimate the EE for the four activities tested in this study among MWUs with SCI.

Apparent diffusion coefficient, fractional anisotropy, and relative cerebral blood volume were measured in different tumor regions. Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine classifiers were used in the classification procedure. The application of classification methods adds incremental differential diagnostic value. Differentiation is mainly achieved using diffusion metrics, while perfusion measurements may provide significant information for the peritumoral regions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It may cause visual loss and blindness if it is not diagnosed at the early stage. Automated fundus image analysis and mass screening may help to detect the disease at early stage. In this work, we have developed an automated glaucoma detection system using relative energy and entropy features of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). These features were tested for statistical significance using independent sample t-test. Then the selected features were fed to the set of supervised classifiers (Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Fuzzy, k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Naive Bayes (NB) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN)) to select the best classifier. Fuzzy classifier yielded the highest accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 93.33%. The performance of the system can be further improved using better features and robust classifiers.	[Koh, Joel E.

Electrocardiogram (ECG), can assist in diagnosing DM by identifying abnormalities within the signals. In this study, we have developed an algorithm that uses Heart Rate Variability (HRV) obtained from ECG signals to detect diabetes. Third order cumulants of Higher Order Spectra (HOS) is used to analyze the HRV signals. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and student test is employed to extract features and select them before classifying them using seven different classifiers, namely Fuzzy classifier, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Naive Bayes classifier (NBC), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Decision Tree (DT) classifier. The performances of the classifiers were evaluated by calculating values of their accuracy, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), sensitivity and specificity. The accuracy for the classifiers ranges between 52.76% and 79.93%. SVM using RBF kernel has achieved the highest accuracy with 79.93%.

Application of a Bayesian Classifier of Anomalous Propagation to Single-Polarization Radar Reflectivity Data	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Data quality control; Radars; Radar observations; Bayesian methods	WEATHER RADAR; NONPRECIPITATING ECHOES; IDENTIFICATION; CLUTTER	A naive Bayes classifier (NBC) was developed to distinguish precipitation echoes from anomalous propagation (anaprop). The NBC is an application of Bayes's theorem, which makes its classification decision based on the class with the maximum a posteriori probability. Several feature fields were input to the Bayes classifier: texture of reflectivity (TDBZ), a measure of the reflectivity fluctuations (SPIN), and vertical profile of reflectivity (VPDBZ). Prior conditional probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the feature fields were constructed from training sets for several meteorological scenarios and for anaprop. A Box-Cox transform was applied to transform these PDFs to approximate Gaussian distributions, which enabled efficient numerical computation as they could be specified completely by their mean and standard deviation. Combinations of the feature fields were tested on the training datasets to evaluate the best combination for discriminating anaprop and precipitation, which was found to be TDBZ and VPDBZ. The NBC was applied to a case of convective rain embedded in anaprop and found to be effective at distinguishing the echoes. Furthermore, despite having been trained with data from a single radar, the NBC was successful at distinguishing precipitation and anaprop from two nearby radars with differing wavelength and beamwidth characteristics. The NBC was extended to implement a strength of classification index that provides a metric to quantify the confidence with which data have been classified as precipitation and, consequently, a method to censor data for assimilation or quantitative precipitation estimation.

Embedding holistic appearance information in part-based adaptive appearance model for robust visual tracking	ELECTRONICS LETTERS			English	Article						Bayes methods; image classification; image representation; object tracking; embedding holistic appearance information; part-based adaptive appearance model; robust visual tracking; naive Bayes classifier; sparse multiscale Haar-like features; object representation; blooming discriminative trackers		Part-based adaptive appearance model has been extensively used in increasingly popular discriminative trackers. The main problem of these methods is the stability plasticity dilemma. Embedding holistic appearance information in the part-based appearance model which is learned online to alleviate this problem is proposed. Specifically, the object is represented by sparse multi-scale Haar-like features and the appearance model is constructed with a naive Bayes classifier. Unlike the conventional methods, the classifier is trained by positive and negative samples that are weighted according to their similarity with the holistic appearance model, which is kept constant during the updating procedure. The constant holistic appearance information providing some constraints when updating the part-based appearance model makes the tracker more stable. The online updating procedure of the part-based appearance model makes the tracker adaptive enough to appearance changes. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared with several state-of-art algorithms.	[Zeng, F. X.; Huang, Z. T.; Ji, Y.

Similarity maps - a visualization strategy for molecular fingerprints and machine-learning methods	JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS			English	Article						Visualization; Machine-learning; Similarity; Fingerprints	DOPAMINE D3 RECEPTOR; LIGANDS; MODELS; DESIGN	Fingerprint similarity is a common method for comparing chemical structures. Similarity is an appealing approach because, with many fingerprint types, it provides intuitive results: a chemist looking at two molecules can understand why they have been determined to be similar. This transparency is partially lost with the fuzzier similarity methods that are often used for scaffold hopping and tends to vanish completely when molecular fingerprints are used as inputs to machine-learning (ML) models. Here we present similarity maps, a straightforward and general strategy to visualize the atomic contributions to the similarity between two molecules or the predicted probability of a ML model. We show the application of similarity maps to a set of dopamine D3 receptor ligands using atom-pair and circular fingerprints as well as two popular ML methods: random forests and naive Bayes. An open-source implementation of the method is provided.

J	Zigkolis, C; Karagiannidis, S; Koumarelas, I; Vakali, A				Zigkolis, Christos; Karagiannidis, Savvas; Koumarelas, Ioannis; Vakali, Athena			Integrating similarity and dissimilarity notions in recommenders	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Recommender systems; Dissimilarity recommender; Distributed framework	SYSTEMS	Collaborative recommenders rely on the assumption that similar users may exhibit similar tastes while content-based ones favour items that found to be similar with the items a user likes. Weak related entities, which are often considered to be useful, are neglected by those similarity-driven recommenders. To take advantage of this neglected information, we introduce a novel dissimilarity-based recommender that bases its estimations on degrees of dissimilarities among items' attributes. However, instead of using the proposed recommender as a stand-alone method, we combine it with similarity-based ones to maintain the selective nature of the latter while detecting, through our recommender, information that may have been overlooked. Such combinations are established by IANOS, a proposed framework through which we increase the accuracy of two popular similarity-based recommenders (Naive Bayes and Slope-One) after their combination with our algorithm. Improved accuracy results in experimentation on two datasets (Yahoo! Movies and Movielens) enhance our reasoning. However, the proposed recommender comes with an additional computational complexity when combined with other techniques. By using Hadoop technology, we developed a distributed version of IANOS through which execution time was reduced. Evaluation on IANOS procedures in terms of time performance endorses the use of distributed implementations. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, C; Cao, LB; Miao, BQ				Wang, Cheng; Cao, Longbing; Miao, Baiqi			Optimal feature selection for sparse linear discriminant analysis and its applications in gene expression data	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Feature selection; High-dimensional classification; Large p, small n; Linear discriminant analysis (LDA); Misclassification rate; Naive Bayes	CLASSIFICATION; CANCER; SENSITIVITY; PREDICTION; DISCOVERY; SPACE	This work studies the theoretical rules of feature selection in linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and a new feature selection method is proposed for sparse linear discriminant analysis. An l(1) minimization method is used to select the important features from which the LDA will be constructed. The asymptotic results of this proposed two-stage LDA (TLDA) are studied, demonstrating that TLDA is an optimal classification rule whose convergence rate is the best compared to existing methods. The experiments on simulated and real datasets are consistent with the theoretical results and show that TLDA performs favorably in comparison with current methods. Overall, TLDA uses a lower minimum number of features or genes than other approaches to achieve a better result with a reduced misclassification rate. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Several tools have been released to map an unknown molecular entity to one of the known classes using solely its sequence data. However, all of the existing tools are problem-specific and restricted to an alphabet constrained by relevant biological structure. Here, we introduce TRAINER, a new online tool designed to serve as a generic sequence classification platform to enable users provide their own training data with any alphabet therein defined. TRAINER allows users to select among several feature representation schemes and supervised machine learning methods with relevant parameters. Trained models can be saved for future use without retraining by other users. Two case studies are reported for effective use of the system for DNA and protein sequences; candidate effector prediction and nucleolar localization signal prediction. Biological relevance of the results is discussed.

We identified 87 signature positions in AIV protein sequences with information entropy method and encoded these positions with five amino acid factor scores (AAFactors) concentrated from 491 physicochemical and biochemical properties of amino acids. We constructed four prediction models by integrating these five features with commonly used machine learning technologies including Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. The cross validation experiment results demonstrated the power of AAFactors in predicting avian-to-human transmission of AIVs. Comparative analysis revealed the strengths and weaknesses of different machine learning methods, and the importance of different AAFactors to the prediction.

J	Fang, X				Fang, Xiao			Inference-Based Naive Bayes: Turning Naive Bayes Cost-Sensitive	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Cost-sensitive classification; Naive Bayes; classification	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR CLASSIFICATION; PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFIERS; ALGORITHMS; CHOICE; TREES	A fundamental challenge for developing a cost-sensitive Naive Bayes method is how to effectively classify an instance based on the cost-sensitive threshold computed under the assumption of knowing the instance's true classification probabilities and the highly biased estimations of these probabilities by the Naive Bayes method. To address this challenge, we develop a cost-sensitive Naive Bayes method from a novel perspective of inferring the order relation (e. g., greater than or equal to, less than) between an instance's true classification probability of belonging to the class of interest and the cost-sensitive threshold. Our method learns and infers the order relation from the training data and classifies the instance based on the inferred order relation. We empirically show that our proposed method significantly outperforms major existing methods for turning Naive Bayes cost-sensitive through experiments with UCI data sets and a real-world case study.

Therefore, the search of names of persons or of organizations is difficult as soon as a single name might appear in many different forms. This paper proposes two approaches to disambiguate on the affiliations of authors of scientific papers in bibliographic databases: the first way considers that a training dataset is available, and uses a Naive Bayes model. The second way assumes that there is no learning resource, and uses a semi-supervised approach, mixing soft-clustering and Bayesian learning. The results are encouraging and the approach is already partially applied in a scientific survey department. However, our experiments also highlight that our approach has some limitations: it cannot process efficiently highly unbalanced data. Alternatives solutions are possible for future developments, particularly with the use of a recent clustering algorithm relying on feature maximization.

JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Text mining; Information retrieval; Natural language processing; Question answering; Information extraction; Evidence-based medicine	CLINICAL QUESTIONS	Efficient identification of patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) components in medical articles is helpful in evidence-based medicine. The purpose of this study is to clarify whether first sentences of these components are good enough to train naive Bayes classifiers for sentence-level PICO element detection. We extracted 19,854 structured abstracts of randomized controlled trials with any P/I/O label from PubMed for naive Bayes classifiers training. Performances of classifiers trained by first sentences of each section (CF) and those trained by all sentences (CA) were compared using all sentences by ten-fold cross-validation. The results measured by recall, precision, and F-measures show that there are no significant differences in performance between CF and CA for detection of O-element (F-measure = 0.731 +/- 0.009 vs. 0.738 +/- 0.010, p = 0.123). However, CA perform better for I-elements, in terms of recall (0.752 +/- 0.012 vs. 0.620 +/- 0.007, p < 0.001) and F-measures (0.728 +/- 0.006 vs. 0.662 +/- 0.007, p < 0.001). For P-elements, CF have higher precision (0.714 +/- 0.009 vs. 0.665 +/- 0.010, p < 0.001), but lower recall (0.766 +/- 0.013 vs. 0.811 +/- 0.012, p < 0.001). CF are not always better than CA in sentence-level PICO element detection. Their performance varies in detecting different elements. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Identification of key clinical phenotypes of breast cancer using a reduced panel of protein biomarkers	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article							GENE-EXPRESSION PROFILES; MOLECULAR PORTRAITS; CLASSIFICATION; CARCINOMA; PATTERNS; SUBTYPES; TUMORS; BASAL; RECOMMENDATIONS; PLATFORMS	Background: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease characterised by complex molecular alterations underlying the varied behaviour and response to therapy. However, translation of cancer genetic profiling for use in routine clinical practice remains elusive or prohibitively expensive. As an alternative, immunohistochemical analysis applied to routinely processed tissue samples could be used to identify distinct biological classes of breast cancer. Methods: In this study, 1073 archival breast tumours previously assessed for 25 key breast cancer biomarkers using immunohistochemistry and classified using clustering algorithms were further refined using naive Bayes classification performance. Criteria for class membership were defined using the expression of a reduced panel of 10 proteins able to identify key molecular classes. We examined the association between these breast cancer classes with clinicopathological factors and patient outcome. Results: We confirm patient classification similar to established genotypic biological classes of breast cancer in addition to novel sub-divisions of luminal and basal tumours. Correlations between classes and clinicopathological parameters were in line with expectations and showed highly significant association with patient outcome. Furthermore, our novel biological class stratification provides additional prognostic information to the Nottingham Prognostic Index. Conclusion: This study confirms that distinct molecular phenotypes of breast cancer can be identified using robust and routinely available techniques and both the luminal and basal breast cancer phenotypes are heterogeneous and contain distinct subgroups.

The subjective-objective mismatch in sleep perception among those with insomnia and sleep apnea	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						misperception; paradoxical; self-report; subjective	STATE MISPERCEPTION; TIME-ESTIMATION; LONG-TERM; DURATION; ADULTS; METAANALYSIS; VARIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; SUFFERERS; ONSET	The diagnosis and management of insomnia relies primarily on clinical history. However, patient self-report of sleep-wake times may not agree with objective measurements. We hypothesized that those with shallow or fragmented sleep would under-report sleep quantity, and that this might account for some of the mismatch. We compared objective and subjective sleep-wake times for 277 patients who underwent diagnostic polysomnography. The group included those with insomnia symptoms (n=92), obstructive sleep apnea (n=66) or both (n=119). Mismatch of wake duration was context dependent: all three groups overestimated sleep latency but underestimated wakefulness after sleep onset. The insomnia group underestimated total sleep time by a median of 81min. However, contrary to our hypothesis, measures of fragmentation (N1, arousal index, sleep efficiency, etc.) did not correlate with the subjective sleep duration estimates. To unmask a potential relationship between sleep architecture and subjective duration, we tested three hypotheses: N1 is perceived as wake; sleep bouts under 10min are perceived as wake; or N1 and N2 are perceived in a weighted fashion. None of these hypotheses exposed a match between subjective and objective sleep duration. We show only modest performance of a Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm for predicting mismatch using clinical and polysomnographic variables. Subjective-objective mismatch is common in patients reporting insomnia symptoms. We conclude that mismatch was not attributable to commonly measured polysomnographic measures of fragmentation. Further insight is needed into the complex relationships between subjective perception of sleep and conventional, objective measurements.

Methods: Twenty-four antiretroviral-naive R5 HIV-1-infected participants received maraviroc 150 mg and darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) 800/100 mg (MVC/DRV/r) once daily. The primary outcome was virologic failure (VF) = confirmed viral load (VL) >50 copies per milliliter at week 24 in the modified intent-to-treat population. To determine viral dynamics, participant-specific first-and second-phase empirical Bayes estimates were compared with decay rates from efavirenz (EFV) plus lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir plus 2NRTIs, and EFV plus 2NRTIs. Maraviroc plasma concentrations were determined at weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48. Results: Baseline median (Q1, Q3) CD4 count and VL were 455 (299, 607) cells per cubic millimeter and 4.62 (4.18, 4.80) log(10) copies per milliliter, respectively. VF occurred in 3 of 24 participants {12.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.7 to 32.4]} at week 24. One of these resuppressed, yielding a week 48 VF rate of 2/24 [8.3% (95% CI: 1.0 to 27.0)]. The week 48 failures were 2 of the 4 participants (50%) with baseline VL >100,000 copies per milliliter. Week 96 VF rate was 2/20 [10% (95% CI: 1.2 to 31.7)]. Phase 1 decay was faster with MVC/DRV/r than reported for ritonavir-boosted lopinavir plus 2NRTIs (P = 0.0063) and similar to EFV-based regimens. Individual maraviroc trough concentrations collected between 20 and 28 hours post dose (n = 59) was 13.7 to 130 ng/mL (Q(1), 23.4 ng/mL; Q(3), 46.5 ng/mL), and modeled steady-state concentration was 128 ng/mL. Conclusions: MVC/DRV/r 150/800/100 mg once daily has potential for treatment-naive patients with R5 HIV-1.

We examined depression within a multidimensional framework consisting of genetic, environmental, and sociobehavioral factors and, using machine learning algorithms, explored interactions among these factors that might better explain the etiology of depressive symptoms. Methods. We measured current depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (n = 6378 participants in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study). Genetic factors were 78 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); environmental factors-13 stressful life events (SLEs), plus a composite proportion of SLEs index; and sociobehavioral factors-18 personality, intelligence, and other health or behavioral measures. We performed traditional SNP associations via logistic regression likelihood ratio testing and explored interactions with support vector machines and Bayesian networks. Results. After correction for multiple testing, we found no significant single genotypic associations with depressive symptoms. Machine learning algorithms showed no evidence of interactions. Naive Bayes produced the best models in both subsets and included only environmental and sociobehavioral factors. Conclusions. We found no single or interactive associations with genetic factors and depressive symptoms. Various environmental and sociobehavioral factors were more predictive of depressive symptoms, yet their impacts were independent of one another. A genome-wide analysis of genetic alterations using machine learning methodologies will provide a framework for identifying genetic-environmental-sociobehavioral interactions in depressive symptoms.

It is particularly useful in dimensionality reduction for selecting features with high discriminative power. This paper introduces a new feature-selection method called Feature Interaction Maximisation (FIM), which employs three-way interaction information as a measure of feature redundancy. It uses a forward greedy search to select features which have maximum interaction information with the features already selected, and which provide maximum relevance. The experiments conducted to verify the performance of the proposed method use three datasets from the UCI repository. The method is compared with four other well-known feature-selection methods: Information Gain (IG), Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR), Double Input Symmetrical Relevance (DISR), and Interaction Gain Based Feature Selection (IGFS). The average classification accuracy of two classifiers, Naive Bayes and K-nearest neighbour, is used to assess the performance of the new feature-selection method. The results show that FIM outperforms the other methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To identify 30 ends, most techniques use an oligo-dT primer to construct deep sequencing libraries. However, this approach can lead to identification of artifactual polyadenylation sites due to internal priming in homopolymeric stretches of adenines. Although heuristic filters have been applied in these cases, they typically result in a high proportion of both false-positive and -negative classifications. Therefore, there is a need to develop improved algorithms to better identify mis-priming events in oligo-dT primed sequences. Results: By analyzing sequence features flanking 30 ends derived from oligo-dT-based sequencing, we developed a naive Bayes classifier to classify them as true or false/internally primed. The resulting algorithm is highly accurate, outperforms previous heuristic filters and facilitates identification of novel polyadenylation sites.

J	Liu, W; Xie, HW				Liu, Wei; Xie, Hongwei			Prediction of regulation relationship between protein interactions in signaling networks	BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Regulation relationship; Protein interaction; Signaling network; Logistic regression	DATABASE; MAP; GENOMES	The discovery of regulation relationship of protein interactions is crucial for the mechanism research in signaling network. Bioinformatics methods can be used to accelerate the discovery of regulation relationship between protein interactions, to distinguish the activation relations from inhibition relations. In this paper, we describe a novel method to predict the regulation relations of protein interactions in the signaling network. We detected 4,417 domain pairs that were significantly enriched in the activation or inhibition dataset. Three machine learning methods, logistic regression, support vector machines(SVMs), and naive bayes, were explored in the classifier models. The prediction power of three different models was evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation and the independent test dataset. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for logistic regression, SVM, and naive bayes models was 0.946, 0.905 and 0.809, respectively. Finally, the logistic regression classifier was applied to the human proteome-wide interaction dataset, and 2,591 interactions were predicted with their regulation relations, with 2,048 in activation and 543 in inhibition. This model based on domains can be used to identify the regulation relations between protein interactions and furthermore reconstruct signaling pathways. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Two different DSS learning strategies have been tested - a standalone classifier and classifier ensemble application. Such classification algorithms as C4.5, CART, JRip and Naive Bayes were used as base classifiers. The classifiers were evaluated on the respondent medical data from an inquiry form, containing 28 attributes and 840 records. The dataset was preprocessed using simple methods in initial data analysis as well as more complex data mining methods for feature selection. The obtained results are summarized and discussed in order to summarize an information on what learning strategies are more applicable to the present dataset and should be studied in more detail in primary research.

A novel approach to predict subjective pain perception from single-trial laser-evoked potentials	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Pain; Laser-evoked potentials (LEPs); Pain prediction; Classification; Regression	PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; MULTIPLE LINEAR-REGRESSION; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; CO2-LASER STIMULATION; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; EFNS GUIDELINES; HUMAN BRAIN; EEG; RESPONSES; AMPLITUDE	Pain is a subjective first-person experience, and self-report is the gold standard for pain assessment in clinical practice. However, self-report of pain is not available in some vulnerable populations (e.g., patients with disorders of consciousness), which leads to an inadequate or suboptimal treatment of pain. Therefore, the availability of a physiology-based and objective assessment of pain that complements the self-report would be of great importance in various applications. Here, we aimed to develop a novel and practice-oriented approach to predict pain perception from single-trial laser-evoked potentials (LEPs). We applied a novel single-trial analysis approach that combined common spatial pattern and multiple linear regression to automatically and reliably estimate single-trial LEP features. Further, we adopted a Naive Bayes classifier to discretely predict low and high pain and a multiple linear prediction model to continuously predict the intensity of pain perception from single-trial LEP features, at both within- and cross-individual levels. Our results showed that the proposed approach provided a binary prediction of pain (classification of low pain and high pain) with an accuracy of 863 +/- 8.4% (within-individual) and 80.3 +/- 8.5% (cross-individual), and a continuous prediction of pain (regression on a continuous scale from 0 to 10) with a mean absolute error of 1.031 +/- 0.136 (within-individual) and 1.821 +/- 0.202 (cross-individual). Thus, the proposed approach may help establish a fast and reliable tool for automated prediction of pain, which could be potentially adopted in various basic and clinical applications.

The Naive Bayes probability values of the amino-acid substitutions at the respective site-wise recombination were utilized to formulate the proposed Genetic Mutant Marker Extraction (GMME) technique that could unearth the hot spot cancer, strong rescue and weak rescue mutants. The p53 mutation records depicting the amino-acid substitutions obtained by yeast assays comprising of nearly 16,700 records, available at the University of California, Machine Learning Repository, were utilized as the training dataset for the GMME technique. The proposed GMME technique revealed the hot spot cancer mutants, strong rescue and weak rescue mutants leading to the detection of probable genetic markers for Cancer prediction from the surface regions 96-289 constituting the second, third and fourth site recombinations. Thus far, computational approaches have been able to predict rescue markers at region-specific mutations (96-105, 114-123, 130-156 and 223-232) with respect to the second site recombination for three hot spot cancer mutants only viz, P152L, R158L and G245S. The GMME technique aimed at predicting possible rescue markers for p53 mutants at the second, third and fourth site recombinations revealing novel rescue markers for fourteen hot spot cancer mutants. Moreover, the GMME technique can be extended effectively to increasing number of recombinant sites that can be efficiently utilized to predict novel rescue markers.	[Ramani, R.

We show analytically that the probability of error for IGS is higher than naive Bayes classification with zero-one loss (NB). We show empirically that IGS does not perform well, even for data that satisfies all its assumptions.

In particular, the appearance model is constructed with a naive Bayes classifier which is trained utilizing sparse multi-scale Haar-like features weighted by a spatial kernel function. Moreover, multiple image cues are integrated to improve the model's discriminative capacity. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method to many state-of-art algorithms.

J	Cao, J; Wu, Z; Mao, B; Zhang, YC				Cao, Jie; Wu, Zhiang; Mao, Bo; Zhang, Yanchun			Shilling attack detection utilizing semi-supervised learning method for collaborative recommender system	WORLD WIDE WEB-INTERNET AND WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						semi-supervised learning; shilling attack detection; collaborative filtering; naive Bayes; EM	CLASSIFICATION; SAMPLES	Collaborative filtering (CF) technique is capable of generating personalized recommendations. However, the recommender systems utilizing CF as their key algorithms are vulnerable to shilling attacks which insert malicious user profiles into the systems to push or nuke the reputations of targeted items. There are only a small number of labeled users in most of the practical recommender systems, while a large number of users are unlabeled because it is expensive to obtain their identities. In this paper, Semi-SAD, a new semi-supervised learning based shilling attack detection algorithm is proposed to take advantage of both types of data. It first trains a na < ve Bayes classifier on a small set of labeled users, and then incorporates unlabeled users with EM-lambda to improve the initial na < ve Bayes classifier. Experiments on MovieLens datasets are implemented to compare the efficiency of Semi-SAD with supervised learning based detector and unsupervised learning based detector. The results indicate that Semi-SAD can better detect various kinds of shilling attacks than others, especially against obfuscated and hybrid shilling attacks.

In particular, there has been a boom in soccer video analysis research. This paper presents a new multi-step algorithm to automatically detect the soccer ball in image sequences acquired from static cameras. In each image, candidate ball regions are selected by analyzing edge circularity and then ball patterns are extracted representing locally affine invariant regions around distinctive points which have been highlighted automatically. The effectiveness of the proposed methodologies is demonstrated through a huge number of experiments using real balls under challenging conditions, as well as a favorable comparison with some of the leading approaches from the literature.

Gene selection is an important step for improved diagnostics. The modified SFFS (sequential forward floating selection) algorithm based on weighted Mahalanobis distance, called MSWM, is proposed to identify optimal informative gene subsets taking into account joint discriminatory power for accurate discrimination in this study. Firstly, we make use of the one-dimensional weighted Mahalanobis distance to perform a preliminary selection of genes and then make use of the modified SFFS method and multidimensional weighted Mahalanobis distance to obtain the optimal informative gene subset for tumor classification. Finally, we used the k nearest neighbor and naive Bayes methods to classify tumors based on the optimal gene subset selected using the MSWM method. To validate the efficiency, the proposed MSWM method is applied to classify two different DNA microarray datasets. Our empirical study shows that the MSWM method for tumor classification can obtain better effectiveness of classification than the BWR (the ratio of between-groups to within-groups sum of squares) and IVGA_I (independent variable group analysis I) methods. It suggests that the MSWM gene selection method is ability to obtain correct informative gene subsets taking into account genes' joint discriminatory power for tumor classification.

Heterogeneous Classifier Fusion for Ligand-Based Virtual Screening: Or, How Decision Making by Committee Can Be a Good Thing	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							BIOACTIVE REFERENCE STRUCTURES; RANDOM FOREST; DESCRIPTORS; COMBINATION; FINGERPRINTS; PERFORMANCE; DIVERSITY; ENSEMBLES; SELECTION; SETS	The concept of data fusion - the combination of information from different sources describing the same object with the expectation to generate a more accurate representation - has found application in a very broad range of disciplines. In the context of ligand-based virtual screening (VS), data fusion has been applied to combine knowledge from either different active molecules or different fingerprints to improve similarity search performance. Machine-learning (ML) methods based on fusion of multiple homogeneous classifiers, in particular random forests, have also been widely applied in the ML literature. The heterogeneous version of classifier fusion - fusing the predictions from different model types - has been less explored. Here, we investigate heterogeneous classifier fusion for ligand-based VS using three different ML methods, RF, naive Bayes (NB), and logistic regression (LR), with four 2D fingerprints, atom pairs, topological torsions, RDKit fingerprint, and circular fingerprint. The methods are compared using a previously developed benchmarking platform for 2D fingerprints which is extended to ML methods in this article. The original data sets are filtered for difficulty, and a new set of challenging data sets from ChEMBL is added. Data sets were also generated for a second use case: starting from a small set of related actives instead of diverse actives. The final fused model consistently outperforms the other approaches across the broad variety of targets studied, indicating that heterogeneous classifier fusion is a very promising approach for ligand-based VS. The new data sets together with the adapted source code for ML methods are provided in the Supporting Information.

This is actually the first study to employ state-of-the-art classification methods for this purpose. Methods and materials: During 2009-2010, 1000 participants were enrolled; 250 consecutive patients with a first ACS and 250 controls (60 +/- 12 years, 83% males), as well as 250 consecutive patients with a first stroke and 250 controls (75 +/- 9 years, 56% males). The controls were population-based and age-sex matched to the patients. The a-priori dietary patterns were derived from the validated MedDietScore, whereas the a-posteriori ones were extracted from principal components analysis. Both approaches were modeled using six classification algorithms: multiple logistic regression (MLR), naive Bayes, decision trees, repeated incremental pruning to produce error reduction (RIPPER), artificial neural networks and support vector machines. The classification accuracy of the resulting models was evaluated using the C-statistic. Results: For the ACS prediction, the C-statistic varied from 0.587 (RIPPER) to 0.807 (MLR) for the a-priori analysis, while for the a-posteriori one, it fluctuated between 0.583 (RIPPER) and 0.827 (MLR). For the stroke prediction, the C-statistic varied from 0.637 (RIPPER) to 0.767 (MLR) for the a-priori analysis, and from 0.617 (decision tree) to 0.780 (MLR) for the a-posteriori. Conclusion: Both dietary pattern approaches achieved equivalent classification accuracy over most classification algorithms. The choice, therefore, depends on the application at hand.

This is especially relevant in the fishing industry where closely related fish samples can be mislabeled, and the high market value of certain fish leads to the use of alternative species as substitutes, for example, Barramundi and Nile Perch (belonging to the same genus, Lates). There is a need to combine selective proteomic datasets with sophisticated computational analysis to devise a robust classification approach. This paper describes an integrated MS-based proteomics and bioinformatics approach to classifying a range of fish samples. A classifier is developed using training data that successfully discriminates between Barramundi and Nile Perch samples using a selected protein subset of the proteome. Additionally, the classifier is shown to successfully discriminate between test samples not used to develop the classifier, including samples that have been cooked, and to classify other fish species as neither Barramundi nor Nile Perch. This approach has applications to truth in labeling for fishmongers and restaurants, monitoring fish catches, and for scientific research into distances between species.

J	Maleki, M; Vasudev, G; Rueda, L				Maleki, Mina; Vasudev, Gokul; Rueda, Luis			The role of electrostatic energy in prediction of obligate protein-protein interactions	PROTEOME SCIENCE			English	Article							FEATURE-SELECTION; RECOGNITION SITES; INTERFACES; SURFACES	Background: Prediction and analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPI) and specifically types of PPIs is an important problem in life science research because of the fundamental roles of PPIs in many biological processes in living cells. In addition, electrostatic interactions are important in understanding inter-molecular interactions, since they are long-range, and because of their influence in charged molecules. This is the main motivation for using electrostatic energy for prediction of PPI types. Results: We propose a prediction model to analyze protein interaction types, namely obligate and non-obligate, using electrostatic energy values as properties. The prediction approach uses electrostatic energy values for pairs of atoms and amino acids present in interfaces where the interaction occurs. The main features of the complexes are found and then the prediction is performed via several state-of-the-art classification techniques, including linear dimensionality reduction (LDR), support vector machine (SVM), naive Bayes (NB) and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN). For an in-depth analysis of classification results, some other experiments were performed by varying the distance cutoffs between atom pairs of interacting chains, ranging from 5 angstrom to 13 angstrom. Moreover, several feature selection algorithms including gain ratio (GR), information gain (IG), chi-square (Chi2) and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) are applied on the available datasets to obtain more discriminative pairs of atom types and amino acid types as features for prediction. Conclusions: Our results on two well-known datasets of obligate and non-obligate complexes confirm that electrostatic energy is an important property to predict obligate and non-obligate protein interaction types on the basis of all the experimental results, achieving accuracies of over 98%. Furthermore, a comparison performed by changing the distance cutoff demonstrates that the best values for prediction of PPI types using electrostatic energy range from 9 angstrom to 12 angstrom, which show that electrostatic interactions are long-range and cover a broader area in the interface. In addition, the results on using feature selection before prediction confirm that (a) a few pairs of atoms and amino acids are appropriate for prediction, and (b) prediction performance can be improved by eliminating irrelevant and noisy features and selecting the most discriminative ones.

However, these PPI networks are always built from high-throughput experiments. The presence of unreliable interactions in PPI network makes this task very challenging. Methods: In this study, we proposed a Genetic-Algorithm Fuzzy Naive Bayes (GAFNB) filter to classify the protein complexes from candidate subgraphs. It takes unreliability into consideration and tackles the presence of unreliable interactions in protein complex. We first got candidate protein complexes through existed popular methods. Each candidate protein complex is represented by 29 graph features and 266 biological property based features. GAFNB model is then applied to classify the candidate complexes into positive or negative. Results: Our evaluation indicates that the protein complex identification algorithms using the GAFNB model filtering outperform original ones. For evaluation of GAFNB model, we also compared the performance of GAFNB with Naive Bayes (NB). Results show that GAFNB performed better than NB. It indicates that a fuzzy model is more suitable when unreliability is present. Conclusions: We conclude that filtering candidate protein complexes with GAFNB model can improve the effectiveness of protein complex identification. It is necessary to consider the unreliability in this task.

The propensity score matching (PSM) method is employed to do this. A naive before and after approach and the empirical Bayes (EB) method are compared with the PSM method. A total of 771 sites and 4787 sites for the treatment and the potential reference groups respectively are observed for a period of 9 years in England. Both the PSM and the EB methods show similar results that there are significant reductions in the number of accidents of all severities at speed camera sites. It is suggested that the propensity score can be used as the criteria for selecting the reference group in before-after control studies.

J	Thomas, A; Oommen, BJ				Thomas, A.; Oommen, B. John			Order statistics-based parametric classification for multi-dimensional distributions	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Classification using Order Statistics (OS); Moments of OS; Multi-dimensional OS-based classification		Traditionally, in the field of Pattern Recognition (PR), the moments of the class-conditional densities of the respective classes have been used to perform classification. However, the use of phenomena that utilized the properties of the Order Statistics (OS) were not reported. Recently, in [10,8], we proposed a new paradigm named CMOS, Classification by the Moments of Order Statistics, which specifically used these quantifiers. It is fascinating that CMOS is essentially "anti"-Bayesian in its nature because the classification is performed in a counter-intuitive manner, i.e., by comparing the testing sample to a few samples distant from the mean, as opposed to the Bayesian approach in which the task is based on the central points of the distributions. In our initial works, we proposed the foundational theory of CMOS for the uni-dimensional Uniform and some other distributions. These results were extended for various symmetric and asymmetric uni-dimensional distributions within the exponential family in [8]. In this paper, we generalize these results for multi-dimensional distributions. The multi-dimensional generalization is particularly non-trivial because there is no well-established method for achieving the ordering of multi-dimensional data specified in terms of its uni-dimensional components. The strategy is analogous to a Naive-Bayes' approach, although it really is of an anti-Naive-Bayes' paradigm. We provide here the analytical and experimental results for the 2-dimensional Uniform, Doubly Exponential and Gaussian distributions, and also clearly specify the way by which one should extend the results for higher dimensions. The analogous results for the other distributions in the exponential family, which were discussed in [10,8] are alluded to, but omitted to avoid repetition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Shekofteh, Y; Almasganj, F				Shekofteh, Yasser; Almasganj, Farshad			Autoregressive modeling of speech trajectory transformed to the reconstructed phase space for ASR purposes	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Feature extraction; Speech recognition system; Signal embedding; Reconstructed phase space; Multivariate autoregressive model	RECOGNITION; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEMS	Investigating new effective feature extraction methods applied to the speech signal is an important approach to improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Owing to the fact that the reconstructed phase space (RPS) is a proper field for true detection of signal dynamics, in this paper we propose a new method for feature extraction from the trajectory of the speech signal in the RPS. This method is based upon modeling the speech trajectory using the multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) method. Moreover, in the following, we benefit from linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for dimension reduction. The LDA technique is utilized to simultaneously decorrelate and reduce the dimension of the, final feature set. Experimental results show that the MVAR of order 6 is appropriate for modeling the trajectory of speech signals in the RPS. In this study recognition experiments are conducted with an HMM-based continuous speech recognition system and a naive Bayes isolated phoneme classifier on the Persian FARSDAT and American English TIMIT corpora to compare the proposed features to some older RPS-based and traditional spectral-based MFCC features.

Insurance datasets will continue to increase in size as more variables are added to aid in managing client risk and will therefore be even more vulnerable to missing data. This paper proposes a hybrid multi-layered artificial immune system and genetic algorithm for partial imputation of missing data in datasets with numerous variables. The multi-layered artificial immune system creates and stores antibodies that bind to and annihilate an antigen. The genetic algorithm optimises the learning process of a stimulated antibody. The evaluation of the imputation is performed using the RIPPER, k-nearest neighbour, naive Bayes and logistic discriminant classifiers. The effect of the imputation on the classifiers is compared with that of the mean/mode and hot deck imputation methods. The results demonstrate that when missing data imputation is performed using the proposed hybrid method, the classification improves and the robustness to the amount of missing data is increased relative to the mean/mode method for data missing completely at random (MCAR) missing at random (MAR), and not missing at random (NMAR).The imputation performance is similar to or marginally better than that of the hot deck imputation.

Among these metrics, Short and Fukunaga metric (SFM) and minimum risk metric (MRM) are two probability-based metrics which are widely used to find reasonable distance between each pair of instances with nominal attributes only. For simplicity, existing works use naive Bayesian (NB) classifiers to estimate class membership probabilities in SFM and MRM. However, it has been proved that the ability of NB classifiers to class probability estimation is poor. In order to scale up the classification performance of NB classifiers, many augmented NB classifiers are proposed. In this paper, we study the class probability estimation performance of these augmented NB classifiers and then use them to estimate the class membership probabilities in SFM and MRM. The experimental results based on a large number of University of California, Irvine (UCI) data-sets show that using these augmented NB classifiers to estimate the class membership probabilities in SFM and MRM can significantly enhance their generalisation ability.

J	Zhao, CH; Zhang, BL; He, J				Zhao, Chihang; Zhang, Bailing; He, Jie			Vision-based Classification of Driving Postures by Efficient Feature Extraction and Bayesian Approach	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & ROBOTIC SYSTEMS			English	Article						Driver assistance system; Driver behavior; Driving posture; Feature extraction; Bayes classifier	DRIVER ASSISTANCE; RECOGNITION; POSE	Reports of traffic accidents show that a considerable percentage of the accidents are caused by human factors. Human-centric driver assistance systems, with integrated sensing, processing and networking, aim to find solutions to this problem and other relevant issues. The key technology in such systems is the capability to automatically understand and characterize driver behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel, efficient feature extraction approach for driving postures from a video camera, which consists of Homomorphic filter, skin-like regions segmentation, canny edge detection, connected regions detection, small connected regions deletion and spatial scale ratio calculation. With features extracted from a driving posture dataset we created at Southeast University (SEU), holdout and cross-validation experiments on driving posture classification are then conducted using Bayes classifier. Compared with a number of commonly used classification methods including naive Bayes classifier, subspace classifier, linear perception classifier and Parzen classifier, the holdout and cross-validation experiments show that the Bayes classifier offers better classification performance than the other four classifiers. Among the four predefined classes, i.e., grasping the steering wheel, operating the shift gear, eating a cake and talking on a cellular phone, the class of talking on a cellular phone is the most difficult to classify. With Bayes classifier, the classification accuracies of talking on a cellular phone are over 90 % in holdout and cross-validation experiments, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method and the importance of Bayes classifier in automatically understanding and characterizing driver behaviors towards human-centric driver assistance systems.

J	Bigdeli, B; Samadzadegan, F; Reinartz, P				Bigdeli, Behnaz; Samadzadegan, Farhad; Reinartz, Peter			A Multiple SVM System for Classification of Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Hyperspectral; Support Vector Machine; Multiple Classifier System; Bayesian Theory	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DECISION FUSION; IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; MUTUAL INFORMATION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SELECTION; RECOGNITION; BAND	With recent technological advances in remote sensing sensors and systems, very high-dimensional hyperspectral data are available for a better discrimination among different complex land-cover classes. However, the large number of spectral bands, but limited availability of training samples creates the problem of Hughes phenomenon or 'curse of dimensionality' in hyperspectral data sets. Moreover, these high numbers of bands are usually highly correlated. Because of these complexities of hyperspectral data, traditional classification strategies have often limited performance in classification of hyperspectral imagery. Referring to the limitation of single classifier in these situations, Multiple Classifier Systems (MCS) may have better performance than single classifier. This paper presents a new method for classification of hyperspectral data based on a band clustering strategy through a multiple Support Vector Machine system. The proposed method uses the band grouping process based on a modified mutual information strategy to split data into few band groups. After the band grouping step, the proposed algorithm aims at benefiting from the capabilities of SVM as classification method. So, the proposed approach applies SVM on each band group that is produced in a previous step. Finally, Naive Bayes (NB) as a classifier fusion method combines decisions of SVM classifiers. Experimental results on two common hyperspectral data sets show that the proposed method improves the classification accuracy in comparison with the standard SVM on entire bands of data and feature selection methods.

J	Borges, HB; Silla, CN; Nievola, JC				Borges, Helyane Bronoski; Silla, Carlos N., Jr.; Nievola, Julio Cesar			An evaluation of global-model hierarchical classification algorithms for hierarchical classification problems with single path of labels	COMPUTERS & MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Hierarchical classification; Global approach	MULTIPLE DATA SETS; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; CLASSIFIERS	Several classification tasks in different application domains can be seen as hierarchical classification problems. In order to deal with hierarchical classification problems, the use of existing flat classification approaches is not appropriate. For these reason, there has been a growing number of studies focusing on the development of novel algorithms able to induce classification models for hierarchical classification problems. In this paper we study the performance of a novel algorithm called Hierarchical Classification using a Competitive Neural Network (HC-CNN) and compare its performance against the Global-Model Naive Bayes (GMNB) on eight protein function prediction datasets. Interestingly enough, the comparison of two global-model hierarchical classification algorithms for single path of labels hierarchical classification problems has never been done before.

J	Qin, ZC; Wan, T				Qin, Zengchang; Wan, Tao			Hybrid Bayesian estimation tree learning with discrete and fuzzy labels	FRONTIERS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						fuzzy labels; label semantics; random set; probability estimation tree; mass assignment; linguistic decision tree; naive Bayes	DECISION TREE; INDUCTION; FRAMEWORK; SEMANTICS	Classical decision tree model is one of the classical machine learning models for its simplicity and effectiveness in applications. However, compared to the DT model, probability estimation trees (PETs) give a better estimation on class probability. In order to get a good probability estimation, we usually need large trees which are not desirable with respect to model transparency. Linguistic decision tree (LDT) is a PET model based on label semantics. Fuzzy labels are used for building the tree and each branch is associated with a probability distribution over classes. If there is no overlap between neighboring fuzzy labels, these fuzzy labels then become discrete labels and a LDT with discrete labels becomes a special case of the PET model. In this paper, two hybrid models by combining the naive Bayes classifier and PETs are proposed in order to build a model with good performance without losing too much transparency. The first model uses naive Bayes estimation given a PET, and the second model uses a set of small-sized PETs as estimators by assuming the independence between these trees. Empirical studies on discrete and fuzzy labels show that the first model outperforms the PET model at shallow depth, and the second model is equivalent to the naive Bayes and PET.

The ECG signal is a P-QRS-T wave representing the cardiac function. The minute variations in the durations and amplitude of these waves cannot be easily deciphered by the naked eye. Hence, there is a need for computer aided diagnosis (CAD) of cardiac healthcare. The current paper presents a methodology for ECG based pattern analysis of normal sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation (AF) beats. The denoised and registered ECG beats were subjected to independent component analysis (ICA) for data reduction. The weights of ICA were used as features for classification using Naive Bayes and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) classifiers. The performance and the upper bound on probability of error in classification were analyzed using Chernoff and Bhattacharyya bounds. The Naive Bayes classifier provided an average sensitivity of 99.32%, specificity of 99.33% and accuracy of 99.33%, while the GMM provided an average sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 99% and accuracy of 99.42%. The probability of error during classification was less for GMM compared to Naive Bayes classifier (NBC) as GMM provided higher performance than the NBC. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Karabulut, M				Karabulut, Mustafa			Fuzzy unordered rule induction algorithm in text categorization on top of geometric particle swarm optimization term selection	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Fuzzy rule; Geometric particle swarm optimization; Text categorization; Information gain; Multi-label text categorization; Feature selection	CLASSIFICATION; MACHINE; WORD	Rapid growth of digital information requires automated handling and organization of documents. The two main stages in automated document categorization are (i) term reduction and (ii) classification. In this paper, we present a novel two-stage term reduction strategy based on Information Gain (IG) theory and Geometric Particle Swarm Optimization (GPSO) search. We evaluate performance of the proposed term reduction approach with use of a new classifier, fuzzy unordered rule induction algorithm (FURIA) to categorize multi-label texts. In order to evaluate the performance of FURIA quantitatively, we compared it against two widely used algorithms, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Text Categorization (TC) performance of the proposed term reduction strategy is validated with use of Reuters-21578 and OHSUMED text collection datasets. The experimental results show that performance of the proposed term reduction method is efficient for document organization tasks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Membership is inferred from statistical classification of X-ray sources, from detection of a robust infrared excess that is best explained by circumstellar dust in a disk or infalling envelope and from published spectral types that are unlikely to be found among field stars. We present the MYStIX membership lists here, and describe in detail the statistical classification of X-ray sources via a "Naive Bayes Classifier." These membership lists provide the empirical foundation for later MYStIX science studies.

J	Planet, S; Iriondo, I				Planet, Santiago; Iriondo, Ignasi			Children's Emotion Recognition from Spontaneous Speech Using a Reduced Set of Acoustic and Linguistic Features	COGNITIVE COMPUTATION			English	Article						Emotion recognition; Spontaneous speech; Acoustic and linguistic features; Feature selection; Feature-level fusion; Speaker-independent		The aim of this article is to classify children's affective states in a real-life non-prototypical emotion recognition scenario. The framework is the same as that proposed in the Interspeech 2009 Emotion Challenge. We used a large set of acoustic features and five linguistic parameters based on the concept of emotional salience. Features were extracted from the spontaneous speech recordings of the FAU Aibo Corpus and their transcriptions. We used a wrapper method to reduce the acoustic set of features from 384 to 28 elements and feature-level fusion to merge them with the set of linguistic parameters. We studied three classification approaches: a Naive-Bayes classifier, a support vector machine and a logistic model tree. Results show that the linguistic features improve the performances of the classifiers that use only acoustic datasets. Additionally, merging the linguistic features with the reduced acoustic set is more effective than working with the full dataset. The best classifier performance is achieved with the logistic model tree and the reduced set of acoustic and linguistic features, which improves the performance obtained with the full dataset by 4.15 % absolute (10.14 % relative) and improves the performance of the Naive-Bayes classifier by 9.91 % absolute (28.18 % relative). For the same conditions proposed in the Emotion Challenge, this simple scheme slightly improves a much more complex structure involving seven classifiers and a larger number of features.

The behavior models are not based on assumptions of perfect rationality. Instead, a novel descriptive approach based on naive Bayes' rules is proposed and demonstrated. The en route diversion model is first estimated with behavior data from a driving simulator. Subsequently, the model is recalibrated for Maryland, based on Bluetooth detector data, and applied to analyze two dynamic message sign scenarios on I-95 and I-895. This calibration method allows researchers and practitioners to transfer the en route diversion model to other regions based on local observations. Future research can integrate this en route diversion model with microscopic traffic simulators, dynamic traffic assignment models, and/or activity-based/agent-based travel demand models for various traffic operations and transportation planning applications.

Interrupted apoptosis process contributes to carcinogenesis, developmental defects, autoimmune diseases and neurological disorders. Due to the complexity of the process, the molecular dynamics and relative interactions of individual proteins responsible for the activation or inhibition of apoptosis should be researched systematically. In this study, we integrate known protein interactions from databases DIP, IntAct, MINT, HPRD and BioGRID by Naive Bayes classifier. The receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curve with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.797 indicates it has a good performance in prediction. Then, we predict the global human apoptotic protein interactions network. Within it, we not only identify the already known interactions of caspases (caspase-8/-10, caspase-9, caspase-3/-6/-7) and Bcl-2 family, but also reveal that Bid can interact with casein kinases (CSK21/22/2B, KC1A, KC1E); both of B2LA1 and B2CL2 can interact with Bid, Bax and Bak; caspase-8 interacts with autophagic proteins (MLP3B, MLP3A and LRRk2). Consequently, we make an initial step to develop the web service IntApop that provides an appropriate platform for apoptosis researchers, systems biologists and translational clinician scientists to predict apoptotic protein interactions in human. In addition, the interaction network can be visualized online, making it a widely applicable systems biology tool for apoptosis and cancer researchers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Poses in video frames are described by the proposed extensive pyramidal features (EPFs), which include the Gabor, Gaussian, and wavelet pyramids. These features are able to encode the orientation, intensity, and contour information and therefore provide an informative representation of human poses. Due to the fact that not all poses in a sequence are discriminative and representative, we further utilize the AdaBoost algorithm to learn a subset of discriminative poses. Given the boosted poses for each video sequence, a new classifier named weighted local naive Bayes nearest neighbor is proposed for the final action classification, which is demonstrated to be more accurate and robust than other classifiers, e.g., support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayes nearest neighbor. The proposed method is systematically evaluated on the KTH data set, the Weizmann data set, the multiview IXMAS data set, and the challenging HMDB51 data set. Experimental results manifest that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of recognition rate.

Classification of Musical Timbre Using Bayesian Networks	COMPUTER MUSIC JOURNAL			English	Article							INSTRUMENT CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION	In this article, we explore the use of Bayesian networks for identifying the timbre of musical instruments. Peak spectral amplitude in ten frequency windows is extracted for each of 20 time windows to be used as features. Over a large data set of 24,000 audio examples covering the full musical range of 24 different common orchestral instruments, four different Bayesian network structures, including naive Bayes, are examined and compared with two support vector machines and a k-nearest neighbor classifier. Classification accuracy is examined by instrument, instrument family, and data set size. Bayesian networks with conditional dependencies in the time and frequency dimensions achieved 98 percent accuracy in the instrument classification task and 97 percent accuracy in the instrument family identification task. These results demonstrate a significant improvement over the previous approaches in the literature on this data set. Additionally, we tested our Bayesian approach on the widely used Iowa musical instrument data set, with similar results.

In this paper, we propose a decision system to classify DM fundus images into normal, clinically significant macular edema (CMSE), and non-clinically significant macular edema (non-CMSE) classes. The objective of the proposed decision system is three fold namely, to automatically extract textural features (both region specific and global), to effectively choose subset of discriminatory features, and to classify DM fundus images to their corresponding class of disease severity. The system uses a gamut of textural features and an ensemble classifier derived from four popular classifiers such as the hidden naive Bayes, naive Bayes, sequential minimal optimization (SMO), and the tree-based J48 classifiers. We achieved an average classification accuracy of 96.7% using five-fold cross validation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Bayesian networks (BNs) have been explored as a tool for various risk management practices, including the risk management of software development projects. However, much of the present research on software risk analysis focuses on finding the correlation between risk factors and project outcome. Software project failures are often a result of insufficient and ineffective risk management. To obtain proper and effective risk control, risk planning should be performed based on risk causality which can provide more risk information for decision making. In this study, we propose a model using BNs with causality constraints (BNCC) for risk analysis of software development projects. Through unrestricted automatic causality learning from 302 collected software project data, we demonstrated that the proposed model can not only discover causalities in accordance with the expert knowledge but also perform better in prediction than other algorithms, such as logistic regression, C4.5, Naive Bayes, and general BNs. This research presents the first causal discovery framework for risk causality analysis of software projects and develops a model using BNCC for application in software project risk management.

J	Taheri, S; Mammadov, M				Taheri, Sona; Mammadov, Musa			LEARNING THE NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER WITH OPTIMIZATION MODELS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Bayesian networks; naive Bayes classifier; optimization; discretization	OF-THE-ART	Naive Bayes is among the simplest probabilistic classifiers. It often performs surprisingly well in many real world applications, despite the strong assumption that all features are conditionally independent given the class. In the learning process of this classifier with the known structure, class probabilities and conditional probabilities are calculated using training data, and then values of these probabilities are used to classify new observations. In this paper, we introduce three novel optimization models for the naive Bayes classifier where both class probabilities and conditional probabilities are considered as variables. The values of these variables are found by solving the corresponding optimization problems. Numerical experiments are conducted on several real world binary classification data sets, where continuous features are discretized by applying three different methods. The performances of these models are compared with the naive Bayes classifier, tree augmented naive Bayes, the SVM, C4.5 and the nearest neighbor classifier. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed models can significantly improve the performance of the naive Bayes classifier, yet at the same time maintain its simple structure.

J	Maruyama, O				Maruyama, Osamu			Heterodimeric protein complex identification by naive Bayes classifiers	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Heterodimeric protein complex; Supervised learning; Naive Bayes classifier; Protein-protein interaction	INTERACTION NETWORKS; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; BUDDING YEAST; PPI NETWORKS; RANDOM-WALKS; PREDICTION; DISCOVERY; ALGORITHM	Background: Protein complexes are basic cellular entities that carry out the functions of their components. It can be found that in databases of protein complexes of yeast like CYC2008, the major type of known protein complexes is heterodimeric complexes. Although a number of methods for trying to predict sets of proteins that form arbitrary types of protein complexes simultaneously have been proposed, it can be found that they often fail to predict heterodimeric complexes. Results: In this paper, we have designed several features characterizing heterodimeric protein complexes based on genomic data sets, and proposed a supervised-learning method for the prediction of heterodimeric protein complexes. This method learns the parameters of the features, which are embedded in the naive Bayes classifier. The log-likelihood ratio derived from the naive Bayes classifier with the parameter values obtained by maximum likelihood estimation gives the score of a given pair of proteins to predict whether the pair is a heterodimeric complex or not. A five-fold cross-validation shows good performance on yeast. The trained classifiers also show higher predictability than various existing algorithms on yeast data sets with approximate and exact matching criteria. Conclusions: Heterodimeric protein complex prediction is a rather harder problem than heteromeric protein complex prediction because heterodimeric protein complex is topologically simpler. However, it turns out that by designing features specialized for heterodimeric protein complexes, predictability of them can be improved. Thus, the design of more sophisticate features for heterodimeric protein complexes as well as the accumulation of more accurate and useful genome-wide data sets will lead to higher predictability of heterodimeric protein complexes.

J	Lethaus, F; Baumann, MRK; Koster, F; Lemmer, K				Lethaus, Firas; Baumann, Martin R. K.; Koester, Frank; Lemmer, Karsten			A comparison of selected simple supervised learning algorithms to predict driver intent based on gaze data	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Artificial Neural Networks; Bayesian Networks; Naive Bayes Classifiers; Driver intent; Eye tracking; Supervised learning	EYE FIXATIONS; INFORMATION; SYSTEMS; NOVICE	Gaze behaviour is known to indicate information gathering. It is therefore suggested that it could be used to derive information about the driver's next planned objective in order to identify intended manoeuvres without relying solely on car data. Ultimately this would be practically realised by an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) using gaze data to correctly infer the intentions of the driver from what is implied by the incoming gaze data available to it. Neural Networks' ability to approximate arbitrary functions from observed data therefore makes them a candidate for modelling driver intent. Previous work has shown that significantly distinct gaze patterns precede each of the driving manoeuvres analysed indicating that eye movement data might be used as input to ADAS supplementing sensors, such as CAN-Bus (Controller Area Network), laser, radar or LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) in order to recognise intended driving manoeuvres. In this study, drivers' gaze behaviour was measured prior to and during the execution of different driving manoeuvres performed in a dynamic driving simulator. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), and Naive Bayes Classifiers (NBCs) were then trained using gaze data to act as classifiers that predict the occurrence of certain driving manoeuvres. This has previously been successfully demonstrated with real traffic data [1]. Issues considered here included the amount of data that is used for predictive purposes prior to the manoeuvre, the accuracy of the predictive models at different times prior to the manoeuvre taking place and the relative difficulty of predicting a lane change left manoeuvre against predicting a lane change right manoeuvre.

IDS that rely solely on a database of stored known attacks are no longer sufficient for effectively detecting modern day threats. This paper presents a novel anomaly detection technique that can be used to detect previously unknown attacks on a network by identifying attack features.

Design: Retrospective follow-up study. Methods: Based on a minimum follow-up time of 10 years with HCV infection, 190 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were classified according to their METAVIR score: (1) 25 nonprogressor patients who did not develop fibrosis (F0) and (2) 165 progressor patients who developed fibrosis (F >= 1). Seven polymorphisms of CRS signature and IL28B genotype were performed using the GoldenGate assay. The CRS signature was calculated by naive Bayes formula as previously described. Results: Nonprogressors had CRS values significantly lower than progressors (0.61 versus 0.67; P = 0.043). Among the progressors, we observed similar CRS values through all the fibrosis stages (F1/ F2/F3/F4). The percentage of patients with CRS. 0.70 (high risk of developing fibrosis) was higher in progressors than in nonprogressors; but the percentages with values between 0.50 and 0.70 (intermediate risk) and,0.50 (low risk) were quite similar for each of the fibrosis stages (P = 0.047). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of CRS for discriminating nonprogressor versus progressor was 0.625 (P = 0.043). When clinical variables were considered (age at HCV infection, intravenous drug use, gender, IL28B, and HCV genotype), the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of CRS improved up to 0.739 (P<0.001). Conclusions: CRS itself seems not to be a good marker for identifying HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who are at high risk of developing liver fibrosis. However, CRS score coupled with clinical factors might help to distinguish between nonprogressors and progressors patients.

Genome-wide essential gene identification has progressed rapidly in certain bacterial species; however, it remains difficult to achieve in most eukaryotic species. Several computational models have recently been developed to integrate gene features and used as alternatives to transfer gene essentiality annotations between organisms. Results: We first collected features that were widely used by previous predictive models and assessed the relationships between gene features and gene essentiality using a stepwise regression model. We found two issues that could significantly reduce model accuracy: (i) the effect of multicollinearity among gene features and (ii) the diverse and even contrasting correlations between gene features and gene essentiality existing within and among different species. To address these issues, we developed a novel model called feature-based weighted Naive Bayes model (FWM), which is based on Naive Bayes classifiers, logistic regression, and genetic algorithm. The proposed model assesses features and filters out the effects of multicollinearity and diversity. The performance of FWM was compared with other popular models, such as support vector machine, Naive Bayes model, and logistic regression model, by applying FWM to reciprocally predict essential genes among and within 21 species. Our results showed that FWM significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of essential gene prediction. Conclusions: FWM can remarkably improve the accuracy of essential gene prediction and may be used as an alternative method for other classification work. This method can contribute substantially to the knowledge of the minimum gene sets required for living organisms and the discovery of new drug targets.

An investigation into the application of ensemble learning for entailment classification	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Entailment; Classification; Ensemble learning	RANDOM SUBSPACE METHOD; STACKED GENERALIZATION	Textual entailment is a task for which the application of supervised learning mechanisms has received considerable attention as driven by successive Recognizing Data Entailment data challenges. We developed a linguistic analysis framework in which a number of similarity/dissimilarity features are extracted for each entailment pair in a data set and various classifier methods are evaluated based on the instance data derived from the extracted features. The focus of the paper is to compare and contrast the performance of single and ensemble based learning algorithms for a number of data sets. We showed that there is some benefit to the use of ensemble approaches but, based on the extracted features, Naive Bayes proved to be the strongest learning mechanism. Only one ensemble approach demonstrated a slight improvement over the technique of Naive Bayes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, this assumes the existence of a dependency relationship between the class variable and all the input variables, and this relationship is a type of "causal" (rather than "effect") relationship, which restricts the flexibility of the algorithm to learn. In this paper, we propose ABC-Miner+, an extension to the ABC-Miner algorithm which is able to learn more flexible Bayesian network classifier structures, where it is not necessary to have a (direct) dependency relationship between the class variable and each of the input variables, and the dependency between the class and the input variables varies from "causal" to "effect" relationships. The produced model is the Markov blanket of the class variable. Empirical evaluations on UCI benchmark datasets show that our extended ABC-Miner+ outperforms its previous version in terms of predictive accuracy, model size and computational time.

In order to increase the efficiency of customer retention campaigns, churn prediction models need to be accurate as well as compact and interpretable. Although a myriad of techniques for churn prediction has been examined, there has been little attention for the use of Bayesian Network classifiers. This paper investigates the predictive power of a number of Bayesian Network algorithms, ranging from the Naive Bayes classifier to General Bayesian Network classifiers. Furthermore, a feature selection method based on the concept of the Markov Blanket, which is genuinely related to Bayesian Networks, is tested. The performance of the classifiers is evaluated with both the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and the recently introduced Maximum Profit criterion. The Maximum Profit criterion performs an intelligent optimization by targeting this fraction of the customer base which would maximize the profit generated by a retention campaign. The results of the experiments are rigorously tested and indicate that most of the analyzed techniques have a comparable performance. Some methods, however, are more preferred since they lead to compact networks, which enhances the interpretability and comprehensibility of the churn prediction models.

J	Zhou, B				Zhou, Bing			Multi-class decision-theoretic rough sets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						Bayesian inference; Bayesian decision theory; Bayes' theorem; Rough sets; Naive Bayes classifier; Three-way decisions	BAYESIAN CONFIRMATION MEASURES; 3-WAY DECISION; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; RULES	As a natural extension to rough set approximations with two decision classes, this paper provides a new formulation of multi-class decision-theoretic rough sets. Instead of making an immediate acceptance or rejection decision, a third option of making a deferment decision is added to each class. This gives users the flexibility of further examining the suspicious objects, thereby reducing the chance of misclassification. Different types of misclassification errors are treated separately based on the notion of loss functions from Bayesian decision theory. The losses incurred for making deferment and rejection decisions to each class are also considered. The presented approach appears to be well suited for cost-sensitive classification tasks where different types of classification errors have different costs. The connections and differences with other existing multi-class rough set models are analyzed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Speeding up incremental wrapper feature subset selection with Naive Bayes classifier	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Wrapper feature subset selection; Incremental algorithms; Naive Bayes; High-dimensional data		This paper deals with the problem of wrapper feature subset selection (FSS) in classification-oriented datasets with a (very) large number of attributes. In high-dimensional datasets with thousands of variables, wrapper FSS becomes a laborious computational process because of the amount of CPU time it requires. In this paper we study how under certain circumstances the wrapper FSS process can be speeded up by embedding the classifier into the wrapper algorithm, instead of dealing with it as a black-box. Our proposal is based on the combination of the NB classifier (which is known to be largely beneficial for FSS) with incremental wrapper FSS algorithms. The merit of this approach is analyzed both theoretically and experimentally, and the results show an impressive speed-up for the embedded FSS process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Inspired by affective computing and active listening strategy, in this paper, a research and application framework of recognizing emotion based on textual interaction is presented first. Second, an emotion category model for e-learners is defined. Third, many Chinese metaphors are abstracted from the corpus according to the sentence semantics and syntax. Fourth, as the strategy of active learning, topic detection is used to detect the first turn in dialogs and recognize the type of emotion in the turn, which is different from the traditional emotion recognition approaches that try to classify every turn into an emotion category. Fifth, compared with Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, LogitBoost, Bagging, MultiClass Classifier, RBFnetwork, J48 algorithms and their corresponding cost-sensitive approaches, Random Forest and its corresponding cost-sensitive approaches achieve better results in our initial experiment of classifying the e-learners' emotions. Finally, a case-based reasoning for emotion regulation instance recommendation is proposed to guide the listener to regulate the negative emotion of a speaker, in which a weighted sum method of Chinese sentence similarity computation is adopted. The experimental result shows that the ratio of effective cases is 68%. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In TPR, the dataset is distributed across a large number of users in which each record is owned by two different users, one user only knows the values for a subset of attributes and the other knows the values for the remaining attributes. A miner aims to learn, for example, classification rules on their data, while preserving each user's privacy. In this work we develop a cryptographic solution for frequency-based learning methods in TPR. The crucial step in the proposed solution is the privacy-preserving computation of frequencies of a tuple of values in the users' data, which can ensure each user's privacy without loss of accuracy. We illustrate the applicability of the method by using it to build the privacy preserving protocol for the naive Bayes classifier learning, and briefly address the solution in other applications. Experimental results show that our protocol is efficient.			luongthedung@gmail.com; hungtd@hnue.edu.vn					Agrawal D., 2001, P 20 ACM SIGMOD SIGA, P247, DOI DOI 10.1145/375551.375602; Agrawal R., 1993, P ACM SIGMOD C MAN D, V22, P207, DOI DOI 10.1145/170035.170072; Agrawal R., 2005, P 2005 ACM SIGMOD IN, P251, DOI 10.1145/1066157.1066187; Agrawal R, 2000, SIGMOD RECORD, V29, P439; Boneh D., 1998, LNCS, V1423, P48; Charu A.C., 2008, PRIVACY PRESERVING D; Domingos P, 1997, MACH LEARN, V29, P103, DOI 10.1023/A:1007413511361; Du W., 2003, P 9 ACM SIGKDD INT C, P505, DOI 10.1145/956750.956810; Du W., 2002, P IEEE INT C PRIV SE, V14, P1; Evfimievski A., 2002, P 8 ACM SIGKDD INT C, P217; Evfimievski A., 2003, P 22 ACM SIGMOD SIGA, P211, DOI 10.1145/773153.773174; Goldreich O., 2001, FDN CRYPTOGRAPHY BAS, V1; Hirt M, 2000, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V1807, P539; JACOBSEN BK, 1987, J CHRON DIS, V40, P795, DOI 10.1016/0021-9681(87)90131-7; Joachim G., 1999, J NUTR HLTH, V13, P69; Kantarcioglu M., 2003, IEEE ICDM WORKSH PRI; Pinkas B., 2002, SIGKDD EXPLORATIONS, V4, P12; Terry D.J., 2004, MCNAIR SCHOLARS J, V8; Tsiounis Y., 1998, LNCS, V1431, P117; Vaidya J, 2002, P 8 ACM SIGKDD INT C; Vaidya J, 2008, VLDB J, V17, P879, DOI 10.1007/s00778-006-0041-y; Verykios VS, 2004, SIGMOD REC, V33, P50; Wu F, 2009, PATTERN RECOGN LETT, V30, P80, DOI 10.1016/j.patrec.2008.09.004; Yang Z., 2005, P 11 ACM SIGKDD INT, P334, DOI 10.1145/1081870.1081909; Yang Z., 2005, SIAM SDM, P21	25	0	0	1	2	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	2194-5357		978-3-319-02821-7; 978-3-319-02820-0	ADV INTELL SYST			2014	245						319	335		10.1007/978-3-319-02821-7_29		17	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BJR51	WOS:000329821100029

We design a new action feature descriptor for action recognition based on differences of skeleton joints, i.e.,EigenJoints which combine action information including static posture, motion property, and overall dynamics. Accumulated Motion Energy (AME) is then proposed to perform informative frame selection, which is able to remove noisy frames and reduce computational cost. We employ non-parametric Naive-Bayes-Nearest-Neighbor (NBNN) to classify multiple actions. The experimental results on several challenging datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we investigate how many frames are necessary for our method to perform classification in the scenario of online action recognition. We observe that the first 30-40% frames are sufficient to achieve comparable results to that using the entire video sequences on the MSR Action3D dataset. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, ZL; Zhao, C; Qiu, S				Wang, Zhelong; Zhao, Cong; Qiu, Sen			A system off human vita signs monitoring and activity recognition based on body sensor network	SENSOR REVIEW			English	Article						Activity recognition; Body sensor network; ECG; Health monitor; SpO(2); Telemedicine		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a health monitoring system that can measure human vital signs and recognize human activity based on body sensor network (BSN). Design/methodology/approach - The system is mainly composed of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal collection node, blood oxygen signal collection node, inertial sensor node, receiving node and upper computer software. The three collection nodes collect ECG signals, blood oxygen signals and motion signals. And then collected signals are transmitted wirelessly to receiving node and analyzed by software in upper computer in real-time. indings - Experiment results show that the system can simultaneously monitor human ECG, heart rate, pulse rate, SpO(2) and recognize human activity. A classifier based on coupled hidden Markov model (CHMM) is adopted to recognize human activity. The average recognition accuracy of CHMM classifier is 94.8 percent, which is higher than some existent methods, such as supported vector machine (SVM), C4.5 decision tree and naive Bayes classifier (NBC). Practical implications - The monitoring system may be used for falling detection, elderly care, postoperative care, rehabilitation training, sports training and other fields in the future. Originality/value - First, the system can measure human vital signs (ECG, blood pressure, pulse rate, SpO(2), temperature, heart rate) and recognizes some specific simple or complex activities (sitting, lying, go boating, bicycle riding). Second, the researches of using CHMM for activity recognition based on BSN are extremely few. Consequently, the classifier based on CHMM is adopted to recognize activity with ideal recognition accuracies in this paper.

Data-Driven Link Quality Prediction Using Link Features	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article						Design; Measurement; Performance; Link quality estimation; link quality prediction	WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS	As an integral part of reliable communication in wireless networks, effective link estimation is essential for routing protocols. However, due to the dynamic nature of wireless channels, accurate link quality estimation remains a challenging task. In this article, we propose 4C, a novel link estimator that applies link quality prediction along with link estimation. Our approach is data driven and consists of three steps: data collection, offline modeling, and online prediction. The data collection step involves gathering link quality data, and based on our analysis of the data, we propose a set of guidelines for the amount of data to be collected in our experimental scenarios. The modeling step includes offline prediction model training and selection. We present three prediction models that utilize different machine learning methods, namely, naive Bayes classifier, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks. Our models take a combination of PRR and the physical-layer information, that is, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and Link Quality Indicator (LQI) as input, and output the success probability of delivering the next packet. From our analysis and experiments, we find that logistic regression works well among the three models with small computational cost. Finally, the third step involves the implementation of 4C, a receiver-initiated online link quality prediction module that computes the short temporal link quality. We conducted extensive experiments in the Motelab and our local indoor testbeds, as well as an outdoor deployment. Our results with single-and multiple-senders experiments show that with 4C, CTP improves the average cost of delivering a packet by 20% to 30%. In some cases, the improvement is larger than 45%.

In this paper, we propose a new approach of feature extraction by using Matrix Pencil Method in Frequency Domain (MPMFD). The proposed method takes into account not only the magnitude of the signal, but also its phase, so that all the physical characteristics of the target will be considered. With this method, the separation between the early time and the late time is not necessary. The proposed method is compared to Matrix Pencil Method in Time Domain (MPMTD). The methods are applied on UWB backscattered signal from three canonical targets (thin wire, sphere, and cylinder). MPMFD is applied on a complex field (real and imaginary parts of the signal). To the best of our knowledge, this comparison and the reconstruction of the complex electromagnetic field by MPMFD have not been done before. We show the effect of the two extraction methods on the accuracy of three different classifiers: Naive bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results show that the accuracy of classification is better when using extracted features by MPMFD with SVM.

While individuals, businesses, and governments are interested in evaluating the sentiments behind this content, there are no consistent conclusions on which sentiment classification technologies are best. Recent studies suggest that ensemble learning methods may have potential applicability in sentiment classification. In this study, we conduct a comparative assessment of the performance of three popular ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting, and Random Subspace) based on five base learners (Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine) for sentiment classification. Moreover, ten public sentiment analysis datasets were investigated to verify the effectiveness of ensemble learning for sentiment analysis. Based on a total of 1200 comparative group experiments, empirical results reveal that ensemble methods substantially improve the performance of individual base learners for sentiment classification. Among the three ensemble methods, Random Subspace has the better comparative results, although it was seldom discussed in the literature. These results illustrate that ensemble learning methods can be used as a viable method for sentiment classification. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A significant number of computational methods have been developed to predict protein-protein interactions using protein sequence, structural and genomic data. Vast experimental data is publicly available on the Internet, but it is scattered across numerous databases. This fact motivated us to create and evaluate new high-throughput datasets of interacting proteins. We extracted interaction data from DIP, MINT, BioGRID and IntAct databases. Then we constructed descriptive features for machine learning purposes based on data from Gene Ontology and DOMINE. Thereafter, four well-established machine learning methods: Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes, were used on these datasets to build an Ensemble Learning method based on majority voting. In cross-validation experiment, sensitivity exceeded 80% and classification/prediction accuracy reached 90% for the Ensemble Learning method. We extended the experiment to a bigger and more realistic dataset maintaining sensitivity over 70%. These results confirmed that our datasets are suitable for performing PPI prediction and Ensemble Learning method is well suited for this task. Both the processed PPI datasets and the software are available at http://sysbio.icm.edu.pl/indra/EL-PPI/home.html.

J	Dong, LJ; Li, XB; Xie, GN				Dong, Longjun; Li, Xibing; Xie, Gongnan			Nonlinear Methodologies for Identifying Seismic Event and Nuclear Explosion Using Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bayes Classification	ABSTRACT AND APPLIED ANALYSIS			English	Article							REGIONAL DISCRIMINATION; ACOUSTIC-EMISSION; SOURCE LOCATION; QUARRY BLASTS; EARTHQUAKES; IDENTIFICATION; NETWORK; ISRAEL	The discrimination of seismic event and nuclear explosion is a complex and nonlinear system. The nonlinear methodologies including Random Forests (RF), Support VectorMachines (SVM), and Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) were applied to discriminant seismic events. Twenty earthquakes and twenty-seven explosions with nine ratios of the energies contained within predetermined "velocity windows" and calculated distance are used in discriminators. Based on the one out cross-validation, ROC curve, calculated accuracy of training and test samples, and discriminating performances of RF, SVM, and NBC were discussed and compared. The result of RF method clearly shows the best predictive power with a maximum area of 0.975 under the ROC among RF, SVM, and NBC. The discriminant accuracies of RF, SVM, and NBC for test samples are 92.86%, 85.71%, and 92.86%, respectively. It has been demonstrated that the presented RF model can not only identify seismic event automatically with high accuracy, but also can sort the discriminant indicators according to calculated values of weights.

This result has significant implications for both practitioners and researchers in terms of computational complexity, ensemble design and metalearning for algorithm selection. We outline the limits of the similarity between RBF and naive Bayes, and use metalearning to build a selection model capable of accurately discriminating between the two algorithms, so that extra computation is only incurred when it is likely to produce significant improvement in predictive accuracy.

It classifies a user's fitness level based on supervised machine learning techniques. This system is able to learn and make customized diagnoses according to the user's physiological data, such as age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). In addition, an elastic algorithm based on Poisson distribution is presented to allocate computation resources dynamically. It predicts the required resources in the future according to the exponential moving average of past observations. The experimental results show that Naive Bayes is the best classifier with the highest accuracy (90.8%) and that the elastic algorithm is able to capture tightly the trend of requests generated from the Internet and thus assign corresponding computation resources to ensure the quality of service.

Since some available real data is multi-valued and multi-labeled, researchers have focused their attention on developing approaches to mine multi-valued and multi-labeled data in recent years. Unfortunately, there are no algorithms can discretize multi-valued and multi-labeled data to improve the performance of data mining. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to solve this problem. Our approach is based on a statistical-based discretization metric and the simulated annealing search algorithm. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively improve the performance of the-state-of-art multi-valued and multi-labeled classification algorithm.

CITRUS HUANGLONGBING DETECTION USING NARROW-BAND IMAGING AND POLARIZED ILLUMINATION	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						Classification; HLB; Image analysis; Starch concentration; Textural features	NEAR INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; DISEASE; MACHINE; TREES	The insect-spread bacterial infection known as citrus greening or Huanglongbing (HLB) is a very destructive citrus disease and has caused massive losses in Florida's citrus industry. Early, easy, and less expensive HLB detection based on particular symptoms, such as starch accumulation in the citrus leaf would increase the chance of preventing the disease from being spread and causing more damage. The ability of narrow-band imaging and polarizing filters in detecting starch accumulation in symptomatic citrus leaf was evaluated in this study. A custom-made image acquisition system was developed for this purpose in which leaf samples were illuminated with polarized light using narrow-band high-power LEDs at 400 nm and 591 nm, and the reflectance was measured by two monochrome cameras. Two polarizing filters were mounted in perpendicular directions in front of the cameras so that each camera acquired an image with reflected light in only one direction (parallel or perpendicular to the illumination polarization). Four groups of textural features, including gray, local binary pattern, local similarity pattern, and gray-level co-occurrence features, were extracted and ranked using several feature selection methods. Seven classifiers (support vector machine, linear, naive Bayes linear, quadratic, naive Bayes quadratic, Mahalanobis, and k nearest neighbor) were evaluated, and the best classifiers and sets of features were selected based on their accuracy. The leaf samples were collected from the 'Hamlin' and 'Valencia' varieties of citrus. Three classes of samples (magnesium-deficient, HLB-positive zinc-deficient, and HLB-negative zinc-deficient) were considered in the classification process to confirm the starch detection ability of the system. Overall average accuracies of 93.1% and 89.6% in HLB detection were obtained for the 'Hamlin' and 'Valencia' varieties, respectively, using a step-by-step classification method The results of this study showed that the starch accumulation in HLB-symptomatic leaves rotated the polarization planar of light at 591 nm, and this property can be effectively used in a fast and inexpensive HLB detection system.

Machine vision based quality inspection of flat glass products	IMAGE PROCESSING: MACHINE VISION APPLICATIONS VII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Image Processing - Machine Vision Applications VII	FEB 03-04, 2014	San Francisco, CA	Soc Imaging Sci & Technol, SPIE		glass inspection; machine vision; classification; machine learning		This application paper presents a machine vision solution for the quality inspection of flat glass products. A contact image sensor (CIS) is used to generate digital images of the glass surfaces. The presented machine vision based quality inspection at the end of the production line aims to classify five different glass defect types. The defect images are usually characterized by very little 'image structure', i.e. homogeneous regions without distinct image texture. Additionally, these defect images usually consist of only a few pixels. At the same time the appearance of certain defect classes can be very diverse ( e. g. water drops). We used simple state-of-the-art image features like histogram-based features (std. deviation, curtosis, skewness), geometric features ( form factor/elongation, eccentricity, Hu-moments) and texture features ( grey level run length matrix, co-occurrence matrix) to extract defect information. The main contribution of this work now lies in the systematic evaluation of various machine learning algorithms to identify appropriate classification approaches for this specific class of images. In this way, the following machine learning algorithms were compared: decision tree (J48), random forest, JRip rules, naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine ( multi class), neural network (multilayer perceptron) and k-Nearest Neighbour. We used a representative image database of 2300 defect images and applied cross validation for evaluation purposes.

J	Akilandeswari, V; Shalinie, SM				Akilandeswari, V.; Shalinie, S. Mercy			Design of an Adaptive Distributed Critical-Care Extensive Response Network (AD-CERN) Using Cooperative Overlay Network	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article							FLOODING ATTACK DETECTION; EVOLUTION; TOPOLOGY; GRAPHS	The main objective of this paper is to propose Adaptive Distributed Critical-Care Extensive Response Network (AD-CERN) which includes self-management and self-defense in the network. The proposed network has the following considerations. (1) Dynamic coevolution is elucidated with interaction between independent rational strategies and structure of overlay network. (2) Evolutionary GameTheory (EGT) specific to overlay network is adopted with the combination of network reciprocity and group selection mechanism. (3) The cooperative efficient network structure is put forth by the multinode link-formation game. In this network, each node will be trained independently based on Naive Bayes classification algorithm to react against any critical services in the network. The proposed network's significant characteristics are self-learning, independent training, collaborative detection, reaction to critical services, protecting the target machine before being collapsed, and maintaining the network performance without any hindrances. It controls the flow of high rate critical services such as Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) flooding attacks and blocks the unwarranted services without any interruption to legitimate users. Hence, there is no doubt that this selfmanaged and self-defensive system will move from realm of fiction to real-time network engineering with high detection accuracy (98.3%), classification rate up to 99%, and improved clustering coefficient.

Two key questions in this regard relate to whether one should stop the information gathering process and commit to a decision (stopping criterion), and if not, what information to gather next (selection criterion). In this paper, we show that the recently introduced notion, Same-Decision Probability (SDP), can be useful as both a stopping and a selection criterion, as it can provide additional insight and allow for robust decision making in a variety of scenarios. This query has been shown to be highly intractable, being PPPP-complete, and is exemplary of a class of queries which correspond to the computation of certain expectations. We propose the first exact algorithm for computing the SDP, and demonstrate its effectiveness on several real and synthetic networks. Finally, we present new complexity results, such as the complexity of computing the SDP on models with a Naive Bayes structure. Additionally, we prove that computing the non-myopic value of information is complete for the same complexity class as computing the SDP.

J	Liu, QC; Lu, J; Chen, SY; Zhao, KJ				Liu, Qingchao; Lu, Jian; Chen, Shuyan; Zhao, Kangjia			Multiple Naive Bayes Classifiers Ensemble for Traffic Incident Detection	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK; ROC CURVE; CLASSIFICATION; MACHINE; AREA	This study presents the applicability of the Naive Bayes classifier ensemble for traffic incident detection. The standard Naive Bayes (NB) has been applied to traffic incident detection and has achieved good results. However, the detection result of the practically implemented NB depends on the choice of the optimal threshold, which is determined mathematically by using Bayesian concepts in the incident-detection process. To avoid the burden of choosing the optimal threshold and tuning the parameters and, furthermore, to improve the limited classification performance of the NB and to enhance the detection performance, we propose an NB classifier ensemble for incident detection. In addition, we also propose to combine the Naive Bayes and decision tree (NBTree) to detect incidents. In this paper, we discuss extensive experiments that were performed to evaluate the performances of three algorithms: standard NB, NB ensemble, and NBTree. The experimental results indicate that the performances of five rules of the NB classifier ensemble are significantly better than those of standard NB and slightly better than those of NBTree in terms of some indicators. More importantly, the performances of the NB classifier ensemble are very stable.

Many classification methods are used in credit risk assessment aiming to establish classifiers to predict the credit state of the corporate (good or bad). However, most of classification methods can not handle continuous variables. So, continuous variables must be quantified. In this paper, we first propose an improved quantization method, namely IDM, based on the statistical independence; then we use data mining techniques, i.e., C4.5 decision tree, Naive-Bayes and SVM classifier, to classify and predict the quantified credit data. The aim is to investigate the effect of quantization method on the classification of credit approval data. The Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves the mean accuracy of classification than other known quantization methods. This denotes that the proposed method can make an effective interpretation and point out the ability of design of a new intelligent assistance credit approval data system.

A Hybrid-Based Feature Selection Approach for IDS	NETWORKS AND COMMUNICATIONS (NETCOM2013)	Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Networks and Communications (NetCom)	DEC 27-28, 2013	Chennai, INDIA				INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM	An intrusion detection (ID) technique classifies the incoming network traffic, represented as a feature vector, into anomalous or normal traffic by a classification method. In practice, it has been observed that the high dimensionality of the feature vector degrades classification performance. To reduce the dimensionality, without compromising the performance, a new hybrid feature selection method has been introduced and its performance is measured on KDD Cup'99 dataset by the classifiers Naive Bayes and C4.5. Three sets of experiments have been conducted using full feature set, reduced sets of features obtained using four well known feature selection methods as Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS), Consistency-based Feature Selection (CON), Information Gain (IG), Gain Ratio (GR) and the proposed method on the said dataset and classifiers. In first experiment, classifier Naive Bayes and C4.5 yielded classification accuracy 97.5 % and 99.8 % respectively. In second set of experiments, the best performance (accuracy) of these classifiers was achieved as 99.1 % and 99.8 % by the method IG. In third experiment, six features are obtained using proposed method and noted the same as 99.4 % and 99.9 %. The proposed hybrid feature selection method outperformed earlier mentioned methods on various metrics.

J	Yang, JM; Qu, ZY; Liu, ZY				Yang, Jieming; Qu, Zhaoyang; Liu, Zhiying			Improved Feature-Selection Method Considering the Imbalance Problem in Text Categorization	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							MUTUAL INFORMATION; ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION	The filtering feature-selection algorithm is a kind of important approach to dimensionality reduction in the field of the text categorization. Most of filtering feature-selection algorithms evaluate the significance of a feature for category based on balanced dataset and do not consider the imbalance factor of dataset. In this paper, a new scheme was proposed, which can weaken the adverse effect caused by the imbalance factor in the corpus. We evaluated the improved versions of nine well-known feature-selection methods (Information Gain, Chi statistic, Document Frequency, Orthogonal Centroid Feature Selection, DIA association factor, Comprehensive Measurement Feature Selection, Deviation from Poisson Feature Selection, improved Gini index, and Mutual Information) using naive Bayes and support vector machines on three benchmark document collections (20-Newsgroups, Reuters-21578, and WebKB).

A shape-space is defined in IAAIS and evenly covered with each kind of antibodies. Each antigen has a "danger zone", and antibodies in danger zone with the same class as antigen can receive stimulation from this antigen. In learning stage, stimulated antibodies are generated by training data. In classification stage, the unknown data is classified by the sum of the antibodies' stimulation levels in danger zone. The solution for unbalance number of training data is presented. Experimental results reveal that IAAIS outperforms algorithms based on AIS, ARIS and ANSC, and classical classification algorithms, C4.5 decision tree, Naive Bayes, Bayesian Networks, and Support Vector Machine, on low-dimensional data, and the accuracy for Iris data is 97.3%.

J	Yang, F; Wang, L				Yang, Fan; Wang, Lin			Mechanisms classifi cation for glycoside hydrolases by sequence and structure features using computational methods	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DATA MINING AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						glycoside hydrolase; catalytic mechanism; classification; data mining; bioinformatics computational methods; structure features; sequence features	K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR; PROTEIN; SELECTION; PREDICTION; ENZYME	Glycoside Hydrolases (GHs) have played key roles in the development of biofuels as well as many other industries. Research aimed at accurate classification of catalytic mechanisms to increase the catalytic activity of GHs is receiving extensive attention. The traditional theories or methods used in the study of catalytic mechanisms of GHs are limited by reaction conditions. They are not suitable for the study of various GHs because different enzymes would show devious physicochemical properties. In this paper, a new method is proposed to classify and predict the catalytic mechanism of a certain glycoside hydrolase according to their sequence and structure features using k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB) Classifier and the Multilayer Perception (MLP) Classifier. The classification performance of the four computational methods used were evaluated and compared. Experimental results show that each classifier has its own advantages, but the kNN classifier is more accurate at the overall level. This research also helps us to gain a better understanding of the catalytic mechanisms in different GHs.

A Naive-Bayes Model Observer for Detection and Localization of Perfusion Defects in Cardiac SPECT-MPI.	MEDICAL IMAGING 2014: IMAGE PERCEPTION, OBSERVER PERFORMANCE, AND TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging - Image Perception, Observer Performance, and Technology Assessment	FEB 16-17, 2014	San Diego, CA	SPIE, Modus Med Devices Inc, XIFIN Inc, Ventana Med Syst Inc, Intrace Med		Bayesian learning; image quality assessment; machine learning; model observer; polar-map; SPECT-MPI	MOTION	Model observers (MO) are widely used in medical imaging to act as surrogates of human observers in task-based image quality evaluation, frequently towards optimization of reconstruction algorithms. In SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), a realistic task-based approach involves detection and localization of perfusion defects, as well as a subsequent assessment of defect severity. In this paper we explore a machine-learning MO based on Naive-Bayes classification (NB-MO). NB-MO uses a set of polar-map image features to predict lesion detection, localization and severity scores given by five human readers for a set of simulated 3D SPECT-MPI patients. The simulated dataset included lesions with different sizes, perfusion-reduction ratios, and locations. Simulated projections were reconstructed using two readily used methods namely: FBP and OSEM. For validation, a multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) analysis of alternative free-response ROC (AFROC) curve was performed for NB-MO and human observers. For comparison, we also report performances of a statistical Hotelling Observer applied on polar-map images. Results show excellent agreement between NB-MO and humans, as well as model's good generalization between different reconstruction treatments.

However, indiscriminate superparent attributes will bring both considerable computational cost and negative effect on classification accuracy. In this paper, to extract the most credible dependencies we present a new type of seminaive Bayesian operation, which selects superparent attributes by building maximum weighted spanning tree and removes highly correlated children attributes by functional dependency and canonical cover analysis. Our extensive experimental comparison on UCI data sets shows that this operation efficiently identifies possible superparent attributes at training time and eliminates redundant children attributes at classification time.

Here, we examine the potential link between clinical tumor imaging and the underlying evolutionary dynamics behind heterogeneity in the cellular expression of estrogen receptors (ER) in breast cancer. We assume, in an evolutionary environment, that ER expression will only occur in the presence of significant concentrations of estrogen, which is delivered via the blood stream. Thus, we hypothesize, the expression of ER in breast cancer cells will correlate with blood flow on gadolinium enhanced breast MRI. To test this hypothesis, we performed quantitative analysis of blood flow on dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and correlated it with the ER status of the tumor. Here we present our analytic methods, which utilize a novel algorithm to analyze 20 volumetric DCE-MRI breast cancer tumors. The algorithm generates post initial enhancement (PIE) maps from DCE-MRI and then performs texture features extraction from the PIE map, feature selection, and finally classification of tumors into ER positive and ER negative status. The combined gray level co-occurrence matrices, gray level run length matrices and local binary pattern histogram features allow quantification of breast tumor heterogeneity. The algorithm predicted ER expression with an accuracy of 85% using a Naive Bayes classifier in leave-one-out cross-validation. Hence, we conclude that our data supports the hypothesis that imaging characteristics can, through application of evolutionary principles, provide insights into the cellular and molecular properties of cancer cells.

J	Jensen, K; Panagiotou, G; Kouskoumvekaki, I				Jensen, Kasper; Panagiotou, Gianni; Kouskoumvekaki, Irene			Integrated Text Mining and Chemoinformatics Analysis Associates Diet to Health Benefit at Molecular Level	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							NATURAL-PRODUCTS; ESSENTIAL OILS; CANCER; RISK; CHEMISTRY; IDENTIFICATION; ANTIOXIDANT; POLYPHENOLS; ALKALOIDS; EVOLUTION	Awareness that disease susceptibility is not only dependent on genetic make up, but can be affected by lifestyle decisions, has brought more attention to the role of diet. However, food is often treated as a black box, or the focus is limited to few, well-studied compounds, such as polyphenols, lipids and nutrients. In this work, we applied text mining and Naive Bayes classification to assemble the knowledge space of food-phytochemical and food-disease associations, where we distinguish between disease prevention/amelioration and disease progression. We subsequently searched for frequently occurring phytochemical-disease pairs and we identified 20,654 phytochemicals from 16,102 plants associated to 1,592 human disease phenotypes. We selected colon cancer as a case study and analyzed our results in three directions; i) one stop legacy knowledge-shop for the effect of food on disease, ii) discovery of novel bioactive compounds with drug-like properties, and iii) discovery of novel health benefits from foods. This works represents a systematized approach to the association of food with health effect, and provides the phytochemical layer of information for nutritional systems biology research.

Classification performance of data mining algorithms applied to breast cancer data	COMPUTATIONAL VISION AND MEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSING IV			English	Proceedings Paper	4th Eccomas Thematic Conference on Computational Vision and Medical Image Processing (VipIMAGE)	OCT 14-16, 2013	Funchal, PORTUGAL				ROC CURVE; AREA	In this paper, we study how several classification algorithms perform when applied to a breast cancer dataset. The challenge is to develop models for computer-aided detection (CAD), capable to classify, at early stages, masses spotted in X-ray images. The dataset was available at KDD CUP 2008. The imbalanced nature of the dataset and its high-dimensional feature space poses problems to the modelling that are tackled using dimension reduction techniques. The algorithms are compared using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) between true-and false-positive rates (TPR and FPR). Other metrics, such as patient sensitivity and FPR are used and discussed. We find that Naive Bayes classifier achieved the best performance irrespective of the combination of datasets and allow controlled trade-offs between false positives and negatives.

Due to the rare occurrence of crystals, images must be manually inspected, a laborious process. We develop a solution incorporating a regularized, logistic regression model for automatically evaluating these images. Standard image features, such as shape context, Gabor filters and Fourier transforms, are first extracted to represent the heterogeneous appearance of our images. Then the proposed solution utilizes Elastic Net to select relevant features. Its L-1-regularization mitigates the effects of our large dataset, and its L-2-regularization ensures proper operation when the feature number exceeds the sample number. A two-tier cascade classifier based on naive Bayes and random forest algorithms categorized the images. In order to validate the proposed method, we experimentally compare it with naive Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, random forest, and their two-tier cascade classifiers, by 10-fold cross validation. Our experimental results demonstrate a 3-category accuracy of 74%, outperforming other models. In addition, Elastic Net better reduces the false negatives responsible for a high, domain specific risk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply Elastic Net to classifying protein crystallization images.

Automated ECG analysis integrated with experts' opinions may provide more accurate and reliable results for detection of arrhythmia. In this study, a novel genetic algorithm-neural network (GA-NN) approach is proposed as a classifier, and compared with other classification methods. The GA-NN approach was shown to perform better than alternative approaches (e.g. k-nn, SVM, naive Bayes, Bayesian networks) on the UCI Arrythmia and the novel TEPAS ECG datasets, where the GA resulted in a feature reduction of 95%. Based on the selected features, several rule extraction algorithms are applied to allow the interpretation of the classification results by the experts. In this application, the accuracy and interpretability of results are more important than processing speed. The results show that neural network based approaches benefit greatly from dimensionality reduction, and by employing GA, we can train the NN reliably.

However, the clusters produced are often found not in accord with user's perception of the document collection. In this paper we describe a novel framework and explore whether clustering performance can be improved by including user supervision at the feature level. Unlike existing semi-supervised clustering methods, which ask the user to label documents, this framework interactively asks the user to label features. The proposed method ranks all features based on the recent clusters using cluster-based feature selection and presents a list of highly ranked features to the user for labeling. The feature set for the next clustering iteration includes both features accepted by the user and other highly ranked features. The experimental results on several real datasets demonstrate that the feature set obtained using the new interactive framework can produce clusters that better match the user's expectations compared with the unsupervised version of the methods. Moreover, we quantify and evaluate the effect of reweighting previously accepted features and of user effort. Different underlying clustering algorithms such as K Means and Multinomial Naive Bayes model are demonstrated to perform very well with the newly proposed framework.

Online breakage detection of multitooth tools using classifier ensembles for imbalanced data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE			English	Article						industrial applications; breakage detection; multitooth tools; classifier ensembles; imbalanced data	FAULT-DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DIAGNOSIS; WEAR; ALGORITHMS; MACHINE; SYSTEMS	Cutting tool breakage detection is an important task, due to its economic impact on mass production lines in the automobile industry. This task presents a central limitation: real data-sets are extremely imbalanced because breakage occurs in very few cases compared with normal operation of the cutting process. In this paper, we present an analysis of different data-mining techniques applied to the detection of insert breakage in multitooth tools. The analysis applies only one experimental variable: the electrical power consumption of the tool drive. This restriction profiles real industrial conditions more accurately than other physical variables, such as acoustic or vibration signals, which are not so easily measured. Many efforts have been made to design a method that is able to identify breakages with a high degree of reliability within a short period of time. The solution is based on classifier ensembles for imbalanced data-sets. Classifier ensembles are combinations of classifiers, which in many situations are more accurate than individual classifiers. Six different base classifiers are tested: Decision Trees, Rules, Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbour, Multilayer Perceptrons and Logistic Regression. Three different balancing strategies are tested with each of the classifier ensembles and compared to their performance with the original data-set: Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE), undersampling and a combination of SMOTE and undersampling. To identify the most suitable data-mining solution, Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) graph and Recall-precision graph are generated and discussed. The performance of logistic regression ensembles on the balanced data-set using the combination of SMOTE and undersampling turned out to be the most suitable technique. Finally a comparison using industrial performance measures is presented, which concludes that this technique is also more suited to this industrial problem than the other techniques presented in the bibliography.

J	Wang, YW; Yao, M; Yang, JH				Wang, Yiwen; Yao, Min; Yang, Jianhua			NIM: A Node Influence Based Method for Cancer Classification	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							GENE-EXPRESSION; MICROARRAY DATA; PREDICTION; NETWORKS; TUMOR; CHIPS	The classification of different cancer types owns great significance in the medical field. However, the great majority of existing cancer classification methods are clinical-based and have relatively weak diagnostic ability. With the rapid development of gene expression technology, it is able to classify different kinds of cancers using DNA microarray. Our main idea is to confront the problem of cancer classification using gene expression data from a graph-based view. Based on a new node influence model we proposed, this paper presents a novel high accuracy method for cancer classification, which is composed of four parts: the first is to calculate the similarity matrix of all samples, the second is to compute the node influence of training samples, the third is to obtain the similarity between every test sample and each class using weighted sum of node influence and similarity matrix, and the last is to classify each test sample based on its similarity between every class. The data sets used in our experiments are breast cancer, central nervous system, colon tumor, prostate cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and lung cancer. experimental results showed that our node influence based method (NIM) is more efficient and robust than the support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, C4.5, naive Bayes, and CART.

If these psychological pressures cannot properly be resolved, it will turn to mental problems, which might lead to serious consequences. Traditional face-to-face psychological diagnosis and treatment cannot meet the demand of relieving teenagers' stress completely due to its lack of timeliness and diversity. With micro-blog becoming a popular media channel for teenagers' information acquisition, interaction, self-expression, emotion release, we envision a micro-blog platform to sense psychological pressures through teenagers' tweets, and assist teenagers to release their stress through micro-blog. We investigate a number of features that may reveal teenagers' pressures from their tweets, and then test five classifiers (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest, and Gaussian Process Classifier) for pressure detection. We also present ways to aggregate single-tweet based detection results in time series to overview teenagers' stress fluctuation over a period of time. Experimental results show that the Gaussian Process Classifier offers the highest detection accuracy due to its robustness in the presence of a large degree of uncertainty that may be encountered with previously-unseen training data on tweets. Among the features, tweet's emotional degree combining negative emotional words, emoticons, exclamation and question marks, plays a primary role in psychological pressure detection.

The computational complexity of inferences on such models depends on the irrelevance/independence concept adopted. In this paper, we study inferential complexity under the concepts of epistemic irrelevance and strong independence. We show that inferences under strong independence are NP-hard even in trees with binary variables except for a single ternary one. We prove that under epistemic irrelevance the polynomial-time complexity of inferences in credal trees is not likely to extend to more general models (e.g., singly connected topologies). These results clearly distinguish networks that admit efficient inferences and those where inferences are most likely hard, and settle several open questions regarding their computational complexity. We show that these results remain valid even if we disallow the use of zero probabilities. We also show that the computation of bounds on the probability of the future state in a hidden Markov model is the same whether we assume epistemic irrelevance or strong independence, and we prove a similar result for inference in naive Bayes structures. These inferential equivalences are important for practitioners, as hidden Markov models and naive Bayes structures are used in real applications of imprecise probability.

J	Przybyla, P; Teisseyre, P				Przybyla, Piotr; Teisseyre, Pawel			Analysing Utterances in Polish Parliament to Predict Speaker's Background	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE LINGUISTICS			English	Article							SPEECHES	In this study we use transcripts of the Sejm (Polish parliament) to predict speaker's background: gender, education, party affiliation and birth year. We create learning cases consisting of 100 utterances by the same author and, using rich multi-level annotations of the source corpus, extract a variety of features from them. They are either text-based (e. g. mean sentence length, percentage of long words or frequency of named entities of certain types) or word-based (unigrams and bigrams of surface forms, lemmas and interpretations). Next, we apply general-purpose feature selection, regression and classification algorithms and obtain results well over the baseline (97% of accuracy for gender, 95% for education, 76-88% for party). Comparative study shows that random forest and k nearest neighbour's classifier usually outperform other methods commonly used in text mining, such as support vector machines and naive Bayes classifier. Performed evaluation experiments help to understand how these solutions deal with such sparse and highly-dimensional data and which of the considered traits influence the language the most. We also address difficulties caused by some of the properties of Polish, typical also for other Slavonic languages.

Experiencing KEEL Software: Application to Fatigue Data Segment Classification	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 21ST NATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES (SKSM21): GERMINATION OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION AND RESEARCH TOWARDS GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	21st National Symposium on Mathematical Sciences (SKSM)	NOV 06-08, 2013	MALAYSIA	Malaysian Math Sci Soc	Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci	KEEL software; data mining classification; fatigue data segment; discretization; feature selection	ALGORITHMS	Most researchers have doubts over what type of classification model is most suitable for representing their data when applying a data mining approach. However, this quandary can be solved by performing a comparison between the available models. Generating multiple classification models simultaneously is cost-effective when using free data mining tools such as KEEL (Knowledge Extraction based on Evolutionary Learning). KEEL is an interactive data mining software that provides a high level of functionality for users. This paper presents an experience of using this user-friendly software to solve a fatigue data segment classification problem. The problem concerns classifying fatigue data segments whether they consist of low or high damage. Experiments over the dataset using three different types of classification algorithms (i.e. CN2, C4.5 and Naive-Bayes), two discretization methods, and two filter-type feature selection methods show that there is no optimal classification algorithm in terms of indexing performance for our specific problem. Interestingly, however, this study does provide minor evidence that classifier performance could be increased by pairing discretization and feature selection methods appropriately.

Experiments are designed to learn the pattern of an earthquake signal recorded from smart phone's accelerometer. The signal is processed using N-gram modeling as feature extractor for machine learning. For the classifier, this study use Naive Bayes, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Random Forest. Our result shows that the best classification accuracy is achieved by Random Forest method. Its accuracy reached 93.15%. It can be concluded that smart phones can be used as an earthquake detector.

Services are supervised by autonomous agents which are responsible for deciding which service should be chosen for interoperation. Agents learn the choice strategy autonomously using supervised learning. In experiments we show that supervised learning (Naive Bayes, C4.5 and Ripper) allows to achieve much better efficiency than simple strategies such as random choice or round robin. What is also important, supervised learning generates a knowledge in a readable form, which may be analyzed by experts.

We used the MetalMapper sensor, from which extrinsic and intrinsic parameters are determined by the combined Differential Evolution (DE) and Ortho-Normalized Volume Magnetic Source (ONVMS) algorithms. The inversion provides spatial locations and intrinsic time-series total ONVMS principal eigenvalues. These are fit to a power-decay empirical model, providing dimensionality reduction to 3 coefficients (k, b, and g) for polarizability decay. Anomaly target features are grouped using the unsupervised clustering Weighted-Pair Group Method with Averaging (WPGMA) algorithm. Central elements of each cluster are dug, and the results are used to train the next round of dig requests. A Naive Bayes classifier is used as a supervised learning algorithm, in which the product of each feature's independent probability density represents each class of UXO in the feature space. We request ground truths for anomalies in rounds, until there are no more Targets of Interest (TOT) in consecutive requests. This fully automatic procedure requires no expert intervention, saving time and money. Naive Bayes outperformed previous efforts with Gaussian Mixture Models(GMM) in all cases.

The proposed system classifies received signal strength measured from existing Wi-Fi access points, and predicts location of mobile devices based on the measured Wi-Fi signal strength and building floor plan. We collected data using different mobile devices, generated heat maps of signal strength recorded in a high-rise building for each Wi-Fi access point, and evaluated three location estimation methods. We applied clustering and Naive-Bayes algorithms to train the classifier and compared the location estimation accuracy of the three methods on the collected dataset. Experimental results show that the system can achieve an average of over 80% location prediction accuracy by clustering data into a number of location zones for the dataset.

However the majority of such research is based on the assumption that there is enough resolution so that the subject's face can be resolved. Hence the majority of the research is actually in the face recognition and facial feature area. A gap exists for gender classification under challenging operating conditions-different seasonal conditions, different clothing, etc.-and when the subject's face cannot be resolved due to lack of resolution. The Seasonal Weather and Gender (SWAG) Database is a novel database that contains subjects walking through a scene under operating conditions that span a calendar year. This paper exploits a subset of that database-the SWAG One dataset-using data mining techniques, traditional classifiers (ex. Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, etc.) and traditional (canny edge detection, etc.) and non-traditional (height/width ratios, etc.) feature extractors to achieve high correct gender classification rates (greater than 85%). Another novelty includes exploiting frame differentials.

Such reviews require frequent and time-consuming updating. This study aims to compare the performance of combining relatively simple Bayesian classifiers using a fixed rule, to the relatively complex linear Support Vector Machine for medical systematic reviews. A collection of four systematic drug reviews is used to compare the performance of the classifiers in this study. Cross-validation experiments were performed to evaluate performance. We found that combining Discriminative Multinomial Naive Bayes and Complement Naive Bayes performs equally well or better than SVM while being about 25% faster than SVM in training time. The results support the usefulness of using an ensemble of Bayesian classifiers for machine learning-based automation of systematic reviews of medical topics, especially when datasets have a large number of abstracts. Further work is needed to integrate the powerful features of such Bayesian classifiers together.

Although many machine-learning and statistical techniques have been proposed widely for defining fault prone modules in software fault prediction, but this area have yet to be explored with high accuracy and less error. Unfortunately, several earlier methods including artificial neural networks and its variants that have been used, marred by limitations such as inability to adequately handle uncertainties in software measurement data which leads to low accuracy, instability and inconsistency in prediction. In this paper, first the effect of irrelevant and inconsistent modules on fault prediction is decreased by designing a new framework, in which the entire project's modules are clustered. The generated output is then passed to the next model in the hybrid setting, which is a probabilistic neural network (PNN) for training and prediction. We used four NASA data sets to evaluate our results. Performance evaluation in terms of false positive rate, false negative rate, and overall error are calculated and showed 30% to 60% improvement in false negative rate compared to other well-performed training methods such as naive Bayes and random forest.

The hybrid model is developed with clustering and classification approaches. Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) is used to cluster the historical variables. The clustered data are then used as inputs to Back-Propagation Neural Network classification. The label dataset having value greater than zero in fire area size are clustered using FCM to produce two categorical clusters, i.e.: Light Burn, and Heavy Burn for its label. On the other hand, fire area label with value zero is clustered as No Burn Area. A Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) is trained based on these data to classify the output (burn area) in three categories, No Burn Area, Light Burn and Heavy Burn. The experiment shows promising results depicting classification size of forest fire with the accuracy of confusion matrix around 97, 50 % and Cohens Kappa 0.954. This research also compares the performance of proposed model with other classification method such as SVM, Naive Bayes, DCT Tree, and K-NN that showed BPNN have best performance.

Cattle Identification Using Muzzle Print Images Based on Texture Features Approach	PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INNOVATIONS IN BIO-INSPIRED COMPUTING AND APPLICATIONS (IBICA 2014)	Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Innovations in Bio-Inspired Computing and Applications (IBICA)	2014	Ostrava, CZECH REPUBLIC	Tech Univ Ostrava, ESF			PATTERN	The increasing growth of the world trade and growing concerns of food safety by consumers need a cutting-edge animal identification and traceability systems as the simple recording and reading of tags-based systems are only effective in eradication programs of national disease. Animal biometric-based solutions, e.g. muzzle imaging system, offer an effective and secure, and rapid method of addressing the requirements of animal identification and traceability systems. In this paper, we propose a robust and fast cattle identification approach. This approach makes use of Local Binary Pattern (LBP) to extract local invariant features from muzzle print images. We also applied different classifiers including Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, SVM and KNN for cattle identification. The experimental results showed that our approach is superior than existed works as ours achieves 99,5% identification accuracy. In addition, the results proved that our proposed method achieved this high accuracy even if the testing images are rotated in various angels or occluded with different parts of their sizes.

Our model comprises two phases: risk factor calculation and prediction. We start by calculating the risk factors associated with the outcome, followed by a prediction phase that utilises a random forest approach for classification into one of four obtained classes, namely low, mid, high, and moderate. Experimental results show that the employed random forest classifier provides better prediction accuracy compared to other machine learning techniques including Bayes net, multi-layer perceptron, radial basis function and naive Bayes tree classifiers.

The recent arrival of DNA microarray technology has led to the concurrent monitoring of thousands of gene expressions in a single chip which stimulates the progress in cancer classification. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid approach for microarray data classification based on nearest neighbor (KNN), naive Bayes, and support vector machine (SVM). Feature selection prior to classification plays a vital role and a feature selection technique which combines discrete wavelet transform(DWT) and moving window technique (MWT) is used. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the conventional classifiers like support vector machine, nearest neighbor, and naive Bayes. Experiments have been conducted on both real and benchmark datasets and the results indicate that the ensemble approach produces higher classification accuracy than conventional classifiers. This paper serves as an automated system for the classification of cancer and can be applied by doctors in real cases which serve as a boon to the medical community. This work further reduces the misclassification of cancers which is highly not allowed in cancer detection.

To detect emotion from nonstationary EEG signals, a sophisticated learning algorithm that can represent high-level abstraction is required. This study proposes the utilization of a deep learning network (DLN) to discover unknown feature correlation between input signals that is crucial for the learning task. The DLN is implemented with a stacked autoencoder (SAE) using hierarchical feature learning approach. Input features of the network are power spectral densities of 32-channel EEG signals from 32 subjects. To alleviate overfitting problem, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to extract the most important components of initial input features. Furthermore, covariate shift adaptation of the principal components is implemented to minimize the nonstationary effect of EEG signals. Experimental results show that the DLNis capable of classifying three different levels of valence and arousal with accuracy of 49.52% and 46.03%, respectively. Principal component based covariate shift adaptation enhances the respective classification accuracy by 5.55% and 6.53%. Moreover, DLN provides better performance compared to SVM and naive Bayes classifiers.

J	Sarac, E; Ozel, SA				Sarac, Esra; Ozel, Selma Ayse			An Ant Colony Optimization Based Feature Selection for Web Page Classification	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							FEATURE-SUBSET-SELECTION; TEXT CATEGORIZATION; ALGORITHM; SYSTEM; WORDS	The increased popularity of the web has caused the inclusion of huge amount of information to the web, and as a result of this explosive information growth, automated web page classification systems are needed to improve search engines' performance. Web pages have a large number of features such as HTML/XML tags, URLs, hyperlinks, and text contents that should be considered during an automated classification process. The aim of this study is to reduce the number of features to be used to improve runtime and accuracy of the classification of web pages. In this study, we used an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm to select the best features, and then we applied the well-known C4.5, naive Bayes, and k nearest neighbor classifiers to assign class labels to web pages. We used the WebKB and Conference datasets in our experiments, and we showed that using the ACO for feature selection improves both accuracy and runtime performance of classification. We also showed that the proposed ACO based algorithm can select better features with respect to the well-known information gain and chi square feature selection methods.

The accelerometer is a widely-used tool for this purpose, but the quadruped Sony AIBO does not have such a high-end sensor compared to the latest state-of-art developments. Past works focused on attaching replacement sensors to the robot dog as well as collecting many samples for machine learning methods although some studies did not address this issue at all. This paper focuses on improvements with sensor fusion of built-in sensors to recognize wider variety of surfaces and get similar or better accuracy than earlier experiments. The combined features are based on the accelerometer and paw sensors to make the recognition more robust and a naive Bayes classifier achieves 85-91% accuracy for different locomotion speeds. Evaluation suggests that this method can reduce the data collection time for training samples dramatically and it is suitable for practical applications.

PMLC exploits limited information of the signal strength and combines a clustering task and a classification task. PMLC is compared with well-known machine learning classifiers, i.e. Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Artificial Neural Networks. The performance comparison is done in terms of accuracy of position classification and precision of distance classifier. The result of this study shows that PMLC can increase performance for indoor positioning of all classifiers when an appropriate number of clusters is assigned in the clustering process. In addition, PMLC is the most optimized model while having Decision Tree to be its classifier.

Statistical Feature Selection for Enhanced Detection of Brain Tumor	APPLICATIONS OF DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING XXXVII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Applications of Digital Image Processing XXXVII	AUG 18-21, 2014	San Diego, CA	SPIE		Glioma; feature selection; tumor; decision tree	CERVICAL-CANCER; PROGNOSIS; GLIOMA	Feature-based methods are widely used in the brain tumor recognition system. Robust of early cancer detection is one of the most powerful image processing tools. Specifically, statistical features, such as geometric mean, harmonic mean, mean excluding outliers, median, percentiles, skewness and kurtosis, have been extracted from brain tumor glioma to aid in discriminating two levels namely, Level I and Level II using fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence in the diagnosis of brain tumor. Statistical feature describes the major characteristics of each level from glioma which is an important step to evaluate heterogeneity of cancer area pixels. In this paper, we address the task of feature selection to identify the relevant subset of features in the statistical domain, while discarding those that are either redundant or confusing, thereby improving the performance of feature-based scheme to distinguish between Level I and Level II. We apply a Decision Structure algorithm to find the optimal combination of non-homogeneity based statistical features for the problem at hand. We employ a Naive Bayes classifier to evaluate the performance of the optimal statistical feature based scheme in terms of its glioma Level I and Level II discrimination capability and use real-data collected from 17 patients have a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Dataset provided from 3 Tesla MR imaging system by MD Anderson Cancer Center. For the specific data analyzed, it is shown that the identified dominant features yield higher classification accuracy, with lower number of false alarms and missed detections, compared to the full statistical based feature set. This work has been proposed and analyzed specific GBM types which Level I and Level II and the dominant features were considered as feature aid to prognostic indicators. These features were selected automatically to be better able to determine prognosis from classical imaging studies.

A chromosome is assigned to one of the seven groups from A to G, based on the 'Denver System' of classification of chromosomes. Chromosomes within the group are difficult to identify, possessing almost identical characteristics including the length and centromere position. The proposed method is applied to the chromosome dataset and the similarity values using the generalized Lukasiewicz structure are calculated. The similarity values are aggregated with the help of Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operators with a Regular Increasing Monotone (RIM) quantifier and the chromosome is assigned to that group for which it has the highest value of similarity. This work evaluates the performance of classifiers including Naive Bayes, Quadratic classifier and a novel, unsupervised, Fuzzy Similarity Classifier guided by OWA Operators, in classifying the Denver Group of chromosomes. A fundamental review on fuzzy similarity based classification is also presented. Experimental results clearly demonstrates that the proposed Fuzzy Similarity Classifier guided by OWA Operators with a RIM quantifier, produces the best classification results with a mean classification accuracy of 96.0028% and variance of 5.0871e-005. Statistical testing with one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) at 95% and 99% level of confidence and Tukey's post-hoc analysis is performed to validate the selection of the classifier. The proposed Fuzzy Similarity Classifier gives the most promising classification results and can be applied to any large scale biomedical data and other applications.

More than 350 000 deaths are reported annually, which are caused by HCV. HCV, similar to a variety of viruses, causes disease in humans by altering protein-protein interactions within the host cells. Experimental approaches for the detection of host-virus PPIs have many inherent limitations. Computational approaches to predict these interactions are therefore of significant importance. While many studies have been developed to predict intra-species PPIs in the last decade, predictions on inter-species PPIs such as human-HCV PPIs are rare. In this study, we developed an ensemble learning method to predict PPIs between human and HCV proteins. Our model utilises four well-established diverse learners as base classifiers including random forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). In addition, an MLP was used as a meta-learner to combine base learners' predictions to provide the final prediction. To encode human and HCV proteins as feature vectors, we used six different descriptors as follows: amino acid composition (ACC), pseudo amino acid composition (PAC), evolutionary information feature, network centrality measures, tissue information and post-translational modification information. To assess the prediction power of the proposed method, we assembled a benchmark dataset composed of confident positive and negative PPIs. In a 10-fold cross-validation experiment, our prediction method achieved accuracy and specificity as high as 83% and 94%, respectively. Furthermore, in an independent test set the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 84% and a specificity of 92%. When compared with the existing method, our method showed a better performance. These results revealed that our method is suitable for performing PPI prediction in a host-pathogen context.

Usage of defective tablets can be harmful for patients. In this research we proposed a nondestructive method to identify defective and nondefective tablets using their surface morphology. Three different environmental factors temperature, humidity and moisture are analyzed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Multiple textural features are extracted from the surface of the defective and nondefective tablets. These textural features are gray level cooccurrence matrix, run length matrix, histogram, autoregressivemodel and HAAR wavelet. Total textural features extracted from images are 281. We performed an analysis on all those 281, top 15, and top 2 features. Top 15 features are extracted using three different feature reduction techniques: chi-square, gain ratio and relief-F. In this research we have used three different classifiers: support vector machine, K-nearest neighbors and naive Bayes to calculate the accuracies against proposed method using two experiments, that is, leave-one-out cross-validation technique and train test models. We tested each classifier against all selected features and then performed the comparison of their results. The experimental work resulted in that in most of the cases SVM performed better than the other two classifiers.

To resolve this problem, an improved algorithm based on C4.5 is proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithm firstly modifies the available training data according to the predictions of C4.5, then continuous data is discretized by dividing many finite intervals of attributes, this modified training data is used to train TANG. In this way it can improve the classification accuracy of the TANG. The experimental results show that the improved algorithm is superior to TANG in terms of classification accuracy.

Existing studies have investigated many features for prediction. However, features from the users who have potential to retweet a tweet have not been fully explored for this problem. Also, the impact of tweet's post time on its early-stage popularity has been neglected. To address these issues, we study two prediction tasks in this paper, i.e. predicting the popularity of a tweet based on the observation in 1 Hour after being posted (PP1H) or the observation of its first k retweets (PPkR), and investigate a wide spectrum of features to identify effective features for each prediction task. We extract structural features including retweet network features and border network features from the underlying user network, and temporal features from the observed retweets. To mitigate the impact of tweet's post time on its early-stage popularity, we introduce the notation of tweet time and use it to measure the temporal features. We treat both prediction tasks as classification problems and apply five standard classifiers (i.e. naive bayes, k-nearest-neighbor, support vector machine, logistic regression and bagging decision trees) for prediction. Experiments on Sina Weibo show that for PP1H task, bagging decision trees with all feature yield the best performance and border network features outperform other groups of features. For PPkR task, we find that satisfied prediction performance can be obtained based on only the temporal features of first 10 retweets. Furhter, by introducing tweet time, we can significantly improve the prediction performance of temporal features.

The standard test for OSA diagnosis is polysomnography (PSG), an expensive exam limited to urban areas. Furthermore, nearly half of all PSG tests results are negative for OSA. This work aims to reduce these unnecessary exams, by defining an auxiliary diagnostic method that could be used to assess patient's need for PSG, according to their probability of OSA diagnosis. A prospective study was conducted on adult patients with OSA suspicion who performed PSG at our sleep laboratory in Portugal. The studied clinical variables were defined after literature review and collected during consultation. Two comparable cohorts were studied for derivation (n=86) and validation (n=33) of models. Three classifiers were analyzed - a multiple logistic regression classifier (AUC=80.0%) and two Bayesian networks classifiers - Naive Bayes (AUC=81.3%) and Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN, AUC=81.4%) - aiming at the best possible specificity (identification of unnecessary exams). Overall, sensitivity-adjusted models could detect normal patients, preventing unnecessary PSG, while keeping sensitivity high. Furthermore, the graphical representation of TAN can be explored by the physician during consultation, making it a helpful tool to assess patients' need to perform PSG.

The goal of this study is to determine online interaction behaviours that predict weight loss performance. The problem is modelled as a binomial classification task for predicting whether a patient would lose significant weight, based on analysis of two obesity online communities. An expansion-reduction method was developed for the patient feature vector, where the expansion is based on concatenating network structure features and the reduction is based on feature subset selection. Further, empirical evaluation of classifiers was done on the datasets, before and after the expansion. Based on feature subset selection, centrality measures such as degree and betweenness were more predictive than basic demographic features. Top performers, compared with bottom performers, were significantly more active online and connected to more than one sub-community (at 95% CI and p<.05). In terms of classification, we found naive Bayes and decision tree methods had superior performance on the datasets, drastically reducing the false positive (FP) rate in some instances, and reaching a maximum F-score of 0.977, precision of 0.978 and AUC of 0.996. Current findings are consistent with previous reports that amount of online engagement correlates with weight loss, but our findings speak further to the types of engagement that yield best results.

In this study, we present a subject independent method for automatic classification of breath and related sounds during sleep. An experienced operator manually labelled segments of breath sounds from 11 sleeping subjects as: inspiration, expiration, inspiratory snoring, expiratory snoring, wheezing, other noise, and non-audible. Ten features were extracted and fed into 3 different classifiers: naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. Leave-one-out method was used in which data from each subject, in turn, is evaluated using models trained with all other subject. Mean accuracy for concurrent classification of all 7 classes reached 85.4%. Mean accuracy for separating data into 2 classes, snoring and non-snoring, reached 97.8%. To our knowledge, these are the highest accuracies achieved in automatic classification of all breath sounds components concurrently and for snoring, in a subject independent model.

This paper considers detecting churners in a 3.7 million mobile phone network. The two main issues are designing fast and efficient features and classifiers. We discuss both in this paper. We associate every caller in the network with an activity vector and an affinity graph, and our features are derived from activity levels computed from subgraphs of the affinity graph. These features reflect the graph-dependent nature of the problem. To compute these networks expeditiously, we extend as integral affinity graphs the concept of integral images. Our anomaly classifier is a cascaded classifier with stages that combine naive Bayes and decision tree classifiers. Simulations with a 3.7 million cell phone user network illustrate an anomaly classifier that reaches a false alarm rate of 0.8% with a churn detection rate of 71%.	[Deri, Joya A.; Moura, Jose M.

In this paper, we examine the classification of emotional speech in patients with PD and the classification of PD speech. Participants were recorded speaking short statements with different emotional prosody which were classified with three methods (naive Bayes, random forests, and support vector machines) using 209 unique auditory features. Feature sets were reduced using simple statistical testing. We achieve accuracies of 65.5% and 73.33% on classifying between the emotions and between PD vs. control, respectively. These results may assist in the future development of automated early detection systems for diagnosing patients with PD.

A faster method for taxonomic classification based on metagenomic reads is required with the improvement of DNA sequencer's throughput in recent years. In this research we focus on naive Bayes, which can quickly classify organisms with sufficient accuracy, and we have developed an acceptably fast, yet more accurate classification method using improved naive Bayes, Weightily Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (WAODE). Additionally, we accelerated WAODE classification by introducing a cutoff for the mutual information content, and achieved a 20 times faster classification speed while keeping comparable prediction accuracy.

However, Bayesian network classifiers that minimize the number of misclassification errors ignore different misclassification costs. For example, in rock burst prediction, the cost of misclassifying a rock which happens to burst as a rock which doesn't burst is much higher than the opposite type of error. This paper studies the cost-sensitive learning and then applies it to different Bayesian Network classifiers, and the resulted algorithms are called cost-sensitive Bayesian Network classifiers. The experimental results on 36 UCI datasets validate their effectiveness in terms of the total misclassification costs. Finally, we apply the cost-sensitive Bayesian Network classifiers to some real-world rock burst prediction examples and achieve good results.

These levels of abstraction represent attribute values of increasing precision. Specifically, we assume attribute values constitute an ontology (i.e., attribute value ontology) reflecting a domain-specific background knowledge, where more general values subsumes more precise ones. While there are approaches that consider levels of abstraction during learning, the novelty of our proposal consists in exploring levels of abstraction when classifying new examples. The described scheme is essential when tests that increase precision of example description are associated with costs - such a situation is often encountered in medical diagnosis. Experimental evaluation of the proposed classification scheme combined with ontological Bayes classifier (i.e., a naive Bayes classifier expanded to handle attribute value ontologies) demonstrates that the classification accuracy obtained at higher levels of abstraction (i.e., more general description of classified examples) converges very quickly to the classification accuracy for classified examples represented precisely.

The paper presents results of research on influence of data discretization on efficiency of Naive Bayes classifier. The analysis has been carried on datasets founded on texts of two male and two female authors using the WEKA data mining software framework. The binary classification was performed separately for both datasets for wide range of parameters of discretization process in order to investigate dependency between ways of discretization and quality of classification using Naive Bayes method. The numerical results of tests have been compared and discussed and some observations and conclusions formulated. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B. V.

We use an attribute value ontology (AVO) to represent examples at different levels of abstraction (levels of precision). This precision can be improved by conducting diagnostic tests. The selection of these diagnostic tests is generally a non-trivial task. We consider the hypothesis-driven interactive classification, where a decision maker chooses diagnostic tests that approve or reject her hypothesis (the classification of a new example to a one or more selected decision classes). Specifically, we present two approaches to the selection of diagnostic tests: the use of the measure of information gain and the analysis of the classification results for these diagnostic tests using an ontological Bayes classifier (OBC).

In order to detect information leakage by some internal insiders, anomaly detection using individual and community behavior models have been developed. The basic assumption of anomaly detection is each user has his/her own profile of activities and anomaly detection algorithm attempts to identify any deviation from the basic profile by each user. Both models neglected the possibility of change of individual user profile, e.g. change of individual interests. We propose here an anomaly detection model of insider threat using file content. The proposed model uses the document segmentation and Naive Bayes algorithm to classify the contents of files in an organization. We then set up the correlation matrices between users and their interests, and also the user community and their interests. We then propose a comprehensive model to detect the insider threat, which takes into consideration of the deviations of individual users' current behaviors, their historical behaviors and their associated community behaviors simultaneously. According to the experimental test results, the proposed model can successfully detect the anomaly access to files in the internal systems.

When used to analyze classification results, the method, which is widely known as permutation testing, works by testing the null hypothesis after generating a permutation distribution (PD) of classification accuracies/errors that is centered around chance-level. In principle, these PDs should behave in accord with the central limit theorem (CLT) if the independence condition in the cross-validation classification error (test statistic) is fulfilled. Permutation testing has been widely used in pattern classification applied to neuroimaging studies to eradicate chance performance. In this work, we used Anderson-Darling test to evaluate the accordance level of PDs of classification accuracies to normality expected under CLT. An exhaustive simulation study was carried out using functional magnetic resonance imaging data that were collected while human subjects responded to visual stimulation paradigms and the following classifiers were considered: support vector machines, logistic regression, ridge logistic regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, sparse multinomial logistic regression, and artificial neural networks. Our results showed that while the standard normal distribution does not adequately fit to PDs, it tends to fit well when the mean classification accuracy averaged over a set of independent classifiers is considered. We also found that across-run motion correction of the fMRI data weakens the accordance of PDs with CLT and this phenomenon could be due to the across runs dependence resulting from motion correction.

Current neurophysiological measurements can distinguish groups of healthy controls and groups of schizophrenia patients. Individual classification based on neurophysiological measurements only shows moderate accuracy. In this study, we wanted to examine whether it is possible to distinguish controls and patients individually with a good accuracy. To this end we used a combination of features from different test paradigms, in particular the auditory and visual P300 and the mismatch negativity. We selected 54 patients and 54 controls, matched for age and gender, from the data available at the UPC Kortenberg. The EEG-data were high-and low-pass filtered, epoched, artefacts were rejected and the epochs were averaged. Features (latencies and amplitudes of component peaks) were extracted from the averaged signals. The resulting dataset was used to train and test classification algorithms. Here we applied Naive Bayes and Decision Tree (without and with AdaBoost). A combination of three evoked potentials allowed us to accurately classify individual subjects as either control or patient. For the three investigated classifiers a total accuracy of more than 80%, a sensitivity of above 82% and a specificity of at least 78% was found.

The multivariate FS methods are generally time-consuming although they displayed better performance than the univariate FS methods. In this study, we applied a fast sparse representation method based on Smoothed 10 (SL0) algorithm to select relevant features in fMRI data. The performance of Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) classifier using voxels selected by SL0 and the univariate t-test methods were also compared. Results of both simulated and real fMRI experiments demonstrated that the SL0 method largely improved the classification accuracy of GNB compared to the t-test method for all the noise levels.

While large volumes of labeled data are currently available for some of these problems, little or no labeled data exists for others. Manually labeling data can be costly and time consuming. An alternative is to learn classifiers in a domain adaptation setting in which existing labeled data can be lever-aged from a related problem, referred to as source domain, in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data and large amount of unlabeled data for the problem of interest, or target domain. In this paper, we propose two similar domain adaptation classifiers based on a naive Bayes algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a framework to grade metastatic liver histology images based on the spatial organization inter and intra regions. After detecting the presence of metastases, we first decompose the image into regions corresponding to the tissue types (sane, cancerous, vessels and gaps). A sample of each type is further decomposed into the contained biological objects (nuclei, stroma, gaps). The spatial relations between all the pairs of regions and objects are measured using a Force Histogram Decomposition. A specimen is described using a Bag of Words model aggregating the features measured on all its randomly acquired images. The grading is made using a Naive Bayes Classifier. Experiments on a 23 mice dataset with CT26 intrasplenic tumors highlight the relevance of the spatial relations with a correct grading rate of 78.95%.

In contrast with the classical Vector Space Model which represents each document by a unique vector in the feature space, our model consists in representing each document by a vector in the space of training documents of each category. We develop, for this novel model, a discriminative classifier which is based on the norms of the generated vectors by our model. We call this algorithm the Nearest Cetroid based on Vector Norms. Our major goal, by the proposition of such new classification framework, is to overcome the problems related to huge dimensionality and vector sparsity which are commonly faced in Text Classification problems. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework by comparing its effectiveness and efficiency with those of some standard classifiers when used with the classical document representation. The studied classifiers are Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN). We conduct our experiments on multi-lingual balanced and unbalanced binary data sets. Our results show that our algorithm typically performs well since it is competitive with the classical methods and, at the same time, dramatically faster especially in comparison with NB and kNN. We also apply our model on the Reuters21578 corpus so as to evaluate its performance in a multi-class environment. We can say that the obtained result (85.4% in terms of micro-F1) is promising and that it can be improved in future works.

However most blogs, forums or online Q& A websites have poor searchability for specific programming language source code. Naive thumb rules based on the file extension if any are invariably used for syntax highlighting, indentation and other ways to improve readability of the code by programming language editors. A more systematic way to identify the language in which a given source file was written would be of immense value. We believe that simple Bayesiam models would be adequate for this given the intrinsic syntactic structure of any programming language. In this paper, we present Bayesian learning models for correctly identifying the programming language in which a given piece of source code was written, with high probability. We have used 20000 source code files across 10 programming languages to train and test the model using the following Bayesian classifier models - Naive Bayes, Bayesian Network and Multinomial Naive Bayes. Lastly, we show a performance comparison among the three models in terms of classification accuracy on the test data.

An application in which two expert systems are used for the differential diagnosis of hypertension is presented. These systems aim to facilitate the diagnosis process of primary, endocrine and renal hypertension. A Naive Bayes Classifier and a Fuzzy Inference System were designed and implemented in order to differentiate the presented types of hypertension. The application was designed based on the client-server architecture, using Cloud Computing techniques and Android programming.

Sabotaging the quality of the results retrieved by search engines can lead users to doubt the search engine provider. Spam websites can serve as means of phishing. This paper shows a spam host detection approach that uses support vector machines(SVM) for classification. We create a parallel version of standard Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) to determine free parameters of the SVM classifier and apply our proposed model to a content web spamming dataset, WEBSPAM-UK2011. Our implementation of the parallel PSO is constructed on a pool of threads and each thread executes tasks associated to a particle from the swarm. Experiments showed that our proposed model can achieve a higher accuracy than regular SVM and outperforms other classifiers (C4.5, Naive Bayes). Furthermore, parallel version of standard Particle Swam Optimization(PSO) can efficiently select parameters for SVM.

However, most of this research has been conducted using English language data, and relatively little has considered Korean. In this paper, we demonstrate a systematic analysis framework using Korean Twitter data to mine temporal and spatial trends of brand images. A publicly available Korean morpheme analyzer is used to analyze Korean tweets grammatically, and we construct Korean polarity dictionaries containing a noun, adjective, verb, and/or root to automatically analyze the sentiment of each tweet message. Sentiment classification is performed by a support vector machine and multinomial naive Bayes classifier. In particular, our own feature selection step improves the support vector machine sentiment classification accuracy to 80%. Based on this result, we visualize the temporal and spatial distribution of brand images, and present the temporal changes of brand-related keyword networks. Our analysis enables trends in brand awareness to be systematically traced and evaluated. This allows various other analyses, such as advantages and disadvantages of the brand, and a comparison with its competitors.

In emotion recognition, bio-signals reflect sequences of neural activity induced by emotional events and also, have many technical advantages. The aim of this study is to classify six emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and neutral) that human have often experienced in real life from multi-channel bio-signals using machine learning algorithms. We have measured physiological responses of three-hundred participants for acquisition of bio-signals such as electrodermal activity, electrocardiograph, skin temperature, and photoplethysmograph during six emotions induction. Also, for emotion classification, we have extracted eighteen features from the signals and performed emotion classification using five algorithms, linear discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes, classification and regression tree, self-organization map and support vector machine. The used algorithms were evaluated by only training, 10-fold cross-validation and repeated random sub-sampling validation. We have obtained recognition accuracy from 42.4 to 100% for only training and 39.2 to 53.9% for testing. Also, the result for testing showed that an accuracy of emotion recognition by Naive Bayes and linear discriminant analysis were highest (53.9%, 52.7%) and was lowest by support vector machine (39.2%). This means that Naive Bayes is the best emotion recognition algorithm for basic emotions. To apply to real system, we have to discuss in the view point of testing and this means that it needs to apply various methodologies for the accuracy improvement of emotion recognition in the future analysis.

Based on the basic principles of IDA and the features of datasets that IDA handles, the development of IDA is briefly summarized from three aspects, i.e., algorithm principle, the scale and type of the dataset. Moreover, the challenges facing the IDA in big data environment are analyzed from four views, including big data management, data collection, data analysis, and application pattern. It is also cleared that in order to extract more values from data, the further development of IDA should combine practical applications and theoretical researches together.

In this paper, we introduce an adaptive naive Bayes tree (NBTree) algorithm for scaling up the classification accuracy of multi-class classification problems, which considers the attributes that are used in the decision tree for the calculation of the naive assumption of class conditional independence. The NBTree is a hybrid classifier of decision tree and naive Bayes classifiers. In NBTree nodes contain and split as regular decision tree, but the leaves are replaced by naive Bayes classifier. We tested the performance of proposed algorithm against those of the existing decision tree and naive Bayes classifiers respectively using the classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity-specificity analysis, and 10-fold cross validation on 10 real benchmark datasets from UCI (University of California, Irvine) machine learning repository. The experimental results show that the proposed approach improved the classification accuracy of real life challenging multi-class problems.

A striking malware is obfuscation malware that is very difficult to detect. This kind of malware can create new variants that are similar to original malware feature but different about code. In order to deal with such types of malware, many approaches have been proposed, however, some of these approaches are ineffective due to their limited detection range, huge overheads or manual stages. Malware detection based on signature, for example, cannot overcome the obfuscation techniques of malware. Likewise, the behavior-based methods have the natural problems of a monitoring system such as recovery costs and long-lasting detection time. In this paper, we propose a new method (semantic set method) to detect metamorphic malware effectively by using semantic set (a set of changed values of registers or variables allocated in memory when a program is executed). For more details, this semantic set is analyzed by n-gram separator and Naive Bayes classifier to increase detection accuracy and reduce detection time. This system has been already experimented on different datasets and got the accuracy up to 98% and detection rate almost 100%.

It belongs to the "tracking by detection" method. Slight inaccuracies in the tracker can lead to incorrectly labeled training examples in these algorithms, which degrade the classifier and usually cause drift. In this paper, we incorporate the motion model into the traditional compressive tracking where we utilize the particle filter. Therefore, our algorithm can handle drifting problem to some extent. Meanwhile, in order to improve the discriminative power of the classifier to relieve drifting problem radically, a modified naive Bayes classifier is proposed. The proposed algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms on some challenging video sequences.

Non-Standard Words are: numbers, dates, acronyms, abbreviations, currency, etc. NSWs in Croatian language are determined according to Croatian NSW taxonomy. For the purpose of this research, 390 text documents were collected and formed the SKIPEZ collection with 6 classes: official, literary, informative, popular, educational and scientific. Text categorization experiment was conducted on three different representations of the SKIPEZ collection: in the first representation, the frequencies of NSWs are used as features; in the second representation, the statistic measures of NSWs (variance, coefficient of variation, standard deviation, etc.) are used as features; while the third representation combines the first two feature sets. Naive Bayes, CN2, C4.5, kNN, Classification Trees and Random Forest algorithms were used in text categorization experiments. The best categorization results are achieved using the first feature set (NSW frequencies) with the categorization accuracy of 87%. This suggests that the NSWs should be considered as features in highly inflectional languages, such as Croatian. NSW based features reduce the dimensionality of the feature space without standard lemmatization procedures, and therefore the bag-of-NSWs should be considered for further Croatian texts categorization experiments.

The motivating example discussed in the paper is a recent HackerRank competition problem that tasked competitors with creating a classifier for questions from the popular question and answer platform StackExchange. The paper describes the key components of one solution to this problem, and briefly overviews the naive Bayes classifier that is the basis of the solution. The discussion is focused on feature selection and example representation which were the key challenges to be addressed during the development of this classifier. We also analyze the effect of the number of features on accuracy, training and classification time and the size of the resulting classifier and the representation of the training examples which were all important characteristics for the competition. The described classifier achieved slightly over 89% accuracy on the hidden question set, while the winning submission achieved around 92%.

Bearing this in mind, it can be assumed that simple properties of a movie poster should play a significant role in automated detection of movie genres. Therefore, low-level features based on colors and edges are extracted from poster images and used for poster classification into genres. In this paper, poster classification is modeled as a multi-label classification task, where a single movie may belong to more than one class (genre). To simplify and solve the multi-label problem, two methods for multi-label data transformation are described and evaluated given the classification results obtained by distance ranking, Naive Bayes and RAKEL. Experiments are conducted on a set of 1500 posters with 6 movie genres. Results provide insights into the properties of the discussed algorithms and features.

Evaluation of importance of the features used in the prediction and their subsequent selection is an immensely important step in the process of classification and data mining. This paper presents a study on the importance of student demographic features in the process of predicting. The study and performed analyses used the demographic data collected from the Information System for Higher Education (ISVU). For determining the importance of demographic features in the study the following methods have been used: Information Gain (IG), Gain Ratio (GR), Sequential Backward Selection (SBS), Sequential Forward Selection (SFS). The results show the features rank, their importance weight in the prediction and comparison of the results and the use of different methods. Two classification algorithms for evaluating the impact of ranking features to the quality of prediction are used: Naive Bayes i Support Vector Machine (SVM). Final results provide guidelines for the development of a new prediction model.

In this paper, we define the prediction problem as a classification task where process characteristics impacting on machining errors are attribute variables and error results are class variables. To deal with non-linearity and invisible correlations among process characteristics, the Bayesian network-based classifier learning from historic information is applied to extract hidden knowledge between process characteristics and resulting machining errors. Given an instance from the set of process characteristics describing, the posterior probability of each machining error result can be calculated using Bayes rules. An experiment for surface roughness (Ra) prediction on Al 7055 high-strength aluminum alloy in high speed cutting was presented, in which three Bayesian network-based classifiers, namely Naive Bayesian Classifier, Tree-Augmented Network Classifier and General Bayesian Network Classifier, learnt from the experimental dataset simultaneity. Up to 84.6 % accuracy was achieved by GBNC which was selected as the surface roughness prediction model. Therefore, the Bayesian network-based classifier is a valid method for machining error prediction.

The fusion strategy is a combination of feature-level fusion and naive-Bayes decision-level fusion. Optimal feature subsets were derived by using a consistency-based feature evaluation index and sequential forward floating selection technique.

Most previous work has solved the problem either by using discretization, normal method or kernel method. This study proposes the usage of different continuous probability distribution techniques for Naive Bayes classification. It explores various probability density functions of distributions. The experimental results show that the proposed probability distributions also classify continuous data with potentially high accuracy. In addition, this paper introduces a novel method, named NBC4D, which offers a new approach for classification by applying different distribution types on different attributes. The results (obtained classification accuracy rates) show that our proposed method (the usage of more than one distribution types) has success on real-world datasets when compared with the usage of only one well known distribution type.

In the case of teaching, knowledge about students sentiments can be used to address problems like confusion and boredom which affect students engagement. For this purpose, we looked at several methods that could be used for learning sentiment from students feedback. Thus, Naive Bayes, Complement Naive Bayes (CNB), Maximum Entropy and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were trained using real students' feedback. Two classifiers stand out as better at learning sentiment, with SVM resulting in the highest accuracy at 94%, followed by CNB at 84%. We also experimented with the use of the neutral class and the results indicated that, generally, classifiers perform better when the neutral class is excluded.

Our process is decomposed in three steps: (i) we transform original data into several simple representations; (ii) on each representation, we apply a coclustering method; (iii) we use coclustering results to build new features for time series. It results in a new transactional (i.e. object-attribute oriented) data set, made of time series identifiers described by features related to the various generated representations. We show that a Selective Naive Bayes classifier on this new data set is highly competitive when compared with state-of-the-art times series classification methods while highlighting interpretable and class relevant patterns.

Considering the volume of user documents, efficient methods for grouping or searching relevant user documents are required. In the case of Twitter, self-defined metadata called hashtags are attached to tweets for that purpose. However, due to the wide scope of hashtags, users are having difficulty in finding out appropriate hashtags for their tweets. In this paper, we propose a new hashtag recommendation scheme for user tweets based on user tweet analysis and hashtag classification. More specifically, we extract keywords from user tweets using TF-IDF and classify their hashtags into pre-defined classes using Naive Bayes classifier. Next, we select a user interest class based on keywords of user tweets to reflect user interest. To recommend appropriate hashtags to users, we calculate the ranks of candidate hashtags by considering similar tweets, user interest and popularity of hashtags. To show the performance of our scheme, we developed an Android application named "TWITH" and evaluate its recommendation accuracy. Through various experiments, we show that our scheme is quite effective in the hashtag recommendation.

The accurate annotation of the unknown protein using the classification of the protein sequence into an existing superfamily is considered a critical and challenging task in bioinformatics and computational biology. This classification would be helpful in the analysis and modeling of unknown protein to determine their structure and function. In this paper, a frequency-based feature encoding technique has been used in the proposed framework to represent amino acids of a protein's primary sequence. The technique has considered the occurrence frequency of each amino acid in a sequence. Popular classification algorithms such as decision tree, naive Bayes, neural network, random forest and support vector machine have been employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the encoding method utilized in the proposed framework. Results have indicated that the decision tree classifier significantly shows better results in terms of classification accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, F-measure, etc. The classification accuracy of 88.7% was achieved over the Yeast protein sequence data taken from the well-known UniProtKB database.

The proposed system consists of three major steps: feature extraction, classification into normal and abnormal pattern and segmentation of abnormal pattern. Computed features based on Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM) are used to evaluate the effectiveness of textural information possessed by mass regions. A total of 20 GLCM features are extracted from thermograms. The ability of feature set in differentiating abnormal from normal tissue is investigated using a Support Vector Machine classifier, Naive Bayes classifier and K-Nearest Neighbor classifier. To evaluate the classification performance, five-fold cross validation method and Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed. The verification results show that the proposed algorithm gives the best classification results using K-Nearest Neighbor classifier and a accuracy of 92.5 %. Image segmentation techniques can play an important role to segment and extract suspected hot regions of interests in the breast infrared images. Three image segmentation techniques: minimum variance quantization, dilation of image and erosion of image are discussed. The hottest regions of thermal breast images are extracted and compared to the original images. According to the results, the proposed method has potential to extract almost exact shape of tumors.

Object Recognition with Naive Bayes-NN via Prototype Generation	PATTERN RECOGNITION, MCPR 2014	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	6th Mexican Conference on Pattern Recognition (MCPR)	JUN 25-28, 2014	Cancun, MEXICO	Natl Inst Astrophys, Opt & Elect Mexico, Comp Sci Dept, Autonomous Univ Puebla, Mexican Assoc Comp Vis, Neurocomputing & Robot, Int Assoc Pattern Recognit, Natl Council Sci & Technol Mexico, Secretariat Publ Educ Mexico		NBNN; Prototype generation; KNN; Object recognition	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR CLASSIFICATION; PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; LOCAL FEATURES; REDUCTION; DESIGN; ALGORITHM	Naive Bayes nearest neighbors (NBNN) is a variant of the classic KNN classifier that has proved to be very effective for object recognition and image classification tasks. Under NBNN an unseen image is classified by looking at the distance between the sets of visual descriptors of test and training images. Although NBNN is a very competitive pattern classification approach, it presents a major drawback: it requires of large storage and computational resources. NBNN's requirements are even larger than those of the standard KNN because sets of raw descriptors must be stored and compared, therefore, efficiency improvements for NBNN are necessary. Prototype generation (PG) methods have proved to be helpful for reducing the storage and computational requirements of standard KNN. PG methods learn a reduced subset of prototypical instances to be used by KNN for classification. In this contribution we study the suitability of PG methods for enhancing the capabilities of NBNN. Throughout an extensive comparative study we show that PG methods can reduce dramatically the number of descriptors required by NBNN without significantly affecting its discriminative performance. In fact, we show that PG methods can improve the classification performance of NBNN by using much less visual descriptors. We compare the performance of NBNN to other state-of-the-art object recognition approaches and show the combination of PG and NBNN outperforms alternative techniques.

In this paper we propose a dynamic approach to on-line discovery of rule application areas. Our approach incorporates tracking transformation progress in the input model using temperature-based coloring of model elements. The resulting heat map is used to discover possible rule application scopes ahead of rule execution. Further refinement of scopes is achieved by applying a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier to predict a set of possible match candidates. NB is well suited for the computationally intensive environment of model transformations due to its incremental training phase and low classification overhead. Our design is intended to take a runtime, black-box approach to observing and learning from the transformations as they are executed. Finally, we demonstrate a prototype evaluation of the approach in our transformation tool AToMPM [24] and address the benefits, limitations as well as future applications.

The solution to this problem is obtained through algorithms (classifiers) that look for patterns of relationships between classes in known cases, using these relationships to classify unknown cases. The performance of the classifiers depends substantially of the data types. In order to give proper treatment to nominal data, this paper shows that the application of previous transformations can substantially improve the performance of classifiers, bringing significant benefits to the result of the whole process of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). This paper uses three different data sets with nominal data and two well-known classifiers: the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and the Naive-Bayes (NB). For data transformation, the paper applies an approach called Geometric Data Analysis (GDA). The GDA techniques compared in this paper are the traditional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the underexplored Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA). The results confirm the capability of the GDA transformation to improve the classification accuracy and attest the superiority of the MCA in comparison with its precursor, the PCA, when applied to nominal data.

Multiattribute Based Machine Learning Models for Severity Prediction in Cross Project Context	COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS - ICCSA 2014, PT V	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA)	JUN 30-JUL 03, 2014	Guimaraes, PORTUGAL	Univ Minho, Univ Perugia, Univ Basilicata, Monash Univ, Kyushu Sangyo Univ, Assoc Portuguesa Investigacao Operac				The severity level of a reported bug is an important attribute. It describes the impact of a bug on functionality of the software. In the available literature, machine learning techniques based prediction models have been proposed to assess the severity level of a bug. These prediction models have been developed by using summary of a reported bug i.e. the description of a bug reported by a user. This work has been also extended in cross project context to help the projects whose historical data is not available. Till now, the literature reveals that bug triager assess the severity level based on only the summary report of a bug but we feel that the severity level of a bug may change its value during the course of fixing and moreover, the severity level is not only characterized by the summary of bug report but also by other attributes namely priority, number of comments, number of dependents, number of duplicates, complexity, summary weight and cc list. In this paper, we have developed prediction models for determining the severity level of a reported bug based on these attributes in cross project context.

The collected public opinion documents are stored locally according to the HDFS architecture, and whose character words are extracted paralleled in Mapreduce process. Thus the naive Bayesian classification algorithm is parallel encapsulated on cloud computing platform. The MapReduce packaged Naive Bayesian classification algorithm performance is verified and the results show that the algorithm execution speed are significantly improved compared to a single server. Its public opinion classification accuracy rate is more than 85%, which can effectively improve the classification performance of network public opinion and classification efficiency.

Especially in outdoor scenes where usually only few hot spots appear in thermal infrared imagery, humans can be detected more reliably due to their prominent infrared signature. We propose a two-stage person recognition approach for LWIR images: (1) the application of Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) to detect hot spots instead of background subtraction or sliding window and (2) the verification of the detected hot spots using a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) based descriptor and a modified Random Naive Bayes (RNB) classifier. The main contributions are the novel modified RNB classifier and the generality of our method. We achieve high detection rates for several different LWIR datasets with low resolution videos in real-time. While many papers in this topic are dealing with strong constraints such as considering only one dataset, assuming a stationary camera, or detecting only moving persons, we aim at avoiding such constraints to make our approach applicable with moving platforms such as Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV).

Human knowledge of functioning of the brain is still insufficient to understand the neurophysiology of suddenly occurring epileptic seizures. But the detection of the disorder and recognition of the affected brain area is essential for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of epileptic patients. Epilepsy is not only a disorder, but rather acts as a syndrome with divergent symptoms involving episodic abnormal electrical activities in the brain. EEG is the most economical and effective tool with high temporal resolution for understanding the complex dynamical behavior and studying physiological states of the brain. The research presented in this paper, aims to develop a computer aided diagnostic system utilizing EEG data to diagnose whether the person is epileptic or not. We present here various methodologies that could be implemented in hardware for monitoring an epileptic patient. Statistical features depicting morphology of EEG signals are extracted, selected and utilized to classify the signals by Artificial Neural Network, Radial Basis Function, Naive Bayes Classifier, K means classifier, Support vector machine. Efficacy of technique is evaluated on the basis of performance measures, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. It has been observed that artificial neural network and support vector machine with radial basis function kernel are more successful as compared to other soft computing paradigms.

Three phase currents of both circuits and zero sequence current are given as input to the NB network for classification of fault. Inputs are preprocessed using approximate coefficient of DWT. NB classifier uses Gaussian distribution function for classification. Seven classifiers are designed for fault classification for each phase AI, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2 and ground G. Advantage of using Naive Bayes classifier is that it take few seconds for training no matter how big the data is. Different cases of fault are studied like phase faults, phase to ground faults, inter-circuit faults, cross country faults, fault near boundaries, different fault location, different inception angle and different fault resistance with high fault resistance. Accuracy of the proposed method is 99% and reach setting is also 99% of line length.

In a group DSS (GDSS) a number of managers need to be involved in the decision process. Roadway lane management can be implemented by different strategies whichever is appropriate for particular situation, based on the environment and individuals' behavior. Solving lane management problem requires setting weights for different management strategies by some experts based on standards on physical characteristics of the road and some other experts based on the individual's behavior. Finally, the planner(s) will choose the most appropriate strategy based on the current characteristics of the roadway and its users and also based on previous experience on that country. This article makes an environment which exerts experts' consult and for each roadway/society situation estimates fuzzy results based on this consult and previous implementation experience from knowledge base. A Naive Bayes classifier is the core of the proposed GDSS which handles the irrelevant attributes, and can get a good estimate of the probability and do not require a very large training set.

In this paper we proposed an automated weed control system which can differentiate the weeds and crops from the digital image. The images were segmented to separate plant from soil. This paper demonstrates the classification of weeds and crops according to twelve extracted features. Four hundreds sample images over five species were taken where each and every species contains 80 images. Minimizing the computation cost and achieving high accuracy rate, Naive Bayes classification algorithm has been proposed as it gains 98.9% accuracy over 400 sample image.

Such realtime application calls for fast processing and accurate classification of brain signals. In this paper, we address the twolevel classification of motor imagery signals, where the user differentiates between clockwise/counter-clockwise movement of wrist and the opening/closing of the fingers. For this purpose, parameters of adaptive autoregressive (AAR) models and Extreme Energy Ratio criterion (EER) are employed as features, which are fed to standard classifiers for comparison. It concludes the features extracted based on EER, selected by sequential forward search and classified using radial basis function kernelized support vector machine, provides optimum performance of the classification process for implementation in real-time scenario, with an average accuracy 90.24% and a time complexity of 8.2449 seconds.

A number of existing models includes Weight of Evidence, Knowledge-driven Fuzzy, Data-driven Fuzzy, Neural-Network, Bayesian Classifier and Geostatistical Kriging. We offer classification models developed in our laboratory, where point pattern analysis was used to identify presence or absence of a known secondary alluvial (cassiterite) deposits in the Nigerian Younger Granite Region (NYGR) and the model performance assessed. We focused on the training and testing data split using longitudinal spatial data splitting (strips and halves) to ensure predictive attribute's independence. The spatial data split runs counter to the traditional random sample data selection as a procedure for checking overfitting of models mainly due to spatial data autocorrelation. Specifically, we used classification algorithms such as; Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree Bagging and Discriminant Analysis algorithms for training and testing. We analysed the model's performance results using model predictive accuracy and ROC curve values in two different approaches that improve spatial data independence among predictive attributes to give a meaningful model performance.

In real life many classification problem requires decisions among a set of contending classes. Multiclass classification and prediction is suitable for hand written digit recognition, hand written character recognition, speech recognition and body parts recognition etc. This paper compares five classification algorithms namely Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Naive Bayes Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor and Bayesian Network algorithms for predicting students' grade particularly for engineering students. This is a four class prediction problem. Student's marks are classified into four classes A, B, C and F respectively. Initially complete data set is used to build the classifiers then Bootstrap method is used to improve the accuracy of the each classifier. Bootstrap method is a resample function available in WEKA tool kit. The excellent results of this function can be seen through IBK, Decision Tree and Bayes Net algorithm. However the overall results of all four algorithms are good but the results of individual classes for Naive Bayes and NB Tree is not sufficient enough for the individual class prediction particularly for this study. This paper also presents a comparative study of the previous work related to student's performance predictions.

The data was download and extracted using RapidMiner and Xpath queries. A Naive Bayes and SVM binary classification model was created. Pre-processing techniques of tokenisation, n-gram creation, stop-word removal, stemming as well as feature selection by weights were applied to the data, resulting in a 15 point improvement in the model. In addition we are reporting on a comprehensive cluster analysis. Frequent terms and differences between clusters were visualised using word clouds. Clusters were compared with values contained in nominal fields. Model results and interpretation are provided at various preprocessing stages.

Goal of this work is to compare the common feature extraction modules. Proposed two stage feature extraction technique is exceedingly discriminative, precised and computation efficient. We have used, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decorrelate spectral information and extract only the salient visual speech information from lip portion. In the second stage the Locality Sensitive Discriminant Analysis (LSDA) is used to further trim down the feature dimension while preserving the required identifiable ability. A competent feature extraction module result a novel automatic lip reading system. We have compared performance of classical Naive Bayes with the popular SVM classifier. The CUAVE database is used for experimentation and performance comparison. Experimental results show that DWT+LSDA feature mining is better than DWT with PCA or LDA. The performance of Naive Bayes classifier is exceedingly augmented with DWT+LSDA.

However, in case of fMRI data analysis the large number of attributes may leads to a serious problem of classifying cognitive states. It significantly increases the computational cost and memory usage of a classifier. Hence to address this problem, we use GAs for selecting optimal set of attributes and then GNB classifier in a pipeline to classify different cognitive states. The experimental outcomes prove its worthiness in successfully classifying different cognitive states. The detailed comparison study with popular machine learning classifiers illustrates the importance of such GA-Bayesian approach applied in pipeline for fMRI data analysis.

Automated Identification of Business Rules in Requirements Documents	SOUVENIR OF THE 2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL ADVANCE COMPUTING CONFERENCE (IACC)	IEEE International Advance Computing Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	4th IEEE International Advance Computing Conference (IACC)	FEB 21-22, 2014	Gurgaon, INDIA	IEEE, ITM Univ, Dept Comp Sci Engn & Informat Technol, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Student Branch	ITM Univ	Business Rules; Requirements; Machine Learning		Business Rule identification is an important task of Requirements Engineering process. However, the task is challenging as business rules are often not explicitly stated in the requirements documents. In case business rules are explicit, they may not be atomic in nature or, may be vague. In this paper, we present an approach for identifying business rules in the available requirements documentation. We first identify various business rules categories and, then examine requirements documentation (including requirements specifications, domain knowledge documents, change request, request for proposal) for the presence of these rules. Our study aims at finding how effectively business rules can be identified and classified into one of the categories of business rules using machine learning algorithms. We report on the results of the experiments performed. Our observations indicate that in terms of overall result, support vector machine algorithm performed better than other classifiers.

Frequently, these dichotomous objectives make for a trade space which is difficult to resolve. Fortunately, the use of unresolved multispectral and hyperspectral imagery fused with other Measurement And Signature Intelligence (MASINT) such as target kinematic features presents an opportunity to extend a sensor's useful classification /discrimination range without requiring additional hardware innovation. In this paper, we will provide an overview of multispectral, hyperspectral and kinematic based MASINT phenomenologies which are available for extraction and exploitation. Additionally, we will review feature and information fusion from the perspective of Maximum Likelihood, Naive Bayes and Bayesian Belief Networks in the context of MASINT Information Fusion.

Bio-signals reflect sequences of neural activity, which result in changes in autonomic and neuroendocrine systems induced by emotional events. Therefore in human-computer interaction researches, one of the most current interesting topics in emotion recognition is to recognize human's feeling using bio-signals. The aim of this study is to classify emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and neutral) that human have often experienced in real life from multichannel bio-signals using machine learning algorithms. We have measured physiological responses of three-hundred participants for acquisition of bio-signals such as electrodermal activity, electrocardiograph, skin temperature, and photoplethysmograph during six emotions induction. Also, for emotion classification, we have extracted eighteen features from the signals and performed emotion classification using four algorithms, linear discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes, classification and regression tree and support vector machine. The used algorithms were evaluated by only training, 10-fold cross-validation and repeated random sub-sampling validation. We have obtained recognition accuracy from 56.4 to 100% for only training and 39.2 to 53.9% for testing. Also, the result for testing showed that an accuracy of emotion recognition by Naive Bayes was highest (53.9%) and lowest by support vector machine (39.2%). This means that Naive Bayes is the best emotion recognition algorithm for basic emotions. This result can be helpful to provide the basis for the emotion recognition technique in human-computer interaction.

The aim of proposed solution is to improve the interaction among humans and computers. The emotion recognition system must be capable of recognizing at least six basic emotions (happiness, anger, surprise, disgust, fear, sadness) and the neutral circumstances. The proposed system has two subsystems Gender Recognition (GR) and Emotion Recognition (ER) and also distinguishes a single emotion versus all the others. An appropriate emotion recognition method is applied after extracting features like pitch, energy and MFCC having emotional information. The performance in terms of accuracy is shown in results. The highlight of result is that a prior knowledge about the gender of speaker increases the performance of proposed system. Proposed approach has been implemented by using Naive Bayes method. This is a simple and efficient classification approach. It has easy learning on large speech databases and its accuracy as compared to other approaches is reasonably good. In future this system can be implemented over mobile devices such as smart phones.

As a motion feature learning method, we developed a complexity-based subsequence of time series clustering (C-STSC) method to learn time series codewords from a human motion trajectory. The key to the C-STSC method is to measure the importance of each subsequence in time series data through to use of a complexity measure. Next, time series codewords are learned on the basis of the important subsequences by using a clustering algorithm. Moreover, we also propose a hierarchical spatio-temporal naive Bayes classifier (HST-NBC) to classify the C-STSC features, where both the codeword-type and its spatio-temporal information is explicitly represented as a composite node in a Bayesian network framework. To validate the proposed method, we present experimental results of the proposed approach with respect to several open datasets.

However, their analysis is uneasy because the number of genes is extremely large with respect to the number of experiments. The problem is that all genes are not essential in gene expression data. Some of the genes may be redundant, and others may be irrelevant and noisy. This research paper studies the gene expression data using rough set theory; it is an intelligent computing method. In this paper, we studied and implemented following discretization methods such as rough discretization (RD), naive Bayes, max-min, equal width intervals, K-means-based discretization, and entropy-based discretization (EBD) for gene selection using rough set quick reduct (QR) for breast cancer gene expression data. Further, the performance of the above algorithms has been evaluated using classification tools available in Weka software and BPN classifier.	[Sathishkumar, E.

Most recent extension of rough set is soft rough set, where parameterized subsets of a universal set are basic building blocks for lower and upper approximations of a subset. In this paper, a new model of soft rough set, which is called modified soft rough set (MSR) where information granules are finer than soft rough sets, is applied for classification of medical data. In this paper, rough-set-based quick reduct approach is applied for selecting relevant features and MSR is applied for multiclass classification problem and the proposed work is compared with bijective soft set (BSS)-based classification, naive Bayes, and decision table classifier algorithms based on evaluation metrics.

Among popular social networking portals, Twitter has been the point of attraction to several researchers in important areas like prediction of democratic electoral events, consumer brands, movie box office, stock market, popularity of celebrities etc. Sentiment analysis over Twitter offers a fast and efficient way of monitoring the public sentiment. In this paper, we introduce the novel approach of exploiting the user influence factor in order to predict the outcome of an election result. We also propose a hybrid approach of extracting opinion using direct and indirect features of Twitter data based on Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy and Artificial Neural Networks based supervised classifiers. We combined Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with SVM in an attempt to perform dimensionality reduction. This paper shows two different case studies of entirely different social scenarios, US Presidential Elections 2012 and Karnataka Assembly Elections 2013. We conclude the conditions under which Twitter may fail or succeed in predicting the outcome of elections. Experimental results demonstrate that Support Vector Machines outperform all other classifiers with maximum successful prediction accuracy of 88% in case of US Presidential Elections held in November 2012 and maximum prediction accuracy of 58% in case of Karnataka State Assembly Elections held in May 2013.

It is highly requested to retrieve useful information from lifelogs because these raw data are hard to handle. Extracting human activities from these logs is promising to enrich our life. Context-awareness services can be provided depending on user activities extracted from these logs. Recently, a lot of people post a message called tweet within Twitter to show what they are doing, thinking, feeling, and so on. Tweets have potential to record human activities, because many people post tweets so frequently every day. This paper focused on the tweets to retrieve human behavior from them. The length of tweets are limited within short sentence, so this causes some difficulties. The users will use domain-specific terms and will post grammatically incorrect sentences to fit with the constraints. These make us hard to analyze tweets with grammatical manner or with dictionaries. To tackle them, we are applying character n-gram tokenization and naive Bayes classifier to extract appropriate behavioral information from tweets. Using n-gram tokenizer, domain-specific words can be identified and incorrect grammar can be handled. Our approach is examined using real tweets in Japanese. The index of precision, recall and F-measure shows the promising results. Some experiments have been carried out to show the feasibility of our approach. At this point, our system applied to Japanese tweets but it is applicable to any other languages.

The model classifies scientific documents according to their content using information retrieval techniques and Hidden Markov Models. To demonstrate the efficiency of the model, we present a set of experiments which have been performed on OHSUMED biomedical corpus, a subset of the MEDLINE database, and the Allele and GO TREC corpora. Our classifier is also compared with Naive Bayes, k-NN and SVM techniques. Experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results show that the model is comparable to the SVM technique in the classification of biomedical texts.	[Seara Vieira, A.; Iglesias, E.

The appearance based people identification in a domestic environment has many similarities with the problem of re-identification in public surveillance systems, but there are also some additional beneficial and constraining factors (e.g., less people, non-pedestrian behaviour, unusual camera viewpoints). In this paper, we are considering the problem of people identification in a small home RGB-D camera network, for which we have developed a method based on appearance learning and classification using a combination of SVM and the Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the prototype of a real-time multiple camera system on a 16 people dataset.

Power Index of the Inspiratory Flow Signal as a Predictor of Weaning in Intensive Care Units	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc			MECHANICAL VENTILATION	Disconnection from mechanical ventilation, called the weaning process, is an additional difficulty in the management of patients in intensive care units (ICU). Unnecessary delays in the discontinuation process and a weaning trial that is undertaken too early are undesirable. In this study, we propose an extubation index based on the power of the respiratory flow signal (P-i). A total of 132 patients on weaning trials were studied: 94 patients with successful trials (group S) and 38 patients who failed to maintain spontaneous breathing and were reconnected (group F). The respiratory flow signals were processed considering the following three stages: a) zero crossing detection of the inspiratory phase, b) inflection point detection of the flow curve during the inspiratory phase, and c) calculation of the signal power on the time instant indicated by the inflection point. The zero crossing detection was performed using an algorithm based on thresholds. The inflection points were marked considering the zero crossing of the second derivative. Finally, the inspiratory power was calculated from the energy contained over the finite time interval (between the instant of zero crossing and the inflection point). The performance of this parameter was evaluated using the following classifiers: logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, the classification and regression tree, Naive Bayes, and the support vector machine. The best results were obtained using the Bayesian classifier, which had an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 87%, 90% and 81% respectively.

Neck-worn systems provide access to a unique set of health-related data that other wearable devices simply cannot obtain. Activities including breathing, chewing, clearing the throat, coughing, swallowing, speech and even heartbeat can be recorded from around the neck. In this paper, we explore tracheal activity recognition using a combination of promising acoustic features from related work and apply simplistic classifiers including K-NN and Naive Bayes. For wearable systems in which low power consumption is of primary concern, we show that with a sub-optimal sampling rate of 16 kHz, we have achieved average classification results in the range of 86.6% to 87.4% using 1-NN, 3-NN, 5-NN and Naive Bayes. All classifiers obtained the highest recognition rate in the range of 97.2% to 99.4% for speech classification. This is promising to mitigate privacy concerns associated with wearable systems interfering with the user's conversations.

A feasibility study is undertaken with N = 5 participants to identify nine key locations, including in the hand, thigh and backpack, using a multitude of commonly available smartphone sensors. Sensors examined include the accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope, pressure and light sensors. Each sensor is examined independently, to identify the potential contributions it can offer, before a fused approach, using all sensors is adopted. A total of 139 features are generated from these sensors, and used to train five machine learning algorithms, i.e. C4.5, CART, Naive Bayes, Multilayer Perceptrons, and Support Vector Machines. Ten-fold cross validation is used to validate these models, achieving classification results as high as 99%.

Physical Activity Recognition based on Rotated Acceleration Data using Quaternion in Sedentary Behavior : A Preliminary study	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc				This paper suggests a physical activity assessment method based on quaternion. To reduce user inconvenience, we measured the activity using a mobile device which is not put on fixed position. Recognized results were verified with various machine learning algorithms, such as neural network (multilayer perceptron), decision tree (J48), SVM (support vector machine) and naive bayes classifier. All algorithms have shown over 97% accuracy including decision tree (J48), which recognized the activity with 98.35% accuracy. As a result, physical activity assessment method based on rotated acceleration using quaternion can classify sedentary behavior with more accuracy without considering devices' position and orientation.

Many attempts have been made to automate the process by training computer algorithms such as support vector machines and hidden Markov models (HMMs) to replicate human scoring. Such supervised classifiers are typically trained on scored data and then validated on scored out-of-sample data. Here we describe a methodology based on HMMs for scoring an overnight sleep recording without the benefit of a trained initial model. The number of states in the data is not known a priori and is optimized using a Bayes information criterion. When tested on a 22-subject database, this unsupervised classifier agreed well with human scores (mean of Cohen's kappa > 0.7). The HMM also outperformed other unsupervised classifiers (Gaussian mixture models, k-means, and linkage trees), that are capable of naive classification but do not model dynamics, by a significant margin (p < 0.05).

Realization of an efficient mobile device for semi-automatic diagnosis of melanoma would greatly enhance the applicability of medical image classification scheme and make it useful in clinical contexts. In this paper, interactive object recognition methodology is adopted for border segmentation of clinical skin lesion images. In addition, performance of five classifiers, KNN, Naive Bayes, multi-layer perceptron, random forest and SVM are compared based on color and texture features for discriminating melanoma from benign nevus. The results show that a sensitivity of 82.6% and specificity of 83% can be achieved using a single SVM classifier. However, a better classification performance was achieved using a proposed cascade classifier with the sensitivity of 83.06% and specificity of 90.05% when performing ten-fold cross validation.

It was proposed a new strategy to guide focused crawlers to fetch specific documents by identifying topic boundary around the unvisited link and combining with Naive Bayes text classifier. Experimental results show that the new strategy is more efficient in improving crawling process.

The objective of this paper is to find out the best description of the learning curves produced by a Naive Bayes classification. The performance of Naive Bayes was measured on 121 datasets using k-fold cross-validation. Power, linear, logarithmic and exponential functions were fit to the data. The exponential function was a better descriptor of the error rate in 44 of 60 useful cases. Average mean squared error is significantly different at P=0,000 from power and linear and at P=0,001 from logarithmic function. The exponential function's rank is significantly different from the ranks of other models (P=0,000). The results can be used to forecast the future performance of the learner, or to check where on the learning curve the current measurement lies.

Supervised feature selection aims to overcome this problem by selecting features that are highly related to the class labels, yet unrelated to each other. One proposed technique to select good features with few inter-dependencies is minimal Redundancy Maximal Relevance (mRMR) [12], but this can be impractical with large feature sets. In many situations, features are extracted from signal data such as vehicle telemetry, medical sensors, or financial time-series, and it is possible for feature redundancies to exist both between features extracted from the same signal (intra-signal), and between features extracted from different signals (inter-signal). We propose a two stage selection process to take advantage of these different types of redundancy, considering intra-signal and inter-signal redundancies separately. We illustrate the process on vehicle telemetry signal data collected in a driver distraction monitoring project. We evaluate it using several machine learning algorithms: Random Forest; Naive Bayes; and C4.5 Decision Tree. Our results show that this two stage process significantly reduces the computation required because of inter-dependency calculations, while having minimal detrimental effect on the performance of the feature sets produced.

Cellular Floating Vehicle Data (CFVD) which is one of these techniques analyzes the cellular network data to estimate real-time traffic information with the higher coverage and the lower cost. Therefore, this study proposes an urban road segment determination method based on CFVD for tracking Mobile Stations (MSs). First, the cell ID and timestamp of cellular network signals (e. g., handovers) which are generated by MS are recorded. Data mining technique is used to analyze the data for determining the road segment which is driven by MS user. The experiment results show the average accuracy of proposed method which is 93% is better than naive Bayes classification, decision tree, support vector machine, and backpropagation neural network. Therefore, the proposed road segment determination method based on CFVD can be used to track MSs and estimate traffic information for ITS.

A Novel Technique for Fingerprint Classification based on Fuzzy C-Means and Naive Bayes Classifier	2014 EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPLEX, INTELLIGENT AND SOFTWARE INTENSIVE SYSTEMS (CISIS),			English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems (CISIS)	JUL 02-04, 2014	Birmingham, UNITED KINGDOM		Birmingham City Univ	Fingerprint Classification; Directional Images; Fuzzy C-Means; Naive Bayes Classifier		Fingerprint classification is a key issue in automatic fingerprint identification systems. One of the main goals is to reduce the item search time within the fingerprint database without affecting the accuracy rate. In this paper, a novel technique, based on topological information, for efficient fingerprint classification is described. The proposed system is composed of two independent modules: the former module, based on Fuzzy C-Means, extracts the best set of training images; the latter module, based on Fuzzy C-Means and Naive Bayes classifier, assigns a class to each processed fingerprint using only directional image information. The proposed approach does not require any image enhancement phase. Experimental trials, conducted on a subset of the free downloadable PolyU database, show a classification rate of 91% over a 100 images test database using only 12 training examples.

For this purpose, LC waveforms acquisition is firstly carried out on a plane insulator model under various saline pollution conductivities. Then, LC is investigated and decomposed in five levels using the Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT). Two, four, eight, sixteen and thirty-two coefficients are obtained from the first level to the fifth one respectively. Next, Standard Deviation-Multi Resolution Analysis (STD-MRA) is used to extract features from WPT coefficients. It is noted that the higher the pollution severity, the higher the STD value. Finally, STD values are used as inputs to three well known classification methods (K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines), while the sole output is the pollution conductivity value. Results announce that the higher the decomposition level, the better the classification performance. WPT methodology is presented as a highly efficient technique for LC investigation and classification.	[Chaou, A.

Adaptive auto-regressive coefficients and Hjorth parameters are used as features which are classified using linear Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbor and tree classifiers. Following this, the space complexity to store the high-dimensional tactile features is identified. ReliefF algorithm is used as a dimension reduction technique. A polynomial of order 6 is used to fit an EEG feature to a corresponding tactile feature. These pre-fitted polynomials are used to predict the EEG features in situation where EEG measuring device is not present. Finally we note that using these predicted features along with the tactile features yields enhanced classification accuracies.

The proposed methodology corrects the error by taking into account morphosyntactic information regarding the context of the orthographically ambiguous word. Our methodology is knowledge-poor because the information used is only the endings of the words in the context of the ambiguous word; as such it can be adapted even by simple editors for real-time spelling correction. We tested our method using Id3, C4.5, Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes and Random Forest as machine learning algorithms for correct spelling prediction. Experimental results show that the success rate of the above method is usually between 90% and 95% and sometimes approaching 97%. Synthetic Minority Oversampling was used to cope with the problem of class imbalance in our datasets.

Bayesian Model Averaging of Bayesian Network Classifiers for Intrusion Detection	2014 38TH ANNUAL IEEE INTERNATIONAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS CONFERENCE WORKSHOPS (COMPSACW 2014)			English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual IEEE International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)	JUL 21-25, 2014	Vasteras, SWEDEN	IEEE, IEEE Cloud Comp, Korean Inst Informat Scientists & Engineers, Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, IEEE Comp Soc, IPS, CCF, Malardalen Univ Sweden, ABB, Missouri S & T		Intrusion detection system; Bayesian network; Bayesian Model Averaging; detection accuracy	DETECTION SYSTEM	Bayesian network (BN) classifiers with powerful reasoning capabilities have been increasingly utilized to detect intrusion with reasonable accuracy and efficiency. However, existing BN classifiers for intrusion detection suffer two problems. First, such BN classifiers are often trained from data using heuristic methods that usually select suboptimal models. Second, the classifiers are trained using very large datasets which may be time consuming to obtain in practice. When the size of training dataset is small, the performance of a single BN classifier is significantly reduced due to its inability to represent the whole probability distribution. To alleviate these problems, we build a Bayesian classifier by Bayesian Model Averaging(BMA) over the k-best BN classifiers, called Bayesian Network Model Averaging (BNMA) classifier. We train and evaluate BNMA classifier on the NSL-KDD dataset, which is less redundant, thus more judicial than the commonly used KDD Cup 99 dataset. We show that the BNMA classifier performs significantly better in terms of detection accuracy than the Naive Bayes classifier and the BN classifier built with heuristic method. We also show that the BNMA classifier trained using a smaller dataset outperforms two other classifiers trained using a larger dataset. This also implies that the BNMA is beneficial in accelerating the detection process due to its less dependance on the potentially prolonged process of collecting large training datasets.

User generated content from social media platforms can provide early clues about product allergies, adverse events and product counterfeiting. This paper reports a work in progress with contributions including: the development of a framework for gathering and analyzing the views and experiences of users of drug and cosmetic products using machine learning, text mining and sentiment analysis; the application of the proposed framework on Facebook comments and data from Twitter for brand analysis, and the description of how to develop a product safety lexicon and training data for modeling a machine learning classifier for drug and cosmetic product sentiment prediction. The initial brand and product comparison results signify the usefulness of text mining and sentiment analysis on social media data while the use of machine learning classifier for predicting the sentiment orientation provides a useful tool for users, product manufacturers, regulatory and enforcement agencies to monitor brand or product sentiment trends in order to act in the event of sudden or significant rise in negative sentiment.

Previous studies show that a configuration bug could cause huge financial losses in a software system. The importance of configuration bugs has attracted various research studies, e.g., to detect, diagnose, and fix configuration bugs. Given a bug report, an approach that can identify whether the bug is a configuration bug could help developers reduce debugging effort. We refer to this problem as configuration bug reports prediction. To address this problem, we develop a new automated framework that applies text mining technologies on the naturallanguage description of bug reports to train a statistical model on historical bug reports with known labels (i.e., configuration or non-configuration), and the statistical model is then used to predict a label for a new bug report. Developers could apply our model to automatically predict labels of bug reports to improve their productivity. Our tool first applies feature selection techniques (e.g., information gain and Chi-square) to preprocess the textual information in bug reports, and then applies various text mining techniques (e.g., naive Bayes, SVM, naive Bayes multinomial) to build statistical models. We evaluate our solution on 5 bug report datasets including accumulo, activemq, camel, flume, and wicket. We show that naive Bayes multinomial with information gain achieves the best performance. On average across the 5 projects, its accuracy, configuration F-measure and non-configuration F-measure are 0.811, 0.450, and 0.880, respectively. We also compare our solution with the method proposed by Arshad et al.. The results show that our proposed approach that uses naive Bayes multinomial with information gain on average improves accuracy, configuration F-measure and non-configuration F-measure scores of Arshad et al.'s method by 8.34%, 103.7%, and 4.24%, respectively.

Physicians subjectively classify the erythema parameter into several grades of severity. To support the decision and the evaluation of the psoriasis lesions' evolution in time, this study proposes an approach for the objective assessment of erythema degree. There were processed seventeen images depicting psoriasis lesions from mild to severe and the erythema parameter was classified into three categories using machine learning algorithms. The classification was based on color and texture features extracted from the digital images. Three classifiers were trained and tested with these features: Naive Bayes, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. A comparative analysis on the classification accuracy and computation time was made to the classification algorithms. The best classification accuracy (92%) was obtained when using a two-layer feed-forward Neural Network. The proposed method can be used to objectively assess the psoriasis lesion's erythema.

Since software maintainability is an important attribute of software quality, accurate prediction of it can help to improve overall software quality. This paper utilizes data mining of some new predictor metrics apart from traditionally used software metrics for predicting maintainability of software systems. The prediction models are constructed using static code metric datasets of four different open source software (OSS): Lucene, JHotdraw, JEdit, and JTreeview. Lucene contain 385 classes and is of 135241 lines of code (LOC) OSS, JHotdraw contain 159 classes and is of 21802 LOC OSS, JEdit contain 275 classes and is of 104053 LOC OSS and JTreeview contain 60 classes and is of 11988 LOC OSS. The metrics were collected using two different metrics extraction tools Chidamber and Kemerer Java metric (CKJM) tool and IntelliJ IDEA. Naive Bayes, Bayes Network, Logistic, MultiLayerPerceptron and Random Forest classifiers are used to identify the software modules that are difficult to maintain. Random forest models are found to be most useful in software maintainability prediction by data mining of software code metrics as random forest models have higher recall, precision and Area under curve (AUC) of ROC curve.

There are increasing numbers of articles every day therefore the automatic evaluation method is needed for user. Components of Wikipedia articles such as headers, pictures, references, and links are useful to indicate the quality of articles. However readers need complete content to cover all of concepts in that article. The concept features are investigated in this work. The aim of this research is to classify Thai Wikipedia articles into two classes namely high-quality and low-quality class. Three article domains (Biography, Animal, and Place) are testes with decision tree and Naive Bayes. We found that Naive Bayes gets high TP Rate compared to decision tree in every domain. Moreover, we found that the concept feature plays an important role in quality classification of Thai Wikipedia articles.

The use of Data Mining (DM) can contribute to overcome these limitations in order to identify relevant data on patient's management and providing important information for managers to support their decisions. Throughout this study, were induced DM models capable to make predictions in a real environment using real data. For this, was adopted the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology. Three distinct techniques were considered: Decision Trees (DT), Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform classification tasks. This work explored the possibility to predict the number of patient discharges using only the number of discharges veirifed in the past. The models developed are able to predict the number of patient discharges per week with acuity values ranging from approximate to 82.69% to approximate to 94.23%. The use of these models can improve the efficiency of the administration of hospital beds. An accurate forecasting of discharges allows a better estimate of the beds available for the coming weeks.

Most of these algorithms are based on bag-of-words representations, which generate high dimensional data. However, just a few supervised learning methods, such as SVMs, can efficiently handle high dimensional data. To overcome this limitation we propose the use of prior polarity words (PPW) in order to create a compact and representative feature set for financial news classification. Using this approach it is possible to reduce feature sets from thousands to less than tens of features without compromising the accuracy of the text classifier. We measured accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure and ROC AUC of text classifiers using PPW. Classifier using PPW was able to topping all results when compared with a wide range of feature selection methods. By adopting PPW, Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes performed consistently better than using the full feature set. PPW also turned Naive Bayes comparable to SVMs, as indicated by the improved performance scores in all measures tested.

Successful text classification relies heavily on the vital task of dimensionality reduction, which aims to improve classification accuracy, give greater expression to the classification process, and improve classification computational efficiency. In this paper, two algorithms for feature selection are presented, based on sampling and weighted sampling that build on the C4.5 algorithm. The results demonstrate considerable improvements with regard to classification accuracy - up to 10% - compared to traditional algorithms such as C4.5, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines. The classification process is performed using the Naive Bayes model in the space of reduced dimensionality. Experiments were carried out using data sets based on the Reuters-21578 collection.

However, users may have different usernames in different social networks, making the linkage task difficult. To enable this, we explore a probabilistic approach that uses a domain-specific prior knowledge to address this problem of online social network user profile linkage. At scale, linkage approaches that are based on a naive pairwise comparisons that have quadratic complexity become prohibitively expensive. Our proposed threshold-based canopying framework - named OPL - reduces this pairwise comparisons, and guarantees a upper bound theoretic linear complexity with respect to the dataset size. We evaluate our approaches on real-world, large-scale datasets obtained from Twitter and Linkedin. Our probabilistic classifier integrating prior knowledge into Naive Bayes performs at over 85% F-1-measure for pairwise linkage, comparable to state-of-the-art approaches.

With the increasing volume of crime information available on the web, a means to retrieve and exploit them and provide insight into the criminal behavior and networks must be determined to fight crime more efficiently and effectively. We believe that an electronic system must be designed for crime named entity recognition from the newspaper articles. Thus, this study designs and develops a crime named entity recognition based on machine learning approaches that extract nationalities, weapons, and crime locations in online crime documents. This study also collected a new corpus of crime and manually labeled them. A machine learning classification framework is proposed based on Naive Bayes and SVM model in extracting nationalities, weapons, and crime location from online crime documents. To evaluate our model, a manually annotated data set was used, which was then validated by experiments. The results of the experiments showed that the developed techniques are promising.

Sentiment analysis in the Arabic language is a more challenging task than in other languages due to the morphological complexity of the Arabic and the large variation of its dialects. This paper presents an empirical comparison of seven feature selection methods (Information Gain, Principal Components Analysis, Relief-F, Gini Index, Uncertainty, Chi-squared, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs)), and three machine learning classifiers (SVM, Naive Bayes, and K-nearest neighbor) for Arabic sentiment classification. A wide range of comparative experiments are conducted on an opinion corpus for Arabic (OCA). This paper demonstrates that feature selection does improve the performance of Arabic sentiment-based classification, but the result depends on the method used and the number of features selected. The experimental results demonstrate that feature reduction methods are found to improve the classifier performance. Moreover, the experimental results indicate that SVM-based feature selection yields the best performance for feature selection and that the SVM classifier outperforms the other techniques for Arabic sentiment-based classification. Finally, the experiments indicate that the SVM classifier with the SVM-based feature selection method yields the best classification method, with an accuracy of 92.4%.

In order to divide different research fields, it is very important to correctly classify all the papers in computer science. In this paper, we propose CSAR classification system derived from 2012 ACM Computing Classification System (CCS), and also propose a new weighted naive Bayes classifier to classify the papers in top publications by their research fields. The experiments show that the performance of proposed weighted naive Bayes classifier is better than the unweighted naive Bayes classifier and overwhelms the results of k-NN classifier.

Every consumer has different health topic familiarity. This diversity may cause misunderstanding because the information presented during health information searches may not fit the consumer's understanding. This study aimed to develop health topic familiarity prediction models based on the consumer's searching behavior, how the consumers formulate the query and how they interact with the search results. The experimental results show that Naive Bayes and Sequential Minimal Optimization classifiers achieved high accuracy on the combination of query formulation and search result interaction feature sets in predicting consumer's health topic familiarity. This finding suggests that health topic familiarity identification based on the query formulation and the search result interaction is feasible and effective.

Recently classification from video data obtained by vehicle mounted video in outdoor environments is receiving considerable attention due to the large number of real-world applications. However this is a very challenging task and requires novel research techniques. This paper presents an analysis of hybrid classification approach to distinguish vegetation in particularly the type of roadside grasses from videos recorded by the Queensland transport and main roads. The proposed framework can distinguish dense and non-dense grass regions from roadside video data. While most of the recent works focuses on infrared images, proposed approach uses image texture feature for vegetation region classification. Analysis of hybrid approach using texture feature and multiple classifiers is the main contribution of this research work. The classifiers include: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), AdaBoost and Naive Bayes. The different images were created from video data containing roadside vegetation in various conditions for training and testing purposes. The hybrid classification approach has been analysed on roadside data obtained and results are discussed.

Understanding the types of defects could help developers to adopt measures in current and future software releases. In practice, developers often categorize defects into various types. One common categorization is based on fault triggers of defects. Fault trigger is a set of conditions which activate a defect (i. e., fault) and propagate the defect into a failure. In general, there are two types of defect based fault triggering conditions, Bohrbug and Mandelbug. Bohrbug refers to a bug which can be easily isolated, and its activation and error propagation is simple. Mandelbug refers to a bug whose activation and/or error propagation is complex (e. g., a time lag between the fault activation and the failure occurrence). With these category labels, developers can better perform post-mortem analysis to identify common characteristic of the defects, and design specific fault-tolerance mechanisms. However, in most software systems, these category labels are often unavailable. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a text mining solution which categorize defects into fault trigger categories by analyzing the natural-language description of bug reports. A previous study shows that Mandelbug is more complex and needs more time to be fixed. Thus, to better identify Mandelbugs, we propose a novel fUzzy Set based fEature Selection algorithm named USES, which selects the features (i. e., terms) which have high ability to distinguish Mandelbugs from Bohrbugs. USES first caches a set of terms based on their fuzzy affinity scores to Bohrbug or Mandelbug. Next, it iterates many times, and in each iteration, it selects a subset of terms, and builds a classifier on these terms. USES selects the classifier and the terms which could achieve the best performance on a training data. We evaluate our solution on 4 datasets including Linux, Mysql, Apache HTTPD, and AXIS containing a total of 809 bug reports. We show that USES with naive Bayes multinomial achieves the best performance; it achieves Mandelbug F-measure scores of 0.298 -0.615. We also compare USES with other baseline approaches. The results show that USES on average improves Mandelbug F-measure scores of the best performing baseline by 12.3%.

This paper presents a novel approach for classification of lung tissue patterns affected with Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILDs) in high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans. The proposed scheme makes use of texture features obtained using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and multiple classifiers to obtain the initial decisions on the input image. The decisions obtained from all the classifiers are fused to obtain the final decision on the input pattern. The method is tested on a private database containing HRCT images belongs to four ILDs patterns (viz. consolidation, emphysema, ground glass, nodular) and normal lung tissue. The performance of the method is compared with its single classifier based counterpart and found to be superior.

Mammogram is an effective study for detecting mass lesions, which could indicate this disease. However, due to the density of breast tissue and a wide range of mass characteristic, the mass diagnosis is difficult. In this study, the performance comparison of Bayesian networks models on classification of benign and malignant masses is presented. Here, Naive Bayes, Tree Augmented Naive Bayes, K-dependence Bayesian classifier, and Forest Augmented Naive Bayes models are analyzed. Two data sets extracted from the public BCDR-F01 database, including 112 benign and 119 malignant masses, were used to train the models. The experimental results have shown that TAN, KDB, and FAN models with a subset of only eight features have achieved a performance of 0.79 in accuracy, 0.80 in sensitivity, and 0.77 in specificity. Therefore, these models which allow dependencies among variables (features), are considered as suitable and promising methods for automated mass classification.

Emails, text messages and online messenger chatting have become part and parcel of our lives. Out of all these communications, emails are more prone to exploitation. Thus, various email providers employ algorithms to filter emails based on spam and ham. In this research paper, our prime aim is to detect text as well as image based spam emails. To achieve the objective we applied three algorithms namely: KNN algorithm, Naive Bayes algorithm and reverse DBSCAN algorithm. Pre-processing of email text before executing the algorithms is used to make them predict better. This paper uses Enron corpus's dataset of spam and ham emails.

We performed experiments on bug report repositories of bug tracking systems such as bugzilla and debugger. In the proposed approach we apply text mining methodology and TF-IDF on the existing historic bug report database based on the bug's description to predict the nature of the bug and to train a statistical model for manually mislabeled bug reports present in the database. The tool helps in deciding the priorities of the incoming bugs depending on the category of the bugs i.e. whether it is a security bug report or a non-security bug report, using naive bayes. Our evaluation shows that our tool using TF-IDF is giving better results than the naive bayes method.

Applications of human action recognition, such as video retrieval, video surveillance and video event analysis are expanded extensively. Generally the video data used are based on fixed camera with stationary background, well-controlled environment and under simple actions. However, in real human action cases, the actions of human behavior are often complex and the background are cluttered with illumination changes, different human body size and moving camera. These make the real video much more complex. In this study, study to improve accuracies of human action recognition under clutter and moving background is proposed. The recognition scheme is based on the space-time interest point (STIP) and naive Bayes based mutual information maximization (NBMIM). Methods including the selection of robust feature points based on camera motion estimation, analysis and correlations of the important STIP features during the training stage and weighting mechanism for action recognition to improve the recognition rate are used. Experimental results using the YouTube dataset indicate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

With heterogeneous accesses and huge traffic volumes, several pattern identification techniques have been brought into the research community. Data Mining is one of the analyses which many IDSs have adopted as an attack recognition scheme. Thus, in this paper, the classification methodology including attribute and data selections was drawn based on the well-known classification schemes, i.e., Decision Tree, Ripper Rule, Neural Networks, Naive Bayes, k-Nearest-Neighbour, and Support Vector Machine, for intrusion detection analysis using both KDD CUP dataset and recent HTTP BOTNET attacks. Performance of the evaluation was measured using recent Weka tools with a standard cross-validation and confusion matrix.

Kinect allows capturing dense, and three dimensional scans of an object in real time. We propose a combination of modelling and learning approach for hand gesture recognition. We use Kinect depth feature for background segmentation of hand gesture images captured with Kinect. Image processing techniques are employed to find contour of segmented hand images. Then we calculate convex hull and convexity defects for this contour. We are using contour area and convexity defects as features for classification. We classify the gestures using naive Bayes classifier. We have considered five hand gestures classes i.e. to show using one, two, three, four, and five fingers one by one. We implemented and tested this algorithm for 15 images of each class. It gives a correct classification rate of 100%.

Individuals need to be aware that good body posture is vital for a healthy quality of life, especially as one ages. However, an individual's ability to detect poor posture can be difficult as a faulty posture tends to feel normal after continuous practice. Moreover, consulting a physician about one's posture may not always be feasible. As such, we propose a convenient photo-based approach for assessing body posture from a side profile image of an individual. Shape features extracted by processing these images, such as the curves from an individual's back are used to train a Support Vector Machine and a Naive Bayes classification models to predict good or poor posture. Results from the experiments conducted with 144 participants demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

The dataset comprised of 698 tender files obtained from DRDO website. The dataset was processed and fed into Weka toolkit. Experiments were conducted using Naive Bayes classifier with 10 folds cross validation. The documents were classified with 75.21 percent accuracy by technology area and 68.62 percent by lab's name when the dataset included lab names somewhere in the document. An accuracy result of 74.36 percent and 68.34 percent was attained for the technology area and name of the lab respectively when all occurrences of lab names were removed from the dataset.

The problems associated with spam and various approaches that attempt to deal with it, have been presented here. Statistical classifiers are one such group of methods that show adequate performance in filtering span!, based upon the previous knowledge gathered through collected and classified emails. Learning algorithms that uses the Naive Bayesian classifier have shown promising results in separating spam from legitimate mail. An encoded and fragmented database approach that resembles radix sort technique has been proposed and applied for first time to improve Paul Graham's Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm for spam filtering. The main objective of this paper is to reduce overall time in the process of spam detection. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the proposed technique, performed on two public spam databases (SpamAssasin and Ling Spam) has shown improved time performance. The proposed method has performed up to six times faster than the existing Paul Graham's Bayesian approach.

In this paper we propose a hybrid classifier framework called co-NV for automatic identification of RESTful services on the Web. In our framework, web pages are analyzed and filtered according to the contents and structure characteristics of HTML documents, with Naive Bayes classifier and Vector Space Model (VSM) respectively. Experiments with real RESTful services prove that our framework works effectively with high precision and recall rate, and is very practical.

For this reason heuristic methodologies have been proposed. In this paper, decision trees, Naive Bayes, and supervised classifying systems UCS, are combined to improve the performance of a classifier. In order to validate the system, a scenario based on real data of the NSL-KDD99 dataset is used.

In this paper, a series of comparative experiments are performed in which two simple interpretable supervised classifiers (specifically, Naive Bayes and linear Support Vector Machines) are trained (i) directly on "real" data, as would be the normal case, and (ii) indirectly, using special artificial datasets derived from real data via evolutionary optimization. The results across several challenging test problems show that supervised classifiers trained indirectly using our novel evolution-based approach produce models with superior predictive classification performance. Besides presenting the accuracy of the learned models, we also analyze the sensitivity of our artificial data optimization process to Differential Evolution's parameters, and then we examine the statistical characteristics of the artificial data that is evolved.

For this reason, many classification/prediction approaches emerged over the years to provide an automated reasoning over severity classes. In this paper, we use text mining together with bi-grams and feature selection to improve the classification of bugs in severe/non-severe classes. We adopt the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier considering Mozilla and Eclipse datasets commonly used in related works. Overall, the results show that the application of bi-grams can improve slightly the performance of the classifier, but feature selection can be more effective to determine the most informative terms and bi-grams. The results are in any case project-dependent, as in some cases the addition of bi-grams may worsen the performance.
