Recent research on question classification for open-domain mostly concentrates on using machine learning methods to resolve the special kind of text classification. This paper presents our research about Chinese question classification using machine learning method and gives our approach based on SVM and semantic gram extraction. SVM has been widely used for question classification and got good performances. We use SVM as the classifier and propose a new feature extraction method of Chinese questions which is called semantic gram extraction. The method is proposed based on the word semantics and N-gram. The experiment results show that the feature extraction can perform well with SVM and our approach can reach high classification accuracy.

Also, performance evaluation and parameters selection for SVM model become an important issue to make it practically useful. In this paper, after investigating current evaluation index for pattern recognition, we introduced Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve into the performance evaluation. Area under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve is applied to the model evaluation, model performance of SVM and RBFN is compared. Also optimal operating point of ROC is adopted to the optimization of SVM within the kernel parameters and penalty factor, and the optimization is performed by seeking of optimal operating point. Pattern recognition experiment with UCI dataset shows that ROC method is an effective approach for performance evaluation and optimization of SVM.

Unfortunately, in practice, the training data are often either too few, expensive to label, or easy to be outdated Most of supervised machine learning methods led to poor performance when working on limited tagged data. In recently years, some researches successfully use unlabeled data to help classification. This paper investigated a novel semi-supervised learning method based on active learning with information entropy. An optimization strategy of selecting training instances, based on active learning, was presented The experiment results show that our method could achieve high performance on small tagged data.

One important goal of microarray experiments is to discover novel biomarkers for toxicity evaluation. A variety of toxicological effects have been associated with explosive compounds 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 1,3.5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane (RDX). Here we developed a discriminant analysis and cluster (DAC) pipeline to analyze a 248-array dataset with 15,208 non-redundant earthworm (Eisenia fetida) gene probes on each array. Our objective was to identify biomarker genes that can separate earthworm samples into three groups: control (untreated), TNT-treated, and RDX-treated. First, the class comparison statistical algorithm implemented in BRB-ArrayTools was used to infer a total of 869 genes that significantly changed relative to controls as a result of exposure to TNT or RDX at various concentrations for 4 or 14 days. Then, nine tree-based supervised machine learning algorithms were applied to generate classification rules and a set of 286 classifier genes. These classifier genes were ranked by their overall weight of significance in the nine classification methods, and were used to build support vector machines (SVM). A SVM containing all 286 classifier genes had the highest classification accuracy (91.5%). Results of unsupervised clustering show that the use of the top 100 classifier genes can assign the largest number of the 248 worm samples into the three reference clusters obtained by using all the 14,188 filtered genes, suggesting that these top-ranked genes may be potential candidates for biomarkers. This study demonstrates that the DAC pipeline can be used to identify a small set of biomarker genes from high dimensional datasets and generate a reliable SVM classification model for multiple classes.

Most popular tools for structural annotation of genomes are determined by computational pipelines. It is well-known that these computational methods have a number of shortcomings including false identifications and incorrect identification of gene boundaries. Proteomic data can used to confirm the identification of genes identified by computational methods and correct mistakes. A Proteogenomic mapping method has been developed, which uses peptides identified from mass spectrometry for structural annotation of genomes. Spectra are matched against both a protein database and the genome database translated in all six reading frames. Those peptides that match the genome but not the protein database potentially represent novel protein coding genes, annotation errors. These short experimentally derived peptides are used to discover potential novel protein coding genes called expressed Protein Sequence Tags (ePSTs) by aligning the peptides to the genomic DNA and extending the translation in the 3 ' and 5 ' direction. In the paper, an enhanced pipeline, has been designed and developed for discovering and evaluating of potential novel protein coding genes: 1) a distance-based outlier detection method for validating peptides identified from MS/MS, 2) a proteogenomic mapping for discovery of potential novel protein coding genes, 3) collection of evidence front a number of sources and automatically evaluate potential novel protein coding genes by using machine learning techniques, such as Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes etc.	[Wang, Nan] Univ So Mississippi, Sch Comp, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA	Wang, N (reprint author), Univ So Mississippi, Sch Comp, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA.	burgess@cvm.msstate.edu					Delcher AL, 1999, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V27, P4636, DOI 10.1093/nar/27.23.4636; Jaffe JD, 2004, PROTEOMICS, V4, P59, DOI 10.1002/pmic.200300511; Kalume DE, 2005, BMC GENOMICS, V6, DOI 10.1186/1471-2164-6-128; Lukashin AV, 1998, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V26, P1107, DOI 10.1093/nar/26.4.1107; Mann M, 2001, TRENDS BIOCHEM SCI, V26, P54, DOI 10.1016/S0968-0004(00)01726-6; WANG N, MCBIOS2009 OAKL OK F; WEKA SG, 1995, P NZ COMP SCI RES ST, P57	7	0	0	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA		978-0-7695-3739-9				2009							103	106		10.1109/IJCBS.2009.126		4	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Mathematical & Computational Biology	Computer Science; Mathematical & Computational Biology	BRI88	WOS:000282797800017

RNA secondary structure can be determined in laboratory by X-ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. However, these techniques are slow and expensive. Therefore, computational approaches are used to predict the secondary structure of RNA molecules. A new approach. RNA-SSP, for predicting RNA secondary structure elements is proposed. It combines computational approaches and machine learning classifiers to predict individual structure elements using a new search heuristic. The approach is implemented and tested for hairpin loops and a methodology for extending the approach to predict the remaining secondary structure elements is proposed. The experiments showed a significant improvement in prediction accuracy to 95% for stem regions and 80% for loops. The overall weighted-average accuracy for predicting hairpin loop sub-structure is 89% with a sensitivity of 85.29%.

Novel computational method is highly needed to help biologist design experiment. In this paper, we are motivated to propose a novel machine learning model for predicting Gram-positive protein subcelluar localization, as an alternative to the existing models Gpos-Ploc when the required GO annotation information is unavailable. The model uses protein structural domain as indicator of protein subcelluar location. To capture protein sequence local information and structural domain boundary partition information, a novel method called Multiple Instance Multiclass Learning (MIMC) is proposed for predicting protein subcelluar location, where domain is taken as an instance of protein and protein as a bag of domains. Because some proteins may have multiple subcelluar locations, we introduce another related model called Multiple Instance Multiple Label Learning (MIML) to predict potential minor subcelluar locations. Protein sequence and domain are encoded using simple 20-D Amino Acid Composition (AA), so that feature dimensionality is greatly reduced and the Instance representation can capture domain boundary partition information as compared to flat domain vector representation.

In this study, a new machine learning method has been developed for sequence-based prediction of protein stability changes upon single amino acid substitutions. Support vector machines were trained with data from experimental studies on the free energy change of protein stability upon mutations. To construct accurate classifiers, twenty biological features were examined for input vector encoding. It was shown that classifier performance varied significantly by the use of different features. The most accurate classifier was constructed using a combination of several biological features. This classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 82.24% with 75.24% sensitivity and 85.36% specificity. Predictive results at this level of accuracy may be used in human genetic studies to distinguish between deleterious and tolerant alterations in disease candidate genes.

Such process is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To speed up this process, one popular way is using machine learning method to model the underlying mechanism of protein methylation based on known methylated proteins and then suggesting candidate positions on unknown proteins. In this paper, we first collect several proteins methylated by different families of PRMTs, and then use granular computing methods to build a granular decision fusion method based on SVM modeling. Such decision fusion method can produce high prediction accuracy. More importantly, we use this method to successfully discover several highly possible methylation sites on some unknown proteins; biological experiments have verified our results.

However, PSSM is rather designed for PSI-BLAST searches, and it may not contain all the evolutionary information for modeling specific sequence patterns. In this study, several new descriptors of evolutionary information have been developed and evaluated for sequence-based prediction of DNA and RNA-binding residues using support vector machines (SVMs). The new descriptors were shown to improve classifier performance. Interestingly, the best classifiers were obtained by combining the new descriptors and PSSM, suggesting that they captured different aspects of evolutionary information for DNA and RNA-binding site prediction. The SVM classifiers achieved 77.3% sensitivity and 79.3% specificity for prediction of DNA-binding residues, and 71.6% sensitivity and 78.7% specificity for RNA-binding site prediction. Predictions at this level of accuracy may provide useful information for protein functional annotation, protein-nucleic acid docking and experimental studies such as site-directed mutagenesis.

The mining and curation of PPI knowledge is critical for analyzing high-throughput genomics and proteomics data. Several PPI knowledge bases have been generated through expensive manual curation but far from comprehensive. It is desired to have a document classification system which can classify documents as PPI-related or not PPI-related and therefore assist the mining and curation of PPI knowledge. In order to build document classification systems, an annotated corpus is needed where each document in the corpus is tagged with a label (either positive or negative) However, it is usually the case that only a small number of positive documents can be obtained manually or from existing PPI knowledge bases with literature evidences Meanwhile, there arc a large number of unlabeled documents where most of them are not PPI-related Machine learning based on a small number of positives and a large number of unlabeled documents is called learning from positive and unlabelled documents (LPU) which has been studied in the general domain A popular approach for LPU is a two-step strategy where the first step is to obtain reliable negative documents (RN) and the second step is to refine RN using various methods such as clustering or boosting In this paper, we tackle the problem of LPU for PPI document classification and compare three two-step procedures based on a public data set, Reuters-21578 One is to obtain a negative data set by building a machine learning classifier which treats each unlabelled document as negatives and then classifies unlabelled documents The second procedure is to refine the negative data set iteratively and consider those unlabeled documents always classified as negative as reliable negatives The third procedure is to augment the negative data set iteratively by including unlabeled documents classified as negative in any iteration Three machine learning algorithms were deployed for each two-step procedure	[Xu, Guixian; Niu, Zhendong] Beijing Inst Technol, Coll Comp Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China	Xu, GX (reprint author), Beijing Inst Technol, Coll Comp Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.	gx6@georgetown.edu; zniu@bit.edu.cn; qinxuping@sohu.com; hl224@georgetown.edu	Uetz, Peter/A-7119-2012				Bodenreider O, 2004, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V32, pD267, DOI 10.1093/nar/gkh061; Daraselia N, 2004, BIOINFORMATICS, V20, P604, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg452; Donaldson I, 2003, BMC BIOINFORMATICS, V4, DOI 10.1186/1471-2105-4-11; FUNG GPC, 2006, IEEE T KNOWLEDGE DAT, V18; Goll J, 2008, BIOINFORMATICS, V24, P1743, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btn285; Higham DJ, 2008, BIOINFORMATICS, V24, P1093, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btn079; Liu B, 2002, P 19 INT C MACH LEAR; Liu B., 2003, P 18 INT JOINT C ART; Spasic I, 2005, BRIEF BIOINFORM, V6, P239, DOI 10.1093/bib/6.3.239; Temkin JM, 2003, BIOINFORMATICS, V19, P2046, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg279; Tsai RTH, 2008, BMC BIOINFORMATICS, V9, DOI 10.1186/1471-2105-9-S1-S3; XIAO J, 2005, P S SEM MIN BIOM; XU G, 2008, IEEE INT C BIOINF BI, P83; YU H, 2004, IEEE T KNOWLEDGE DAT	14	0	0	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA		978-0-7695-3739-9				2009							263	270		10.1109/IJCBS.2009.68		8	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Mathematical & Computational Biology	Computer Science; Mathematical & Computational Biology	BRI88	WOS:000282797800047

It is important to be able to predict which antigenic peptides will bind to a specific MHC allele and which will not, creating possibilities for controlling immune response and for the applications of immunotherapy. however, a problem for MHC class I is the presence of bulges and loops in the peptides, changing the total length. Most machine learning methods in use today require the sequences to be of same length to successfully mine the binding motifs. We propose the use of time-based data mining methods in motif mining to be able to mine motifs position-independently. Also, the information for both binding and nonbinding peptides is used on the contrary to the other methods which only rely on binding peptides. The prediction results are between 60-95% for the tested alleles.

Machine learning techniques have been extensively used to analyze microarray data but, most methods are based on the identification of significant associations of gene ontology terms with groups of genes. This does not directly reflect metabolic networks. In this paper, a more systematic approach is considered. As a first step, we did pathway analysis using Hyper Geometric Distribution (HGD) and significantly overrepresented sets of reactions (pathways or sub-pathways) were identified. As a second step, feature selection based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) methods were used.

They provide reliable static models, but their extension to the training of dynamic models is still an open problem. In the present paper, we describe Regularized Recurrent Support Vector Machines, which, in contrast to previous Recurrent Support Vector Machine, models, allow the design of dynamical models while retaining the built-in regularization mechanism present in Support Vector Machines. The principle is validated on academic examples; it is shown that the results compare favorably to those obtained by unregularized Recurrent Support Vector Machines and to regularized, partially recurrent Support Vector Machines.

But k the number of clusters needs users specify and the effective initial centers are difficult to select. Meanwhile, it is sensitive to noise data points. In this paper, we focus on choice the better initial centers to improve the quality of k-means and to reduce the computational complexity of k-means method. The proposed algorithm called GK-means, which combines grid structure and spatial index with k-means algorithm.

This requires configurable implementations of many algorithms, means to define and conduct meaningful experiments on them, and mechanisms for storing and analyzing observed performance data. In this paper, we first overview basic approaches for improving simulation performance and illustrate the challenges when comparing different methods. We then argue that providing all the aforementioned components in a single tool, in our case the open source modeling and simulation framework JAMES II, reveals many synergies in effectively pursuing both questions. This is exemplified by presenting results of recent studies and introducing a new component to swiftly evaluate simulator code changes against previous experimental data.

A more accurate alternative is to inspect the application payloads of traffic flows. The main drawback of such method is that target applications must be manually analyzed beforehand. Another alternative is to exploit the distinctive statistical properties of traffic flows and apply machine learning techniques to classify or cluster flows. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic mechanism for application identification. The mechanism combine flow clustering based on statistical features in order to generate clusters dominated by a single application on the one hand, and automatic construction of application signature based on payload contents solely on the other hand. Preliminary results of evaluation using real-world traffic traces indicate that the proposed approach is feasible and promising.

The performance of this rule-based approach can be enhanced by modifying and improving the knowledge base only due to the characteristic that knowledge and control logic are separate and independent of each other in knowledge based system. Moreover, "primitive action", "priority of parallel conclusion", "parallel search method" and "simple conflict resolution method" were also introduced to shorten the system's response time. The successful prototype application in robot soccer verified its effectiveness.

The main contribution of this work is the automatic detection and classification of artifacts located at the ground level. The detection is based on Top-Hat of hole filling algorithm of range images. Then, several features are extracted from the detected connected components (CCs). Afterward, a stepwise forward variable selection by using Wilk's Lambda criterion is performed. Finally, CCs are classified in four categories (lampposts, pedestrians, cars, the others) by using a SVM machine learning method.

However, it is difficult to test such applications because often there is no "test oracle" to indicate what the correct output should be for arbitrary input. To help address the quality of such software, in this paper we present a technique for testing the implementations of supervised machine learning classification algorithms on which such scientific computing software depends. Our technique is based on an approach called "metamorphic testing", which has been shown to be effective in such cases. More importantly, we demonstrate that our technique not only serves the purpose of verification, but also can be applied in validation. In addition to presenting our technique, we describe a case study we performed on a real-world machine learning application framework, and discuss how programmers implementing machine learning algorithms can avoid the common pitfalls discovered in our study. We also discuss how our findings can be of use to other areas outside scientific computing, as well.

Consequently, their detection and correction have drawn the attention of both researchers and practitioners who have proposed various approaches to detect code and design smells in programs. However, none of these approaches handle the inherent uncertainty of the detection process. We propose a Bayesian approach to manage this uncertainty. First, we present a systematic process to convert existing state-of-the-art detection rules into a probabilistic model. We illustrate this process by generating a model to detect occurrences of the Blob antipattern. Second, we present results of the validation of the model: we built this model on two open-source programs, GanttProject v1.10.2 and Xerces v2.7.0, and measured its accuracy. Third, we compare our model with another approach to show that it returns the same candidate classes while ordering them to minimise the quality analysts' effort. Finally, we show that when past detection results are available, our model can be calibrated using machine learning techniques to offer an improved, context-specific detection.

The techniques used here are based on Support Vector Machines (SVM). SVMs are machine learning strategies which use a robust cost function alternative to the widely used Least Squares function and that apply a regularization which provides control of the complexity of the resulting estimators. As a result, estimators are robust against interferences and nongaussian noise and present excellent generalization properties where the number of data available for the estimation is small. The structure presented here has a feature extraction part that, instead of using an FFT approach, uses the SVM criterion for spectrum estimation, feature extraction and modulation classification.

In particular, it leads to a radical review of healthcare delivery for the future as personalised, preventive, predictive and participatory, or p-Health. It is a vision that places e-Systems at the core of healthcare delivery, in contrast to current practice. This view of the demands of the 21st century sets an agenda that builds upon advances in engineering devices and computing infrastructure, but also computational intelligence and new models for communication between healthcare providers and the public. This paper gives an overview of p-Health with reference to decision support in breast cancer.

However, conventional IBL has the limitation that it has no criterion for choosing the trusted intuition based on the knowledge and experience. The purpose of this paper is to develop a learning model for human-computer cooperative from user's perspective. We have established the theoretical foundation and conceptualization of the constructs for learning system with trusted intuition. And suggest a new machine learning technique called Trusted Intuition Network (TIN). We have developed a general instrument capable of reliably and accurately measuring trusted intuition in the context of intuitive learning systems. We also compare the results with the learning methods, artificial intuition networks and conventional IBL. The results of this paper show that the proposed technique outperforms those of many other methods, it overcomes the limitation of conventional IBL, and it provides improved uncertainty learning theory.

A new filter method of specific sample points based on partial least-squares analysis was introduced in this paper. Two conceptions of true and false specific sample points were given and their relationship was elaborated in detail. The paper defined the critical value distinguishing true and false specific sample points and presented the critical formula. A novel method for identifying true and false specific sample points was described by using ellipse T(2) diagram, ellipsoid T(2) and scatter diagram of the principal component. Discrimination and filter method of specific sample points took great effect on eliminating samples created by random factors and purifying ultimate model.

We design a Modified Topic Relevance Retrieval System (MTRRS) containing query formulation and a combination model. To design the query, manual adjustment and machine learning are used. During the machine learning processing, we define a center word list which helps to generate a novel distance feature. The result can be improved 22.97% on MAP by query formulation. The results of document retrieval model and passage retrieval model are combined. 33.55% increase on MAP can be received. Also by using the combination model, the retrieval result of the semi-machine learning query is closely approaching the manually adjusted result.

In our approach, unlabeled data has been used to construct an optimized kernel that better generalizes on the target dataset. For the proposed kernel learning algorithm, Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) is used in conjunction with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) test of statistics to optimize a base kernel using labeled and unlabeled data. Thereafter; the constructed kernel from both labeled and unlabeled datasets is used in SVM to evaluate the results which proved to increase prediction accuracy.	[Abbasnejad, M.

SVM uses various kernel functions like RBF and polynomial to map the data into higher dimensional space to improve data separability. New kernel functions are used in this paper to classify hyperspectral images which are based on wavelet functions as named Wavelet-kernels. The experimental results indicate that Wavelet-kernels provide better classification accuracy than previous kernels.

Quality estimations are made using fault proneness data available from previously developed similar type of projects and the training data consisting of software measurements. To predict faulty modules in software data different techniques have been proposed which includes statistical method, machine learning methods, neural network techniques and clustering techniques. The aim of proposed approach is to investigate that whether metrics available in the early lifecycle (i.e. requirement metrics), metrics available in the late lifecycle (i.e. code metrics) and metrics available in the early lifecycle (i.e. requirement metrics) combined with metrics available in the late lifecycle (i.e. code metrics) can be used to identify fault prone modules by using clustering techniques. This approach has been tested with three real time defect datasets of NASA software projects, JM1, PC1 and CM1. Predicting faults early in the software life cycle can be used to improve software process control and achieve high software reliability. The results show that when all the prediction techniques are evaluated, the best prediction model is found to be the fusion of requirement and code metric model.

Blog classification using machine learning techniques is a key method towards doing it. We have devised a machine learning algorithm where features are created from individual sentences in the body of a blog by taking one word at a time. Weights are assigned to the features based on the strength of their predictive capabilities for illegitimate/legitimate determination. The predictive capabilities are estimated by the frequency of occurrence of the feature in illegitimate/legitimate collections. During classification, total illegitimate and legitimate evidence in the blog is obtained by summing up the weights of extracted features of each class and the message is classified into whichever class accumulates the greater sum. We compared the algorithm against the popular naive-bayes algorithm (in [8]) and found its performance does not deteriorate in the least than that of naive-bayes algorithm both in terms of catching blog spam and for reducing false positives.

Parallel Methods; PCA; DCT; Histogram Matching; Weighted Facial Attribute		Recognizing a face based on its attributes is an easy task for a human to perform; it is nearly automatic, and requires little mental effort. A computer, on the other hand, has no innate ability to recognize a face or facial features, and must be programmed with an algorithm to do so. Generally, to recognize a face, different kinds of the facial features were used separately or in a combined manner. Feature fusion methods and parallel methods performed by integrating multiple feature sets at different levels. However, these feature fusion methods as well as parallel methods do not guarantee better result. Several Feature extraction techniques and fusion models were explored in several earlier works. This work, addresses feature fusion model with multiple weighted facial attribute set. For facial feature set creation, 1. PCA based Eigen feature extraction technique, 2. DCT based feature extraction technique, 3. Histogram Based Feature Extraction technique and 4. Simple intensity based feature Extraction were used. The proposed model has been tested on face images which differ in expression and illumination condition with a dataset obtained from face image databases of ORL. A more significant improvement in term of accuracy was achieved and more significant results were arrived.

It is known that the performance of the K-means clustering algorithm depend highly on initial cluster centers. Generally initial cluster centers are selected randomly, so the algorithm could not lead to the unique result. In this paper, we present a method to compute initial cluster centers for K-means clustering. Our method is based on an efficient technique for estimating the modes of a distribution. We apply the new method to the K-means algorithm. The experimental results show better performance of the proposed method.

And machine learning is concerned with constructing computer programs that automatically improve with experience. Machine learning draws on concepts and results from many fields. Obviously, no matter what we adopt new analytical method or technical means, we must have a distinct recognition of system itself and its complexity, and increase continuously analysis, operation and control level. The forecasting analysis of nonlinear complex system will be discussed carefully in this paper. We are mainly using grey forecasting theory to forecast data sequences, and the usual forecast precision has exceeded 90%. In the symbolic forecast of 2-letters nonlinear complex system, the precision of grey forecasting certainly will decrease as the length of symbolic sequence is increasing. But in this place we have found a generating rule that may realize chaotic synchronization at least in short and medium term, and we can analysis and forecast in this way.

Accuracy and transparency are two important criteria that should be satisfied by any classification model. In this paper, a transparent and relatively accurate classifier is developed using a hybrid soft computing technique. The initial fuzzy model is first generated using a clustering method and the transparency and accuracy of the model are then simultaneously optimized using a multi-objective evolutionary technique. The proposed model is tested on two real problems; the first one is related to credit scoring problem while the other is on medical diagnosis. All the data sets used in this study are publicly available at UCI repository of machine learning database.

This is to be done without human visual interpretation. Our research demonstrates that it can be achieved by visualizing the historical temporal data pattern generated from the inspection machine. From there, the data pattern is transformed and mapped into machine learning algorithm for training. In this paper, we have introduced the pattern visualization technique with trinay and quinary number and compared them with our previous binary pattern visualization technique. This is to deal with multi class classification. The result implied that, the performance of the multi class classification can be improved when all class instances were made higher in quantity and balance. Quinary pattern visualization techniques performed better compared with binary and trinary patterns when the multi class instances were made balanced and were significantly at higher quantity.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to provide users with an accelerometer-based interface for interactively controlling not only functions or devices in digital environments but virtual characters in game-like scenarios. A general approach suitable for both PC and mobile platforms is proposed. Its core techniques include automatic generation and preprocessing of training samples and proper setup of machine learning models. Three sample applications are given: gesture-controlled lantern slide system with Wii Remote, gesture recognition system to make phone calls on Nokia N95, and performance-driven motion choreographing system with Xsens MTx. Experimental results show that the recognition rate is over 95% which is quite acceptable for gesture interaction systems.

At each iteration, the algorithm discards most of the samples with small weight and keeps only the samples whit large weight to train the weak learner. During training, only a small portion of the samples are used to train the weak learner, so the speed is increased. The method has been applied to mining safety monitoring, the experimental results show that the method has good effects for large-scale data.

The ordinary ways of regression analysis have difficulty in establishing models and may lead to "over learning". The support vector machine (SVM) does not have a strict requirement on the number of samples, the distribution of process errors and sample points, and is easy to promote. In this paper, We make a SVM regression analysis of the quality control and prediction of higher education and put forward a regression model with strong generalization ability from the angle of machine learning. The results of the effect of fitting are good under the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. Thus, the problems of establishing models, making quantification analysis in the quality control of higher education can have a solution.

Support vector machine (SVM) is a new machine learning method, which seeks to minimize an upper bound of the generalization error instead of the empirical error as in conventional neural networks. In the study, support vector machine and particle swarm optimization is applied in economic growth forecasting, PSO is to find the optimal settings of parameters in SVM. The total output value of Xi'an city from 1990 to 2000 was employed to compare the forecasting performances of the proposed PSVM model and RBF neural network forecasting model in economic growth forecasting. The experiment results indicate that the proposed hybrid PSOSVM algorithm is better than the RBFNN in economic growth forecasting.

However, comparing to regular C-SVM, its formulation is more complicated because of having an additional inequality so up to now there are no exact and effective methods for incremental v-SVM learning. In this paper, based on the truth that the additional inequality can be treated as an equality, we propose an effective and exact incremental learning algorithm for v-SVM which conquers the difficult problem the incremental learning path may break off by the original incremental method for C-SVM.

For UCT algorithm, Monte-Carlo simulations are performed with the guidance of UCB1 formula, which are averaged to evaluate a specified action. We observe that, as more simulations are performed, later ones usually lead to more accurate results, partly because the level of the search used in the later simulation is deeper and partly because more results are available to direct subsequent simulations. This paper presents a new method to improve the performance of UCT algorithm by increasing the feedback value of the later simulations. And the experimental results in the classical game Go show that our approach increases the performance of Monte-Carlo simulations significantly when exponential models are used.

A novel method is introduced for image categorization by constructing vocabulary ensembles using different clustering algorithms in the popular vocabulary approach. The vocabulary approach describes an image as a bag of discrete visual words, where the frequency distributions of these words are used for image categorization. Based on vocabularies formed by various clustering algorithms, a classifier ensemble is learned, which can jointly exploit different data structure of high dimensional descriptors. High classification accuracies of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated on three different datasets.

At present, there is some research on sentiment analysis for English traveler generated reviews, but very few studies pay attention to sentiment analysis for traveler reviews in Chinese. China is the largest country in terms of the number of Internet users. Internet technologies are gradually playing more and more important roles for many industries including tourism industry. The lack of sentiment analysis methods will block the use of word-of-mouth for tourism industry in China. To solve the problem, this study conducts an exploring research on sentiment analysis to Chinese traveler reviews by support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The experiment data of Chinese reviews for hotels are downloaded from www.ctrip.com, the largest online travel agency in China. Empirical results indicate that, comparing to prior studies on English reviews, SVM algorithm can gain a very well performance of sentiment classification for traveler reviews in Chinese.

In this paper, we present work flow of our IE system for the extraction of semantically rich information from the unstructured or semi-structured Chinese web pages. Knowledge engineering approach and automatic training approach are used to extract pattern and built knowledge repository. General IE system needs to label the unlabeled training web pages. A novel methodology that does not need to label text is developed, including hierarchy filtration pattern matching based on syntax in best distance method and maximum forward boundary recognition using organization suffix repository and part of speech tagging method. As for applications of IE, a new application system based on IE is built. It is object-level vertical search system and object here is Chinese people, so IE is concerned with extracting people's related attributes from a collection of web pages about Chinese people. The results are displayed as hierarchy directory tree according to people's attributes. The system makes user find people quickly and easily.

Ensemble learning algorithm is one of the algorithms which have best classification results in many classification algorithms. A decision tree algorithm is a kind of greedy algorithm, it use top-down recursive way to determine the tree structure. The proposed algorithm improved the accuracy of classification by combining the advantage of Boosting algorithm with decision tree. The main idea is to make full use of the advantages of ensemble learning algorithm and decision tree. We introduce the algorithm procession in detail. The proposed algorithm proved that the property which has the smallest classification error rate as of decision tree is equivalent to the branching method of traditional decision tree. The algorithm uses the rapid classification capabilities of decision tree. In the meantime, we take into account the classification accuracy of joint classification. Finally, Experiments with UCI machine learning data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

It not only overcomes some shortcomings of traditional classification technique based on port number, but also does not inspect the packet payload, which involves the security and privacy. In this paper, we apply an unsupervised machine learning approach based on DBSCAN algorithm. DBSCAN algorithm has three merits: (1) minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters; (2) discovery of clusters with arbitrary shapes; (3) good efficiency on large data set. Experiment results show that DBSCAN has better effectiveness and efficiency.

It can improve the efficiency and accuracy by removing redundant and irrelevant terms. Feature selection is commonly used in machine learning, and has been wildly applied in many fields, we propose a new feature selection method. This is an integrative hybrid method. It first uses Affinity Propagation and SVM sensitivity analysis to generate feature subset, and then use forward selection and backward elimination method to optimize the feature subset based on feature ranking. Besides, we apply this feature selection method to solve a new problem, Human resource selection. The data is acquired by questionnaire survey. The simulation results show that the proposed feature selection method is effective, it not only reduced human resource features but also increased the classification performance.

Q-learning has been applied to various tasks such as foraging, soccer and prey-pursuing robots. In this paper, a simple foraging task has been considered to study the influences of the policies reported in the open literatures. A mobile robot is used to search and retrieve pucks back to a home location. The goal of this study is to identify an efficient policy for q-learning which maximizes the number of pucks collected and minimizes the number of collisions in the environment. Policies namely greedy, epsilon-greedy, Boltzmann distribution and random search are used to study their performances in the foraging task and the results are presented.

The added abilities that come from the hybrid approaches motivate their use in every system. Bio-Medical Engineering is yet another field which has seen a major change in he past few years. We find various new approaches being applied to this field as well as many new models being proposed. At this juncture, we study the effectiveness of various new hybrid approaches in the field of Bio-medicals in this paper. PIMA Indian database has been used for this purpose from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The basic aim is to compare the various hybrid approaches from the recent literature and compare their performances. We have chosen 3 major Hybrid Systems and standard Back Propagation Algorithm for this purpose. These are Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems, Ensembles and Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks.

While pruning algorithms. are used to tackle the complexity problem, no direct solutions are known for the second. Selecting training data at random from the sample space is the most popular method followed. Despite its simplicity, this method does not ensure nor guarantee that the training would be optimal. In this brief paper, we present a new method that is specific to a difference boosting neural network (DBNN) but could probably be extended to other networks as well. The method is iterative and fast, ensuring optimal selection of the minimum training data from a larger set in an automated manner We test the performance of the new method on the some of the well known datasets from the UCI repository for benchmarking machine learning tools and show that the performance of the new method in almost all cases is better than that in any published method of comparable network complexity and that it requires only a fraction of the usual training data, thereby, making learning faster and more generic.

Credit scoring models have been widely studied in the areas of statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). Many novel approaches such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), rough sets, or decision trees have been proposed to increase the accuracy of credit scoring models. Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) which are algorithm developed with inspiration from natural immune system processes have been used to solve various kinds of real life processes with success. Various AIS algorithms like AIRS, CLONALG, Immunos etc have been proposed. This paper explores the possibility of application of various Artificial Immune System Algorithms to credit scoring problem and compares the results with other methodologies. Experiments are done against two benchmark data sets and results presented with respect to other algorithms to help credit analysts chose from various methodologies.			antobhaduri@gmail.com					ALDRICH JH, 1984, LINEAR PROBABILITY; ALTMAN EI, 1968, J FINANC, V23, P589, DOI 10.2307/2978933; Blake C.

Two major concerns in engineering software systems are high maintenance costs and reliability of systems. To reduce maintenance efforts, there is a need for automated tools to help software developers understand their existing code base. So, there is a need to extract specifications to aid program comprehension. In this paper a novel technique to efficiently mine software specifications, called TM_TraceMiner is proposed which mines software specifications from program execution traces. The Transaction Mapping algorithm is currently one of the fastest approaches. To address the limitations of Apriori-like methods and FP-growth methods, a mining paradigm has been proposed, which uses Transaction Mapping algorithm. Experimental data shows that this method outperforms the other two methods.

Characterizing L2 Cache Behavior of Programs on Multi-core Processors: Regression Models and Their Transferability	2009 WORLD CONGRESS ON NATURE & BIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED COMPUTING (NABIC 2009)			English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Nature and Biologically Inspired Computing	DEC 09-12, 2009	Coimbatore, INDIA					In this study we investigate the transferability of trained regression models to estimate solo run L2 cache stress of programs running on multi-core processors. We used machine learning to generate the trained regression models. Transferability of a regression model means how useful is a regression model (which is trained on one architecture) to predict the solo run L2 cache stress on another architecture. The statistical methodology to assess model transferability is discussed. We observed that regression models trained on a given L2 cache architecture are reasonably transferable to other L2 cache architecture and vice versa.

They can be obtained by the use of a Particle Image Velocimetry acquisition device, or as the result of a physical simulation, such as a fluid flow simulation, among many examples. This paper proposes to formulate the unstructured vector field reconstruction and approximation through Machine-Learning. The machine learns from the samples a global vector field estimation function that could be evaluated at arbitrary points from the whole domain. Using an adaptation of the Support Vector Regression method for multi-scale analysis, the proposed method provides a global, analytical expression for the reconstructed vector field through an efficient non-linear optimization. Experiments on artificial and real data show a statistically robust behavior of the proposed technique.

Learning Discriminative Appearance-Based Models Using Partial Least Squares	2009 XXII BRAZILIAN SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER GRAPHICS AND IMAGE PROCESSING (SIBGRAPI 2009)	SIBGRAPI - Brazilian Symposium on Computer Graphics and Image Processing		English	Proceedings Paper	22nd Brazilian Symposium on Computer Graphics and Image Processing	OCT 11-15, 2009	Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	Pontifical Catholic Univ Rio de Janeiro, PUC Rio Matematica, UFF Computacao, Petrobras, CNPq, CAPES, FAPERJ, Sociedade Brasileira Computacao, Eurographics				Appearance information is essential for applications such as tracking and people recognition. One of the main problems of using appearance-based discriminative models is the ambiguities among classes when the number of persons being considered increases. To reduce the amount of ambiguity, we propose the use of a rich set of feature descriptors based on color, textures and edges. Another issue regarding appearance modeling is the limited number of training samples available for each appearance. The discriminative models are created using a powerful statistical tool called Partial Least Squares (PLS), responsible for weighting the features according to their discriminative power for each different appearance. The experimental results, based on appearance-based person recognition, demonstrate that the use of an enriched feature set analyzed by PLS reduces the ambiguity among different appearances and provides higher recognition rates when compared to other machine learning techniques.

But major issue to be solved to make this paradigm effective in real world industrial environment is related to the lack of efficiency of agent-based local decision-making approaches employed.

It aims to find two nonnegative matrices whose product can well approximate the nonnegative data matrix, which naturally lead to parts-based representation. In this paper, we present a local learning regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (LLNMF) for clustering. It imposes an additional constraint on NMF that the cluster label of each point can be predicted by the points in its neighborhood. This constraint encodes both the discriminative information and the geometric structure, and is good at clustering data on manifold. An iterative multiplicative updating algorithm is proposed to optimize the objective, and its convergence is guaranteed theoretically. Experiments on many benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms NMF as well as many state of the art clustering methods.

Intuitively, discovering a good feature representation across domains is crucial. In this paper, we propose to find such a representation through a new learning method, transfer component analysis (TCA), for domain adaptation. TCA tries to learn some transfer components across domains in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). In the subspace spanned by these transfer components, data distributions in different domains are close to each other. As a result, with the new representations in this subspace, we can apply standard machine learning methods to train classifiers or regression models in the source domain for use in the target domain. The main contribution of our work is that we propose a novel feature representation in which to perform domain adaptation via a new parametric kernel using feature extraction methods, which can dramatically minimize the distance between domain distributions by projecting data onto the learned transfer components. Furthermore, our approach can handle large datsets and naturally lead to out-of-sample generalization. The effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in are verified by experiments on two real-world applications: cross-domain indoor WiFi localization and cross-domain text classification.

Recently, metric learning for semi-supervised algorithms has received much attention. For semi-supervised clustering, usually a set of pairwise similarity and dissimilarity constraints is provided as supervisory information. Until now, various metric learning methods utilizing pairwise constraints have been proposed. The existing methods that can consider both positive (must-link) and negative (cannot-link) constraints find linear transformations or equivalently global Mahalanobis metrics. Additionally, they find metrics only according to the data points appearing in constraints (without considering other data points). In this paper, we consider the topological structure of data along with both positive and negative constraints. We propose a kernel-based metric learning method that provides a non-linear transformation. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets show the effectiveness of our metric learning method.

In this paper we introduce a novel manifold alignment approach, which differs from "semisupervised alignment" and "Procrustes alignment" in that it does not require predetermining correspondences. Our approach learns a projection that maps data instances (from two different spaces) to a lower dimensional space simultaneously matching the local geometry and preserving the neighborhood relationship within each set. This approach also builds connections between spaces defined by different features and makes direct knowledge transfer possible. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated and validated in a series of carefully designed experiments in information retrieval and bioinformatics.

One of the feasible solution for this problem is transfer learning. It can make use of the labeled data from other domain to discriminate those unlabeled data in the target domain. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning framework based on similarity matrix approximation to tackle such problems. Two practical algorithms are proposed, which are the label propagation and the similarity propagation. In these methods, we build a hybrid graph based on all available data. Then the information is transferred cross domains through alternatively constructing the similarity matrix for different part of the graph. Among all related methods, similarity propagation approach can make maximum use of all available similarity information across domains. This leads to more efficient transfer and better learning result. The experiment on real world text mining applications demonstrates the promise and effectiveness of our algorithms.

While existing Gaussian process models focus on modeling one single relation, we present a generalized GP model, named multi-relational Gaussian process model, that is able to deal with an arbitrary number of relations in a domain of interest. The proposed model is analyzed in the context of bipartite, directed, and undirected univariate relations.

So far, much work has been conducted in solving multiple instance classification and multiple instance regression problems, where supervised training patterns are given as bags and each bag consists of some instances. But the research on unsupervised multiple instance clustering is still limited. This paper formulates a novel Maximum Margin Multiple Instance Clustering (M(3)IC) problem for the multiple instance clustering task. To avoid solving a non-convex optimization problem directly, M(3)IC is further relaxed, which enables an efficient optimization solution with a combination of Constrained Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP) and the Cutting Plane method. Furthermore, this paper analyzes some important properties of the proposed method and the relationship between the proposed method and some other related ones. An extensive set of empirical results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method against existing research for both effectiveness and efficiency.

However, studies have shown that written instructions are difficult to follow, even for experienced users. A system that understands human-written instructions could guide users through the process of following the directions, improving completion rates and enhancing the user experience. While general natural language understanding is extremely difficult, we believe that in the limited domain of how-to instructions it should be possible to understand enough to provide guided help in a mixed-initiative environment. Based on a qualitative analysis of instructions gathered for 43 web-based tasks, we have formalized the problem of understanding and interpreting how-to instructions. We compare three different approaches to interpreting instructions: a keyword-based interpreter, a grammar-based interpreter, and an interpreter based on machine learning and information extraction. Our empirical results demonstrate the feasibility of automated how-to instruction understanding.

These terms spatially correspond to local regions of the images; however, they are attached collectively to groups of images, such that it is unknown which term is assigned to which region of which image in the group. This poses a challenge to the development of the computational method to automate the textual description of expression patterns contained in each image. In this paper, we show that the underlying nature of this task matches well with a new machine learning framework, Multi-Instance Multi-Label learning (MIML). We propose a new MIML support vector machine to solve the problems that beset the annotation task. Empirical study shows that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art Drosophila gene expression pattern annotation methods.

The instructions are segmented on the basis of the actions to be taken, and each segment is labeled with the required action. This flat formulation reduces the problem to a sequential labeling task, to which machine learning methods are applied. We propose an innovative machine learning method for explicitly modeling the actions described in instructions and integrating learning and inference about the physical environment. We obtained a corpus of 840 route instructions that experimenters verified as follow-able, given by people in building navigation situations. Using the four-fold cross validation, our experiments showed that the simulated robot reached the correct destination 88% of the time.

This task, known as textual entailment, offers a natural abstraction for many NLP tasks, and has been recognized as a central tool for the new area of Machine Reading. Important in the study of textual entailment is making precise the sense in which something is implied by text. The operational definition often employed is a subjective one: something is implied if humans are more likely to believe it given the truth of the text, than otherwise. In this work we propose a natural objective definition for textual entailment. Our approach is to view text as a partial depiction of some underlying hidden reality. Reality is mapped into text through a possibly stochastic process, the author of the text. Textual entailment is then formalized as the task of accurately, in a defined sense, recovering information about this hidden reality. We show how existing machine learning work can be applied to this information recovery setting, and discuss the implications for the construction of machines that autonomously engage in textual entailment. We then investigate the role of using multiple inference rules for this task. We establish that such rules cannot be learned and applied in parallel, but that layered learning and reasoning are necessary.

B	Sonntag, D		Boutilier, C		Sonntag, Daniel			Introspection and Adaptable Model Integration for Dialogue-based Question Answering	21ST INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (IJCAI-09), PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	21st Internation Joint Conference on Artifical Intelligence (IJCAI-09)	JUL 11-17, 2009	Pasadena, CA					Dialogue-based Question Answering (QA) is a highly complex task that brings together a QA system including various natural language processing components (i.e., components for question classification, information extraction, and retrieval) with dialogue systems for effective and natural communication. The dialogue-based access is difficult to establish when the QA system in use is complex and combines many different answer services with different quality and access characteristics. For example, some questions are processed by open-domain QA services with a broad coverage. Others should be processed by using a domain-specific instance ontology for more reliable answers. Different answer services may change their characteristics over time and the dialogue reaction models have to be updated according to that. To solve this problem, we developed introspective methods to integrate adaptable models of the answer services. We evaluated the impact of the learned models on the dialogue performance, i.e., whether the adaptable models can be used for a more convenient dialogue formulation process. We show significant effectiveness improvements in the resulting dialogues when using the machine learning (ML) models. Examples are provided in the context of the generation of system-initiative feedback to user questions and answers, as provided by heterogeneous information services.

A common approach to evaluating the robustness of CAPTCHA is the use of machine learning techniques. Critical to this approach is the acquisition of an adequate set of labeled samples, on which the learning techniques are trained. However, such a sample labeling task is difficult for computers, since the strength of CAPTCHAs stems exactly from the difficulty computers have in recognizing either distorted texts or image contents. Therefore, until now, researchers have to manually label their samples, which is tedious and expensive. In this paper, we present Magic Bullet, a computer game that for the first time turns such sample labeling into a fun experience, and that achieves a labeling accuracy of as high as 98% for free. The game leverages human computation to address a task that cannot be easily automated, and it effectively streamlines the evaluation of CAPTCHAs. The game can also be used for other constructive purposes such as 1) developing better machine learning algorithms for handwriting recognition, and 2) training people's typing skills.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the feasibility of using Multi-spectral imaging, especially the near-infrared (NIR) channel (800 nm +/- 10 nm) to find the weeds' fingerprints, and validate the performance with specific eigenvalues by co-occurrence matrix. Veronica polita Pries, Veronica persica Poir, longtube ground ivy, Laminum amplexicaule Linn. were selected in this study, which perform different effect in field, and are alien invasive species in China. 307 weed leaves' images were randomly selected for the calibration set, while the remaining 207 samples for the prediction set. All images were pretreated by Wallis filter to adjust the noise by uneven lighting. Gray level co-occurrence matrix was applied to extract the texture character, which shows density, randomness correlation, contrast and homogeneity of texture with different algorithms. Three channels (green channel by 550 nm +/- 10 nm, red channel by 650 nm 10 nm and NIR channel by 800 nm 10 nm) were respectively calculated to get the eigenvalues. Least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) was applied to discriminate the categories of weeds by the eigenvalues from co-occurrence matrix. Finally, recognition ratio of 83.35% by NIR channel was obtained, better than the results by green channel (76.67%) and red channel (69.46%). The prediction results of 81.35% indicated that the selected eigenvalues reflected the main characteristics of weeds' fingerprint based on multi-spectral (especially by NIR channel) and LS-SVM model.

This kind of cancer has increased its frequency in the last few years and its mortality is around twenty percent if it is not early treated. In order to improve the early diagnosis, the problem characterization using Machine Learning (ML) is crucial to identify melanoma patterns. Therefore we need to organize the data so that we can apply ML on it. This paper presents a detailed characterization based on the most relevant knowledge in melanomas problem and how to relate them to apply Data Mining techniques to aid medical diagnosis in melanoma and improve the research in this field.

Several approaches for deriving satisfactory predictive models from empirical data have been proposed, although none has been massively accepted due to the difficulty of building a generic solution applicable to a considerable number of different software projects. The most common strategy on estimating software metrics is the linear regression statistical technique, for its ease of use and availability in several statistical packages. Linear regression has numerous shortcomings though, which motivated the exploration of many techniques, such as data mining and other machine learning approaches. This paper reports different strategies on software metrics estimation, presenting a case study executed within a large worldwide IT company. Our contributions are the lessons learned during the preparation and execution of the experiments, in order to aid the state of the art on prediction models of software development projects.

Image Segmentation of Cell Nuclei based on Classification in the Color Space	4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	4th European Conference of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering (ECIFMBE)	NOV 23-27, 2008	Antwerp, BELGIUM			microscopy; image segmentation; color spaces; machine learning; statistical classification	PIXEL CLASSIFICATION	Many developments in the field of image processing and analysis have been motivated and driven by applications from microscopy. Unfortunately, today hardly any general applicable set of image processing methods exist to support biomedical experts with a fully or partially automated analysis of micrographs to support and strengthen his experiments. Hence, currently much image analysis and interpretation in this field has to be done manually. Otherwise, a background in image processing is needed to adopt available image analysis tools to the desired task, or to write scripts in image-processing tool-boxes. Thus, using cervical nuclei as a first example, a novel image processing scheme is suggested to bridge the so-called "semantical gap" between the analytical question of the biomedical experts on one side and the required set of image processing procedures on the other. Within this approach, the biomedical expert interactively annotates the background and foreground pixels (nuclei) on a small subset of micrographs of cervical cells. Using this information, the image processing system can now automatically find the most optimal classifier to separate these two sets of pixels in color space. Within this approach machine-learning algorithms, namely K-Nearest Neighbor, KStar, Gaussian Mixture Models, KMeans and Expectation-Maximation have been used and evaluated for the task to separate fore-and background pixels in the color space to yield an automated segmentation approach for cervical nuclei. Thus, the suggested approach is able to "learn" the required segmentation task from the biomedical experts by interactively training the system on a small subset of images. After the self-organization and optimization procedure, the system is capable to apply the learned analysis mechanisms to other micrographs of cervical cells.

An optimization framework for classifier learning from image data for computer-assisted diagnosis	4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	4th European Conference of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering (ECIFMBE)	NOV 23-27, 2008	Antwerp, BELGIUM			Classifier Learning; Computer-Assisted Diagnosis; Medical Image Data		In computer-assisted medical diagnosis it is often hard or even impossible to obtain a valid set of rules for disease classification by classical knowledge engineering methods. Alternatively, machine learning methods are applied to obtain classifiers from sets of data pre-classified by medical experts. Typically in a medical context, available data sets are imbalanced with respect to the possible classifications. E.g., in dermatology, there are only few data representing cases of malign melanoma vs. many cases representing benign nevi. Furthermore, there are different missclassification costs assigned to different classes. E.g., it is much more critical (i.e. costly) to erroneously classify a malign melanoma as benign than the other way around. We propose a universally applicable optimization framework that successfully corrects the error-based inductive bias of classifier learning methods on image data. The framework integrates several techniques of common optimization techniques, such as modifying the optimization procedure for inducer-specific parameters, modifying input data by an arcing algorithm, combining classifiers of several classifier learning methods (kNN, SVM and C4.5) with different settings according to locally-adaptive, cost-sensitive voting schemes. The framework is designed to make the learning process cost-sensitive and enforcing more balanced missclassification costs between classes. The framework was evaluated on image data for Barrett's esophagus with promising results compared to the base learners.

In Mozilla and Eclipse, between 37%-44% of bug reports are "tossed" (reassigned) to other developers, for example because the bug has been assigned by accident or another developer with additional expertise is needed. In any case, tossing increases the time-to-correction for a bug. In this paper, we introduce a graph model based on Markov chains, which captures bug tossing history. This model has several desirable qualities. First, it reveals developer networks which can be used to discover team structures and to find suitable experts for a new task. Second, it helps to better assign developers to bug reports. In our experiments with 445,000 bug reports, our model reduced tossing events, by up to 72%. In addition, the model increased the prediction accuracy by up to 23 percentage points compared to traditional bug triaging approaches.

In order to solve these, we introduce a framework of test case comparison metrics which will quantitatively describe the distance between any arbitrary test case pair of an existing test suite, allowing various test case analysis applications. We combine program profiles from test execution, static analysis and statistical techniques to capture various aspects of test execution and compute a specialized test case distance measurement. Using these distance metrics, we drive a customized hierarchical test suite clustering algorithm that groups similar test cases together. We present an industrial strength framework called SPIRIT that works at binary level, implementing different metrics in the form of coverage, control, data, def-use, temporal variances and does test case clustering. This is step towards integrating runtime analysis, static analysis, statistical techniques and machine learning to drive new generation of test suite analysis algorithms.

It has the potential to reveal more hidden knowledge in data than classification. Cohen, Schapire and Singer were early investigators of this problem. They took a preference-based approach where pairwise preferences were combined into a total ordering. It is however not always possible to have knowledge of pairwise preferences. In this paper we consider a distance-based approach to ordering, where the ordering of alternatives is predicted on the basis of their distances to a query. To learn such an ordering function we consider two orderings: one is the actual ordering and another one is the predicted ordering. We aim to maximise the agreement of the two orderings by varying the parameters of a distance function, resulting in a trained distance function which is taken to be the ordering function. We evaluated this work by comparing the trained distance and the untrained distance in all experiment on public data. Results show that the trained distance leads in general to a higher degree of agreement than untrained distance.

A model that can accurately describe the secondary structure of a noncoding RNA faamily is crucial to the search accuracy of genome annotation. In this paper we develop a novel machine learning approach that can capture the crucial structure features of a noncoding RNA family and estimate the parameters in its secondary structure Model. One advantage of this approach is that these estimated parameters contain structure features that are generally missing in the conventional Covariance Model (CM). Our experiments showed that compared with the conventional CM, structure models obtained with our approach can provide a more accurate description of the secondary structure in a noncoding RNA family and thus significantly improve the accuracy of genome annotation.

Important applications can be centered around these data like, for example, recognition of specific patterns, pattern similarity, detecting anomalies, and clustering and classification of patterns. We study and evaluate a number of classification techniques for process control data. For pattern similarity, we examine distance measure with raw data and with new feature extracted from the data. The evaluation is conducted with common benchmark process control data for time series process variables. This paper shows that data mining and machine learning can be extremely beneficial in acquiring and producing knowledge and discoveries form process data to benefit the industry.	[Nasr, Emad S.

By exhaustive search of NCBI GenBank database based on the information in Peptide Cutter website, we have identified a protein very likely to control apoptosis after N-myristoylation which is caused by the cleavage by caspase-8. To find more rules for sequences cleaved by caspase enzymes, we conducted computational experiments using the machine learning system BONSAI, and extracted some characteristic sequences involving serine-threonine kinase motif. This suggests the new possibility that the machine learning technique finds the significant sequence such as the recognition site of the enzyme.

According to their differential orders for the dynamic system, the input and output variables were allocated into multiple calculational subspaces. Taking advantage of its nonlinear regression performance, each subspace was represented by the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) to map the influence of the output on the input with a certain differential order. To connect subspaces with differential orders, a synthetic LS-SVM was then delivered to embody the dynamic characteristic of all sub-networks to the inverse model. At last a simulation system was put forward to validate the feasibility of proposed method. The result shows that presented method has clear dynamic structure, which is effective for the inverse dynamic system identification.

However, in the last decades industry and academia have been paying increasing attention to another metric to evaluate servers: availability. A web server may serve many users when running, but if it is out of service too much time, it becomes useless and expensive. The industry has adopted several techniques to improve system availability, yet crashes still happen. In this paper, we propose a new framework to predict time-to-failure when the system is suffering transient failures that consume resources randomly. We study which machine learning algorithms build a more accurate model of the behavior of the anomaly system, and focus on Linear Regression and Decision Tree algorithms. Our preliminary results show that M5P (a Decision Tree algorithm) is the best option to model the behavior of the system under the random injection of memory leaks.

This paper presents the adoption of artificial neural network (ANN) model and Unascertained system to assist decision-makers in evaluating the quality of construction projects in China. Artificial neural network (ANN) has outstanding characteristics in machine learning, fault, tolerant, parallel reasoning and processing nonlinear problem abilities. Unascertained system that imitates the human brain's thinking logical is a kind of mathematical tools used to deal with imprecise and uncertain knowledge. Integrating unascertained method with neural network technology, the reasoning process of network coding can be tracked, and the output of the network can be given a physical explanation. The experimental result of this approach is that it does not rely on the experience of experts and it can improve the validity and the precision of evaluation. Therefore, it can reflect the quality status of construction project.

Pitch and Energy related acoustic features are derived from statistic methods, and we consider context influences to pitch and energy related features. Models of pitch accent (accent and unaccented) are built at the syllable level. At the same time, we compare support vector machine (SVM) to predict pitch accent at same experiment conditions. Results showed that in all experiments ensemble machine learning achieved improved performance. The best result obtained using ensemble machine learning is 82.60% accuracy to mandarin read speech.

In this paper, a new letter-to-phoneme conversion approach is proposed; it is automatic, simple, portable and efficient. It relies on a machine learning technique initially developed for transliteration and translation; the system infers rewriting rules from examples of words with their phonetic representations. This approach is evaluated in the framework of the Pronalsyl Pascal challenge, which includes several datasets on different languages. The obtained results equal or outperform those of the best known systems.

Our proposed architecture takes into account the fact that GRID frameworks and their modules are not easy to modify or re-implement. It is therefore our aim to provide a plug-in which can be easily added to existing frameworks, thus avoiding significant and time-consuming modifications. Furthermore, we assume that existing scheduling algorithm in the framework should not be completely overridden, but rather modified only if there are chances, based on historical data, that the modification will yield abetter result. Finally, we focus on use of off-the-shelf simple machine learning methods in a black-box manner with internal parameter optimization. We present three experiments within a simulated environment, performed with synthetic data aimed at congestion of the system. The results show that improvements over the simple scheduling algorithms can be made.

Most symbolic learning systems face difficulties when discovering knowledge from large databases. Adapting the learning systems to cope with large databases is the traditional solution to overcome these limitations. This paper evaluates a new methodology for partitioning the representation space. The method selects an irrelevant attribute, determined by a utility function, to partition the representation space. Since irrelevant attributes are not needed to describe concepts learned from the original data, the knowledge discovered from all subspaces should be independent of such an attribute. If the representation space is partitioned by a relevant attribute, the knowledge discovered from all subspaces are combined simply using information about that attribute. The method is analyzed using C5 learning system, or See5.

The most general method uses neural networks to classify emotion by using speech and face image data for human's emotion recognition. But high-dimension and large size of this data cause low-speed learning of neural network. The main idea of the proposed method is to suggest emotion engine and to express emotion by hybrid system composed of bacterial foraging and multi-agent system. Experimental result shows that this method can achieve better performance for human's emotion recognition than others and express emotion.			kimdh@hanbat.ac.kr; sbnair@iitg.ernet.in					Ambastha M, 2005, INT J INTELL SYST, V20, P523, DOI 10.1002/int.20079; Bernon C., 2006, Informatica, V30; ESSA I, 1995, INT C COMP VIS; KIM DH, 2006, THESIS TIT TOKYO; LIN D, 1999, INT C NEUR INF PROC; NAIR SB, 2009, DYNAMIC EMOTIONAL MO; Yoshitomi Y., 2000, IEEE INT WORKSH ROB	7	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA		978-1-4244-4477-9				2009							13	17				5	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BMY64	WOS:000273929400003

Until recent days, the model using regression analysis based on statistical algorithm has been used. However, Machine learning is more being investigated now. This paper estimates the software cost using SVR (Support Vector Regression), a sort of machine learning technique. It, also, finds the best set of parameters applying immune algorithm.

Commonly, the offline analysis is performed in a subjective and time-consuming manner via slow-motion playback. In this study an objective method for overcoming this drawback is presented being based on Phonovibrogram (PVG) images. For a set of normal voices and subjects suffering from vocal fold paralysis or functional dysphonia the laryngeal dynamics were captured by specialized Phonovibrogram features and classified using a support vector machine (SVM). In case of functional voice disorders a mean classification accuracy of 78.5% was obtained while in vocal fold paralysis a classification accuracy of up to 93% could be obtained. The classification results show that the PVG features hold a lot of promise in supporting diagnosis of voice pathologies even in case of muscle tension dysphonia.

The scaling coefficient in the PLV algorithm plays a key role in reducing the effects of noise, thereby improving the precision of the clustering results. However, the optimal value of the scaling parameter varies depending on the population type of dataset. Accordingly, the current study proposes an evaluation method for evaluating suitable values of the scaling parameter. The relative comparison of each method is then examined by conducting PLV clustering trials using datasets comprising data of different types and patterns.

K-Means Clustering using Max-min Distance Measure	2009 ANNUAL MEETING OF THE NORTH AMERICAN FUZZY INFORMATION PROCESSING SOCIETY			English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the North-American-Fuzzy-Information-Processing-Society	JUN 14-17, 2009	Cincinnati, OH			Clustering; Euclidean distance; K-Means algorithm; Max-min distance	ALGORITHM	The cluster analysis deals with the problems of organization of a collection of data objects into clusters based on similarity. It is also known as the unsupervised classification of objects and has found many applications in different areas. An important component of a clustering algorithm is the distance measure which is used to find the similarity between data objects. K-means is one of the most popular and widespread partitioning clustering algorithms due to its superior scalability and efficiency. Typically, the K-means algorithm determines the distance between an object and its cluster centroid by Euclidean distance measure. This paper proposes a variant of K-means which uses an alternate distance measure namely, Max-min measure. The modified K-means algorithm is tested with six benchmark datasets taken from UCI machine learning data repository and found that the proposed algorithm takes less number of iterations to converge than the existing one with improved performance.

The novel software partitioning scheme in combination with an adaptive mounting order is proposed in this paper is a self adaptive mechanism applicable to embedded infotainment devices in general. A new breed of home entertainment and low end computing devices with local processing power like Set Top Box (STB) with PC like features, Thin-clients, Telemedicine client, and others are in vogue with growing sizes of external flash storage devices. It is always observed that a considerable amount of time is contributed to mount the external flash storage device, within the total time required from boot up to first user application. Measurement shows that the adaptive mounting order improves the initial user experience by 25% in an 80MB NAND Flash (50% improvement in mount time), which will theoretically scale up for an application software with larger footprint.

Since manually annotated domain data is rarely available, it is restricted to apply machine learning approaches in the work. We propose a method based on maximum entropy model for recognizing the phrase, in which domain knowledge is integrated into the statistical method to improve the classifier. For introducing various features into maximum entropy model, the phrases are analyzed from the point of view of language. N-grams method is used and head-word is drawn out as a feature. Analyzing the lexical spectrum of the phrases structure, we utilize the clue that some words can be mapped to human anatomy concepts and related words. In another aspect, when the phrases are expressed, there are some word collocations even if the), could not appear in direct co-occurrence relations. They form trigger-pairs, which can be used as features. With a hierarchical framework, anatomy taxonomy is used as a kind of priori lexical feature. Utilizing the information from attributes of anatomy objects and the information around the right boundaries of the phrases, trigger-pair mechanisms are integrated to maximum entropy model. The experiment shows that the methods can provide a new line to recognize disease named phrase.

We rely on recently produced experimental data on genome-wide maps of chromatin state to derive computational models delineating the hidden patterns of post-translational modifications. We use support vector machines to model and predict post-translational modification state of the histones using a diverse set of features. The classification results on the human CD-4+ T-cells by five-fold cross-validation show promising results.

Identification and Detection of Electricity Customer Behaviour Irregularities	2009 IEEE/PES POWER SYSTEMS CONFERENCE AND EXPOSITION, VOLS 1-3			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition	MAR 15-18, 2009	Seattle, WA	IEEE, PES		Classification Techniques; Extreme Machine Learning (ELM); Non-Technical Losses (NTL); Support Vector Machine (SVM)	LOAD PROFILES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; FRAUD DETECTION; TIME-SERIES; SYSTEM; CONSUMERS; CLASSIFICATION; FRAMEWORK; THEFT	The present case study focusing on TNB, Malaysia's largest power utility, concentrates on load profiles as manifestations of customer behaviour. The main objective here is to base the investigation on comparing the efficacy of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique with the newly emerging techniques of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and its OS-ELM variant as means of classification and prediction in this context. Non-technical losses (NTL) represent a significant proportion of electricity losses in both developing and developed countries. The ELM-based approach presented here uses customer load-profile information to expose abnormal behaviour that is known to be highly correlated with NTL activities. This approach provides a method of data mining for this purpose and it involves extracting patterns of customer behaviour from historical kWh consumption data. The results yield classification classes that are used to reveal whether any significant behaviour that emerges are due to irregularities in consumption. In this paper, ELM and online sequential-ELM (OS-ELM) algorithms are both used to achieve an improved classification performance and to increase accuracy of results. A comparison of this approach with other classification techniques, such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, is also undertaken and the ELM performance and accuracy in NTL analysis is shown to be superior.

Communication faults in any stage of these control networks can cause delays or even shutdown of the entire manufacturing process. The current process of detecting and diagnosing communication faults is mostly manual, cumbersome, and inefficient. Detecting early symptoms of potential problems is very important but automated solutions do not yet exist. Our research goal is to automate the process of detecting and diagnosing the communication faults as well as to prevent problems by detecting early symptoms of potential problems. To achieve our goal, we have first investigated real-world fault cases and summarized control network failures. We have also defined network metrics and their alarm conditions to detect early symptoms for communication failures between process control servers and devices. In particular, we leverage data mining techniques to train the system to learn the rules of network faults in control networks and our testing results show that these rules are very effective. In our earlier work, we presented a design of a process control network monitoring and fault diagnosis system. In this paper, we focus on how the fault detection part of this system can be improved using data mining techniques.			fates@postech.ac.kr; yjwon@postech.ac.kr; hwanjoyu@postech.ac.kr; jwkhong@postech.ac.kr; vishnu4@posco.co.kr; jangjin21@posco.co.kr					ASHRAE, 1995, 1351995 ASHRAE ANSI; Cristianini N., 2000, INTRO SUPPORT VECTOR; DENIS F, 1998, PAC LEARNING POSITIV; Dickerson JE, 2000, PEACHFUZZ 2000 : 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE NORTH AMERICAN FUZZY INFORMATION PROCESSING SOCIETY - NAFIPS, P301, DOI 10.1109/NAFIPS.2000.877441; Frank J., 1994, P 17 NAT COMP SEC C; Han Jiawei, 2006, DATA MINING CONCEPT; Han SH, 2002, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V2506, P16; LIAN FL, 2001, IEEE CONTROL SYSTEM, V117, P641; Lippmann R.P., 2000, P DARPA INF SURV C E, V2, P12; Mukkamala S., 2003, INT J DIGITAL EVIDEN, V1, P1; Okabe N., 2005, Proceedings.

The evaluation of the quality of construction is a typical multi-index evaluation. As practiced today, construction quality assessment and prediction generally relies on experts' intuitive experience. It offers significant support in terms of organizing, classifying, and summarizing data. Scientific methods should be developed and employed during project planning and design stages in order to raise quality estimate and prediction accuracy. This paper applies fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) models and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) which has outstanding characteristics in machine learning, fault, tolerant, parallel reasoning and processing nonlinear problem abilities in assessment of quality of construction project. It is demonstrated through this case study that it can serve the purpose of improving the performance of a neural network in the assessment of construction project quality.

Many Current machine learning paradigms used for this purpose, however, result in opaque models that are difficult, if not impossible to analyse, which is an impediment in safety-critical applications or application scenarios where humans and robots occupy the same workspace. In experiments with a Magellan Pro mobile robot we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain transparent models of sensor-motor Couplings that are amenable to subsequent analysis, and flow such analysis can be used to refine and tune the models post hoc.

Subtypes in data that includes patients and controls could be associated with patient/control could associate with patient/control groupings. Testing for subtypes provides a non-parametric investigation of group differences. Cortical thickness maps, generated from magnetic resonance images of 96 patients with schizophrenia and 106 controls, were co-registered and corrected for age-related thinning. At multiple map locations, the number of (sub)types best explaining cortical thickness in the patients, the controls, and both combined was determined. Grey matter volumes of selected regions were measured. Both patients and controls, considered independently, were predominantly homogeneous in cortical thickness. The few bimodal regions were similar in both groups. The combined subjects' cortical thickness was bimodal over 34% of the cortical mantle and otherwise unimodal. Further probing of these bimodal regions showed that subjects tending to belong to thinner modes were significantly more likely to be patients, and grey matter volumes of most bimodal regions were significantly smaller in patients. The study found no subtypes specific to patients. It suggested, however, that associations between abnormally thin cortex and schizophrenia are more widespread than shown by previously published results based on significance testing.

Counting subsequences under various constraints has become relevant to biological sequence analysis, to machine learning, to coding theory, to the analysis of categorical time series in the social sciences, and to the theory of word complexity. We present theorems that lead to efficient dynamic programming algorithms to count (1) distinct subsequences in a string, (2) distinct common subsequences of two strings, (3) matching joint embeddings in two strings, (4) distinct subsequences with a given minimum span, and (5) sequences generated by a string allowing characters to come in runs of a length that is bounded from above.

The ability to perform accurate, high-throughput identification of physiologically active miR targets would enable functional characterization of individual miRs. Current target prediction methods include traditional approaches that are based on specific base-pairing rules in the miR's seed region and implementation of cross-species conservation of the target site, and machine learning (ML) methods that explore patterns that contrast true and false miR-mRNA duplexes. However, in the case of the traditional methods research shows that some seed region matches that are conserved are false positives and that some of the experimentally validated target sites are not conserved. Results: We present HuMiTar, a computational method for identifying common targets of miRs, which is based on a scoring function that considers base-pairing for both seed and non-seed positions for human miR-mRNA duplexes. Our design shows that certain non-seed miR nucleotides, such as 14, 18, 13, 11, and 17, are characterized by a strong bias towards formation of Watson-Crick pairing. We contrasted HuMiTar with several representative competing methods on two sets of human miR targets and a set of ten glioblastoma oncogenes. Comparison with the two best performing traditional methods, PicTar and TargetScanS, and a representative ML method that considers the non-seed positions, NBmiRTar, shows that HuMiTar predictions include majority of the predictions of the other three methods. At the same time, the proposed method is also capable of finding more true positive targets as a trade-off for an increased number of predictions. Genome-wide predictions show that the proposed method is characterized by 1.99 signal-to-noise ratio and linear, with respect to the length of the mRNA sequence, computational complexity. The ROC analysis shows that HuMiTar obtains results comparable with PicTar, which are characterized by high true positive rates that are coupled with moderate values of false positive rates. Conclusion: The proposed HuMiTar method constitutes a step towards providing an efficient model for studying translational gene regulation by miRs.

J	Bordner, AJ				Bordner, Andrew J.			Predicting small ligand binding sites in proteins using backbone structure	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; FOLD; ZINC; CLASSIFICATION; INTERFACES; RESOLUTION; RESIDUES; SEQUENCE; MODELS; IONS	Motivation: Specific non-covalent binding of metal ions and ligands, such as nucleotides and cofactors, is essential for the function of many proteins. Computational methods are useful for predicting the location of such binding sites when experimental information is lacking. Methods that use structural information, when available, are particularly promising since they can potentially identify non-contiguous binding motifs that cannot be found using only the amino acid sequence. Furthermore, a prediction method that can utilize low-resolution models is advantageous because high-resolution structures are available for only a relatively small fraction of proteins. Results: SitePredict is a machine learning-based method for predicting binding sites in protein structures for specific metal ions or small molecules. The method uses Random Forest classifiers trained on diverse residue-based site properties including spatial clustering of residue types and evolutionary conservation. SitePredict was tested by cross-validation on a set of known binding sites for six different metal ions and five different small molecules in a non-redundant set of protein-ligand complex structures. The prediction performance was good for all ligands considered, as reflected by AUC values of at least 0.8. Furthermore, a more realistic test on unbound structures showed only a slight decrease in the accuracy. The properties that contribute the most to the prediction accuracy of each ligand were also examined. Finally, examples of predicted binding sites in homology models and uncharacterized proteins are discussed.

Estimation of suspended sediment concentration and yield using linear models, random forests and quantile regression forests	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						suspended sediment concentration; sediment rating curve; generalized linear model; Random Forests; Quantile Regression Forests	NEURAL-NETWORK; RATING CURVES; FUZZY-LOGIC; PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; DISCHARGE; RIVERS; TREES; BASIN; LOADS	For sediment yield estimation, intermittent measurements of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) have to be interpolated to derive a Continuous sedigraph. Traditionally, sediment rating Curves (SRCs) based Oil univariate linear regression of discharge and SSC (or the logarithms thereof) are used but alternative approaches (e.g. fuzzy logic. artificial neural networks, etc.) exist. This paper presents a comparison of the applicability of traditional SRCs. generalized linear models (GLMs) and nonparametric regression using Random Forests (RF) and Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) applied to a dataset of SSC obtained for four subcatchments (0.08, 41, 145 and 445 km(2)) in the Central Spanish Pyrenees. The observed SSCs are highly variable and range over six orders of magnitude. For these data, traditional SRCs performed inadequately due to the over-simplification of relating SSC solely to discharge. Instead, the multitude of acting processes required more flexibility to model these nonlinear relationships. Thus, alternative advanced machine learning techniques that have been successfully applied ill other disciplines were tested. GLMs provide the option of including other relevant process variables (e.g. rainfall intensities and temporal information) but require the selection of the most appropriate predictors. For the given datasets, the investigated variable selection methods produced inconsistent results. All proposed GLMs showed an interior performance, whereas RF and QRF proved to be very robust and performed favourably for reproducing sediment dynamics. QRF additionally provides estimates oil the accuracy of the predictions and thus allows the assessment of uncertainties in the estimated sediment yield that is not commonly found in other methods. The capabilities of RF and QRF concerning the interpretation of predictor effects are also Outlined. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The role of environmental context in mapping invasive plants with hyperspectral image data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						HyMap; Hyperspectral imaging; Invasive plant species; Lepidium latifolium; Mixture tuned matched filtering (MTMF); Perennial pepperweed; Remote sensing; Weed mapping	LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; PEPPERWEED LEPIDIUM-LATIFOLIUM; MACHINE-LEARNING ALGORITHMS; KNAPWEED CENTAUREA-MACULOSA; REMOTELY-SENSED DATA; AVIRIS DATA; SPECTRAL DISCRIMINATION; FOREST VEGETATION; WATER INDEX; CALIFORNIA	Lepidium latifolium (perennial pepperweed) is a noxious Eurasian weed invading riparian and wetland areas of the western US. Effective management of Lepidium requires detailed, accurate maps of its distribution, as may be provided by remote sensing, to contain existing infestations and eradicate incipient populations. We mapped Lepidium with 3 m spatial resolution, 128-band HyMap image data in three sites of California's San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (Rush Ranch in Suisun Marsh and the Greater Jepson Prairie Ecosystem and the Cosumnes River Preserve in the Delta). These sites are markedly different in terms of hydrology, salinity, species composition, and structural and landscape diversity. Aggregated classification and regression tree models (CART), incorporating the results of mixture tuned matched filter (MTMF) analyses and spectral physiological indexes, were used to map Lepidium at the three sites. This approach was sufficiently flexible and robust to detect Lepidium with similar accuracies (similar to 90%) at both Rush Ranch and Jepson Prairie, but was unsuccessful at Cosumnes River Preserve. Comparisons of the behavior of the MTMFs and the CARTs between sites reveal the importance of environmental context in species mapping. Rush Ranch presents the simplest conditions for mapping Lepidium: it is the wettest and least diverse site and Lepidium is spectrally distinct from co-occurring species. At Jepson Prairie, several co-occurring species closely resemble Lepidium spectrally. Nevertheless, hyperspectral data provide sufficient spectral detail to resolve Lepidium even at this challenging site, which is facilitated by phenological separation from the matrix of annual grasses. At Cosumnes River Preserve, however, Lepidium is neither spectrally nor phenologically distinct, and consequently could not be mapped successfully. Evidence suggests that the success of a remote sensing analysis declines as site complexity increases (species, structural, and landscape diversity; spectral variability; etc.), although this relationship is complex, indirect, and may be phenology-dependent.

The completion of the human genome revealed a large number of putative GPCRs. However, the identification of their natural ligands, and especially peptides, suffers from low discovery rates, thus impeding development of therapeutics based on these potential drug targets. We describe the discovery of novel GPCR ligands encrypted in the human proteome. Hundreds of potential peptide ligands were predicted by machine learning algorithms. In vitro screening of selected 33 peptides on a set of 152 GPCRs, including a group of designated orphan receptors, was conducted by intracellular calcium measurements and cAMP assays. The screening revealed eight novel peptides as potential agonists that specifically activated six different receptors in a dose-dependent manner. Most of the peptides showed distinct stimulatory patterns targeted at designated and orphan GPCRs. Further analysis demonstrated a significant in vivo effect for one of the peptides in a mouse inflammation model.

Most analyses of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data begin with an enzymatic digestion of a complex protein mixture to generate smaller peptides that can be separated and identified by an MS/MS instrument. Peptide spectral counting techniques attempt to quantify protein abundance by counting the number of detected tryptic peptides and their corresponding MS spectra. However, spectral counting is confounded by the fact that peptide physicochemical properties severely affect MS detection resulting in each peptide having a different detection probability. Lu et al. (2007) described a modified spectral counting technique, Absolute Protein Expression (APEX), which improves on basic spectral counting methods by including a correction factor for each protein (called O(i) value) that accounts for variable peptide detection by MS techniques. The technique uses machine learning classification to derive peptide detection probabilities that are used to predict the number of tryptic peptides expected to be detected for one molecule of a particular protein (O(i)). This predicted spectral count is compared to the protein's observed MS total spectral count during APEX computation of protein abundances. Results: The APEX Quantitative Proteomics Tool, introduced here, is a free open source Java application that supports the APEX protein quantitation technique. The APEX tool uses data from standard tandem mass spectrometry proteomics experiments and provides computational support for APEX protein abundance quantitation through a set of graphical user interfaces that partition thparameter controls for the various processing tasks. The tool also provides a Z-score analysis for identification of significant differential protein expression, a utility to assess APEX classifier performance via cross validation, and a utility to merge multiple APEX results into a standardized format in preparation for further statistical analysis. Conclusion: The APEX Quantitative Proteomics Tool provides a simple means to quickly derive hundreds to thousands of protein abundance values from standard liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry proteomics datasets. The APEX tool provides a straightforward intuitive interface design overlaying a highly customizable computational workflow to produce protein abundance values from LC-MS/MS datasets.

This lentivirus uses the CD4 receptor in conjunction with a chemokine coreceptor, either CXCR4 or CCR5, to enter a target cell. HIV-1 is characterized by high sequence variability. Nonetheless, within this extensive variability, certain features must be conserved to define functions and phenotypes. The determination of coreceptor usage of HIV-1, from its protein envelope sequence, falls into a well-studied machine learning problem known as classification. The support vector machine (SVM), with string kernels, has proven to be very efficient for dealing with a wide class of classification problems ranging from text categorization to protein homology detection. In this paper, we investigate how the SVM can predict HIV-1 coreceptor usage when it is equipped with an appropriate string kernel. Results: Three string kernels were compared. Accuracies of 96.35% (CCR5) 94.80% (CXCR4) and 95.15% (CCR5 and CXCR4) were achieved with the SVM equipped with the distant segments kernel on a test set of 1425 examples with a classifier built on a training set of 1425 examples. Our datasets are built with Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV Databases sequences. A web server is available at http://genome.ulaval.ca/hiv- dskernel. Conclusion: We examined string kernels that have been used successfully for protein homology detection and propose a new one that we call the distant segments kernel. We also show how to extract the most relevant features for HIV-1 coreceptor usage. The SVM with the distant segments kernel is currently the best method described.

Search programs compare fragmentation spectra (MS/MS) of peptides from complex digests with theoretically derived spectra from a database of protein sequences. Improved discrimination is achieved with theoretical spectra that are based on simulating gas phase chemistry of the peptides, but the limited understanding of those processes affects the accuracy of predictions from theoretical spectra. Results: We employed a robust data mining strategy using new feature annotation functions of MAE software, which revealed under-prediction of the frequency of occurrence in fragmentation of the second peptide bond. We applied methods of exploratory data analysis to pre-process the information in the MS/MS spectra, including data normalization and attribute selection, to reduce the attributes to a smaller, less correlated set for machine learning studies. We then compared our rule building machine learning program, DataSqueezer, with commonly used association rules and decision tree algorithms. All used machine learning algorithms produced similar results that were consistent with expected properties for a second gas phase mechanism at the second peptide bond. Conclusion: The results provide compelling evidence that we have identified underlying chemical properties in the data that suggest the existence of an additional gas phase mechanism for the second peptide bond. Thus, the methods described in this study provide a valuable approach for analyses of this kind in the future.

Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives on Meta-Learning for Algorithm Selection	ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS			English	Article						Algorithms; Performance; Algorithm selection; meta-learning; classification; forecasting; constraint satisfaction; combinatorial optimization; sorting; dataset characterization; model selection; empirical hardness; landscape analysis	PROBLEM INSTANCES; CLASSIFICATION; TIME; HARDNESS; OPTIMIZATION; COMPLEXITY; ACCURACY; MODELS; SAT	The algorithm selection problem [Rice 1976] seeks to answer the question: Which algorithm is likely to perform best for my problem? Recognizing the problem as a learning task in the early 1990's, the machine learning community has developed the field of meta-learning, focused on learning about learning algorithm performance on classification problems. But there has been only limited generalization of these ideas beyond classification, and many related attempts have been made in other disciplines (such as AI and operations research) to tackle the algorithm selection problem in different ways, introducing different terminology, and overlooking the similarities of approaches. In this sense, there is much to be gained from a greater awareness of developments in meta-learning, and how these ideas can be generalized to learn about the behaviors of other (nonlearning) algorithms. In this article we present a unified framework for considering the algorithm selection problem as a learning problem, and use this framework to tie together the crossdisciplinary developments in tackling the algorithm selection problem. We discuss the generalization of meta-learning concepts to algorithms focused on tasks including sorting, forecasting, constraint satisfaction, and optimization, and the extension of these ideas to bioinformatics, cryptography, and other fields.

J	Liu, R; Freund, Y; Spraggon, G				Liu, Roy; Freund, Yoav; Spraggon, Glen			Image-based crystal detection: a machine-learning approach	ACTA CRYSTALLOGRAPHICA SECTION D-BIOLOGICAL CRYSTALLOGRAPHY			English	Article							THERMOTOGA-MARITIMA PROTEOME; STRUCTURAL GENOMICS; AUTOMATED CLASSIFICATION; CRYSTALLIZATION; WAVELETS; TEXTURE	The ability of computers to learn from and annotate large databases of crystallization-trial images provides not only the ability to reduce the workload of crystallization studies, but also an opportunity to annotate crystallization trials as part of a framework for improving screening methods. Here, a system is presented that scores sets of images based on the likelihood of containing crystalline material as perceived by a machine-learning algorithm. The system can be incorporated into existing crystallization-analysis pipelines, whereby specialists examine images as they normally would with the exception that the images appear in rank order according to a simple real-valued score. Promising results are shown for 319 112 images associated with 150 structures solved by the Joint Center for Structural Genomics pipeline during the 2006-2007 year. Overall, the algorithm achieves a mean receiver operating characteristic score of 0.919 and a 78% reduction in human effort per set when considering an absolute score cutoff for screening images, while incurring a loss of five out of 150 structures.

We start by defining the main notions of constraint programming and then give various concepts of soft constraints and show how they can be used to model quantitative preferences. We then consider how soft constraints can be adopted to handle other forms of preferences, such as bipolar, qualitative, and temporal preferences. Finally, we describe how AI techniques such as abstraction, explanation generation, machine learning, and preference elicitation can be useful in modeling and solving soft constraints.

J	Nadler, B				Nadler, Boaz			FINITE SAMPLE APPROXIMATION RESULTS FOR PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS: A MATRIX PERTURBATION APPROACH	ANNALS OF STATISTICS			English	Article						Principal component analysis; spiked covariance model; random matrix theory; matrix perturbation; phase transition	DIMENSIONAL RANDOM MATRICES; COVARIANCE MATRICES; LARGEST EIGENVALUE; EMPIRICAL DISTRIBUTION; ROOTS; MODEL	Principal component analysis (PCA) is a standard tool for dimensional reduction of a set of n observations (samples), each with p variables. In this paper, using a matrix perturbation approach, we study the nonasymptotic relation between the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of PCA computed on a finite sample of size n, and those of the limiting population PCA as n -> infinity. As in machine learning, we present a finite sample theorem which holds with high probability for the closeness between the leading eigenvalue and eigenvector of sample PCA and population PCA under a spiked covariance model. In addition, we also consider the relation between finite sample PCA and the asymptotic results in the joint limit p, n -> infinity, with p/n = c. We present a matrix perturbation view of the "phase transition phenomenon," and a simple linear-algebra based derivation of the eigenvalue and eigenvector overlap in this asymptotic limit. Moreover, our analysis also applies for finite p, n where we show that although there is no sharp phase transition as in the infinite case, either as a function of noise level or as a function of sample size n, the eigenvector of sample PICA may exhibit a sharp "loss of tracking," suddenly losing its relation to the (true) eigenvector of the population PCA matrix. This occurs due to a crossover between the eigenvalue due to the signal and the largest eigenvalue due to noise, whose eigenvector points in a random direction.

J	Bosnic, Z; Kononenko, I				Bosnic, Zoran; Kononenko, Igor			Estimation of individual prediction reliability using the local sensitivity analysis	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								For a given prediction model, some predictions may be reliable while others may be unreliable. The average accuracy of the system cannot provide the reliability estimate for a single particular prediction. The measure of individual prediction reliability can be important information in risk-sensitive applications of machine learning (e.g. medicine, engineering, business). We define empirical measures for estimation of prediction accuracy in regression. Presented measures are based on sensitivity analysis of regression models. They estimate reliability for each individual regression prediction in contrast to the average prediction reliability of the given regression model. We study the empirical sensitivity properties of five regression models (linear regression, locally weighted regression, regression trees, neural networks, and support vector machines) and the relation between reliability measures and distribution of learning examples with prediction errors for all five regression models. We show that the suggested methodology is appropriate only for the three studied models: regression trees, neural networks, and support vector machines, and test the proposed estimates with these three models. The results of our experiments on 48 data sets indicate significant correlations of the proposed measures with the prediction error.

As a technique for context mining, we have developed an algorithm called CANSY. It adopts trained neural networks for feature weighting and a value difference metric in order to measure distances between all possible values of symbolic features. CANSY plays a core role in classifying and presenting most similar cases from a case base. Experimental results show that CANSY along with a rule base can provide personalized information with a relatively high level of accuracy, and it is capable of recommending appropriate products or services.

A review on the combination of binary classifiers in multiclass problems	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						Machine learning; Supervised learning; Multiclass classification	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CORRECTING OUTPUT CODES; CLASSIFICATION; DESIGN; RECOGNITION	Several real problems involve the classification of data into categories or classes. Given a data set containing data whose classes are known, Machine Learning algorithms can be employed for the induction of a classifier able to predict the class of new data from the same domain, performing the desired discrimination. Some learning techniques are originally conceived for the solution of problems with only two classes, also named binary classification problems. However, many problems require the discrimination of examples into more than two categories or classes. This paper presents a survey on the main strategies for the generalization of binary classifiers to problems with more than two classes, known as multiclass classification problems. The focus is on strategies that decompose the original multiclass problem into multiple binary subtasks, whose outputs are combined to obtain the final prediction.

J	Fernandez, F; Isasi, P				Fernandez, Fernando; Isasi, Pedro			Nearest prototype classification of noisy data	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						Nearest prototype classification; Evolutionary learning; Machine learning	LEARNING ALGORITHMS; CLASSIFIERS	Nearest prototype approaches offer a common way to design classifiers. However, when data is noisy, the success of this sort of classifiers depends on some parameters that the designer needs to tune, as the number of prototypes. In this work, we have made a study of the ENPC technique, based on the nearest prototype approach, in noisy datasets. Previous experimentation of this algorithm had shown that it does not require any parameter tuning to obtain good solutions in problems where class limits are well defined, and data is not noisy. In this work, we show that the algorithm is able to obtain solutions with high classification success even when data is noisy. A comparison with optimal (hand made) solutions and other different classification algorithms demonstrates the good performance of the ENPC algorithm in accuracy and number of prototypes as the noise level increases. We have performed experiments in four different datasets, each of them with different characteristics.

J	London, N; Schueler-Furman, O				London, Nir; Schueler-Furman, Ora			FunHunt: model selection based on energy landscape characteristics	BIOCHEMICAL SOCIETY TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						energy funnels; energy landscape; high-resolution modelling; model selection; protein-protein docking; Rosetta	PROTEIN-PROTEIN DOCKING; STRUCTURE PREDICTION; PROGRESS; CONSURF; MINIMA; CAPRI	Protein folding and binding is commonly depicted as a search for the minimum energy conformation in a vast energy landscape. indeed, modelling of protein complex structures by RosettaDock often results in a set of low-energy conformations near the native structure. Ensembles of low-energy conformations can appear, however, in other regions of the energy landscape, especially when backbone movements occur upon binding. What then characterizes the energy landscape near the correct orientation? we have applied a machine learning algorithm to distinguish ensembles of low-energy conformations around the native conformation from other low-energy ensembles. FunHunt, the resulting classifier, identified the native orientation for 50/52 protein complexes in a test set, and for all of 12 recent CAPRI targets. FunHunt is also able to choose the near-native orientation among models created by algorithms other than RosettaDock, demonstrating its general applicability for model selection. The features used by FunHunt teach us about the nature of native interfaces. Remarkably, the energy decrease of trajectories toward near-native orientations is significantly larger than for other orientations. This provides a possible explanation for the stability of association in the native orientation. The FunHunt approach, discriminating models based on ensembles of structures that map the nearby energy landscape, can be adapted and extended to additional tasks, such as ob initio model selection, protein interface design and specificity predictions.

Predictions of the substrate sites in a proteome for the proteases would facilitate understanding the biological functions of the proteases. High-throughput experiments could generate suitable datasets for machine learning to grasp complex relationships between the substrate sequences and the enzymatic specificities. But the capability in predicting protease substrate sites by integrating the machine learning algorithms with the experimental methodology has yet to be demonstrated. Results: Factor Xa, a key regulatory protease in the blood coagulation system, was used as model system, for which effective substrate site predictors were developed and benchmarked. The predictors were derived from bootstrap aggregation (machine learning) algorithms trained with data obtained from multilevel substrate phage display experiments. The experimental sampling and computational learning on substrate specificities can be generalized to proteases for which the active forms are available for the in vitro experiments.

Most standard classification methods, however, are designed to maximize the overall accuracy and cannot incorporate different costs to different classes explicitly. In this article, we propose a novel nonparametric method to directly maximize the weighted specificity and sensitivity of the receiver operating characteristic curve. Combining advances in machine learning, optimization theory, and statistics, the proposed method has excellent generalization property and assigns different error costs to different classes explicitly. We present experiments that compare the proposed algorithms with support vector machines and regularized logistic regression using data from a study on HIV-1 protease as well as six public available datasets. Our main conclusion is that the performance of proposed algorithm is significantly better in most cases than the other classifiers tested. Software package in MATLAB is available upon request.

Automated seizure onset detection for accurate onset time determination in intracranial EEG	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Seizure onset detection; Machine learning; EEG	SPONTANEOUS EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; APPLIED CURRENTS; CORTICAL STIMULATION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; PULSE STIMULATION; PATTERNS; EPILEPSY; AFTERDISCHARGES; TRANSITION	Objective: A novel algorithm for automated seizure onset detection is presented. The method allows for precise identification of electrographic seizure onset times within large databases of electrographic data. Methods: The patient-specific algorithm extracts salient spectral and temporal features in five frequency bands within a sliding window of an electrographic recording. Feature windows are classified as containing or not containing a seizure onset via Support vector machines. A clustering and regression analysis is utilized to accurately localize seizure onsets in time. User-adjustable parameters allow for tuning of detection sensitivity, false positive rate, and latency. The method was tested on intracranial electrographic data recorded from six patients with a total of 1792 recorded seizure onsets from 8246 total electrographic recordings. Results: Testing of algorithm performance via cross-validation resulted in sensitivities between 80% and 98%, false positive rates from 0.002 to 0.046 per minute (0.12-2.8 per hour), and median detection time within 100 ms of the electrographic onset for all patients. In five of the six patients, more than 90% of all detected onsets were less than 3 s from the electrographic onset. Conclusions: The detection system was able to detect seizure onset times in a temporally unbiased fashion with low latency while maintaining reasonable sensitivities and false positive rates. The regression algorithm for temporal localization of onsets confers a considerable benefit in terms of detection latency. Significance: With the use Of Our algorithm, large databases of electrographic data can be rapidly processed and seizure onset times accurately marked, facilitating research and analyses of peri-onset events that require precise seizure onset alignment.

Responsive listening behavior	COMPUTER ANIMATION AND VIRTUAL WORLDS			English	Article						Computer animation; non-verbal behavior; motion capture; machine learning	MOTION INTERPOLATION; CHARACTER ANIMATION; STYLE	Humans use their bodies in a highly expressive way during conversation, and animated characters that lack this form of non-verbal expression call seem stiff and unemotional. An important aspect Of non-verbal expression is that people respond to each others behavior and are highly attuned to picking up this type of response. This is particularly important for the feedback given while listening to some one speak. However, automatically generating this type of behavior is difficult as it is highly complex and subtle. This paper takes a data driven approach to generating interactive social behavior. Listening behavior is motion captured, together with the audio being listened to. These data are used to learn ail animation model of the responses of one person to the other. This allows its to create characters that respond in real-time during a conversation with a real human.

Peter			Automatic detection of blue-white veil and related structures in dermoscopy images	COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS			English	Article						Melanoma; Dermoscopy; Blue-white veil; Contextual pixel classification; Decision tree classifier	MELANOCYTIC SKIN-LESIONS; BORDER DETECTION; ABCD RULE; CLASSIFICATION; COLOR; SEGMENTATION; DERMATOSCOPY; MICROSCOPY; DIAGNOSIS; PATTERN	Dermoscopy is a non-invasive skin imaging technique which permits visualization of features of pigmented melanocytic neoplasms that are not discernable by examination with the naked eye. One of the most important features for the diagnosis of melanoma in dermoscopy images is the blue-white veil (irregualar, strucuteless areas of confluent blue pigmentation with an overlying white "ground-glass" film). In this article. we present a machine learning approach to the detection of blue-white veil and related structures in dermoscopy images. The method involves contextual pixel classification using a decision tree classifier. The percentage of blue-white areas detected in a lesion combined with a simple shape descriptor yielded a sensitivity of 69.35% and a specificity of 89.97% on a set of 545 dermoscopy images. The sensitivity rises to 78.20% for detection of blue veil in those cases where it is a primary feature for melanoma recognition. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Celebi, M.

J	Wang, HC; Chang, CY; Li, TY				Wang, Hao-Chuan; Chang, Chun-Yen; Li, Tsai-Yen			Assessing creative problem-solving with automated text grading	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						Computer-aided assessment; Automated grading; Creative problem-solving; Science learning assessment; Machine learning application	VECTOR-SPACE MODEL; ABILITY; SCIENCE	The work aims to improve the assessment of creative problem-solving in science education by employing language technologies and computational-statistical machine learning methods to grade students' natural language responses automatically. To evaluate constructs like creative problem-solving with validity, open-ended questions that elicit students' constructed responses are beneficial. But the high cost required in manually grading constructed responses could become an obstacle in applying open-ended questions. In this study, automated grading schemes have been developed and evaluated in the context of secondary Earth science education. Empirical evaluations revealed that the automated grading schemes may reliably identify domain concepts embedded in students' natural language responses with satisfactory inter-coder agreement against human coding in two sub-tasks of the test (Cohen's Kappa = .65-72). And when a single holistic score was computed for each student, machine-generated scores achieved high inter-rater reliability against human grading (Pearson's r = .92). The reliable performance in automatic concept identification and numeric grading demonstrates the potential of using automated grading to support the use of open-ended questions in science assessments and enable new technologies for science learning.

The extensive use of computer-assisted drug design techniques may considerably increase the chances of finding valuable drug candidates, thus decreasing the drug discovery time and costs. The most important computational approach is represented by structure-activity relationships that can discriminate between sets of chemicals that are active/inactive towards a certain biological receptor. An adverse effect of some cationic amphiphilic drugs is phospholipidosis that manifests as an intracellular accumulation of phospholipids and formation of concentric lamellar bodies. Here we present structure-activity relationships (SAR) computed with a wide variety of machine learning algorithms trained to identify drugs that have phospholipidosis inducing potential. All SAR models are developed with the machine learning software Weka, and include both classical algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors and decision trees, as well as recently introduced methods, such as support vector machines and artificial immune systems.

J	Baluja, S; Covell, M				Baluja, Shumeet; Covell, Michele			Learning to hash: forgiving hash functions and applications	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Hashing; Audio matching; Machine learning; Locality sensitive hashing		The problem of efficiently finding similar items in a large corpus of high-dimensional data points arises in many real-world tasks, such as music, image, and video retrieval. Beyond the scaling difficulties that arise with lookups in large data sets, the complexity in these domains is exacerbated by an imprecise definition of similarity. In this paper, we describe a method to learn a similarity function from only weakly labeled positive examples. Once learned, this similarity function is used as the basis of a hash function to severely constrain the number of points considered for each lookup. Tested on a large real-world audio dataset, only a tiny fraction of the points (similar to 0.27%) are ever considered for each lookup. To increase efficiency, no comparisons in the original high-dimensional space of points are required. The performance far surpasses, in terms of both efficiency and accuracy, a state-of-the-art Locality-Sensitive-Hashing-based (LSH) technique for the same problem and data set.

J	Corander, J; Ekdahl, M; Koski, T				Corander, Jukka; Ekdahl, Magnus; Koski, Timo			Parallell interacting MCMC for learning of topologies of graphical models	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						MCMC; Equivalence search; Learning graphical models	CHAIN MONTE-CARLO; MARKOV EQUIVALENCE CLASSES; EFFICIENT ESTIMATION; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; ACYCLIC DIGRAPHS; SELECTION	Automated statistical learning of graphical models from data has attained a considerable degree of interest in the machine learning and related literature. Many authors have discussed and/or demonstrated the need for consistent stochastic search methods that would not be as prone to yield locally optimal model structures as simple greedy methods. However, at the same time most of the stochastic search methods are based on a standard Metropolis-Hastings theory that necessitates the use of relatively simple random proposals and prevents the utilization of intelligent and efficient search operators. Here we derive an algorithm for learning topologies of graphical models from samples of a finite set of discrete variables by utilizing and further enhancing a recently introduced theory for non-reversible parallel interacting Markov chain Monte Carlo-style computation. In particular, we illustrate how the non-reversible approach allows for novel type of creativity in the design of search operators. Also, the parallel aspect of our method illustrates well the advantages of the adaptive nature of search operators to avoid trapping states in the vicinity of locally optimal network topologies.

By choosing an appropriate representation texture, classifiers can be evolved without computing texture features. Due to the absence of time-consuming feature extraction, the evolved classifiers enable the development of the proposed texture segmentation algorithm. This GP based method can achieve a segmentation speed that is significantly higher than that of conventional methods. This method does not require a human expert to manually construct models for texture feature extraction. In an analysis of the evolved classifiers, it can be seen that these GP classifiers are not arbitrary. Certain textural regularities are captured by these classifiers to discriminate different textures. GP has been shown in this Study as a feasible and a powerful approach for texture classification and segmentation, which are generally considered as complex vision tasks.

A methodology for automated fuzzy model generation	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Decision trees; Fuzzy modeling; Optimization; Weighted fuzzy rules	INDUCTIVE LEARNING-METHOD; DECISION TREES; CLASSIFICATION; FRAMEWORK; OPTIMIZATION; ACCURACY; CREATION; SYSTEMS; RULES	In this paper we propose a generic methodology for the automated generation of fuzzy models. The methodology is realized in three stages. Initially, a crisp model is created and in the second stage it is transformed to a fuzzy one. In the third stage, all parameters entering the fuzzy model are optimized. The proposed methodology is novel and generic since it can integrate alternative techniques in each of its stages. A specific realization of this methodology is implemented, using decision trees for the creation of the crisp model, the sigmoid function, the min-max operators and the maximum defuzzifier, for the transformation of the crisp model into a fuzzy one, and four different optimization strategies, including global and local optimization techniques, as well as. hybrid approaches. The proposed methodology presents several advantages and novelties: the transformation of the crisp model to the respective fuzzy one is straightforward ensuring its full automated nature and it introduces a set of parameters, expressing the importance of each fuzzy rule. The above realization is extensively evaluated using several benchmark data sets front the UCI machine learning repository and the obtained results indicate its high efficiency.

J	Aberg, MB; Wessberg, J				Aberg, Malin Bjornsdotter; Wessberg, Johan			An Evolutionary Approach to the Identification of Informative Voxel Clusters for Brain State Discrimination	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Classification; evolutionary algorithms; fMRI; pattern recognition; support vector machines	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; FMRI DATA; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; VISUAL-CORTEX; CLASSIFICATION	We present a novel multivariate machine learning approach to the identification of voxel clusters containing brain state discriminating information, serving as a potentially more sensitive alternative to univariate activation detection. The proposed method consists of an evolutionary algorithm that, in conjunction with a classifier, extracts voxel clusters with a classification score above a pre-defined, above-chance threshold. The results can be displayed as two- or three-dimensional voxel discrimination relevance maps (VDRMs), indicating where and to what degree brain state classification is possible. When applied to a finger-tapping dataset numerous voxel clusters with impressive classification rates were identified, at best scoring an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC)-curve (AUC) of I within as well as between subjects. The location of high-scoring regions correlated well with functionally relevant areas as defined by the general linear model (GLM). Combining clusters for maximal classification scores as a feature selection approach outperformed the GLM T-map voxel ranking method (e.g., group level AUC of 0.908 compared to 0.785 for one cluster/200 voxels). Moreover, on data from a tactile study we show that the proposed algorithm can produce significant brain state discrimination scores where both the GLM and ROI-based classification fail to detect significantly activated voxels. Finally, we demonstrate that the algorithm can be successfully applied to data with more than two conditions and hence produce multiclass voxel relevance maps. The proposed evolutionary classification scheme has thus proven excellent in identifying voxel clusters that contain information about given brain states, which can be utilized not only for maximal single-volume fMRI classification, but also for multivariate, multiclass, highly sensitive functional brain mapping.

J	Martin, T; Shen, Y; Azvine, B				Martin, Trevor; Shen, Yun; Azvine, Ben			Incremental Evolution of Fuzzy Grammar Fragments to Enhance Instance Matching and Text Mining	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Entity extraction; evolving system; extensible markup language (XML); fuzzy sets; grammar fragments; incremental learning; instance matching; tagging; text mining	LINKAGE	In many applications, it is useful to extract structured data from sections of unstructured text. A common approach is to use pattern matching (e.g., regular expressions) or more general grammar-based techniques. In cases where exact templates or grammar fragments are not known, it is possible to use machine learning approaches, based on words or n-grams, to identify the structured data. This is generally a two-stage (train/use) process that cannot easily cope with incremental extensions of the training set. In this paper, we combine a fuzzy grammar-based approach with incremental learning. This enables a set of grammar fragments to evolve incrementally, each time a new example is given, while guaranteeing that it can parse previously seen examples. We propose a novel measure of overlap between fuzzy grammar. fragments that can also be used to determine the degree to which a string is parsed by a grammar fragment. This measure of overlap allows us to compare the range of two fuzzy grammar fragments (i.e., to estimate and compare the sets of strings that fuzzily conform to each grammar) without explicitly parsing any strings. A simple application shows the method's validity.

This paper presents a sparse conditional random field (SCRF) model to select relevant features for the classification of hyperspectral images and, meanwhile, to exploit the contextual information in the form of spatial dependences in the images. The sparsity arises from the use of a Laplacian prior on the CRF parameters, which encourages the parameter estimates to be either significantly large or exactly zero. To joint the feature selection and classifier design, this paper develops an efficient sparse training method, which divides the training of SCRF into the sparse trainings of two simpler classifiers. Experiments on the real-world hyperspectral image attest to the accuracy, sparsity, and efficiency of the proposed model.

The new training algorithm is fast and simple. This is achieved by an over-complete wavelet transform that finds the optimal approximation of the support vectors. The presented derivation shows that the wavelet theory provides an upper bound on the distance between the decision function of the support vector machine and our classifier. The obtained classifier is fast, since a Haar wavelet approximation of the support vectors is used, enabling efficient integral image-based kernel evaluations. This provides a set of cascaded classifiers of increasing complexity for an early rejection of vectors easy to discriminate. This excellent runtime performance is achieved by using a hierarchical evaluation over the number of incorporated and additional over the approximation accuracy of the reduced set vectors. Here, this algorithm is applied to the problem of face detection, but it can also be used for other image-based classifications. The algorithm presented, provides a 530-fold speedup over the support vector machine, enabling face detection at more than 25 fps on a standard PC.

Nesting One-Against-One Algorithm Based on SVMs for Pattern Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Multiclass classification algorithms; one-against-one algorithm; support vector machines (SVMs)	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION	Support vector machines (SVMs), which were originally designed for binary classifications, are an excellent tool for machine learning. For the multiclass classifications, they are usually converted into binary ones before they can be used to classify the examples. In the one-against-one algorithm with SVMs, there exists an unclassifiable region where the data samples cannot be classified by its decision function. This paper extends the one-against-one algorithm to handle this problem. We also give the convergence and computational complexity analysis of the proposed method. Finally, one-against-one, fuzzy decision function (FDF), and decision-directed acyclic graph (DDAG) algorithms and our proposed method are compared using five University of California at Irvine (UCI) data sets. The results report that the proposed method can handle the unclassifiable region better than others.

With spatial resolution on the order of millimeters and temporal resolution on the order of seconds, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a promising technology for such applications. However, fMRI data's low signal-to-noise ratio, high dimensionality, and extensive spatiotemporal correlations present formidable analytic challenges. Here, we apply different machine-learning algorithms to previously acquired data to examine the ability of fMRI activation in three regions-the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and insula-to predict purchasing. Our goal was to improve spatiotemporal interpretability as well as classification accuracy. To this end, sparse penalized discriminant analysis (SPDA) enabled automatic selection of correlated variables, yielding interpretable models that generalized well to new data. Relative to logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and linear support vector machines, SPDA not only increased interpretability but also improved classification accuracy. SPDA promises to allow more precise inferences about when specific brain regions contribute to purchasing decisions. More broadly, this approach provides a general framework for using neuroimaging data to build interpretable models, including those that predict choice.

The identification of a model to estimate the subjective workload score of individuals under different workload situations is too ambitious a task because different individuals (due to different body conditions, emotional states, age, gender, etc.) show different physiological responses (assessed by evaluating the HR signal) under different workload situations. This is equivalent to saying that the mathematical mappings between physiological parameters and the workload score are uncertain. Our approach to deal with the uncertainties in a workload-modeling problem consists of the following steps: 1) The uncertainties arising due the individual variations in identifying a common model valid for all the individuals are filtered out using a fuzzy filter; 2) stochastic modeling of the uncertainties (provided by the fuzzy filter) use finite-mixture models and utilize this information regarding uncertainties for identifying the structure and initial parameters of a workload model; and 3) finally, the workload model parameters for an individual are identified in an online scenario using machine learning algorithms. The contribution of this paper is to propose, with a mathematical analysis, a fuzzy-based modeling technique that first filters out the uncertainties from the modeling problem, analyzes the uncertainties statistically using finite-mixture modeling, and, finally, utilizes the information about uncertainties for adapting the workload model to an individual's physiological conditions. The approach of this paper, demonstrated with the real-world medical data of 11 subjects, provides a fuzzy-based tool useful for modeling in the presence of uncertainties.

J	El Fkihi, S; Daoudi, M; Aboutajdine, D				El Fkihi, Sanaa; Daoudi, Mohamed; Aboutajdine, Driss			The mixture of K-Optimal-Spanning-Trees based probability approximation: Application to skin detection	IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING			English	Article						Optimal-Spanning-Tree; Dependency tree; Probability mixture; Mixture of trees; Skin detection	MODELS	This paper presents a new approach for machine learning to deal with the problem of classification and/or probability approximation. Our contribution is based on the Optimal-Spanning-Tree distributions that are widely used in many optimization areas. The rationale behind this study is that in some cases the approximation of true class probability given by an Optimal-Spanning-Tree is not unique and might be chosen randomly. Furthermore, the user can specify the error tolerance between the tree weights that he/she can accept to manage the information of these kinds of trees. Therefore, the main idea of this work consists in focusing and highlighting the performance of each possible K (K is an element of N) Optimal-Spanning-Tree and making some assumptions, to propose the mixture of the K-Optimal-SpanningTrees approximating the true class probability in a supervised algorithm. The theoretical proof of the K-Optimal-Spanning-Trees' mixture is given. Furthermore, the performance of our method is assessed for Skin/Non-Skin classification in the Compaq database by measuring the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and its under area. These measures have proved better results of the proposed model compared with a random Optimal- Spanning-Tree model and the baseline one. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Rokach, L; Romano, R; Maimon, O				Rokach, Lior; Romano, Roni; Maimon, Oded			Negation recognition in medical narrative reports	INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Article						text classification; part-of-speech tagging; negation; narrative medical reports; artificial intelligence	INFORMATION EXTRACTION; WRAPPER INDUCTION; BIOMEDICAL TEXT; CLASSIFICATION; CATEGORIZATION; RETRIEVAL; RADIOLOGY	Substantial medical data, such as discharge summaries and operative reports are stored in electronic textual form. Databases containing free-text clinical narratives reports often need to be retrieved to find relevant information for clinical and research purposes. The context of negation, a negative finding, is of special importance, since many of the most frequently described findings are such. When searching free-text narratives for patients with a certain medical condition, if negation is not taken into account, many of the documents retrieved will be irrelevant. Hence, negation is a major source of poor precision in medical information retrieval systems. Previous research has shown that negated findings may be difficult to identify if the words implying negations (negation signals) are more than a few words away from them. We present a new pattern learning method for automatic identification of negative context in clinical narratives reports. We compare the new algorithm to previous methods proposed for the same task, and show its advantages: accuracy improvement compared to other machine learning methods, and much faster than manual knowledge engineering techniques with matching accuracy. The new algorithm can be applied also to further context identification and information extraction tasks.

J	Doreswamy				Doreswamy			A SURVEY FOR DATA MINING FRAME WORK FOR POLYMER MATRIX COMPOSITE ENGINEERING MATERIALS DESIGN APPLICATIONS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery; Composite Materials Selection; Machine Learning; Neural Network Model	DECISION-SUPPORT ARCHITECTURE; EVOLUTION	In this paper, a survey for Data Mining frame work has been done for proposing Data Mining methodologies to engineering materials design applications. An exhaustive literature survey made in this article has covered the modeling systems such as Analytical Model, Numerical Simulation Model and Computer Based Modeling Systems, which were developed and implemented for Polymer Composite processing from the year 1950 to till 2006. Motivation for the present investigation is inspired by the Computer Based Models and is depicted as Mining Frame Work for determining optimal decision making strategies and performing intelligent computational operations associated to advanced Composite materials design applications. Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery has made tremendous progress in Computer Science in the last 15 years. However, a large gap exists between the results of Data Mining and Knowledge Base system that can provide and support proper decision making. Though many Modeling and Simulation Systems have been designed and developed for improving the concurrent engineering materials design throughput, the application of Data Mining is still essential to extract previously unknown and potentially useful information and knowledge from the engineering materials database. The information and knowledge extracted by the Mining System is enormously useful for Composite materials design applications and for reducing the materials selection cost and time that is required to select the suitable constituent materials that maximize the performance of Composite materials under deferent environmental conditions.

The edited version of this method consists of the application of this classifier with a subset of the complete training set in which some of the training patterns are excluded, in order to reduce the classification error rate. In recent works, genetic algorithms have been successfully applied to determine which patterns must be included in the edited subset. In this paper we propose a novel implementation of a genetic algorithm for designing edited k-nearest neighbor classifiers. It includes the definition of a novel mean square error based fitness function, a novel clustered crossover technique, and the proposal of a fast smart mutation scheme. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, results using the breast cancer database, the diabetes database and the letter recognition database from the UCI machine learning benchmark repository have been included. Both error rate and computational cost have been considered in the analysis. Obtained results show the improvement achieved by the proposed editing method.

We set up the problem by introducing an agent-based hidden Markov model for the agent dynamics: an agent's actions are determined by micro-laws. Nonetheless, We learn the agent dynamics from the observed communications without knowing state transitions. Our approach is to identify the appropriate micro-laws corresponding to an identification of the appropriate parameters in the model. The model identification problem is then formulated as a mixed optimization problem. To solve the problem, we develop a multistage learning process for determining the group structure, the group evolution, and the micro-laws of a community based on the observed set of communications among actors, without knowing the semantic contents. Finally, to test the quality of our approximations and the feasibility of the approach, we present the results of extensive experiments on synthetic data as well as the results on real communities, such as Enron email and Movie newsgroups. Insight into agent dynamics helps us understand the driving forces behind social evolution.

The trait was mean progeny mortality rate in 253 sire families, after adjusting records for nuisance effects affecting mortality at the individual bird level. Over 5,000 whole-genome SNP were narrowed down via a machine-learning (filter-wrapper) feature selection procedure applied to mortality rates in each of the 2 environments. For both early and late mortality, it was found that the selected SNP subsets differed across hygiene environments, in terms of either across-environment predictive ability or extent of linkage disequilibrium between the subsets. Reduction in predictive ability due to G x E was assessed by the ratio of 2 predicted residual sum of squares statistics, one associated with SNP selected from the same hygiene environment and the other associated with the SNP subset from a different environment. Reduction was 30 and 20% for early and late mortality, respectively. An extremely low level of linkage disequilibrium between SNP subsets selected under low and high hygiene also indicated G x E. Findings suggest that there may not be a universally optimal SNP subset for predicting mortality and that interactions between genome and environmental factors need to be considered in association analysis of complex traits.

Word sense disambiguation across two domains: Biomedical literature and clinical notes	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Natural language processing; Word sense disambiguation; Information extraction; Biomedical natural language processing; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning	MOLECULAR-BIOLOGY; INFORMATION; SYSTEM	The aim of this study is to explore the word sense disambiguation (WSD) problem across two biomedical domains-biomedical literature and clinical notes. A supervised machine learning technique was used for the WSD task. One of the challenges addressed is the creation of a suitable clinical corpus with manual sense annotations. This corpus in conjunction with the WSD set from the National Library of Medicine provided the basis for the evaluation of our method across multiple domains and for the comparison of our results to published ones. Noteworthy is that only 20% of the most relevant ambiguous terms within a domain overlap between the two domains, having more senses associated with them in the clinical space than in the biomedical literature space. Experimentation with 28 different feature sets rendered a system achieving an average F-score of 0.82 on the clinical data and 0.86 on the biomedical literature. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

It is necessary to analyze these data through the use of algorithms, as in clustering and machine-learning. In a previous study, we developed fuzzy adaptive resonance theory (FuzzyART) and applied it to gene expression data, to identify genetic networks. FuzzyART was used as a clustering algorithm that is very suitable for the analysis of biological data; however, although FuzzyART is very useful in the analysis of dozens of gene expression profiles, it is difficult to apply this method to thousands of gene expression profiles, owing to inherent category proliferation and long calculation time. In the present study, we developed a knowledge-based FuzzyART (KB-FuzzyART) to mitigate these problems. We first constructed a gene list-1 from the gene database of Arabidopsis thaliana as knowledge for KB-FuzzyART, because KB-FuzzyART requires any knowledge as input. This method was applied to gene expression data obtained via the microarray analysis of A. thaliana, to identify the downstream genes of ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS]) and ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2 (AS2), both of which are involved in leaf development. The results of the analysis using KB-FuzzyART showed that the KNAT6 and YABBY5 (YAB5) genes are candidates for downstream factors, after a short calculation time for analysis. These results suggest that our gene list-1 is a very useful database for analyzing the expression profiles of genes that are related to the development of A. thaliana; they also suggest that the KB-FuzzyART has the high potential to function as a new method by which one can select candidate genes from thousands of genes, using gene expression data on mutant strains.

J	Xiao, J; Wang, LS; Liu, XW; Jiang, T				Xiao, Jing; Wang, Lusheng; Liu, Xiaowen; Jiang, Tao			An Efficient Voting Algorithm for Finding Additive Biclusters with Random Background	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						additive bicluster; computational biology; gene expression data analysis; polynomial-time algorithm; probability model	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; LARGE HIDDEN CLIQUE; GRAPH; CLUSTERS; PATTERNS	The biclustering problem has been extensively studied in many areas, including e-commerce, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, statistics, and, more recently, computational biology. Given an n x m matrix A ( n >= m), the main goal of biclustering is to identify a subset of rows ( called objects) and a subset of columns ( called properties) such that some objective function that specifies the quality of the found bicluster ( formed by the subsets of rows and of columns of A) is optimized. The problem has been proved or conjectured to be NP-hard for various objective functions. In this article, we study a probabilistic model for the implanted additive bicluster problem, where each element in the n x m background matrix is a random integer from [0; L - 1] for some integer L, and a k x k implanted additive bicluster is obtained from an error-free additive bicluster by randomly changing each element to a number in [0; L - 1] with probability theta. We propose an O(n(2)m) time algorithm based on voting to solve the problem. We show that when k >= Omega (root n logn), the voting algorithm can correctly find the implanted bicluster with probability at least 1 - 9/n(2). We also implement our algorithm as a C++ program named VOTE. The implementation incorporates several ideas for estimating the size of an implanted bicluster, adjusting the threshold in voting, dealing with small biclusters, and dealing with overlapping implanted biclusters. Our experimental results on both simulated and real datasets show that VOTE can find biclusters with a high accuracy and speed.

J	Tang, MHE; Krogh, A; Winther, O				Tang, Man-Hung Eric; Krogh, Anders; Winther, Ole			BayesMD: Flexible Biological Modeling for Motif Discovery	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						computational molecular biology; gene expression; machine learning; Markov chains; Monte Carlo likelihood; recognition of genes and regulatory elements; sequence analysis; stochastic processes	FACTOR-BINDING-SITES; OPEN-ACCESS DATABASE; REGULATORY REGIONS; IDENTIFICATION; SEQUENCE; INFERENCE; ALIGNMENT; PROFILES; SAMPLER; GENOME	We present BayesMD, a Bayesian Motif Discovery model with several new features. Three different types of biological a priori knowledge are built into the framework in a modular fashion. A mixture of Dirichlets is used as prior over nucleotide probabilities in binding sites. It is trained on transcription factor (TF) databases in order to extract the typical properties of TF binding sites. In a similar fashion we train organism-specific priors for the background sequences. Lastly, we use a prior over the position of binding sites. This prior represents information complementary to the motif and background priors coming from conservation, local sequence complexity, nucleosome occupancy, etc. and assumptions about the number of occurrences. The Bayesian inference is carried out using a combination of exact marginalization (multinomial parameters) and sampling (over the position of sites). Robust sampling results are achieved using the advanced sampling method parallel tempering. In a post-analysis step candidate motifs with high marginal probability are found by searching among those motifs that contain sites that occur frequently. Thereby, maximum a posteriori inference for the motifs is avoided and the marginal probabilities can be used directly to assess the significance of the findings. The framework is benchmarked against other methods on a number of real and artificial data sets. The accompanying prediction server, documentation, software, models and data are available from http://bayesmd.binf.ku.dk/.

Our reductions imply that for these problems, given an optimal (or beta-approximation) algorithm for an algorithmic pricing problem, we can convert it into a (1 + epsilon)-approximation (or beta(l + epsilon)-approximation) for the incentive-compatible mechanism design problem, so long as the number of bidders is sufficiently large as a function of an appropriate measure of complexity of the class of allowable pricings. We apply these results to the problem of auctioning a digital good, to the attribute auction problem which includes a wide variety of discriminatory pricing problems, and to the problem of item-pricing in unlimited-supply combinatorial auctions. From a machine learning perspective, these settings present several challenges: in particular, the "loss function" is discontinuous, is asymmetric, and has a large range.

However most algorithms in that class may be termed "manifold-motivated" as they lack any explicit theoretical guarantees. In this paper we take a step towards closing the gap between theory and practice for a class of Laplacian-based manifold methods. These methods utilize the graph Laplacian associated to a data set for a variety of applications in semi-supervised learning, clustering, data representation. We show that under certain conditions the graph Laplacian of a point cloud of data samples converges to the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the underlying manifold. Theorem 3.1 contains the first result showing convergence of a random graph Laplacian to the manifold Laplacian in the context of machine learning. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Learning communicative actions of conflicting human agents	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						behaviour human agents; multi-agent conflict; communicative actions; machine learning	GRAPHS	One of the main problems to be solved while assisting inter-human conflict resolution is how to reuse the previous experience with similar agents. A machine learning technique for handling scenarios of interaction between conflicting human agents is proposed. Scenarios are represented by directed graphs with labelled vertices (for communicative actions) and arcs (for temporal and Causal relation ships between these actions and their parameters). For illustrative purposes, classification of a scenario is computed by comparing partial matching of its graph with graphs of positive and negative examples. Nearest Neighbour. learning is followed by the JSM-based learning which minimised the number of false negatives and takes advantage of a More accurate way of matching sequences of communicative actions. Developed scenario representation and comparative analysis techniques are applied to the classification of textual customer complaints. It is shown that analysing the structure Of communicative actions without context information is frequently sufficient to estimate complaint validity. Therefore, being domain-independent, proposed machine learning technique is a good compliment to a wide range of customer relation management applications where formal treatment of inter-human interactions is required in a decision-support mode.

J	Malik, AM; Russell, T; Chase, M; van Beek, P				Malik, Abid M.; Russell, Tyrel; Chase, Michael; van Beek, Peter			Learning heuristics for basic block instruction scheduling	JOURNAL OF HEURISTICS			English	Article						Instruction scheduling; Machine learning; List scheduling heuristics		Instruction scheduling is an important step for improving the performance of object code produced by a compiler. A fundamental problem that arises in instruction scheduling is to find a minimum length schedule for a basic block-a straight-line sequence of code with a single entry point and a single exit point-subject to precedence, latency, and resource constraints. Solving the problem exactly is known to be difficult, and most compilers use a greedy list scheduling algorithm coupled with a heuristic. The heuristic is usually hand-crafted, a potentially time-consuming process. In contrast, we present a study on automatically learning good heuristics using techniques from machine learning. In our study, a recently proposed optimal basic block scheduler was used to generate the machine learning training data. A decision tree learning algorithm was then used to induce a simple heuristic from the training data. The automatically constructed decision tree heuristic was compared against a popular critical-path heuristic on the SPEC 2000 benchmarks. On this benchmark suite, the decision tree heuristic reduced the number of basic blocks that were not optimally scheduled by up to 55% compared to the critical-path heuristic, and gave improved performance guarantees in terms of the worst-case factor from optimality.

Brendan; Guestrin, Carlos; Gupta, Anupam			Robust Submodular Observation Selection	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						observation selection; experimental design; active learning; submodular functions; Gaussian processes	P-CENTER PROBLEM; EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN; ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION	In many applications, one has to actively select among a set of expensive observations before making an informed decision. For example, in environmental monitoring, we want to select locations to measure in order to most effectively predict spatial phenomena. Often, we want to select observations which are robust against a number of possible objective functions. Examples include minimizing the maximum posterior variance in Gaussian Process regression, robust experimental design, and sensor placement for outbreak detection. In this paper, we present the submodular Saturation algorithm, a simple and efficient algorithm with strong theoretical approximation guarantees for cases where the possible objective functions exhibit submodularity, an intuitive diminishing returns property. Moreover, we prove that better approximation algorithms do not exist unless NP-complete problems admit efficient algorithms. We show how our algorithm can be extended to handle complex cost functions (incorporating non-unit observation cost or communication and path costs). We also show how the algorithm can be used to near-optimally trade off expected-case (e. g., the Mean Square Prediction Error in Gaussian Process regression) and worst- case (e. g., maximum predictive variance) performance. We show that many important machine learning problems fit our robust submodular observation selection formalism, and provide extensive empirical evaluation on several real-world problems. For Gaussian Process regression, our algorithm compares favorably with state-of-the-art heuristics described in the geostatistics literature, while being simpler, faster and providing theoretical guarantees. For robust experimental design, our algorithm performs favorably compared to SDP-based algorithms.

J	Ohta, S; Kurebayashi, R; Kobayashi, K				Ohta, Satoru; Kurebayashi, Ryosuke; Kobayashi, Kiyoshi			Minimizing False Positives of a Decision Tree Classifier for Intrusion Detection on the Internet	JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Internet; Intrusion detection; Data mining; Machine learning; Decision tree	DESIGN	Machine learning or data mining technologies are often used in network intrusion detection systems. An intrusion detection system based on machine learning utilizes a classifier to infer the current state from the observed traffic attributes. The problem with learning-based intrusion detection is that it leads to false positives and so incurs unnecessary additional operation costs. This paper investigates a method to decrease the false positives generated by an intrusion detection system that employs a decision tree as its classifier. The paper first points out that the information-gain criterion used in previous studies to select the attributes in the tree-constructing algorithm is not effective in achieving low false positive rates. Instead of the information-gain criterion, this paper proposes a new function that evaluates the goodness of an attribute by considering the significance of error types. The proposed function can successfully choose an attribute that suppresses false positives from the given attribute set and the effectiveness of using it is confirmed experimentally. This paper also examines the more trivial leaf rewriting approach to benchmark the proposed method. The comparison shows that the proposed attribute evaluation function yields better solutions than the leaf rewriting approach.

A comparative evaluation	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Missing data; Missing data toleration; C4.5; Data imputation; Software project cost prediction	COST-ESTIMATION MODELS; MISSING DATA; FEATURE-SELECTION; ASSUMPTIONS; VALIDATION; MECHANISM; VALUES	Missing data is a widespread problem that can affect the ability to use data to construct effective prediction systems. We investigate a common machine learning technique that can tolerate missing values, namely C4.5, to predict Cost using six real world software project databases. We analyze the predictive performance after using the k-NN missing data imputation technique to see if it is better to tolerate missing data or to try to impute missing Values and then apply the C4.5 algorithm. For the investigation, we simulated three missingness mechanisms, three missing data patterns, and five missing data percentages. We found that the k-NN imputation can improve the prediction accuracy of C4.5. At the same time, both C4.5 and k-NN are little affected by the missingness mechanism, but that the missing data pattern and the missing data percentage have a strong negative impact upon prediction (or imputation) accuracy particularly if the missing data percentage exceeds 40%.

This paper presented a new splitting rule that introduces a metric, i.e., an impurity measure, to construct decision trees for ranking tasks. We provided a theoretical basis and some intuitive explanations for the splitting rule. Our approach is also meaningful to collaborative filtering in the sense of dealing with categorical data and selecting relative features. Some experiments were made to illustrate our ranking approach, whose results showed that our algorithm outperforms both perceptron-based ranking and the classification tree algorithms in term of accuracy as well as speed.

J	Lu, JJ; Zhao, TZ; Zhang, YF				Lu, Jianjiang; Zhao, Tianzhong; Zhang, Yafei			Feature selection based-on genetic algorithm for image annotation	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Image annotation; Feature selection; Genetic algorithm; k-Nearest neighbor classifier; Multimedia content description interface	TEXTURE DESCRIPTORS; RETRIEVAL; SEARCH	Machine learning techniques for feature selection, which include the optimization of feature descriptor weights and the selection of optimal feature descriptor subset, are desirable to enhance the performance of image annotation systems. In our system, the Multimedia content description interface (MPEG-7) image feature descriptors consisting of color descriptors, texture descriptors and shape descriptors are employed to represent low-level image features. We use a real coded chromosome genetic algorithm and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classification accuracy as fitness function to optimize the weights of MPEG-7 image feature descriptors. A binary one and k-NN classification accuracy combining with the size of feature descriptor Subset as fitness function are used to select optimal MPEG-7 feature descriptor subset. Furthermore, a bi-coded chromosome genetic algorithm is used for the simultaneity of weight optimization and descriptor subset selection, whose fitness function is the same as that of the binary one. The experimental results over 2000 classified Corel images show that with the real coded genetic algorithm, the binary coded one and the bi-coded one, the accuracies of image annotation system are improved by 7%. 9% and 13.6%, respectively, comparing to the method without machine learning. Furthermore, 2 of 25 MPEG-7 feature descriptors are selected with the binary coded genetic algorithm and four with the bicoded one, which may improve the efficiency of system significantly.

We identify a number of critical issues that hamper comparison of the results obtained by different researchers. Some of these issues are common to other NLP-related tasks: e.g., the difficulty of exactly identifying the effects on performance of the data (sample selection and sample size), of the domain theory (features selected), and of algorithm parameter settings. Some issues are specific to IE: how leniently to assess inexact identification of filler boundaries, the possibility of multiple fillers for a slot, and how the counting is performed. We argue that, when specifying an IE task, these issues should be explicitly addressed, and a number of methodological characteristics should be clearly defined. To empirically verify the practical impact of the issues mentioned above, we perform a survey of the results of different algorithms when applied to a few standard datasets. The survey shows a serious lack of consensus on these issues, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions on a comparative evaluation of the algorithms. Our aim is to elaborate a clear and detailed experimental methodology and propose it to the IE community. Widespread agreement on this proposal should lead to future IE comparative evaluations that are fair and reliable. To demonstrate the way the methodology is to be applied we have organized and run a comparative evaluation of ML-based IE systems (the Pascal Challenge on ML-based IE) where the principles described in this article are put into practice. In this article we describe the proposed methodology and its motivations. The Pascal evaluation is then described and its results presented.

J	Sculley, D; Pasanek, BM				Sculley, D.; Pasanek, Bradley M.			Meaning and mining: the impact of implicit assumptions in data mining for the humanities	LITERARY AND LINGUISTIC COMPUTING			English	Article								As the use of data mining and machine learning methods in the humanities becomes more common, it will be increasingly important to examine implicit biases, assumptions, and limitations these methods bring with them. This article makes explicit some of the foundational assumptions of machine learning methods, and presents a series of experiments as a case study and object lesson in the potential pitfalls in the use of data mining methods for hypothesis testing in literary scholarship. The worst dangers may lie in the humanist's ability to interpret nearly any result, projecting his or her own biases into the outcome of an experiment-perhaps all the more unwittingly due to the superficial objectivity of computational methods. We argue that in the digital humanities, the standards for the initial production of evidence should be even more rigorous than in the empirical sciences because of the subjective nature of the work that follows. Thus, we conclude with a discussion of recommended best practices for making results from data mining in the humanities domain as meaningful as possible. These include methods for keeping the the boundary between computational results and subsequent interpretation as clearly delineated as possible.

Motivated by problems with the application of MTL networks to machine lifelong learning systems, csMTL encoding of multiple task examples was developed and found to improve predictive performance. As evidence, the csMTL method is tested on seven task domains and shown to produce hypotheses for primary tasks that are often better than standard MTL hypotheses when learning in the presence of related and unrelated tasks. We argue that the reason for this performance improvement is a reduction in the number of effective free parameters in the csMTL network brought about by the shared output node and weight update constraints due to the context inputs. An examination of IDT and SVM models developed from csMTL encoded data provides initial evidence that this improvement is not shared across all machine learning models.

Recent advancements in technology, including computation, robotics, machine learning, communication, and miniaturization of sensors have been used primarily in manufacturing, military, space exploration, and entertainment. However, few efforts have been made to utilize these technologies to enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities.

This task is challenging due to a lack of information on gene function. The integration of large-scale functional genomics data has proven to be an effective strategy to prioritize candidate disease genes. Mitochondrial disorders are a prevalent and heterogeneous class of diseases that are particularly amenable to this approach. Here we explain the application of integrative approaches to the identification of mitochondrial disease genes. We first examine various datasets that can be used to evaluate the involvement of each gene in mitochondrial function. The data integration methodology is then described, accompanied by examples of common implementations. Finally, we discuss how gene networks are constructed using integrative techniques and applied to candidate gene prioritization. Relevant public data resources are indicated. This report highlights the success and potential of data integration as well as its applicability to the search for mitochondrial disease genes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Schmitt, J; Hollick, M; Roos, C; Steinmetz, R				Schmitt, Johannes; Hollick, Matthias; Roos, Christoph; Steinmetz, Ralf			Adapting the User Context in Realtime: Tailoring Online Machine Learning Algorithms to Ambient Computing	MOBILE NETWORKS & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						ambient computing; pervasive computing; context-aware computing; machine learning	EXAMPLES	Ambient systems weave computing and communication aspects into everyday life. To provide self-adaptive services, it is necessary to acquire context information using sensors and to leverage the collected information for reasoning and classification of situations. To enable self-learning systems, we propose to depart from static rule-based decisions and first-order logic to define situations from basic context, but to build on machine-learning techniques. However, existing learning algorithms show substantial weaknesses if applied in highly dynamic environments, where we expect accurate decisions in realtime while the user is in-the-loop to give feedback to the system's recommendations. To address ambient and pervasive computing environments, we propose the FLORA-multiple classification (FLORA-MC) online learning algorithm. In particular, we enhance the FLORA algorithm to allow for (1) multiple classification and (2) numerical input values, while improving its concept drift handling capabilities; thus, making it an excellent choice for use in the area of ambient computing. The multiple classification allows context-aware systems to differentiate between multiple categories instead of taking binary decisions. Support for numerical input values enables the processing of arbitrary sensor inputs beyond nominal data. To provide the capability of concept drift handling, we propose the use of an advanced window adjustment heuristic, which allows FLORA-MC to continuously adapt to the user's behavior, even if her/his preferences change abruptly over time. In combination with the inherent characteristics of online learning algorithms, our scheme is very well suited for realtime application in the area of ambient and pervasive computing. We describe the design and implementation of FLORA-MC and evaluate its performance vs. state-of-the-art learning algorithms. We are able to show the superior performance of our algorithm with respect to reaction time and concept drift handling, while maintaining an excellent accuracy. Our implementation is available to the research community as a WEKA module.

Discovering speech phones using convolutive non-negative matrix factorisation with a sparseness constraint	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Non-negative matrix factorisation; Sparse representations; Convolutive dictionaries; Speech phone analysis	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SEPARATION; DECONVOLUTION; ALGORITHMS; INPUTS	Discovering a representation that allows auditory data to be parsimoniously represented is useful for many machine learning and signal processing tasks. Such a representation can be constructed by non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF), a method for finding parts-based representations of non-negative data. Here, we present an extension to convolutive NMF that includes a sparseness constraint, where the resultant algorithm has multiplicative updates and utilises the beta divergence as its reconstruction objective. In combination with a spectral magnitude transform of speech, this method discovers auditory objects that resemble speech phones along with their associated sparse activation patterns. We use these in a supervised separation scheme for monophonic mixtures, finding improved separation performance in comparison to standard convolutive NMF. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Enhancing the correntropy MACE filter with random projections	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Minimum average correlation energy; Pattern recognition; Correntropy; Random projection; Dimensionality reduction; Face recognition	PATTERN-RECOGNITION; SIGNAL	The minimum average correlation energy (MACE) filter is a well known correlation filter for object recognition. Recently, a nonlinear extension to the MACE filter using the correntropy function in feature space has been introduced. Correntropy is a positive definite function that generalizes the concept of correlation by utilizing higher order moment information of signal structure. Since the MACE is a spatial matched filter for an image class, the correntropy MACE (CMACE) can potentially improve its performance. Both the MACE and CMACE are basically memory-based algorithms and due to the high dimensionality of the image data, the computational cost of the CMACE filter is one of the critical issues in practical applications. We propose to use a dimensionality reduction method based on random projections (RP), which has emerged as a powerful method for dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We apply the CMACE filter with random projection (CMACE-RP) to face recognition and show that it indeed outperforms the traditional linear MACE in both generalization and rejection abilities with small degradation in performance, but great savings in storage and computational complexity.

One key strength of ELM is the significantly low computational time required for training new classifiers since the weights of the hidden and output nodes are randomly chosen and analytically determined, respectively. In this paper, we address the architectural design of the ELM classifier network, since too few/many hidden nodes employed would lead to underfitting/overfitting issues in pattern classification. In particular, we describe the proposed pruned-ELM (P-ELM) algorithm as a systematic and automated approach for designing ELM classifier network. P-ELM uses statistical methods to measure the relevance of hidden nodes. Beginning from an initial large number of hidden nodes, irrelevant nodes are then pruned by considering their relevance to the class labels. As a result, the architectural design of ELM network classifier can be automated. Empirical study of P-ELM on several commonly used classification benchmark problems and with diverse forms of hidden node functions show that the proposed approach leads to compact network classifiers that generate fast response and robust prediction accuracy on unseen data, comparing with traditional ELM and other popular machine learning approaches.

A granular-oriented development of functional radial basis function neural networks	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Functional neuron; Local models; Receptive fields; Fuzzy clustering; Context-based fuzzy clustering; Information granules	RBF NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; CONSTRUCTION; RECOGNITION; PERFORMANCE	In this study, we develop a design methodology for generalized radial basis function neural networks. In contrast with the plethora of existing approaches, here we promote a development strategy in which a topology of the network is predominantly based upon a collection of information granules formed on a basis of available experimental data. The output space is granulated making use of the K-means clustering while the input space is clustered with the aid of a so-called context-based fuzzy clustering. The number of information granules produced for each context is adjusted so that we satisfy a certain reconstructability criterion that helps us minimize an error between the original data and the ones resulting from their reconstruction involving prototypes of the clusters and the corresponding membership values. In contrast to "standard" radial basis function neural networks, the output neuron of the network exhibits a certain functional nature as its connections are realized its local linear or quadratic functions whose location is determined by the values of the context and the prototypes in the input space. The other parameters of these local functions are subject to further parametric optimization. Numeric examples involve sonic low-dimensional synthetic data and selected data coming from the Machine Learning repository. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Whalley, I				Whalley, Ian			HIEMPA: Hybrid Instruments from Electroacoustic Manipulation and Models of Putorino and Aquascape	ORGANISED SOUND			English	Article								The HIEMPA project combined a team of people with technical, artistic, environmental and cultural expertise towards an artistic outcome aiming to extend the New Zealand sonic art tradition. The work involved collecting audio samples from the aquascape of the Ruakuri Caves and Nature Reserve in Waitomo, South Waikato, New Zealand; and samples of a variety of putorino - a New Zealand Maori wind instrument. Following a machine learning analysis of this audio material and an analysis of the performance material, hybrid digital instruments were built and mapped to suitable hardware triggers. The new instruments are playable in realtime, along with the electroacoustic manipulation of putorino performances. The project takes into account the environmental and cultural significance of the source material, with the results to be released as a set of compositions. This paper discusses the background research and process of the project.

J	Xiang, SM; Nie, FP; Zhang, CS				Xiang, Shiming; Nie, Feiping; Zhang, Changshui			Learning a Mahalanobis distance metric for data clustering and classification	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						distance metric learning; Mahalanobis distance; global optimization; data clustering; interactive image segmentation; face pose estimation	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR CLASSIFICATION; IMAGE RETRIEVAL; FACE RECOGNITION; CONSTRAINTS; ALGORITHM	Distance metric is a key issue in many machine learning algorithms. This paper considers a general problem of learning from pairwise constraints in the form of must-links and cannot-links. As one kind of side information, a must-link indicates the pair of the two data points must be in a same class, while a cannot-link indicates that the two data points must be in two different classes. Given must-link and cannot-link information, our goal is to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric. Under this metric, we hope the distances of point pairs in must-links are as small as possible and those of point pairs in cannot-links are as large as possible. This task is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, in which the global optimum can be obtained effectively and efficiently. Finally, some applications in data clustering, interactive natural image segmentation and face pose estimation are given in this paper. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Supervised dimensionality reduction via sequential semidefinite programming	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						dimensionality reduction; semidefinite programming; linear discriminant analysis	LARGEST EIGENVALUES; FACE RECOGNITION; MATRIX; CRITERION	Many dimensionality reduction problems end up with a trace quotient formulation. Since it is difficult to directly solve the trace quotient problem, traditionally the trace quotient cost function is replaced by an approximation such that the generalized eigenvalue decomposition can be applied. In contrast, we directly optimize the trace quotient in this work. It is reformulated as a quasi-linear semidefinite optimization problem, which can be solved globally and efficiently using standard off-the-shelf semidefinite programming solvers. Also this optimization strategy allows one to enforce additional constraints (for example. sparseness constraints) on the projection matrix. We apply this optimization framework to a novel dimensionality reduction algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in experiments by several UCI machine learning benchmark examples, USPS handwritten digits as well as ORL and Yale face data.

Enhancing the activity and stability of PEPs under gastric conditions (low pH, high pepsin concentration) is a challenge for protein engineers. Using a combination of sequence- and structure-based approaches together with machine learning algorithms, we have identified improved variants of the Sphingomonas capsulata PEP, a target of clinical relevance. Through two rounds of iterative mutagenesis and analysis, variants with as much as 20% enhanced specific activity at pH 4.5 and 200-fold greater resistance to pepsin were identified. Our results vividly reinforce the concept that conservative changes in proteins, especially in hydrophobic residues within tightly packed regions, can profoundly influence protein structure and function in ways that are difficult to predict entirely from first principles and must therefore be optimized through iterative design and analytical cycles. Incubation with whole wheat bread under simulated gastric conditions also suggests that some variants have pharmacologically significant improvements in gluten detoxification activity.

The machine condition is assessed through a suitable 'monitoring index' extracted from the vibration signals. The progression of the monitoring index is predicted using an SC technique, namely adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Comparison with a machine learning method, namely Support vector regression (SVR), is also presented. The proposed prediction procedures have been evaluated through benchmark data sets. The prognostic effectiveness of the techniques has been illustrated through previously published data on several types Of faults in machines. The performance of SVR was found to be better than ANFIS for the data sets used. The results are helpful in understanding the relationship of machine conditions, the corresponding indicating features, the level of damage/degradation and their progression. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The GA-MLR method was used to select the most appropriate molecular descriptors from a large set of descriptors, which were only calculated from molecular structures, and develop a linear quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model at the same time. On the basis of the selected descriptors, the other two more accurate models (LS-SVM and PPR) were built. Both the linear and nonlinear modes gave good prediction results, but the nonlinear models afforded better prediction ability, which meant that the LS-SVM and PPR methods could simulate the relationship between the structural descriptors and fungicidal activities more accurately. The results show that the nonlinear methods (LS-SVM and PPR) could be used as good modeling tools for the study of rice blast. Moreover, this study provides a new and simple but efficient approach, which should facilitate the design and development of new,compounds to resist the rice blast disease.

In the three previous papers of this series (Polymer 45 (2004) 3845-3853; Polymer 46 (2005) 2791-2798: and Polymer 46 (2005) 6461-6473) we focused on the uses of molecular graph parameters called topological indices (TIs) to link the structure of polymers with their biological properties. However, there has been little effort to extend these TIs to the Study of complex mixtures of artificial polymers OF biopolymers such as nucleic acids and proteins. In this sense, Blood Proteome (BP) is one of the most important and complex mixtures containing protein polymers. For instance, outcomes obtained by Mass Spectrometry (MS) analysis of BP are very useful for the early detection of diseases and drug-induced toxicities. Here, we use two Spiral and Star Network representations of the MS outcomes and defined a new type of TIs. The new TIs introduced here are the spectral moments (pi(k)) of the stochastic matrix associated to the Spiral graph and describe non-linear relationships between the different regions of the MS characteristic of BR We used the MARCH-INSIDE approach to calculate the pi(k)(SN) of different BP samples and S2SNet to determine several Star graph TIs. In the second step, we develop the corresponding Quantitative Proteome-Property Relationship (QPPR) models using the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). QPPRs are the analogues of QSPRs in the case of complex biopolymer mixtures. Specifically, the new QPPRs derived here may be used to detect drug-induced cardiac toxicities from BP samples. Different Machine Learning classification algorithms were used to fit the QPPRs based on pi(k)(SN), showing J48 decision tree classifier to have the best performance. These results suggest that the present approach Captures important features of the complex biopolymers mixtures and opens new opportunities to the application of the idea supporting classic QSPRs in polymer sciences.

J	Yu, J; Lee, H; Kim, MS; Park, D				Yu, Jaehak; Lee, Hansung; Kim, Myung-Sup; Park, Daihee			Traffic flooding attack detection with SNMP MIB using SVM	COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Intrusion detection; SNMP; MIB; DoS/DDoS; Support vector machine	INTRUSION-DETECTION	Recently, as network flooding attacks such as DoS/DDoS and Internet Worm have posed devastating threats to network services, rapid detection and proper response mechanisms are the major concern for secure and reliable network services. However, most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) focus on detail analysis of packet data, which results in late detection and a high system burden to cope with high-speed network traffic. Little or no integration exists between IDS and SNMP-based network management, in spite of the extensive monitoring and statistical information provided by SNMP agents implemented on network devices and systems. In this paper we propose a lightweight and fast detection mechanism for traffic flooding attacks. Firstly, we use SNMP MIB statistical data gathered from SNMP agents, instead of raw packet data from network links. The involved SNMP MIB variables are selected by an effective feature selection mechanism and gathered effectively by the MIB update time prediction mechanism. Secondly, we use a machine learning approach based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for attack classification. Using MIB and SVM, we achieved fast detection with high accuracy. the minimization of the system burden, and extendibility for system deployment. The proposed mechanism is constructed in a hierarchical structure, which first distinguishes attack traffic from normal traffic and then determines the type of attacks in detail. Using MIB datasets collected from real experiments involving a DDoS attack, we validate the possibility of our approaches. It is shown that network attacks are detected with high efficiency, and classified with low false alarms. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Use of machine learning algorithms to classify binary protein sequences as highly-designable or poorly-designable	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							SELF-AVOIDING WALKS; GROUND-STATE CANDIDATES; TRANSFER-MATRIX METHOD; THERMOPHILIC ADAPTATION; LATTICE-MODEL; CUBIC LATTICE; ENUMERATION; CONFORMATIONS; GENERATION; STABILITY	Background: By using a standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) method of training, Nave Bayes and other machine learning algorithms we are able to distinguish between two classes of protein sequences: those folding to highly-designable conformations, or those folding to poorly-or non-designable conformations. Results: First, we generate all possible compact lattice conformations for the specified shape (a hexagon or a triangle) on the 2D triangular lattice. Then we generate all possible binary hydrophobic/polar (H/P) sequences and by using a specified energy function, thread them through all of these compact conformations. If for a given sequence the lowest energy is obtained for a particular lattice conformation we assume that this sequence folds to that conformation. Highly-designable conformations have many H/P sequences folding to them, while poorly-designable conformations have few or no H/P sequences. We classify sequences as folding to either highly or poorly-designable conformations. We have randomly selected subsets of the sequences belonging to highly-designable and poorly-designable conformations and used them to train several different standard machine learning algorithms. Conclusion: By using these machine learning algorithms with ten-fold cross-validation we are able to classify the two classes of sequences with high accuracy - in some cases exceeding 95%.

Here, we apply an original metabolome representation, termed Network of Interacting Pathways or NIP, with a combination of graph theoretical and machine learning strategies, to address this question. NIPs compress the information of the metabolic network exhibited by a species into much smaller networks of overlapping metabolic pathways, where nodes are pathways and links are the metabolites they exchange. Results: Our analysis shows that a small set of descriptors of the structure and complexity of the NIPs combined into regression models reproduce very accurately reference phylogenetic distances derived from 16S rRNA sequences (10-fold cross-validation correlation coefficient higher than 0.9). Our method also showed better scores than previous work on metabolism-based phylogenetic reconstructions, as assessed by branch distances score, topological similarity and second cousins score. Thus, our metabolome representation as network of overlapping metabolic pathways captures sufficient information about the underlying evolutionary events leading to the formation of metabolic networks and species phylogeny. It is important to note that precise knowledge of all of the reactions in these pathways is not required for these reconstructions. These observations underscore the potential for the use of abstract, modular representations of metabolic reactions as tools in studying the evolution of species.

However, most proteins that are associated are not actually in direct physical contact. Predicting physical interactions directly from microarrays is both a challenging and important task that we addressed by developing a novel machine learning method optimized for this task. Results: We validated our support vector machine-based method on several independent datasets. At the same levels of accuracy, our method recovered more experimentally observed physical interactions than a conventional correlation-based approach. Pairs predicted by our method to very likely interact were close in the overall network of interaction, suggesting our method as an aid for functional annotation. We applied the method to predict interactions in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). A Gene Ontology function annotation analysis and literature search revealed several probable and novel predictions worthy of future experimental validation. We therefore hope our new method will improve the annotation of interactions as one component of multi-source integrated systems.

One manifestation of this approach is based on a panel of luminescent bacterial bioreporters, harboring fusions of the luxCDABE operon to various stress-responsive gene promoters. Such sensors can report by a dose-dependent luminescent signal on the stress sensed by-the cells and thus on the presence of toxic compound(s), but they lack the ability to identify the chemicals involved. Here, we demonstrate how the use of a panel of such sensors might offer a solution to this drawback. Five selected Escherichia coli reporter strains harboring fusions of selected gene promoters (grpE, nhoA, oraA, lacZ and mipA) to luxCDABE were exposed to five model toxicants and to a toxicant-free control in a 40-repetition format. Each of the six treatments activated different promoters to different extents, producing its own unique fingerprint. Two machine learning schemes were challenged with the obtained data set: Bayesian decision theory and the nonparametric nearest-neighbor technique. The Bayesian classifiers performed better and were able to identify the sample's contents within 30 min with an error rate estimate that did not exceed 3% at a 95% confidence level and with zero false negatives. Performance in tap water and wastewater samples was similar. Given the coming of age of whole-cell sensing devices, pattern classification algorithms such as the ones described here offer a step toward the incorporation of reporter cells into future biosensor formats, including whole-cell arrays.

Application of two machine learning algorithms to genetic association studies in the presence of covariates	BMC GENETICS			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; VARIABLES	Background: Population-based investigations aimed at uncovering genotype-trait associations often involve high-dimensional genetic polymorphism data as well as information on multiple environmental and clinical parameters. Machine learning (ML) algorithms offer a straightforward analytic approach for selecting subsets of these inputs that are most predictive of a pre-defined trait. The performance of these algorithms, however, in the presence of covariates is not well characterized. Methods and Results: In this manuscript, we investigate two approaches: Random Forests (RFs) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). Through multiple simulation studies, the performance under several underlying models is evaluated. An application to a cohort of HIV-1 infected individuals receiving anti-retroviral therapies is also provided. Conclusion: Consistent with more traditional regression modeling theory, our findings highlight the importance of considering the nature of underlying gene-covariate-trait relationships before applying ML algorithms, particularly when there is potential confounding or effect mediation.

ISINA: INTEGRAL Source Identification Network Algorithm	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: data analysis; catalogues; surveys	RAY SURVEY CATALOG; IMAGER	We give an overview of ISINA: INTEGRAL Source Identification Network Algorithm. This machine learning algorithm, using random forests, is applied to the IBIS/ISGRI data set in order to ease the production of unbiased future soft gamma-ray source catalogues. First, we introduce the data set and the problems encountered when dealing with images obtained using the coded mask technique. The initial step of source candidate searching is introduced and an initial candidate list is created. A description of the feature extraction on the initial candidate list is then performed together with feature merging for these candidates. Three training and testing sets are created in order to deal with the diverse time-scales encountered when dealing with the gamma-ray sky. Three independent random forests are built: one dealing with faint persistent source recognition, one dealing with strong persistent sources and a final one dealing with transients. For the latter, a new transient detection technique is introduced and described: the transient matrix. Finally the performance of the network is assessed and discussed using the testing set and some illustrative source examples.	[Scaringi, S.; Bird, A. J.; Clark, D. J.; Dean, A. J.; Hill, A.

J	Struyf, J; Dobrin, S; Page, D				Struyf, Jan; Dobrin, Seth; Page, David			Combining gene expression, demographic and clinical data in modeling disease: a case study of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article							SEX-DIFFERENCES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; BRAIN MORPHOLOGY; ASSOCIATION; SUPPORT; ABNORMALITIES; MICROARRAY; RECEPTORS; RELEVANCE	Background: This paper presents a retrospective statistical study on the newly-released data set by the Stanley Neuropathology Consortium on gene expression in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This data set contains gene expression data as well as limited demographic and clinical data for each subject. Previous studies using statistical classification or machine learning algorithms have focused on gene expression data only. The present paper investigates if such techniques can benefit from including demographic and clinical data. Results: We compare six classification algorithms: support vector machines (SVMs), nearest shrunken centroids, decision trees, ensemble of voters, nave Bayes, and nearest neighbor. SVMs outperform the other algorithms. Using expression data only, they yield an area under the ROC curve of 0.92 for bipolar disorder versus control, and 0.91 for schizophrenia versus control. By including demographic and clinical data, classification performance improves to 0.97 and 0.94 respectively. Conclusion: This paper demonstrates that SVMs can distinguish bipolar disorder and schizophrenia from normal control at a very high rate. Moreover, it shows that classification performance improves by including demographic and clinical data. We also found that some variables in this data set, such as alcohol and drug use, are strongly associated to the diseases. These variables may affect gene expression and make it more difficult to identify genes that are directly associated to the diseases. Stratification can correct for such variables, but we show that this reduces the power of the statistical methods.

This challenge is particularly difficult when attempting to detect H/ACA molecules which are involved in converting uridine to pseudouridine on rRNA in trypanosomes, because these organisms have unique H/ACA molecules (termed H/ACA-like) that lack several of the features that characterize H/ACA molecules in most other organisms. Results: We present here a computational tool called Psiscan, which was designed to detect H/ACA-like molecules in trypanosomes. We started by analyzing known H/ACA-like molecules and characterized their crucial elements both computationally and experimentally. Next, we set up constraints based on this analysis and additional phylogenic and functional data to rapidly scan three trypanosome genomes (T. brucei, T. cruzi and L. major) for sequences that observe these constraints and are conserved among the species. In the next step, we used minimal energy calculation to select the molecules that are predicted to fold into a lowest energy structure that is consistent with the constraints. In the final computational step, we used a Support Vector Machine that was trained on known H/ACA-like molecules as positive examples and on negative examples of molecules that were identified by the computational analyses but were shown experimentally not to be H/ACA-like molecules. The leading candidate molecules predicted by the SVM model were then subjected to experimental validation. Conclusion: The experimental validation showed 11 molecules to be expressed (4 out of 25 in the intermediate stage and 7 out of 19 in the final validation after the machine learning stage). Five of these 11 molecules were further shown to be bona fide H/ACA-like molecules. As snoRNA in trypanosomes are organized in clusters, the new H/ACA-like molecules could be used as starting points to manually search for additional molecules in their neighbourhood. All together this study increased our repertoire by fourteen H/ACA-like and six C/D snoRNAs molecules from T. brucei and L. Major. In addition the experimental analysis revealed that six ncRNA molecules that are expressed are not downregulated in CBF5 silenced cells, suggesting that they have structural features of H/ACA-like molecules but do not have their standard function. We termed this novel class of molecules AGA-like, and we are exploring their function. This study demonstrates the power of tight collaboration between computational and experimental approaches in a combined effort to reveal the repertoire of ncRNA molecles.

As one of the members of the International Space Environment Service (ISES), Regional Warning Center of China (RWC-China) was set up in 1990's. Solar Activity Prediction Center (SAPC), as one of the four sub-centers of RWC-China, is located in NAOC. Solar activity prediction studies and services in NAOC cover short-term, medium-term, and long-term forecast of solar activities. Nowadays, certain prediction models, such as solar X-ray flare model, solar proton event model, solar 10 cm radio flux model, have been established for the practical prediction services. Recently, more and more physical analyses are introduced in the studies of solar activity prediction, such as the magnetic properties of solar active regions and magnetic structure of solar atmosphere. Besides traditional statistics algorithms, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) method, are employed in the establishment of forecast models. A Web-based integrated platform for solar activity data sharing and forecast distribution is under construction. (C) 2007 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Chiu, SH; Chen, CC; Lin, TH				Chiu, Shih-Hau; Chen, Chien-Chi; Lin, Thy-Hou			Using support vector regression to model the correlation between the clinical metastases time and gene expression profile for breast cancer	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Breast cancer; Support vector regression; Feature selection; Metastases time; Microarray	MICROARRAY DATA; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; SIGNATURE; PREDICTOR; PROGNOSIS; SELECTION; SURVIVAL; OUTCOMES	Objective: Recently, the microarray analysis has been an important tool used for studying the cancer type, biological mechanism, and diagnostic biomarkers. There are several machine-learning methods being used to construct the prognostic model based on the microarray data sets. However, most of these previous studies were focused on the supervised classification for predicting the clinical type of patients. In this study, we investigate whether or not the expression level of some significant genes identified can be used to predict the clinical metastases time of patients. Materials and methods: We have used a regression method to remodel the data set of breast cancer published in 2002. Some significant genes were ranked and selected based on a wrapper method with 10-fold cross-validation procedure and the selected genes were used to fit the support vector regression (SVR) model. This method could model the relationship between the significant gene expression value and the clinical metastases time of breast cancer. Results: 44 significant genes are selected for building the regression model and the corresponding cross-validated correlation coefficient obtained is 0.82 which is much superior to those reported previously by others using some different data sets. Moreover, there are two breast cancer related genes (the ligand 14 of the chemokine C-X-C motif (CXCL14) and estrogen receptor gene (ER)) selected in the gene set and one of them is never been included in the other data sets. Conclusion: In this report, we have shown that the expression level of some significant genes identified could strongly correlate with the clinical metastases time of breast cancer patients. The 44 selected genes may be used as a benchmark to evaluate the risk of recurrence of breast cancer. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Even though a large number of miRNAs have been identified, annotating their functions remains a challenge. We develop a computational, transcriptome-based approach to annotating stress-inducible microRNAs in plants. With this approach, we find that nineteen microRNA genes of eleven microRNA families in Arabidopsis thaliana are up-regulated by cold stress. Our experiments validate that among the eleven microRNAs, eight are differentially induced and three are constantly expressed under low temperature. Our result expands the number of cold-inducible microRNAs from four to eight. A promoter analysis further reveals that the cold-responsive microRNA genes contain many known stress-related cis-regulatory elements in their promoters. Our analysis also indicates that many signaling pathways, such as auxin pathways, may be affected by cold-inducible microRNAs. Our approach can be applied to plant microRNAs responding to other abiotic and biotic stresses. The research demonstrates that machine learning methods, augmented by wet-lab analysis, hold a great promise for functional annotation of microRNAs. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recent years have seen substantial effort being put in the development of algorithms for the systematic evaluation and optimization of neuron models with respect to electrophysiological data. It is however difficult to compare these methods because of the lack of appropriate benchmark tests. Here, we describe one such effort of providing the community with a standardized set of tests to quantify the performances of single neuron models. Our effort takes the form of a yearly challenge similar to the ones which have been present in the machine learning community for some time. This paper gives an account of the first two challenges which took place in 2007 and 2008 and discusses future directions. The results of the competition suggest that best performance on data obtained from single or double electrode current or conductance injection is achieved by models that combine features of standard leaky integrate-and-fire models with a second variable reflecting adaptation, refractoriness, or a dynamic threshold.

Accuracy of dementia diagnosisa direct comparison between radiologists and a computerized method	BRAIN			English	Article							DIMENSIONAL PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BRAIN ATROPHY; WORK GROUP; CONSENSUS; HEALTHY; MRI; AD	There has been recent interest in the application of machine learning techniques to neuroimaging-based diagnosis. These methods promise fully automated, standard PC-based clinical decisions, unbiased by variable radiological expertise. We recently used support vector machines (SVMs) to separate sporadic Alzheimers disease from normal ageing and from fronto-temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). In this study, we compare the results to those obtained by radiologists. A binary diagnostic classification was made by six radiologists with different levels of experience on the same scans and information that had been previously analysed with SVM. SVMs correctly classified 95 (sensitivity/specificity: 95/95) of sporadic Alzheimers disease and controls into their respective groups. Radiologists correctly classified 6595 (median 89; sensitivity/specificity: 88/90) of scans. SVM correctly classified another set of sporadic Alzheimers disease in 93 (sensitivity/specificity: 100/86) of cases, whereas radiologists ranged between 80 and 90 (median 83; sensitivity/specificity: 80/85). SVMs were better at separating patients with sporadic Alzheimers disease from those with FTLD (SVM 89; sensitivity/specificity: 83/95; compared to radiological range from 63 to 83; median 71; sensitivity/specificity: 64/76). Radiologists were always accurate when they reported a high degree of diagnostic confidence. The results show that well-trained neuroradiologists classify typical Alzheimers disease-associated scans comparable to SVMs. However, SVMs require no expert knowledge and trained SVMs can readily be exchanged between centres for use in diagnostic classification. These results are encouraging and indicate a role for computerized diagnostic methods in clinical practice.

This technique has two key features: it provides natural character behavior and has a programming-by-demonstration interface. Thus we can quickly create compelling autonomous virtual agents that exhibit stylized behavior. First, the human user demonstrates behavior for the character by specifying its high-level actions (e.g., with a joystick) during an interactive session. Each demonstration is recorded as a sequence of discrete actions. Later, the character synthesizes novel behavior by concatenating segments of action sequences. The choice of segments is guided by simulations that predict fitness. Thus our technique operates such as a cognitive model, providing a character with deliberative decision making. The actions are abstract and can be mapped to any pertinent motions, even procedurally synthesized motions. Thus our technique complements character animation algorithms. We empirically show that our O(log n) technique is scalable, robust when provided with sufficient data, produces effective behavior for a number of problem domains, and is faster than traditional planning. Also, the interface is intuitive enough that character behavior can be created by nontechnical users.

Artificial neural network-based glaucoma diagnosis using retinal nerve fiber layer analysis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article						Artificial neural network; Primary open angle glaucoma; Optical coherence tomography; GDx Variable Corneal Compensation	OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY; SCANNING LASER POLARIMETRY; MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIERS; VISUAL-FIELD; AUTOMATED PERIMETRY; DETECT GLAUCOMA; ALGORITHMS; EYES; OPHTHALMOSCOPE; DISK	PURPOSE. To develop, train, and test an artificial neural network (ANN) for differentiating among normal subjects, primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) suspects, and persons with POAG in Asian-Indian eyes using inputs from clinical parameters, optical coherence tomography (OCT), visual fields, and GDx nerve fiber analyzer. METHODS. One hundred eyes were classified using optic disc examination and perimetry into normal (n=35), POAG suspects (n=30), and POAG (n=35). EasyNN-plus simulator was used to develop an ANN model with inputs including age, sex, myopia, intraocular pressure (IOP), optic nerve head, and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) parameters on OCT, Octopus 30-2 full threshold visual field, and GDx parameters. RESULTS. With two outputs (POAG or normal), specificity was 80% and sensitivity was 93.3%. Ninety percent of POAG suspects were labeled a,,; abnormal in this analysis. ANN assigned the highest importance to Smax/Imax RNFL on OCT followed by cup-area (OCT) and other RNFL parameters (OCT) for two outputs. With three outputs (normal, POAG, and POAG suspect), ANN gave an overall classification rate of 65%, specificity of 60%, and sensitivity of 71.4% with a target error rate of the training set at 1%. The parameters for three outputs, in decreasing order of relative importance, were Savg, vertical cup-disc ratio, cup-volume, and cup-area on OCT CONCLUSIONS. An ANN taking varied diagnostic imaging inputs was able to separate POAG eyes from normal subjects and POAG suspects. The network had reasonable sensitivity with three outputs; however, it had a tendency to mislabel POAG suspects as POAG. (Eur J Ophthalmol 2008; 18: 915-21)	[Grewal, D. S.; Jain, R.; Grewal, S. P.

J	Shih, DH; Chiang, HS; Lin, BS				Shih, Dong-Her; Chiang, Hsiu-Sen; Lin, Binshan			Collaborative spam filtering with heterogeneous agents	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						spam; spam filtering; anti-spam; collaborative learning; heterogeneous; multi-agent	DESIGN; SYSTEM; CATEGORIZATION; MANAGEMENT	Spam continues to generate great interest both among academicians and practitioners. Many spam filtering techniques have made considerable progress in recent years. The predominant approaches include data mining methods and machine learning methods. Researchers have largely focused on either one of the approaches since a unified framework is still lacking. To fill the gap in the literature, this paper inherits the credit-assignment problem by proposing a collaborative learning framework that could credit or blame each selected heterogeneous technique. The results of this study indicate that the collaborative learning framework is simple and comprehensible. In addition, we found that the framework offers a principle solution to combine heterogeneous individual technique to collaborative filtering for anti-spam problems. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Integrating web taxonomies is to transfer instances from a source to target taxonomy. Unlike the conventional text categorization problem, in taxonomy integration, the source taxonomy contains extra information that can be used to improve the categorization. The major existing methods can be divided in two types: those that use neighboring categories to smooth the document term vector and those that consider the semantic relationship between corresponding categories of the target and source taxonomies to facilitate categorization. In contrast to the first type of approach, which only uses a flattened hierarchy for smoothing, we apply a hierarchy shrinkage algorithm to smooth child documents by their parents. We also discuss the effect of using different hierarchical levels for smoothing. To extend the second type of approach, we extract fine-grain semantic relationships, which consider the relationships between lower-level categories. In addition, we use the cosine similarity to measure the semantic relationships, which achieves better performance than existing methods. Finally, we integrate the existing approaches and the proposed methods into one machine learning model to find the best feature configuration. The results of experiments oil real Internet data demonstrate that our system outperforms standard text classifiers by about 10%. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Audioprofile-directed screening identifies novel mutations in KCNQ4 causing hearing loss at the DFNA2 locus	GENETICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						KCNQ4; DFNA2; hearing loss; AudioGene v2.0; audioprofiling	OUTER HAIR-CELLS; DOMINANT DEAFNESS; GENE; IMPAIRMENT; EXPRESSION; DFNA2/KCNQ4; FAMILIES; DELETION; REGION; MICE	Purpose: Gene identification in small families segregating autosomal dominant sensorineural hearing loss presents a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we have developed a machine learning-based software tool, AudioGene v2.0, to prioritize candidate genes for mutation screening based on audioprofiling. Methods: We analyzed audiometric data from a cohort of American families with high-frequency autosomal dominant sensorineural hearing loss. Those families predicted to have a DFNA2 audioprofile by AudioGene v2.0 were screened for mutations in the KCNQ4 gene. Results: Two novel missense mutations and a stop mutation were detected in three American families predicted to have DFNA2-related deafness for a positive predictive value of 6.3%. The false negative rate was 0%. The missense mutations were located in the channel pore region and the stop mutation was in transmembrane domain S5. The latter is the first DFNA2-causing stop mutation reported in KCNQ4. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the N-terminal end of the P-loop is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the KCNQ4 channel pore and AudioGene audioprofile analysis can effectively prioritize genes for mutation screening in small families segregating high-frequency autosomal dominant sensorineural hearing loss. AudioGene software will be made freely available to clinicians and researchers once it has been fully validated. Genet Med 2008:10(11):797-804.

J	Khashman, A				Khashman, Adnan			A Modified Backpropagation Learning Algorithm With Added Emotional Coefficients	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Anxiety and confidence; backpropagation (BP); emotional neural networks; face recognition	FACE RECOGNITION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SYSTEMS; MODEL; REPRESENTATION; TIME	Much of the research work into artificial intelligence (AI) has been focusing on exploring various potential applications of intelligent systems with successful results in most cases. In our attempts to model human intelligence by mimicking the brain structure and function, we overlook an important aspect in human learning and decision making: the emotional factor. While it currently sounds impossible to have "machines with emotions," it is quite conceivable to artificially simulate some emotions in machine learning. This paper presents a modified backpropagation (BP) learning algorithm, namely, the emotional backpropagation (EmBP) learning algorithm. The new algorithm has additional emotional weights that are updated using two additional emotional parameters: anxiety and confidence. The proposed "emotional" neural network will be implemented to a facial recognition problem, and the results will be compared to a similar application using a conventional neural network. Experimental results show that the addition of the two novel emotional parameters improves the performance of the neural network yielding higher recognition rates and faster recognition time.

In the adaptive system training context, the main drawback of utilizing output error entropy as compared to correlation-estimation-based second-order statistics is the computational load of the entropy estimation, which is usually obtained via a plug-in kernel estimator. Sample-spacing estimates offer computationally inexpensive entropy estimators; however, resulting estimates are not differentiable, hence, not suitable for gradient-based adaptation. In this brief paper, we propose a nonparametric entropy estimator that captures the desirable properties of both approaches. The resulting estimator yields continuously differentiable estimates with a computational complexity at the order of those of the sample-spacing techniques. The proposed estimator is compared with the kernel density estimation (KDE)-based entropy estimator in the supervised neural network training framework with computation time and performance comparisons.

SARA: Stochastic automata rate adaptation for IEEE 802.11 networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS			English	Article						automatic fallback; IEEE 802.11 MAC; packet success rate; rate adaptation; reinforcement learning; Stochastic Learning Automata		Existing rate adaptation algorithms can broadly be classified under two categories: 1) signal-to-noise-ratio measurement based and 2) statistical count based. While the former suffers from inaccurate estimations, the latter utilizes predefined thresholds for dynamically varying the rate, rendering the adaptation process across varied channel conditions erroneous. In this paper, we first analyze the impact of transmission rate on the performance of a wireless link. Specifically, we emphasize that performance may either improve or deteriorate with increasing transmission rates, and hence, no specific trends can be generalized for the behavior of performance versus rate. Based on this observation, we then propose the Stochastic Automata Rate Adaptation Algorithm (SARA). SARA is inspired by Stochastic Learning Automata (SLA), a machine learning technique for adaptation in random environments. SARA assigns a selection probability to each of the transmission rates. It then randomly selects a rate for a transmission attempt and dynamically updates the probabilities based on the obtained feedback from the receiver (ACK/NACK), thereby obviating the need for explicit channel estimation or predefined thresholds. As opposed to the previous work in this area, SARA is ideally suited for both stationary and nonstationary channel environments and is fully compatible with the existing IEEE 802.11 MAC standard. We compare the performance of our proposed protocol with Automatic Rate Fallback (ARF) thoroughly and Adaptive ARF (AARF) and other existing protocols, under different channel scenarios.

Localized content-based image retrieval	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						machine learning; content-based image retrieval; multiple-instance learning; salient points	CATEGORIZATION	We define a localized content-based image retrieval as a CBIR task where the user is only interested in a portion of the image, and the rest of the image is irrelevant. In this paper, we present a localized CBIR system, ACCIO!, that uses labeled images in conjunction with a multiple-instance learning algorithm to first identify the desired object and weight the features accordingly, and then to rank images in the database using a similarity measure that is based upon only the relevant portions of the image. A challenge for localized CBIR is how to represent the image to capture the content. We present and compare two novel image representations, which extend traditional segmentation-based and salient point-based techniques, respectively, to capture content in a localized CBIR setting.

J	Wang, XJ; Zhang, L; Li, XR; Ma, WY				Wang, Xin-Jing; Zhang, Lei; Li, Xirong; Ma, Wei-Ying			Annotating images by mining image search results	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						clustering; information filtering; object recognition; real-time systems	RETRIEVAL; PICTURES	Although it has been studied for years by the computer vision and machine learning communities, image annotation is still far from practical. In this paper, we propose a novel attempt at model-free image annotation, which is a data-driven approach that annotates images by mining their search results. Some 2.4 million images with their surrounding text are collected from a few photo forums to support this approach. The entire process is formulated in a divide-and-conquer framework where a query keyword is provided along with the uncaptioned image to improve both the effectiveness and efficiency. This is helpful when the collected data set is not dense everywhere. In this sense, our approach contains three steps: 1) the search process to discover visually and semantically similar search results, 2) the mining process to identify salient terms from textual descriptions of the search results, and 3) the annotation rejection process to filter out noisy terms yielded by Step 2. To ensure real-time annotation, two key techniques are leveraged-one is to map the high-dimensional image visual features into hash codes, the other is to implement it as a distributed system, of which the search and mining processes are provided as Web services. As a typical result, the entire process finishes in less than 1 second. Since no training data set is required, our approach enables annotating with unlimited vocabulary and is highly scalable and robust to outliers. Experimental results on both real Web images and a benchmark image data set show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. It is also worth noting that, although the entire approach is illustrated within the divide-and-conquer framework, a query keyword is not crucial to our current implementation. We provide experimental results to prove this.

They cannot deal with the lack of labeled data and would require extensive laboratory training for each individual script, style, language, and collection. We propose a biologically inspired whole-word recognition method that is used to incrementally elicit word labels in a live Web-based annotation system, named Monk. Since human labor should be minimized given the massive amount of image data, it becomes important to rely on robust perceptual mechanisms in the machine. Recent computational models of the neurophysiology of vision are applied to isolated word classification. A primate cortex-like mechanism allows us to classify text images that have a low frequency of occurrence. Typically, these images are the most difficult to retrieve and often contain named entities and are regarded as the most important to people. Usually, standard pattern-recognition technology cannot deal with these text images if there are not enough labeled instances. The results of this retrieval system are compared to normalized word-image matching and appear to be very promising.

In particular, the kind of data noise inherent in software failure data is biased. There is no upper bound for the value of a noisy data point, but there is a lower bound of zero. This may lead to over-optimistic estimation of there liability when using maximum likelihood or least square methods based on standard software reliability models. We attempt to address this problem by modeling software failured at a using machine learning techniques such as support vector machine regression and generalized additive models, which have mechanisms that are capable of dealing with data noise. We then analyse the results from machine learning modeling, and compare them to that of some generalized linear modeling techniques that are equivalent to standard software reliability models. The validity of the machine learning modeling of noisy software failure data is evaluated through this comparison	[Zou, Fengzhong; Davis, Joseph] Univ Sydney, Sch Informat Technol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia	Zou, FZ (reprint author), Univ Sydney, Sch Informat Technol, Bldg J12,1 Cleveland St, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.

The predictive performance of models developed using these methods has traditionally been evaluated by assessing performance of the developed models against a portion of the data randomly selected for holdout. It has been our experience that Such assessments, while widely practiced, result in an optimistic assessment. This paper describes the development of a series of ensemble-based decision tree models, shares our experience at various stages in the model development process. and presents the impact of such models when they are applied to vendor offerings and the forecasted compounds are acquired and screened in the relevant assays. We have seen that well developed models can significantly increase the hit-rates observed in FITS campaigns.

This approach implements the combined use of a new machine-learning algorithm and of specified parameterized functions called Gaussian mesa functions (GMFs). Individual cardiac cycle waveforms are broken up into GMFs using a generalized orthogonal forward regression algorithm; each individual GMF is subsequently identified (wave labeling) and analyzed for feature and morphologic extraction. The GMF associated with the repolarization waveform of the main vector lead, based on principal components analysis, was analyzed, and a set of morphologic parameters were derived under 2 experimental settings: first, in 100 digital 12-lead ECG Holler recordings acquired during three 24-hour periods (baseline and after 160 and 320 mg of sotalol) from 38 healthy subjects; second, in drug-free 12-lead resting ECGs from 100 genotyped long QT syndrome (LQTS) patients (50 each with LQT1 and LQT2). QT-interval duration was measured using an on-screen method applied to the global representative beats and reviewed by a senior cardiologist. QTci (individual correction) was used for analysis. All parameters in the sotalol test showed highly significant differences between the time of peak plasma concentration (Tmax) and baseline ECGs; however, the dynamic pattern of individual parameters followed different patterns. The LQTS test confirmed the results of the sotalol test, showing that GMF-based repolarization parameters were strongly modified as compared with healthy controls. In particular, T-wave width and descending phase of repolarization were more prolonged in LQT2 compared to LQT1. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The model integrates the learning ability of the neural network with the inference mechanism of fuzzy logic. The empirical results show that the proposed neuro fuzzy model leads to a better prediction of crisis. Significantly, the model can also construct a reliable causal relationship among the variables through the obtained knowledge base. Compared to neural network and the traditionally used techniques such as logic, the proposed model can thus lead to a somewhat more prescriptive modeling approach based on determinate causal mechanisms towards finding ways to prevent currency crises.

MRI-Based Attenuation Correction for PET/MRI: A Novel Approach Combining Pattern Recognition and Atlas Registration	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PET/MR; attenuation correction; atlas; machine learning	GUIDED ATTENUATION; IMAGES; PET; SEGMENTATION; ALGORITHM; DISEASE; SCANNER	For quantitative PET information, correction of tissue photon attenuation is mandatory. Generally in conventional PET, the attenuation map is obtained from a transmission scan, which uses a rotating radionuclide source, or from the CT scan in a combined PET/CT scanner. In the case of PET/MRI scanners currently under development, insufficient space for the rotating source exists; the attenuation map can be calculated from the MR image instead. This task is challenging because MR intensities correlate with proton densities and tissue-relaxation properties, rather than with attenuation-related mass density. Methods: We used a combination of local pattern recognition and atlas registration, which captures global variation of anatomy, to predict pseudo-CT images from a given MR Image. These pseudo-CT images were then used for attenuation correction, as the process would be performed in a PET/CT scanner. Results: For human brain scans, we show on a database of 17 MR/CT image pairs that our method reliably enables estimation of a pseudo-CT image from the MR image alone. On additional datasets of MRI/PET/ CT triplets of human brain scans, we compare MRI-based attenuation correction with CT-based correction. Our approach enables PET quantification with a mean error of 3.2% for predefined regions of interest, which we found to be clinically not significant. However, our method is not specific to brain imaging, and we show promising Initial results on 1 whole-body animal dataset. Conclusion: This method allows reliable MRI-based attenuation correction for human brain scans. Further work is necessary to validate the method for whole-body imaging.

Regime Type and International Conflict: Towards a General Model	JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DEMOCRATIC PEACE; POLITICAL SIMILARITY; MILITARIZED DISPUTES; FOREIGN-POLICY; LIBERAL PEACE; WAR; UNCERTAINTY; TRADE	The authors take a new look at the relationship between regime type and deadly militarized conflict among pairs of states (dyads) in the international system. With the goal of describing the general functional form, they evaluate three perspectives: democratic peace, regime similarity and regime rationality. They employ both standard logistic regression (logit) and a recently developed machine learning technique, a support vector machine (SVM). Logit is dependent on assumptions that limit flexibility and make it difficult to discern the appropriate functional form. SVM estimation, on the other hand, is highly flexible and appears capable of discovering a relationship that is contingent on other variables in the model. SVM results indicate that regime similarity and joint democracy are important in most dyadic interactions. However, for the special but important case of the most dangerous dyads, regime rationality plays a role and the democratic peace effect is dominant. The results suggest that models of international conflict excluding distinct indicators for political similarity, joint democracy and joint autocracy may be misspecified. SVMs are an especially useful complement to conventional statistical methods.

J	Garcia-Pedrajas, N; Ortiz-Boyer, D				Garcia-Pedrajas, Nicolas; Ortiz-Boyer, Domingo			Boosting random subspace method	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Random subspace method; Boosting; Classification; Ensemble of classifiers	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CLASSIFIERS; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; ENSEMBLES; TESTS	In this paper we propose a boosting approach to random subspace method (RSM) to achieve an improved performance and avoid some of the major drawbacks of RSM. RSM is a successful method for classification. However, the random selection of inputs, its source of success, can also be a major problem. For several problems some of the selected subspaces may lack the discriminant ability to separate the different classes. These subspaces produce poor classifiers that harm the performance of the ensemble. Additionally, boosting RSM would also be an interesting approach for improving its performance. Nevertheless, the application of the two methods together. boosting and RSM, achieves poor results, worse than the results of each Method separately. In this work, we propose a new approach for combining RSM and boosting. Instead of obtaining random subspaces, we search subspaces that optimize the weighted classification error given by the boosting algorithm, and then the new classifier added to the ensemble is trained using the obtained subspace. An additional advantage of the proposed methodology is that it can be used with any classifier, including those, such as k nearest neighbor classifiers. that cannot use boosting methods easily. The proposed approach is compared with standard ADABOOST and RSM showing an improved performance on a large set of 45 problems from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. An additional study of the effect of noise on the labels of the training instances shows that the less aggressive versions of the proposed methodology are more robust than ADABOOST in the presence of noise.

Currently, there are no computer Go programs that can play at the level of a good human player. However, the emergence of large repositories of games is opening the door for new machine learning approaches to address this challenge. Here we develop a machine learning approach to Go. and related board games. focusing primarily on the problem of learning a good evaluation function in a scalable way. Scalability is essential at multiple levels, from the library of local tactical patterns. to the integration of patterns across the board, to the size of the board itself. The system we propose is capable of automatically learning the propensity of local patterns from a library of games. Propensity and other local tactical information are fed into recursive neural networks, derived from a probabilistic Bayesian network architecture. The recursive neural networks in turn integrate local information across the board in all four cardinal directions and produce local Outputs that represent local territory ownership probabilities. The aggregation of these probabilities provides an effective strategic evaluation function that is an estimate of the expected area at the end. or at various other stages, of the game. Local area targets tor training can be derived from datasets of games played by human players. In this approach, while requiring a learning time proportional to N(4). skills learned on a board of size N(2) can easily he transferred to boards of other sizes. A system trained using 9 X 9 amateur game data performs Surprisingly well on a test set derived from 19 x 19 professional game data. Possible directions for further improvements are briefly discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although localizations have been measured for many yeast proteins through systematic GFP fusions, similar studies in other branches of life are still forthcoming. In the interim, various machine-learning methods have been proposed to predict localization using physical characteristics of a protein, such as amino acid content, hydrophobicity, side-chain mass and domain composition. However, there has been comparatively little work on predicting localization using protein networks. Here, we predict protein localizations by integrating an extensive set of protein physical characteristics over a protein's extended protein-protein interaction neighborhood, using a classification framework called 'Divide and Conquer k-Nearest Neighbors' (DC-kNN). These predictions achieve significantly higher accuracy than two well-known methods for predicting protein localization in yeast. Using new GFP imaging experiments, we show that the network-based approach can extend and revise previous annotations made from high-throughput studies. Finally, we show that our approach remains highly predictive in higher eukaryotes such as fly and human, in which most localizations are unknown and the protein network coverage is less substantial.

J	Steinke, F; Scholkopf, B				Steinke, Florian; Schoelkopf, Bernhard			Kernels, regularization and differential equations	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						positive definite kernel; differential equation; Gaussian process; reproducing kernel Hilbert space	GAUSSIAN-PROCESSES; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SUPPORT; REGRESSION; TUTORIAL; CLASSIFICATION	Many common machine learning methods such as support vector machines or Gaussian process inference make use of positive definite kernels, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, Gaussian processes, and regularization operators. In this work these objects are presented in a general, unifying framework and interrelations are highlighted. With this in mind we then show how linear stochastic differential equation models can be incorporated naturally into the kernel framework. And vice vel-Sa, many kernel machines can be interpreted in terms of differential equations. We focus especially on ordinary differential equations, also known as dynamical systems, and it is shown that standard kernel inference algorithms are equivalent to Kalman filter methods based on such models. In order not to cloud qualitative insights with heavy mathematical machinery, we restrict Ourselves to finite domains, implying that differential equations are treated via their corresponding finite difference equations.

J	Toh, KA; Kim, J; Lee, S				Toh, Kar-Ann; Kim, Jaihie; Lee, Sangyoun			Maximizing area under ROC curve for biometric scores fusion	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						receiver operating characteristics; biometrics; decision fusion; machine learning; pattern classification	FINGERPRINT MINUTIAE; CLASSIFIER; AUTHENTICATION; VERIFICATION	The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve has been extensively used for performance evaluation in multimodal biometrics fusion. However, the processes of fusion classifier design and the final ROC performance evaluation are usually conducted separately. This has been inevitable because the ROC, when taken from the error counting point of view, does not have a well-posed structure linking to the fusion classifier of interest. In this work, we propose to optimize the ROC performance directly according to the fusion classifier design. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) will be used as the optimization objective since it provides a good representation of the ROC performance. Due to the piecewise cumulative structure of the AUC, a smooth approximate formulation is proposed. This enables a direct optimization of the AUC with respect to the classifier parameters. When a fusion classifier has linear parameters, Computation of the solution to optimize a quadratic AUC approximation is surprisingly simple and yet effective. Our empirical experiments on biometrics fusion show strong evidences regarding the potential of the proposed method. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The paper focusses on the images used, the task setup, and the results obtained in the evaluation campaign. Since 2005, the medical automatic image annotation task exists in ImageCLEF with increasing complexity to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art methods for completely automatic annotation of medical images based on visual properties. The paper also describes the evolution of the task from its origin in 2005-2007. The 2007 task, comprising 11,000 fully annotated training images and 1000 test images to be annotated, is a realistic task with a large number of possible classes at different levels of detail. Detailed analysis of the methods across participating groups is presented with respect to the (i) image representation, (ii) classification method, and (iii) use of the class hierarchy. The results show that methods which build on local image descriptors and discriminative models are able to provide good predictions of the image classes, mostly by using techniques that were originally developed in the machine learning and computer vision domain for object recognition in non-medical images.

Previous computational studies have used large expression datasets in order to resolve fine patterns of coexpression, producing clusters or modules of potentially coregulated genes. These methods typically examine promoter sequence information, such as DNA motifs or transcription factor occupancy data, in a separate step after clustering. We needed an alternative and more integrative approach to study the oxygen regulatory network in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a small dataset of perturbation experiments. Mechanisms of oxygen sensing and regulation underlie many physiological and pathological processes, and only a handful of oxygen regulators have been identified in previous studies. We used a new machine learning algorithm called MEDUSA to uncover detailed information about the oxygen regulatory network using genome-wide expression changes in response to perturbations in the levels of oxygen, heme, Hap1, and Co(2+). MEDUSA integrates mRNA expression, promoter sequence, and ChIP-chip occupancy data to learn a model that accurately predicts the differential expression of target genes in held-out data. We used a novel margin-based score to extract significant condition-specific regulators and assemble a global map of the oxygen sensing and regulatory network. This network includes both known oxygen and heme regulators, such as Hap1, Mga2, Hap4, and Upc2, as well as many new candidate regulators. MEDUSA also identified many DNA motifs that are consistent with previous experimentally identified transcription factor binding sites. Because MEDUSA's regulatory program associates regulators to target genes through their promoter sequences, we directly tested the predicted regulators for OLE1, a gene specifically induced under hypoxia, by experimental analysis of the activity of its promoter. In each case, deletion of the candidate regulator resulted in the predicted effect on promoter activity, confirming that several novel regulators identified by MEDUSA are indeed involved in oxygen regulation. MEDUSA can reveal important information from a small dataset and generate testable hypotheses for further experimental analysis. Supplemental data are included.

Isoform-specific variation in the intrinsic disorder of troponin I	PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						sequence; structure; dynamics; native unfolding; prediction; structural bioinformatics	HUMAN CARDIAC TROPONIN; HYDROPHOBIC CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; NATIVELY UNFOLDED PROTEINS; MUSCLE THIN-FILAMENTS; STRIATED-MUSCLE; CONFORMATIONAL TRANSITION; CONTRACTILE FUNCTION; CALCIUM SENSITIVITY; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; ENERGY CONTENT	Various intrinsic disorder (ID) prediction algorithms were applied to the three tissue isoforms of troponin I (TnI). The results were interpreted in terms of the known structure and dynamics of troponin. In line with previous results, all isoforms of TnI were predicted to have large stretches of ID. The predictions show that the C-termini of all isoforms are extensively disordered as is the N-terminal extension of the cardiac isoform. Cardiac TnI likely belongs to the group of intrinsically disordered signalling hub proteins. For a given portion of the protein sequence, most ID prediction approaches indicate isoform-dependent variations in the probability of disorder. Comparison of machine learning and physically based approaches suggests the ID variations are only partially attributable to local variations in the ratio of charged to hydrophobic residues. The VSL2B algorithm predicts the largest variations in ID across the isoforms, with the cardiac isoform having the highest probability of structured regions, and the fast-skeletal isoform having no intrinsic structure. The region corresponding to rest. dues 57-95 of the fast-skeletal isoform, known to form a coiled coil substructure with troponin T, was highly variable between isoforms. The isoform-specific ID variations may have mechanistic significance, modulating the extent to which conformational fluctuations in tropomyosin are communicated to the troponin complex. We discuss structural mechanisms for this communication. Overall, the results motivate the development of predictors designed to address relative levels of disorder between highly similar proteins.

J	Zhang, WB; Wang, Q; Suo, CG				Zhang, Wenbin; Wang, Qi; Suo, Chunguang			A Novel Vehicle Classification Using Embedded Strain Gauge Sensors	SENSORS			English	Article						Vehicle classification; Embedded strain gauge sensor; Support vector machine; Multisensor data fusion	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES	This paper presents a new vehicle classification and develops a traffic monitoring detector to provide reliable vehicle classification to aid traffic management systems. The basic principle of this approach is based on measuring the dynamic strain caused by vehicles across pavement to obtain the corresponding vehicle parameters wheelbase and number of axles - to then accurately classify the vehicle. A system prototype with five embedded strain sensors was developed to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the classification method. According to the special arrangement of the sensors and the different time a vehicle arrived at the sensors one can estimate the vehicle's speed accurately, corresponding to the estimated vehicle wheelbase and number of axles. Because of measurement errors and vehicle characteristics, there is a lot of overlap between vehicle wheelbase patterns. Therefore, directly setting up a fixed threshold for vehicle classification often leads to low-accuracy results. Using the machine learning pattern recognition method to deal with this problem is believed as one of the most effective tools. In this study, support vector machines (SVMs) were used to integrate the classification features extracted from the strain sensors to automatically classify vehicles into five types, ranging from small vehicles to combination trucks, along the lines of the Federal Highway Administration vehicle classification guide. Test bench and field experiments will be introduced in this paper. Two support vector machines classification algorithms (one-against-all, one-against-one) are used to classify single sensor data and multiple sensor combination data. Comparison of the two classification method results shows that the classification accuracy is very close using single data or multiple data. Our results indicate that using multiclass SVM-based fusion multiple sensor data significantly improves the results of a single sensor data, which is trained on the whole multisensor data set.

There have recently been some attempts to build dialogue systems in Spanish, and some corpora have been acquired and annotated. Using these corpora, statistical machine learning methods can be applied to try to solve problems in spoken dialogue systems. In this paper, two statistical models based on the maximum likelihood assumption are presented, and two main applications of these models on a Spanish dialogue corpus are shown: labelling and decoding. The labelling application is useful for annotating new dialogue corpora. The decoding application is useful for implementing dialogue strategies in dialogue systems. Both applications centre on unsegmented dialogue turns. The obtained results show that, although limited, the proposed statistical models are appropriate for these applications.

On the impact of morphology in English to Spanish statistical MT	SPEECH COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Morphology generation; N-gram based translation; Statistical machine translation; Machine learning	MACHINE TRANSLATION	This paper presents a thorough study of the impact of morphology derivation on N-gram-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) models from English into a morphology-rich language such as Spanish. For this purpose, we define a framework under the assumption that a certain degree of morphology-related information is not only being ignored by current statistical translation models, but also has a negative impact on their estimation due to the data sparseness it causes. Moreover, we describe how this information can be decoupled from the standard bilingual N-gram models and introduced separately by means of a well-defined and better informed feature-based classification task. Results are presented for the European Parliament Plenary Sessions (EPPS) English -> Spanish task, showing oracle scores based on to what extent SMT models can benefit from simplifying Spanish morphological surface forms for each Part-Of-Speech category. We show that verb form morphological richness greatly weakens the standard statistical models, and we carry out a posterior morphology classification by defining a simple set of features and applying machine learning techniques. In addition to that, we propose a simple technique to deal with Spanish enclitic pronouns. Both techniques are empirically evaluated and final translation results show improvements over the baseline by just dealing with Spanish morphology. In principle, the study is also valid for translation from English into any other Romance language (Portuguese, Catalan, French, Galician, Italian, etc.). The proposed method can be applied to both monotonic and non-monotonic decoding scenarios, thus revealing the interaction between word-order decoding and the proposed morphology simplification techniques. Overall results achieve statistically significant improvement over baseline performance in this demanding task. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[de Gispert, A.; Marino, J.

The emerging field of chemical genomics is accumulating large-scale assay data on compound-protein interactions. We are now developing new mining methods for the chemical genomics data based on the integration of bioinformatics and chemoinformatics. Here we present a GPCR-ligand database (GLIDA) and a novel in silico screening method, which we have developed. GLIDA is a novel public GPCR-related chemical genomics database that is primarily focused on the correlation of information between GPCRs and their ligands. Our in silico screening method is based on statistical machine learning of the conserved patterns of molecular recognition extracted from comprehensive compound-protein interaction data. These are promising approaches to accelerating drug discovery processes.

Simultaneous feature selection and parameter optimisation using an artificial ant colony: case study of melting point prediction	CHEMISTRY CENTRAL JOURNAL			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; VARIABLE SELECTION; BIOLOGICAL-ACTIVITY; SUBSET-SELECTION; QSAR; SYSTEMS; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHMS; INHIBITORS	Background: We present a novel feature selection algorithm, Winnowing Artificial Ant Colony (WAAC), that performs simultaneous feature selection and model parameter optimisation for the development of predictive quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models. The WAAC algorithm is an extension of the modified ant colony algorithm of Shen et al. (J Chem Inf Model 2005, 45:1024-1029). We test the ability of the algorithm to develop a predictive partial least squares model for the Karthikeyan dataset (J Chem Inf Model 2005, 45:581-590) of melting point values. We also test its ability to perform feature selection on a support vector machine model for the same dataset. Results: Starting from an initial set of 203 descriptors, the WAAC algorithm selected a PLS model with 68 descriptors which has an RMSE on an external test set of 46.6 degrees C and R(2) of 0.51. The number of components chosen for the model was 49, which was close to optimal for this feature selection. The selected SVM model has 28 descriptors (cost of 5, epsilon of 0.21) and an RMSE of 45.1 degrees C and R(2) of 0.54. This model outperforms a kNN model (RMSE of 48.3 degrees C, R(2) of 0.47) for the same data and has similar performance to a Random Forest model (RMSE of 44.5 degrees C, R(2) of 0.55). However it is much less prone to bias at the extremes of the range of melting points as shown by the slope of the line through the residuals: -0.43 for WAAC/SVM, -0.53 for Random Forest. Conclusion: With a careful choice of objective function, the WAAC algorithm can be used to optimise machine learning and regression models that suffer from overfitting. Where model parameters also need to be tuned, as is the case with support vector machine and partial least squares models, it can optimise these simultaneously. The moving probabilities used by the algorithm are easily interpreted in terms of the best and current models of the ants, and the winnowing procedure promotes the removal of irrelevant descriptors.

Conventional methods for extracting information about cell viability usually need reagents to be applied on the targeted cells. These reagent-based techniques are reliable and versatile, however, some of them might be invasive and even toxic to the target cells. In support of automated noninvasive assessment of cell viability, a machine vision system has been developed. Results: This system is based on supervised learning technique. It learns from images of certain kinds of cell populations and trains some classifiers. These trained classifiers are then employed to evaluate the images of given cell populations obtained via dark field microscopy. Wavelet decomposition is performed on the cell images. Energy and entropy are computed for each wavelet subimage as features. A feature selection algorithm is implemented to achieve better performance. Correlation between the results from the machine vision system and commonly accepted gold standards becomes stronger if wavelet features are utilized. The best performance is achieved with a selected subset of wavelet features. Conclusion: The machine vision system based on dark field microscopy in conjugation with supervised machine learning and wavelet feature selection automates the cell viability assessment, and yields comparable results to commonly accepted methods. Wavelet features are found to be suitable to describe the discriminative properties of the live and dead cells in viability classification. According to the analysis, live cells exhibit morphologically more details and are intracellularly more organized than dead ones, which display more homogeneous and diffuse gray values throughout the cells. Feature selection increases the system's performance. The reason lies in the fact that feature selection plays a role of excluding redundant or misleading information that may be contained in the raw data, and leads to better results.

Peak intensity prediction in MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry: A machine learning study to support quantitative proteomics	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							AMINO-ACIDS; PEPTIDES; MS; QUANTIFICATION; MIXTURES; PROTEINS; SPECTRA; SURFACE; SERUM	Background: Mass spectrometry is a key technique in proteomics and can be used to analyze complex samples quickly. One key problem with the mass spectrometric analysis of peptides and proteins, however, is the fact that absolute quantification is severely hampered by the unclear relationship between the observed peak intensity and the peptide concentration in the sample. While there are numerous approaches to circumvent this problem experimentally (e. g. labeling techniques), reliable prediction of the peak intensities from peptide sequences could provide a peptide-specific correction factor. Thus, it would be a valuable tool towards label-free absolute quantification. Results: In this work we present machine learning techniques for peak intensity prediction for MALDI mass spectra. Features encoding the peptides' physico-chemical properties as well as string-based features were extracted. A feature subset was obtained from multiple forward feature selections on the extracted features. Based on these features, two advanced machine learning methods (support vector regression and local linear maps) are shown to yield good results for this problem (Pearson correlation of 0.68 in a ten-fold cross validation). Conclusion: The techniques presented here are a useful first step going beyond the binary prediction of proteotypic peptides towards a more quantitative prediction of peak intensities. These predictions in turn will turn out to be beneficial for mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics.

It is argued that the traditional modeling and identification approach is not appropriate for the highly complex systems that we deal with nowadays in environmental science and economics. We propose that the researchers shift their attention and efforts from attempting to actually develop system models to designing algorithms that get the machine to learn about the behavior of the system. We attempt to make the case that traditional modeling techniques do not work for complex systems by introducing the notion of 'hard' and 'soft' variables. The advantages of machine learning theory and how it can be used to assess the quality of a given model (or learning machine) are discussed. A new approach that implements the notion of VC dimension and the principle of structural risk minimization is proposed to link system macro-descriptions to agent-based models. The techniques of support vector machines and kernel learning are discussed, and explanations as to how kernels can reproduce the knowledge expressed in (empirical and universal) laws are provided. Finally, a small application to the problem of spatial downscaling of the GDP aggregate data is presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Roadknight, Performance-guided neural network for rapidly self-organising active network management (invited Paper), journal of Neurocomputing, 61 C, 2004, pp. 5-20] employs the complementary concepts of common (intersection) feature learning (called snap) and LVQ (drift towards the input patterns) learning, and is a fast, unsupervised method suitable for on-line learning and non-stationary environments where new patterns are continually introduced. ADFUNN [M. Kang, D. Palmer-Brown, An adaptive function neural network (ADFUNN) for phrase recognition, in: The International joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN05), Montreal, Canada, 2005, D. Palmer-Brown, M. Kang, ADFUNN: An adaptive function neural network, in: The 7th International Conference on Adaptive and Natural Computing Algorithms (ICAN-NGA05), Coimbra, Portugal, 2005] is based on a linear piecewise neuron activation function that is modified by a novel gradient descent supervised learning algorithm. It has recently been applied to the Iris dataset, and a natural language phrase recognition problem, exhibiting impressive generalisation classification ability with no hidden neurons. The unsupervised single layer snap-drift is effective in extracting distinct features from the complex cursive-letter datasets, and the supervised single layer ADFUNN is capable of solving linearly inseparable problems rapidly. In combination within one network (SADFUNN), these two methods are more powerful and yet simpler than MLPs, at least on this problem domain. We experiment on SADFUNN with two handwritten digits datasets problems from the LICI Machine Learning repository. The problems are learned rapidly and higher generalisation results are achieved than with a MLP. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	You, GW; Hwang, SW				You, Gae-won; Hwang, Seung-won			Search structures and algorithms for personalized ranking	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						personalization; ranking; top-k query; user context; context-awareness		As data of an unprecedented scale are becoming accessible on the Web, personalization, of narrowing down the retrieval to meet the user-specific information needs, is becoming more and more critical. For instance, while web search engines traditionally retrieve the same results for all users, they began to offer beta services to personalize the results to adapt to user-specific contexts such as prior search history or other application contexts. In a clear contrast to search engines dealing with unstructured text data, this paper studies how to enable such personalization in the context of structured data retrieval. In particular, we adopt contextual ranking model to formalize personalization as a cost-based optimization over collected contextual rankings. With this formalism, personalization can be abstracted as a cost-optimal retrieval of contextual ranking, closely matching user-specific retrieval context. With the retrieved matching context, we adopt a machine learning approach, to effectively and efficiently identify the ideal personalized ranked results for this specific user. Our empirical evaluations over synthetic and real-life data validate both the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The sensitivity of these methods, however, is greatly reduced when the proportion of voxels that convey the discriminative information is small compared to the total number of measured voxels. To reduce this dimensionality problem, previous studies employed univariate voxel selection or region-of-interest-based strategies as a preceding step to the application of machine learning algorithms. Here we employ a strategy for classifying functional imaging data based on a multivariate feature selection algorithm, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) that uses the training algorithm (support vector machine) recursively to eliminate irrelevant voxels and estimate informative spatial patterns. Generalization performances on test data increases while features/voxels are pruned based on their discrimination ability. In this article we evaluate RFE in terms of sensitivity of discriminative maps (Receiver Operative Characteristic analysis) and generalization performances and compare it to previously used univariate voxel selection strategies based on activation and discrimination measures. Using simulated fMRI data, we show that the recursive approach is suitable for mapping discriminative patterns and that the combination of an initial univariate activation-based (F-test) reduction of voxels and multivariate recursive feature elimination produces the best results, especially when differences between conditions have a low contrast-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, we apply our method to high resolution (2 x 2 x 2mm(3)) data from an auditory fMRI experiment in which subjects were stimulated with sounds from four different categories. With these real data, our recursive algorithm proves able to detect and accurately classify multivoxel spatial patterns, highlighting the role of the superior temporal gyrus in encoding the information of sound categories. In line with the simulation results, our method outperforms univariate statistical analysis and statistical learning without feature selection. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Wu, ST; Zhang, Y				Wu, Sitao; Zhang, Yang			ANGLOR: A Composite Machine-Learning Algorithm for Protein Backbone Torsion Angle Prediction	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SECONDARY STRUCTURE PREDICTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; LOCAL-STRUCTURE; SEQUENCE; RESTRAINTS; DYNAMICS; SERVER	We developed a composite machine-learning based algorithm, called ANGLOR, to predict real-value protein backbone torsion angles from amino acid sequences. The input features of ANGLOR include sequence profiles, predicted secondary structure and solvent accessibility. In a large-scale benchmarking test, the mean absolute error (MAE) of the phi/psi prediction is 28 degrees/46 degrees, which is similar to 10% lower than that generated by software in literature. The prediction is statistically different from a random predictor (or a purely secondary-structure-based predictor) with p-value <1.0X10(-300) (or <1.0X10(-148)) by Wilcoxon signed rank test. For some residues (ILE, LEU, PRO and VAL) and especially the residues in helix and buried regions, the MAE of phi angles is much smaller (10-20 degrees) than that in other environments. Thus, although the average accuracy of the ANGLOR prediction is still low, the portion of the accurately predicted dihedral angles may be useful in assisting protein fold recognition and ab initio 3D structure modeling.

We propose innovative generalizations of SNR for multiclass cancer discrimination through introduction of two indices, Gene Dominant Index and Gene Dormant Index ( GDIs). These two indices lead to the concepts of dominant and dormant genes with biological significance. We use these indices to develop methodologies for discovery of dominant and dormant biomarkers with interesting biological significance. The dominancy and dormancy of the identified biomarkers and their excellent discriminating power are also demonstrated pictorially using the scatterplot of individual gene and 2-D Sammon's projection of the selected set of genes. Using information from the literature we have shown that the GDI based method can identify dominant and dormant genes that play significant roles in cancer biology. These biomarkers are also used to design diagnostic prediction systems. Results and discussion: To evaluate the effectiveness of the GDIs, we have used four multiclass cancer data sets (Small Round Blue Cell Tumors, Leukemia, Central Nervous System Tumors, and Lung Cancer). For each data set we demonstrate that the new indices can find biologically meaningful genes that can act as biomarkers. We then use six machine learning tools, Nearest Neighbor Classifier (NNC), Nearest Mean Classifier (NMC), Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with linear kernel, and SVM classifier with Gaussian kernel, where both SVMs are used in conjunction with one-vs-all (OVA) and one-vs-one (OVO) strategies. We found GDIs to be very effective in identifying biomarkers with strong class specific signatures. With all six tools and for all data sets we could achieve better or comparable prediction accuracies usually with fewer marker genes than results reported in the literature using the same computational protocols. The dominant genes are usually easy to find while good dormant genes may not always be available as dormant genes require stronger constraints to be satisfied; but when they are available, they can be used for authentication of diagnosis. Conclusion: Since GDI based schemes can find a small set of dominant/dormant biomarkers that is adequate to design diagnostic prediction systems, it opens up the possibility of using real-time qPCR assays or antibody based methods such as ELISA for an easy and low cost diagnosis of diseases.

The increased availability of sequence data for various eukaryotic organisms in recent years has necessitated for better tools and techniques for the prediction and analysis of promoters in eukaryotic sequences. Many promoter prediction methods and tools have been developed to date but they have yet to provide acceptable predictive performance. One obvious criteria to improve on current methods is to devise a better system for selecting appropriate features of promoters that distinguish them from non-promoters. Secondly improved performance can be achieved by enhancing the predictive ability of the machine learning algorithms used. Results: In this paper, a novel approach is presented in which 128 4-mer motifs in conjunction with a non-linear machine-learning algorithm utilising a Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used to distinguish between promoter and non-promoter DNA sequences. By applying this approach to plant, Drosophila, human, mouse and rat sequences, the classification model has showed 7-fold cross-validation percentage accuracies of 83.81%, 94.82%, 91.25%, 90.77% and 82.35% respectively. The high sensitivity and specificity value of 0.86 and 0.90 for plant; 0.96 and 0.92 for Drosophila; 0.88 and 0.92 for human; 0.78 and 0.84 for mouse and 0.82 and 0.80 for rat demonstrate that this technique is less prone to false positive results and exhibits better performance than many other tools. Moreover, this model successfully identifies location of promoter using TATA weight matrix. Conclusion: The high sensitivity and specificity indicate that 4-mer frequencies in conjunction with supervised machine-learning methods can be beneficial in the identification of RNA pol II promoters comparative to other methods. This approach can be extended to identify promoters in sequences for other eukaryotic genomes.

The availability of large amounts of high-throughput data provides an alternative approach to handling this problem from the computational viewpoint. In this review, we provide a comprehensive description of the computational methods that are currently applicable to protein function prediction, especially from the perspective of machine learning. Machine learning techniques can generally be classified as supervised learning, semi-supervised learning and unsupervised learning. By classifying the existing computational methods for protein annotation into these three groups, we are able to present a comprehensive framework on protein annotation based on machine learning techniques.

J	Feng, SH; Xu, D; Lang, CY; Li, B				Feng Songhe; Xu De; Lang Congyan; Li Bing			Automatic Image Annotation Using Semi-Supervised Multi-Instance Multi-Label Learning Algorithm	CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Image annotation; Semi-supervised learning; Multi-instance multi-label learning; Reinforced diverse density algorithm; Gaussian mixture model	RETRIEVAL	Automatic image annotation has emerged as an important research topic. From the perspective of machine learning, the annotation task fits both multi-instance and multi-label learning framework due to the fact that an image is composed of multiple regions, and is associated with multiple keywords as well. In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised multi-instance multi-label (SSMIML) learning framework, which aims at taking full advantage of both labeled and unlabeled data to address the annotation problem. Specifically, a reinforced diverse density algorithm is applied firstly to select the Instance prototypes (IPs) with respect to a given keyword from both positive and unlabeled bags. Then, the selected IPs are modeled using the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in order to reflect the semantic class density distribution. Furthermore, based on the class distribution for a keyword, both positive and unlabeled bags are redefined using a novel feature mapping strategy. Thus, each bag can be represented by one fixed-length feature vector so that the manifold-ranking algorithm can be used subsequently to propagate the corresponding label from positive bags to unlabeled bags directly.

J	Sen, P; Getoor, L				Sen, Prithviraj; Getoor, Lise			Cost-sensitive learning with conditional Markov networks	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						cost-sensitive learning; machine learning; Markov networks; structured output spaces	GENERALIZED BELIEF PROPAGATION	There has been a recent, growing interest in classification and link prediction in structured domains. Methods such as conditional random fields and relational Markov networks support flexible mechanisms for modeling correlations due to the link structure. In addition, in many structured domains, there is an interesting structure in the risk or cost function associated with different misclassifications. There is a rich tradition of cost-sensitive learning applied to unstructured (IID) data. Here we propose a general framework which can capture correlations in the link structure and handle structured cost functions. We present two new cost-sensitive structured classifiers based on maximum entropy principles. The first determines the cost-sensitive classification by minimizing the expected cost of misclassification. The second directly determines the cost-sensitive classification without going through a probability estimation step. We contrast these approaches with an approach which employs a standard 0/1-loss structured classifier to estimate class conditional probabilities followed by minimization of the expected cost of misclassification and with a cost-sensitive IID classifier that does not utilize the correlations present in the link structure. We demonstrate the utility of our cost-sensitive structured classifiers with experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.

J	Forman, G				Forman, George			Quantifying counts and costs via classification	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						supervised machine learning; classification; prevalence estimation; class distribution estimation; quantification research methodology; detecting and tracking trends; concept drift; class imbalance; text mining	PROBABILITIES	Many business applications track changes over time, for example, measuring the monthly prevalence of influenza incidents. In situations where a classifier is needed to identify the relevant incidents, imperfect classification accuracy can cause substantial bias in estimating class prevalence. The paper defines two research challenges for machine learning. The 'quantification' task is to accurately estimate the number of positive cases (or class distribution) in a test set, using a training set that may have a substantially different distribution. The 'cost quantification' variant estimates the total cost associated with the positive class, where each case is tagged with a cost attribute, such as the expense to resolve the case. Quantification has a very different utility model from traditional classification research. For both forms of quantification, the paper describes a variety of methods and evaluates them with a suitable methodology, revealing which methods give reliable estimates when training data is scarce, the testing class distribution differs widely from training, and the positive class is rare, e.g., 1% positives. These strengths can make quantification practical for business use, even where classification accuracy is poor.

J	Fawcett, T				Fawcett, Tom			PRIE: a system for generating rulelists to maximize ROC performance	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						classification; ROC analysis; rule learning; cost-sensitive learning	ALGORITHMS; CURVE; AREA	Rules are commonly used for classification because they are modular, intelligible and easy to learn. Existing work in classification rule learning assumes the goal is to produce categorical classifications to maximize classification accuracy. Recent work in machine learning has pointed out the limitations of classification accuracy: when class distributions are skewed, or error costs are unequal, an accuracy maximizing classifier can perform poorly. This paper presents a method for learning rules directly from ROC space when the goal is to maximize the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Basic principles from rule learning and computational geometry are used to focus the search for promising rule combinations. The result is a system that can learn intelligible rulelists with good ROC performance.

J	Weiss, GM; Tian, Y				Weiss, Gary M.; Tian, Ye			Maximizing classifier utility when there are data acquisition and modeling costs	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						data mining; machine learning; induction; decision trees; utility-based data mining; cost-sensitive learning; active learning		Classification is a well-studied problem in data mining. Classification performance was originally gauged almost exclusively using predictive accuracy, but as work in the field progressed, more sophisticated measures of classifier utility that better represented the value of the induced knowledge were introduced. Nonetheless, most work still ignored the cost of acquiring training examples, even though this cost impacts the total utility of the data mining process. In this article we analyze the relationship between the number of acquired training examples and the utility of the data mining process and, given the necessary cost information, we determine the number of training examples that yields the optimum overall performance. We then extend this analysis to include the cost of model induction-measured in terms of the CPU time required to generate the model. While our cost model does not take into account all possible costs, our analysis provides some useful insights and a template for future analyses using more sophisticated cost models. Because our analysis is based on experiments that acquire the full set of training examples, it cannot directly be used to find a classifier with optimal or near-optimal total utility. To address this issue we introduce two progressive sampling strategies that are empirically shown to produce classifiers with near-optimal total utility.

J	Chen, Y; Tsai, FS; Chan, KL				Chen, Yun; Tsai, Flora S.; Chan, Kap Luk			Machine learning techniques for business blog search and mining	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						latent semantic analysis; probabilistic latent semantic analysis; weblog; blog; data mining	INFORMATION; RETRIEVAL	Weblogs, or blogs, have rapidly gained in popularity over the past few years. In particular, the growth of business blogs that are written by or provide commentary on businesses and companies opens up new opportunities for developing blog-specific search and mining techniques. In this paper, we propose probabilistic models for blog search and mining using two machine learning techniques, latent semantic analysis (LSA) and probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA). We implement the models in our database of business blogs, BizBlogs07, with the aim of achieving higher precision and recall. The probabilistic model is able to segment the business blogs into separate topic areas, which is useful for keywords detection on the blogosphere. Various term-weighting schemes and factor values were also studied in detail, which reveal interesting patterns in our database of business blogs. Our multi-functional business blog system is indeed found to be very different from existing blog search engines, as it aims to provide better relevance and precision of the search.

Agent Mertacor: A robust design for dealing with uncertainty and variation in SCM environments	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						supply chain management; machine learning; autonomous trading agents; electronic commerce; agent intelligence		Supply Chain Management (SCM) has recently entered a new era, where the old-fashioned static, long-term relationships between involved actors are being replaced by new, dynamic negotiating schemas, established over virtual organizations and trading marketplaces. SCM environments now operate under strict policies that all interested parties (suppliers, manufacturers, customers) have to abide by, in order to participate. And, though such dynamic markets provide greater profit potential, they also conceal greater risks. since competition is tougher and request and demand may vary significantly in the quest for maximum benefit. The need for efficient SCM actors is thus implied, actors that may handle the deluge of (either complete or incomplete) information generated, perceive variations and exploit the full potential of the environments they inhabit. In this context, we introduce Mertacor, an agent that employs robust mechanisms for dealing with all SCM facets and for trading within dynamic and competitive SCM environments. Its efficiency has been extensively tested in one of the most challenging SCM environments, the Trading Agent Competition (TAC) SCM game. This paper provides an extensive analysis of Mertacor and its main architectural primitives, provides an overview of the TAC SCM environment, and thoroughly discusses Mertacor's performance.

J	Huang, CJ; Chuang, YT				Huang, Chenn-Jung; Chuang, Yi-Ta			Supporting the development of collaborative problem-based learning environments with an intelligent diagnosis tool	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						agents; problem solving; collaboration; text mining; support vector machines; cognitive style	SYSTEMS	Problem-based learning (PBL) has been implemented for years in lots of countries and the achieved performance is plausible. However, the implementation of PBL course often needs a lot of human resources; the instructors often need offering instructions to the learners intensively. As the modern computer science and the Internet gains wide popularity around the world, e-learning is taken by the learners as an important study aid and thereby lightens the burden of the instructors. In this research, we incorporate the PBL activity into an open software e-learning platform, Moodle, and a learning diagnosis tool is added in the platform to alleviate the loading of the instructors. The learners' transcripts posted on discussion board and chatting room are first preprocessed by the learning parameter extraction module to truly reflect the learners' planning on the solutions to the designated problem. The extracted parameters are further fed into a classification algorithm to examine the quality of the learners' suggestions and some appropriate feedback will be issued to the learners/instructor if needed. The experimental results show that the text mining and machine learning techniques used in this work are effective in automatically providing useful feedback for the learners to progress through the ill-structured problem solving.

This leads to the need of predicting business failures. Statistical methods and machine learning techniques have been widely used to deal with this issue. In general, financial ratios are one of the main inputs to develop the prediction models. This paper presents a hybrid financial analysis model including static and trend analysis models to construct and train a back-propagation neural network (BPN) model. Further, the experiments employ four datasets of Taiwan enterprises which support that the proposed model not only provides a high predication rate but also outperforms other models including discriminant analysis, decision trees, and the back-propagation neural network alone.

J	Yang, MD; Su, TC				Yang, Ming-Der; Su, Tung-Ching			Automated diagnosis of sewer pipe defects based on machine learning approaches	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						CCTV images; sewer pipe defects; diagnostic system; textural features	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORK; TEXTURE SEGMENTATION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; CLASSIFICATION; MODEL; RECOGNITION; PATTERN; REHABILITATION; INSPECTION	In sewage rehabilitation planning, closed circuit television (CCTV) systems are the widely used inspection tools in assessing sewage structural conditions for non man entry pipes. Currently, the assessment of sewage structural conditions by manually interpretation oil CCTV images seems inefficient, especially for several thousands of frames in one inspection plan. Also, the assessment work significantly involves engineers' eye sight and professional experience. With a purpose of assisting general staffs in diagnosing pipe defects on CCTV inspection images, a diagnostic system by applying machine learning approaches is proposed in this paper. This research was first to use image process techniques, including wavelet transform and computation of co-occurrence matrices, for describing the textures of the pipe defects. Then, three neural network approaches, back-propagation neural network (BPN), radial basis network (RBN), and support vector machine (SVM), were adopted to classify pipe defect patterns, and their performances were compared and discussed. The diagnostic system of pipe defects was applied to a sewer system in the 9th district, Taichung City which is the largest city in middle Taiwan. The result shows that the diagnosis accuracy of 60%, derived by SVM is the best and also better than the diagnosis accuracy of 57.4%, derived by a Bayesian classifier. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

New insight into intestinal motor function via noninvasive endoluminal image analysis	GASTROENTEROLOGY			English	Article							MOTILITY; CONTRACTIONS; OBSTRUCTION; MANOMETRY; MACHINE	Background & Aims: Evaluation of small bowel motility by intestinal manometry is invasive and requires expertise for interpretation. Our aim was to use capsule technology for evaluation of small bowel motor function based on a fully computerized image analysis program. Methods: Thirty-six consecutive patients with severe intestinal motor disorders (19 fulfilling manometric criteria of intestinal dysmotility and 17 not) and 50 healthy subjects received the endoscopic capsule (Pillcam; Given Imaging, Yokneam, Israel). Endoluminal image analysis was performed with a computer vision program specifically developed for the detection of contractile patterns (phasic luminal closure and radial wrinkles by wall texture analysis), noncontractile patterns (tunnel and wall appearance by Laplacian filtering), intestinal content (by color decomposition analysis), and endoluminal motion (by chromatic stability). Automatic classification of normal and abnormal intestinal motility was performed by means of a machine-learning technique. Results: As compared with healthy subjects, patients exhibited less contractile activity (25% less phasic luminal closures, P < .05) and more noncontractile patterns (151% more tunnel pattern, P < .05), static sequences (56% more static images, P < .01), and turbid intestinal content (94% more static turbid images, P < .01). On cross validation, the classifier identified as abnormal all but 1 patient with manometric criteria of dysmotility and as normal all healthy subjects. Out of the 17 patients without manometric criteria of dysmotility, 11 were identified as abnormal and 6 as normal. Conclusions: Our study shows that endoluminal image analysis, by means of computer vision and machine-learning techniques, constitutes a reliable, noninvasive, and automated diagnostic test of intestinal motor disorders.

J	Kirschner, A; Frishman, D				Kirschner, Andreas; Frishman, Dmitrij			Prediction of beta-turns and beta-turn types by a novel bidirectional Elman-type recurrent neural network with multiple output layers (MOLEBRNN)	GENE			English	Article						structural bioinformatics; protein structure prediction; machine learning; classification	PROTEIN SECONDARY STRUCTURE; ACCURACY; CONFORMATION; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION; PEPTIDES; ANTIBODY	Prediction of beta-turns from amino acid sequences has long been recognized as an important problem in structural bioinformatics due to their frequent occurrence as well as their structural and functional significance. Because various structural features of proteins are intercorrelated, secondary structure information has been often employed as an additional input for machine learning algorithms while predicting beta-turns. Here we present a novel bidirectional Elman-type recurrent neural network with multiple output layers (MOLEBRNN) capable of predicting multiple mutually dependent structural motifs and demonstrate its efficiency in recognizing three aspects of protein structure: beta-turns. beta-turn types, and secondary structure. The advantage of our method compared to other predictors is that it does not require any external input except for sequence profiles because interdependencies between different structural features are taken into account implicitly during the learning process. In a sevenfold cross-validation experiment on a standard test dataset our method exhibits the total prediction accuracy of 77.9% and the Mathew's Correlation Coefficient of 0.45, the highest performance reported so far. It also outperforms other known methods in delineating individual turn types. We demonstrate how simultaneous prediction of multiple targets influences prediction performance on single targets. The MOLEBRNN presented here is a generic method applicable in a variety of research fields where multiple mutually depending target classes need to be predicted.

J	Caffrey, JM				Caffrey, J. M.			The resiliency challenge presented by soft failure incidents	IBM SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article								A common problem observed on mainframe installations, and one which presents a significant challenge for resiliency and high availability, involves soft failure incidents. In contrast to catastrophic failures, soft failures involve some degree of system shutdown without an obvious cause. This has been described with the phrase: "Systems don't break; they just stop running, and we don't know why." Extending a medical paradigm, this paper proposes a new method for solutions deployed on IBM z/OS(TM) systems to respond when either the system or the application stops running. The current approach is to treat the "disease," by determining the cause of the problem and taking action to prevent its recurrence. The new approach is to determine whether the system or application is behaving abnormally, identify the cause of this abnormal behavior, and take action to treat the "symptom." This new approach uses machine learning and mathematical modeling to identify normal behavior, enabling the detection of abnormal behavior before it impacts the customer. Based on an analysis of critical problems and preliminary modeling work, the types of abnormal behavior identified are assigned to broad categories. in this paper, we describe the progress being made to address the challenge of soft failures by implementing this new paradigm.

Scoring and thresholding for availability	IBM SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article							GENERALIZED PARETO DISTRIBUTION	As the capacity of hardware systems has grown and workload consolidation has taken place, the volume of performance metrics and diagnostic data streams has outscaled the capability of people to handle these systems using traditional methods. As work of different types (such as database, batch, and Web processing), each in its own monitoring silo, runs concurrently on a single image (operating system instance), both the complexity and the business consequences of a single image failure have increased. This paper presents two techniques for generating actionable information out of the overwhelming amount of performance and diagnostic data available to human analysts. Failure scoring is used to identify high-risk failure events that may be obscured in the myriad system events. This replaces human expertise in scanning tens of thousands of records per day and results in a short, prioritized list for action by systems staff. Adaptive thresholding is used to drive predictive and descriptive machine-learning-based modeling to isolate and identify misbehaving processes and transactions. The attraction of this technique is that it does not require human intervention and can be reapplied continually, resulting in models that are not brittle. Both techniques reduce the quantity and increase the relevance of data available for programmatic and human processes.

Here, we demonstrate in a group of 14 fully BCI-naive subjects that 8 out of 14 BCI novices can perform at >84% accuracy in their very first BCI session, and a further four subjects at >70%. Thus, 12 out of 14 BCI-novices had significant above-chance level performances without any subject training even in the first session, as based on an optimized EEG analysis by advanced machine-learning algorithms.

A mobile-directory approach to service discovery in wireless ad hoc networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article						service data communications; algorithm/protocol design and analysis; ubiquitous computing; machine learning		We present the Service Directory Placement Algorithm (SDPA), a directory-placement scheme that leverages the performance of existing service discovery protocols over wireless ad hoc networks. SDPA promotes the deployment of a nomadic service directory, whose current location in the network varies according to the dynamics of service-discovery queries driven by the users' applications and partial knowledge of the network's topology. SDPA is based on a heuristic approach, whose performance is optimized by formulating the directory-placement problem as a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) solved by the means of a reinforcement-learning technique known as Q-Learning. Performance evaluations obtained through computer simulations of networks with up to 45 hosts moving at pedestrian speeds reveal average bandwidth savings close to 50 percent over a default broadcast/multicast approach for service discovery once an efficient directory-placement policy is obtained.

J	Liang, X; Chen, RC; Guo, XY				Liang, Xun; Chen, Rong-Chang; Guo, Xinyu			Pruning Support Vector Machines Without Altering Performances	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Architectures; crosswise propagation (CP); high-dimensional feature space; pruning; support vector machines (SVMs); upper bound	CLASSIFIER; COMPLEXITY	Support vector machines (SV machines, SVMs) have many merits that distinguish themselves from many other machine-learning algorithms, such as the nonexistence of local minima, the possession of the largest distance from the separating hyperplane to the SVs, and a solid theoretical foundation. However, SVM training algorithms such as the efficient sequential minimal optimization (SMO) often produce many SVs. Some scholars have found that the kernel outputs are frequently of similar levels, which insinuate the redundancy of SVs. By analyzing the overlapped information of kernel outputs, a succinct separating-hyperplane-securing method for pruning the dispensable SVs based on crosswise propagation (CP) is systematically developed. The method also circumvents the problem of explicitly discerning SVs in feature space as the SVM formulation does. Experiments with the famous SMO-based software LibSVM reveal that all typical kernels with different parameters on the data sets contribute the dispensable SVs. Some 1% similar to 9% (in some scenarios, more than 50%) dispensable SVs are found. Furthermore, the experimental results also verify that the pruning method does not alter the SVMs' performances at all. As a corollary, this paper further contributes in theory a new lower upper bound on the number of SVs in the high-dimensional feature space.

Since the descriptors do not form a vector space, well-known machine learning techniques are not well suited to learn the classifiers. The space of d-dimensional nonsingular covariance matrices can be represented as a connected Riemannian manifold. The main contribution of the paper is a novel approach for classifying points lying on a connected Riemannian manifold using the geometry of the space. The algorithm is tested on the INRIA and DaimlerChrysler pedestrian data sets where superior detection rates are observed over the previous approaches.

In this paper, a novel quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) method is proposed by combining quantum theory and reinforcement learning (RL). inspired by the state superposition principle and quantum parallelism, a framework of a value-updating algorithm is introduced. The state (action) in traditional RL is identified as the eigen state (eigen action) in QRL. The state (action) set can be represented with a quantum superposition state, and the eigen state (eigen action) can be obtained by randomly observing the simulated quantum state according to the collapse postulate of quantum measurement. The probability of the eigen action is determined by the probability amplitude, which is updated in parallel according to rewards. Some related characteristics of QRL such as convergence, optimality, and balancing between exploration and exploitation are also analyzed, which shows that this approach makes a good tradeoff between exploration and exploitation using the probability amplitude and can speedup learning through the quantum parallelism. To evaluate the performance and practicability of QRL, several simulated experiments are given, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the QRL algorithm for some complex problems. This paper is also an effective exploration on the application of quantum computation to artificial intelligence.

J	Chandra, B; Varghese, PP				Chandra, B.; Varghese, P. Paul			Fuzzy SLIQ decision tree algorithm	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						classification; fuzzy decision tree; fuzzy membership; function; Gini index	C4.5	Traditional decision tree algorithms face the problem of having sharp decision boundaries which are hardly found in any real-life classification problems. A fuzzy supervised learning in Quest (SLIQ) decision tree (FS-DT) algorithm is proposed in this paper. It is aimed at constructing a fuzzy decision boundary instead of a crisp decision boundary. Size of the decision tree constructed is another very important parameter in decision tree algorithms. Large and deeper decision tree results in incomprehensible induction rules. The proposed FS-DT algorithm modifies the SLIQ decision tree algorithm to construct a fuzzy binary decision tree of significantly reduced size. The performance of the FS-DT algorithm is compared with SLIQ using several real-life datasets taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The FS-DT algorithm outperforms its crisp counterpart in terms of classification accuracy. FS-DT also results in more than 70% reduction in size of the decision tree compared to SLIQ.

J	Johnston, E; Kushmerick, N				Johnston, Eddie; Kushmerick, Nicholas			Web Service aggregation with string distance ensembles and active probe selection	INFORMATION FUSION			English	Article						schema matching; schema integration; Web Services; aggregation	HETEROGENEOUS DATABASES; INFORMATION	The adoption of standards for exchanging information across the Web presents both new opportunities and important challenges for data integration and aggregation. Although Web Services simplify the discovery and access of information Sources, the problem of semantic heterogeneity remains: how to find semantic correspondences across the data being integrated. In this paper, we explore these issues in the context of Web Services, and propose OATS, a novel algorithm for schema matching that is specifically suited to Web Service data aggregation. We show how probing Web Services with a small set of related queries results ill semantically correlated data instances which greatly simplifies the matching process, and demonstrate that the use of all ensemble of string distance metrics in matching data instances performs better than individual metrics. We also show how the choice of probe queries has a dramatic effect on matching accuracy. Motivated by this observation, we describe and evaluate all machine learning approach to selecting probes to maximise accuracy while minimising cost. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ziarko, W				Ziarko, Wojciech			Probabilistic approach to rough sets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						Rough sets; Probabilistic rough sets; Data dependencies; Data mining; Machine learning; Data reduction	MODEL; SYSTEMS	The article introduces the basic ideas and investigates the probabilistic version of rough set theory. It relies on both classification knowledge and probabilistic knowledge in analysis of rules and attributes. Rough approximation evaluative measures and one-way and two-way inter-set dependency measures are proposed and adopted to probabilistic rule evaluation. A new probabilistic dependency measure for attributes is also introduced and proven to have the monotonicity property. This property makes it possible for the measure to be used to optimize and evaluate attribute-based representations through computation of probabilistic measures of attribute reduct, core and significance factors.

J	Madsen, AL				Madsen, A. L.			Belief update in CLG Bayesian networks with lazy propagation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd European Workshop on Probabilistic Graphical Models	SEP 12-15, 2006	Praque, CZECH REPUBLIC			CLG Bayesian networks; Belief update; Propagation	INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS; INFERENCE; PROBABILITIES; COMPUTATION; VARIABLES; ALGORITHM; MODELS	In recent years, Bayesian networks with a mixture of continuous and discrete variables have received an increasing level of attention. In this paper, we focus on the restricted class of mixture Bayesian networks known as conditional linear Gaussian Bayesian networks (CLG Bayesian networks) and present an architecture for exact belief update for this class of mixture networks. The proposed architecture is an extension of lazy propagation using operations of Lauritzen and Jensen [S.L. Lauritzen, F. Jensen, Stable local computation with mixed Gaussian distributions, Statistics and Computing 11(2) (2001) 191-203] and Cowell [R.G. Cowell, Local propagation in conditional Gaussian Bayesian networks, journal of Machine Learning Research 6 (2005) 1517-1550]. By decomposing clique and separator potentials into sets of factors, the proposed architecture takes advantage of independence and irrelevance properties induced by the structure of the graph and the evidence. The resulting benefits are illustrated by examples and assessed by experiments. The performance of the proposed architecture has been evaluated using a set of randomly generated networks. The results indicate a significant potential of the proposed architecture. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The algorithm can mine the association rules with decision attributes directly without processing missing values. Using the incomplete dataset Mushroom from UCI machine learning repository, the new algorithm was compared with the classical association rules mining algorithm based on Apriori from the number of rules extracted, testing accuracy and execution time. The experiment results show that the new algorithm has advantages of short execution time and high accuracy.

J	Minowa, Y				Minowa, Yasushi			Verification for generalizability and accuracy of a thinning-trees selection model with the ensemble learning algorithm and the cross-validation method	JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH			English	Article						ensemble learning; m-fold cross validation; pattern-recognition algorithm; thinning-trees selection; WEKA	CLASSIFICATION	For the purpose of making a highly effective model in relation to the selection of trees for thinning for various forestry goals, the author examined the generalizability and accuracy of models using various ensemble learning algorithms and the m-fold cross-validation method. These techniques make it possible to improve discrimination accuracy by combining or integrating multiple learning results whose accuracies are not very high. WEKA, which is a machine learning tool for data mining programmed in Java machine language, was used to verify the results of the simulation models. The number of samples was 503. Pattern-recognition algorithms in this study used five classification-type models and one function-type model. It was found that: (1) without cross validation, two pattern-recognition algorithms can be classified as having comparatively high discrimination accuracy; (2) with cross validation, discrimination accuracy decreased as a whole, but was not very different from that without cross validation, and (3) from the viewpoint of generalizability, we constructed a model at around 70% discrimination accuracy. In order to construct more effective models, we need to design the model to utilize certain algorithms or to build in re-sampling methods such as ensemble learning and cross validation. Additionally, in the case of small sample datasets, ensemble learning is an effective method for constructing efficient models.

Combining variable neighborhood search and estimation of distribution algorithms in the protein side chain placement problem	JOURNAL OF HEURISTICS			English	Article						VNS; EDAs; UMDA; protein folding; rotamers; protein side chain placement	OPTIMIZATION; IMPLEMENTATION; CLASSIFIERS; HEURISTICS; SELECTION; MODELS	The aim of this work is to introduce several proposals for combining two metaheuristics: variable neighborhood search (VNS) and estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). Although each of these metaheuristics has been previously hybridized in several ways, this paper constitutes the first attempt to combine both optimization methods. The different ways of combining VNS and EDAs will be classified into three groups. In the first group, we will consider combinations where the philosophy underlying VNS is embedded in EDAs. Considering different neighborhood spaces (points, populations or probability distributions), we will obtain instantiations for the approaches in this group. The second group of algorithms is obtained when probabilistic models (or any other machine learning paradigm) are used in order to exploit the good and bad shakes of the randomly generated solutions in a reduced variable neighborhood search. The last group of algorithms contains the results of alternating VNS and EDAs. An application of the first approach is presented in the protein side chain placement problem. The results obtained show the superiority of the hybrid algorithm in comparison with EDAs and VNS.

J	Casoto, P; Datiolo, A; Tasso, C				Casoto, Paolo; Datiolo, Antonina; Tasso, Carlo			Sentiment Classification for the Italian Language: a Case Study on Movie Reviews	JOURNAL OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Opinion Analysis; Sentiment Analysis; Cognitive Agents; zz-Structures; Machine Learning		We consider the problem of tracking the opinion polarity, in terms of positive or negative orientation, expressed in documents written in natural language and extracted from a heterogeneous set of Web sources. More specifically, we focus our attention on the movie reviews domain. We are interested in evaluating the performance obtained by a set of high performance opinion polarity classifiers for the Italian language. Classification of polarity expressed by the input documents is achieved by means of several sets of specialized autonomous or interacting agents, devoted, respectively, to document gathering, classification and visualization. In particular the results of opinion analysis are represented by means of a graphical interface, where a multi agent based implementation of zz-structures is exploited to offer graph-centric views and navigation of results. The specific experimental evaluation performed so far shows an accuracy level, which is higher than previous results reported in the literature.

Ranking Individuals by Group Comparisons	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						ranking; group comparison; binary/scored outcomes; Bradley-Terry model; multi-class classification	STATISTICAL MECHANICS; REDUCING MULTICLASS; INFORMATION THEORY; BINARY; MODELS	This paper proposes new approaches to rank individuals from their group comparison results. Many real-world problems are of this type. For example, ranking players from team comparisons is important in some sports. In machine learning, a closely related application is classification using coding matrices. Group comparison results are usually in two types: binary indicator outcomes (wins/losses) or measured outcomes (scores). For each type of results, we propose new models for estimating individuals' abilities, and hence a ranking of individuals. The estimation is carried out by solving convex minimization problems, for which we develop easy and efficient solution procedures. Experiments on real bridge records and multi-class classification demonstrate the viability of the proposed models.

(Bob)			A compound framework for sports results prediction: A football case study	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Rule-based reasoning; Bayesian inference; Sports prediction; Football; In-game time-series approach; Simulation	MATCHES; LEAGUE; SOCCER	We propose a framework for sports prediction using Bayesian inference and rule-based reasoning, together with an in-game time-series approach. The framework is novel in three ways. The framework consists of two major components: a rule-based reasoner and a Bayesian network component. The two different approaches cooperate in predicting the results of sports matches. It is motivated by the observation that sports matches are highly stochastic, but at the same time, the strategies of a team can be approximated by crisp logic rules. Furthermore, because of the rule-based component, our framework can give reasonably good predictions even when statistical data is scanty: it can be used to predict results of matches between teams which have had few previous encounters. Machine learning techniques have great difficulty in handling such situations of insufficient data. Second, our framework is able to consider many factors, such as current scores, morale, fatigue, skills, etc. when it predicts the results of sports matches: most previous work considered only one factor, usually the score. Third, in contrast to most previous work on sports results prediction, we use a knowledge-based in-game time-series approach to predict sports matches. This approach enables our framework to reflect the tides/flows of a sports match, making our predictions certainly more realistic, and somewhat more accurate. We have implemented a football results predictor called FIRES (Football Result Expert System) based on this framework, and show that it gives reasonable and stable predictions. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Constructing Bayesian networks for criminal profiling from limited data	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Criminal profiling; Crime analysis; Automation; Bayesian networks; Performance metrics	OFFENDER CHARACTERISTICS; PROBABILISTIC NETWORKS; CLASSIFIERS; BEHAVIORS; HOMICIDE; SYSTEMS	The increased availability of information technologies has enabled law enforcement agencies to compile databases with detailed information about major felonies. Machine learning techniques can utilize these databases to produce decision-aid tools to support police investigations. This paper presents a methodology for obtaining a Bayesian network (BN) model of offender behavior from a database of cleared homicides. The BN can infer the characteristics of an unknown offender from the crime scene evidence and, help narrow the list of suspects in an unsolved homicide. Our research shows that 80% of offender characteristics are predicted correctly on average in new single-victim homicides, and when confidence levels are taken into account this accuracy increases to 95.6%.

So, a hyperplane is learned and associated to each point. With this hyperplane we can define the bands distance, a distance measure that bring closer or move away points depending on its classes. We have used this new distance in classification tasks and have performed tests over 68 datasets: IS well-known UCI-Repository datasets, one private dataset, and 49 ad hoc synthetic datasets. We have used 10-fold cross-validation and, in order to compare the results of the classifiers, we have considered the mean accuracy and have also performed a paired two-tailored t-Student's test with a significance level of 95%. The results are encouraging and confirm the good behavior of the new proposed classification method. The bands distance has obtained the best overall results with 1-NN and k-NN classifiers when compared with other distances. Finally, we extract conclusions and outline some lines of future work.

Conventional analysis decomposes loss into errors due to aspects of the learning process, but in relational domains, the inference process used for prediction introduces an additional source of error. Collective inference techniques introduce additional error, both through the use of approximate inference algorithms and through variation in the availability of test-set information. To date, the impact of inference error on model performance has not been investigated. We propose a new bias/variance framework that decomposes loss into errors due to both the learning and inference processes. We evaluate the performance of three relational models on both synthetic and real-world datasets and show that (1) inference can be a significant source of error, and (2) the models exhibit different types of errors as data characteristics are varied.

Forecasting of thunderstorms in pre-monsoon season over northwest India	MAUSAM			English	Article						Thunderstorm; Expert system; Inductive machine learning; Multiple regression; Graphical discriminant analysis	EXPERT-SYSTEM	Early detection and forecasting of thunderstorms is important in safeguarding and prevention of damages resulting from violent thunderstorms. An Expert System for Thunderstorm Forecasting (ESTF) during pre-monsoon season over Delhi the representative location over northwest India has been developed for the first time in India by using technique of approaching the problem "bottom up" by using inductive machine learning techniques to automatically acquire the knowledge about thunderstorm forecasting from the weather development data set consisting of TEMP data of Delhi for the months of May and June for the years from 1995-1999. Only input required is the entry of 0000 UTC TEMP data of Delhi at surface, 850, 700, 500 and 300 hPa levels. The rules are based on stability indices and other thermodynamic parameters evaluated from the said sounding. The system also provides climatological information about thunderstorms over Delhi. To compare the ESTF with the objective techniques, Dynamical-statistical methods for yes or no type thunderstorm occurrence forecast over Delhi during pre-monsoon months of May and June have been developed by using graphical discrimination method and multiple regression method and by using the same development data set i.e., TEMP data of Delhi for the months of May and June for the years from 1995-1999 and by using the same potential predictors as used in development of ESTF. In multiple regression method the parameters were found to be significant by stepwise screening procedure. The three methods developed were tested with independent data sets of May and June for the years from 2000-2001. Comparison of verification parameters of the forecast issued by Graphical Discrimination method, Multiple Regression Technique and by ESTF indicates that results of multiple regression method are better than those of graphical discrimination method. The results obtained by using ESTF were better than those obtained by using dynamical statistical models.	[Dhawan, V.

A tunable high-performance architecture for enhancement of stream video captured under non-uniform lighting conditions	MICROPROCESSORS AND MICROSYSTEMS			English	Article						Nonlinear color image enhancement; Reflectance-illuminance model; HSV-domain components rendering; Color space conversion; Log-domain computation; 2D convolution; Parallel-pipelining; Multiplier-less architecture; Homomorphic filter; Quadrant symmetric architecture	RETINEX	A novel architecture for performing hue-saturation-value (HSV) domain enhancement of digital color images captured under non-uniform lighting conditions is proposed in this paper for video streaming applications. The approach promotes log-domain computation to eliminate all multiplications, divisions and exponentiations utilizing the compact high-speed logarithmic estimation modules. An optimized quadrant symmetric architecture is incorporated into the design of homomorphic filter for the enhancement of intensity value. Efficient modules are also presented for conversion between RGB and HSV color spaces with tunable H and S components in HSV for more flexible color rendering. The design is able to bring out details hidden in shadow regions of the image and preserve the bright parts with adjustable vividness and color shift for improvement of visual quality while maintaining its consistency. It is capable of producing 187.86 million outputs per second (MOPs) on Xilinx's Virtex II XC2V2000-4ff896 field programmable gate array (FPGA) at a clock frequency of 187.86 MHz. It can process over 179.1 (1024 x 1024) frames per second, which is very suitable for high definition videos, and consumes approximately 70.7% and 76.8% less hardware resource with 127% and 280% performance boost when compared to the designs with machine learning algorithm in [M.Z.

Decadal Climate Simulations Using Accurate and Fast Neural Network Emulation of Full, Longwave and Shortwave, Radiation	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW			English	Article							MACHINE LEARNING COMPONENTS; ATMOSPHERIC MODEL; PARAMETERIZATION; REANALYSIS; PROJECT	An approach to calculating model physics using neural network emulations, previously proposed and developed by the authors, has been implemented in this study for both longwave and shortwave radiation parameterizations, or to the full model radiation, the most time-consuming component of model physics. The developed highly accurate neural network emulations of the NCAR Community Atmospheric Model (CAM) longwave and shortwave radiation parameterizations are 150 and 20 times as fast as the original/control longwave and shortwave radiation parameterizations, respectively. The full neural network model radiation was used for a decadal climate model simulation with the NCAR CAM. A detailed comparison of parallel decadal climate simulations performed with the original NCAR model radiation parameterizations and with their neural network emulations is presented. Almost identical results have been obtained for the parallel decadal simulations. This opens the opportunity of using efficient neural network emulations for the full model radiation for decadal and longer climate simulations as well as for weather prediction.

Evolutionary tuning of SVM parameter values in multiclass problems	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th Brazilian Symposium on Neural Networks	2006	Ribeirao Preto, BRAZIL	Brazilian Comp Soc, Int Neural Networks Soc, Special Interest Grp SIG INNS		Parameter tuning; Machine learning; Multiclass classification; Support vector machines; Genetic algorithms	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; LEARNING ALGORITHMS; CLASSIFICATION; CLASSIFIERS	Support vector machines (SVMs) were originally formulated for the solution of binary classification problems. In multiclass problems, a decomposition approach is often employed, in which the multiclass problem is divided into multiple binary subproblems, whose results are combined. Generally, the performance of SVM classifiers is affected by the selection of values for their parameters. This paper investigates the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) to tune the parameters of the binary SVMs in common multiclass decompositions. The developed GA may search for a set of parameter values common to all binary classifiers or for differentiated values for each binary classifier. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These studies are based on the application of advanced pattern recognition approaches and multivariate statistical classifiers. Most published articles in this field are focused on improving the accuracy rates and many approaches have been proposed to accomplish this task. Nevertheless, a point inherent to most machine learning methods (and still relatively unexplored in neuroimaging) is how the discriminative information can be used to characterize groups and their differences. In this work, we introduce the Maximum Uncertainty Linear Discrimination Analysis (MLDA) and show how it can be applied to infer groups' patterns by discriminant hyperplane navigation. In addition, we show that it naturally defines a behavioral score, i.e., an index quantifying the distance between the states of a subject from predefined groups. We validate and illustrate this approach using a motor block design fMRI experiment data with 35 subjects. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Hybrid ICA-Bayesian network approach reveals distinct effective connectivity differences in schizophrenia	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL MRI DATA; STATISTICAL LIMITATIONS; TIME-SERIES; BRAIN; TASK; FMRI; NEUROBIOLOGY; ACTIVATIONS; DYSFUNCTION	We utilized a discrete dynamic Bayesian network (dDBN) approach (Burge, J., Lane, T., Link, H., Qiu, S., Clark, V.P., 2007. Discrete dynamic Bayesian network analysis of fMRI data. Hum Brain Mapp.) to determine differences in brain re.-ions between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls on a measure of effective connectivity, termed the approximate conditional likelihood score (ACL) (Burge, J., Lane, T., 2005. Learning Class-Discriminative Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning, Bonn, Germany, pp. 97-104.). The ACL score represents a class-discriminative measure of effective connectivity by measuring the relative likelihood of the correlation between brain regions in one group versus another. The algorithm is capable of finding non-linear relationships between brain regions because it uses discrete rather than continuous values and attempts to model temporal relationships with a first-order Markov and stationary assumption constraint (Papoulis, A., 1991. Probability, random variables, and stochastic processes. McGraw-Hill, New York.). Since Bayesian networks are overly sensitive to noisy data, we introduced an independent component analysis (ICA) filtering approach that attempted to reduce the noise found in fMRI data by unmixing the raw datasets into a set of independent spatial component maps. Components that represented noise were removed and the remaining components reconstructed into the dimensions of the original fMRI datasets. We applied the dDBN algorithm to a group of 35 patients with schizophrenia and 35 matched healthy controls using an ICA filtered and unfiltered approach. We determined that filtering the data significantly improved the magnitude of the ACL score. Patients showed the greatest ACL scores in several regions, most markedly the cerebellar vermis and hemispheres. Our findings suggest that schizophrenia patients exhibit weaker connectivity than healthy controls in multiple regions, including bilateral temporal, frontal, and cerebellar regions during art auditory paradigm.

J	Wu, CC; Chou, CH; Chang, F				Wu, Chung-Chih; Chou, Chien-Hsing; Chang, Fu			A machine-learning approach for analyzing document layout structures with two reading orders	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						binary decision; document layout analysis; reading order; support vector machine; taboo box; textline; text region	PAGE SEGMENTATION; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM; NETWORKS	The purpose of document layout analysis is to locate textlines and text regions in document images mostly via a series of split-or-merge operations. Before applying such an operation, however, it is necessary to examine the context to decide whether the place chosen for the operation is appropriate. We thus view document layout analysis as a matter of solving a series of binary decision problems, such as whether to apply, or not to apply, a split-or-merge operation to a chosen place. To solve these problems, we use support vector machines to learn whether OF not to apply the previously mentioned operations from training documents in which all textlines and text regions have been located and their identifies labeled. The proposed approach is very effective for analyzing documents that allow both horizontal and vertical reading orders. When applied to a test data set composed of eight types of layout structure, the approach's accuracy rates for identifying textlines and text regions are 98.83% and 96.72%, respectively.

Mapping selective logging in mixed deciduous forest: A comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; REMOTELY-SENSED DATA; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD CLASSIFICATION; DECISION-TREE; CANOPY DAMAGE; SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION; IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; FUZZY ARTMAP; UNCERTAINTY	This study assesses the performance of five Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) in a chronically modified mixed deciduous forest in Massachusetts (USA) in terms of their ability to detect selective timber logging and to cope with deficient reference datasets. Multitemporal Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper-plus (ETM+) imagery is used to assess the performance of three Artificial Neural Networks - Multi-Layer Perceptron, ARTMAP, Self-Organizing Map, and two Classification Tree splitting algorithms: gini and entropy rules. MLA performance evaluations are based on susceptibility to reduced training set size, noise, and variations in the training set, as well as the operability/transparency of the classification process. Classification trees produced the most accurate selective logging maps (gini and entropy rule decision tree mean overall map accuracy = 94 percent and mean per-class kappa of 0.59 and 0.60, respectively). Classification trees are shown to be more robust and accurate when faced with deficient training data, regardless of splitting rule. Of the neural network algorithms, self-organizing maps were least sensitive to the introduction of noise and variations in training data. Given their robust classification capabilities and transparency of the class-selection process, classification trees are preferable algorithms for mapping selective logging and have potential in other forest monitoring applications.

J	Walton, JT				Walton, Jeffrey T.			Subpixel urban land cover estimation: Comparing Cubist, Random Forests, and support vector regression	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							SPECTRAL MIXTURE ANALYSIS; UNITED-STATES; VEGETATION ABUNDANCE; DECISION TREES; CLASSIFICATION; MACHINES; IMAGERY; TUTORIAL; SURFACES; DATABASE	Three machine learning subpixel estimation methods (Cubist, Random Forests, and support vector regression) were applied to estimate urban cover. Urban forest canopy cover and impervious surface cover were estimated from Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery using a higher resolution cover map resampled to 30 m as training and reference data. Three different band combinations (reflectance, tasseled cap, and both reflectance and tasseled cap plus thermal) were compared for their effectiveness with each of the methods. Thirty different training site number and size combinations were also tested. Support vector regression on the tasseled cap bands was found to be the best estimator for urban forest canopy cover, while Cubist performed best using the reflectance plus tasseled cap band combination when predicting impervious surface cover. More training data partitioned in many small training sites generally produces better estimation results.

We have developed an approach to annotate the 'leftover proteins' i.e., those which cannot be assigned function using sequence similarity. Our method (MOPS) is pan-taxonomic, predicting fine-grained molecular function (rather than a broad functional category) with high performance. In addition, we developed a validation scheme that assesses predictions using domain-specific knowledge.	[Kannan, S.; Hauth, A.

J	Wang, Y; Kim, I				Wang, Yun; Kim, Inyoung			A Bootstrap-based Simple Probability Model for Classifying Network Traffic and Detecting Network Intrusion	SECURITY JOURNAL			English	Article						intrusion detection; machine learning; classification; network traffic analysis; network security		Network traffic audit data provide unique and valuable information for network security. Although a comprehensive intrusion detection scheme contains multiple data sources and multiple measurements, the system-level traffic data provide important baseline information on anomalous traffic that could harm the network system, and such information can be learned from training data. However, when labeled abnormal data are not available or such events are insufficient in training data, conventional supervised classification methods, such as regression models and neural networks, are not suitable. Using the bootstrap resampling method, we developed a simple probability model trained with an anomaly-free training sample and yielded a receiver operating characteristic area of 0.96, specificity of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.96, and a classification agreement rate of 0.96 to detect abnormal events in a testing sample. The model provides a potential approach for classifying network traffic when limited or no abnormal information is available in training data.

In the realm of elemental analysis, LIBS has great potential to accomplish direct analysis independently of physical sample state (solid, liquid or gas). Presently. LIBS has been easily employed for qualitative analysis. nevertheless, in order to perform quantitative analysis, some effort is still required since calibration represents a difficult issue. Artificial neural network (ANN) is a machine learning paradigm inspired on biological nervous systems. Recently, ANNs have been used in many applications and its classification and prediction capabilities are especially useful for spectral analysis. In this paper an ANN was used as calibration strategy for LIBS, aiming Cu determination in soil samples. Spectra of 59 samples from a heterogenic set of reference soil samples and their respective Cu concentration were used for calibration and validation. Simple linear regression (SLR) and wrapper approach were the two strategies employed to select a set of wavelengths for ANN learning. Cross validation was applied, following ANN training, for verification of prediction accuracy. The ANN showed good efficiency for Cu predictions although the features of portable instrumentation employed. The proposed method presented a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.3 mg dm(-3) of Cu and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.5 for the predictions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We introduce a paired cross-validation approach for the estimation of misclassification error rates in the classification of data from paired organs. The dependence structure of the sample is honored by subject-level cross-validation. Theoretical considerations as well as a case-control study on glaucoma diagnosis and a simulation study show that the variance of the paired cross-validation estimator is considerably lower than in traditional cross-validation error estimation on one randomly selected eye per subject. The actual variance reduction is mainly controlled by the contribution of differential misclassification between both eyes to the overall error rate. By contrast, 'ad hoc' cross-validation ignoring the autocorrelation of paired organs leads to biased error estimates. Using the double-bagging technique, we also show that classification accuracy can be improved by using information from both eyes in training machine-learning classifiers. In glaucoma detection, the reduction in misclassification error rates by training data from both eyes is equivalent to an increase in the sample size by one-third to one-half, which is an important achievement in clinical studies.

Still, only a fraction of existing metabolites and their spectral fingerprints are known. Computer- Assisted Structure Elucidation (CASE) of biological metabolites will be an important tool to leverage this lack of knowledge. Indispensable for CASE are modules to predict spectra for hypothetical structures. This paper evaluates different statistical and machine learning methods to perform predictions of proton NMR spectra based on data from our open database NMRShiftDB. Results: A mean absolute error of 0.18 ppm was achieved for the prediction of proton NMR shifts ranging from 0 to 11 ppm. Random forest, J48 decision tree and support vector machines achieved similar overall errors. HOSE codes being a notably simple method achieved a comparatively good result of 0.17 ppm mean absolute error. Conclusion: NMR prediction methods applied in the course of this work delivered precise predictions which can serve as a building block for Computer-Assisted Structure Elucidation for biological metabolites.

Combining classifiers for improved classification of proteins from sequence or structure	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							ALIGNMENT; DATABASE; MODELS; TOOL	Background: Predicting a protein's structural or functional class from its amino acid sequence or structure is a fundamental problem in computational biology. Recently, there has been considerable interest in using discriminative learning algorithms, in particular support vector machines (SVMs), for classification of proteins. However, because sufficiently many positive examples are required to train such classifiers, all SVM-based methods are hampered by limited coverage. Results: In this study, we develop a hybrid machine learning approach for classifying proteins, and we apply the method to the problem of assigning proteins to structural categories based on their sequences or their 3D structures. The method combines a full-coverage but lower accuracy nearest neighbor method with higher accuracy but reduced coverage multiclass SVMs to produce a full coverage classifier with overall improved accuracy. The hybrid approach is based on the simple idea of "punting" from one method to another using a learned threshold. Conclusion: In cross-validated experiments on the SCOP hierarchy, the hybrid methods consistently outperform the individual component methods at all levels of coverage.

Enzymes/non-enzymes classification model complexity based on composition, sequence, 3D and topological indices	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						protein models; protein secondary structures; star graph; Python application	AMINO-ACID-COMPOSITION; DNA PRIMARY SEQUENCES; FUNCTIONAL DOMAIN COMPOSITION; 2D GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION; HIV-1 REVERSE-TRANSCRIPTASE; PROTEASE CLEAVAGE SITES; FAMILY CLASSES; DRUG DESIGN; SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION; COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH	The huge amount of new proteins that need a fast enzymatic activity characterization creates demands of protein QSAR theoretical models. The protein parameters that can be used for an enzyme/non-enzyme classification includes the simpler indices such as composition, sequence and connectivity, also called topological indices (TIs) and the computationally expensive 3D descriptors. A comparison of the 3D versus lower dimension indices has not been reported with respect to the power of discrimination of proteins according to enzyme action. A set of 966 proteins (enzymes and non-enzymes) whose structural characteristics are provided by PDB/DSSP files was analyzed with Python/Biopython scripts, STATISTICA and Weka. The list of indices includes, but it is not restricted to pure composition indices (residue fractions), DSSP secondary structure protein composition and 3D indices (surface and access). We also used mixed indices such as composition-sequence indices (Chou's pseudoamino acid compositions or coupling numbers), 31)-composition (surface fractions) and DSSP secondary structure amino acid composition/propensities (obtained with our Prot-2S Web too[). In addition, we extend and test for the first time several classic TIs for the Randic's protein sequence Star graphs using our Sequence to Star Graph (S2SG) Python application. All the indices were processed with general discriminant analysis models (GDA), neural networks (NN) and machine learning (ML) methods and the results are presented versus complexity, average of Shannon's information entropy (Sh) and data/ method type. This study compares for the first time all these classes of indices to assess the ratios between model accuracy and indices/model complexity in enzyme/non-enzyme discrimination. The use of different methods and complexity of data shows that one cannot establish a direct relation between the complexity and the accuracy of the model. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hsing, M; Byler, KG; Cherkasov, A				Hsing, Michael; Byler, Kendall Grant; Cherkasov, Artem			The use of Gene Ontology terms for predicting highly-connected 'hub' nodes in protein-protein interaction networks	BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY			English	Article							YEAST SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; DATABASE; COMPLEXES; BIOLOGY; SCALE; MAP; IDENTIFICATION; EXPRESSION; UPDATE; DOMAIN	Background: Protein-protein interactions mediate a wide range of cellular functions and responses and have been studied rigorously through recent large-scale proteomics experiments and bioinformatics analyses. One of the most important findings of those endeavours was the observation that 'hub' proteins participate in significant numbers of protein interactions and play critical roles in the organization and function of cellular protein interaction networks (PINs) [1,2]. It has also been demonstrated that such hub proteins may constitute an important pool of attractive drug targets. Thus, it is crucial to be able to identify hub proteins based not only on experimental data but also by means of bioinformatics predictions. Results: A hub protein classifier has been developed based on the available interaction data and Gene Ontology (GO) annotations for proteins in the Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens genomes. In particular, by utilizing the machine learning method of boosting trees we were able to create a predictive bioinformatics tool for the identification of proteins that are likely to play the role of a hub in protein interaction networks. Testing the developed hub classifier on external sets of experimental protein interaction data in Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 252 and Caenorhabditis elegans demonstrated that our approach can predict hub proteins with a high degree of accuracy. A practical application of the developed bioinformatics method has been illustrated by the effective protein bait selection for large-scale pull-down experiments that aim to map complete protein-protein interaction networks for several species. Conclusion: The successful development of an accurate hub classifier demonstrated that highly-connected proteins tend to share certain relevant functional properties reflected in their Gene Ontology annotations. It is anticipated that the developed bioinformatics hub classifier will represent a useful tool for the theoretical prediction of highly-interacting proteins, the study of cellular network organizations, and the identification of prospective drug targets - even in those organisms that currently lack large-scale protein interaction data.

J	Hullermeier, E; Brinker, K				Huellermeier, Eyke; Brinker, Klaus			Learning valued preference structures for solving classification problems	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						machine learning; classification; fuzzy preference relations; decision analysis	BINARY; RULE	This paper introduces a new approach to classification which combines pairwise decomposition techniques with ideas and tools from fuzzy preference modeling. More specifically, our approach first decomposes a polychotomous classification problem involving in classes into an ensemble of binary problems, one for each ordered pair of classes. The corresponding classifiers are trained on the relevant subsets of the (transformed) original training data. In the classification phase, a new query is submitted to every binary learner. The output of each classifier is interpreted as a fuzzy degree of preference for the first in comparison with the second class. By combining the outputs of all classifiers, one thus obtains a fuzzy preference relation which is taken as a point of departure for the final classification decision. This way, the problem of classification is effectively reduced to a problem of decision making based on a fuzzy preference relation. Corresponding techniques, which have been investigated quite intensively in the field of fuzzy set theory, hence become amenable to the task of classification. In particular, by decomposing a preference relation into a strict preference, an indifference, and an incomparability relation, this approach allows one to quantify different types of uncertainty in classification and thereby supports sophisticated classification and postprocessing strategies.

First, given existing constraints which prevent individual sites from exchanging detailed numeric data, any communication has to be realized at the level of information granules. The specificity of these granules impacts the effectiveness of ensuing collaborative activities. Second, the fuzzy clustering realized at the level of the individual data site has to constructively consider the findings communicated by other sites and act upon them while running the optimization confined to the particular data site. Adhering to these two general guidelines, we develop a comprehensive optimization scheme and discuss its two-phase character in which the communication phase of the granular findings intertwines with the local optimization being realized at the level of the individual site and exploits the evidence collected from other sites. The proposed augmented form of the objective function is essential in the navigation of the overall optimization that has to be completed on a basis of the data and available information granules. The intensity of collaboration is optimized by choosing a suitable tradeoff between the two components of the objective function. The objective function based clustering used here concerns the well-known Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm. Experimental Studies presented include some synthetic data, selected data sets coming from the machine learning repository and the weather data coming from Environment Canada. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A knowledge-based approach to predict intragenic deletions or duplications	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							GENOMIC DISORDERS; REARRANGEMENTS; CANCER; GENE; IDENTIFICATION; RECOMBINATION; POLYMORPHISMS; ARCHITECTURE; SEQUENCES; DATABASE	Motivation: Despite recent improvements in high-throughput or classic molecular biology approaches it is still challenging to identify intermediate resolution genomic variations (50 bp to 50 kb). Although array-based technologies can be used to detect copy number variations in the human genome they are biased to detect only the largest such deletions or duplications. Several studies have identified deletions or duplications occurring within a gene that directly cause or predispose to disease. We have developed a novel computational system, SPeeDD (system to prioritize deletions or duplications) that utilizes machine learning techniques to predict likely candidate regions that delete or duplicate exon(s) within a gene. Results: Data mining and machine learning methods were applied to identify sequence features that were predictive of homologous recombination events. The logistic model tree (LMT) method yielded the best results. Sensitivity varied from 20 to 71.6 depending on the specific machine learning model used, but specificity exceeded 90 for all methods evaluated. In addition, the SPeeDD system successfully predicted and prioritized a recently published novel BRCA1 mutation. Conclusions: Results suggest that the SPeeDD system is effective at prioritizing candidate deletions and duplications within a gene. Use of SPeeDD enables more focused screening, which reduces the labor and associated costs of the molecular assays and may also lead to targeted design of new array-based screens to focus on candidate areas to accelerate the process of mutation discovery.

Accurate prediction of stability changes in protein mutants by combining machine learning with structure based computational mutagenesis	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							DATABASE-DERIVED POTENTIALS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; POINT MUTATIONS; SOLVENT ACCESSIBILITY; MOLECULAR MECHANICS; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; MEAN FORCE; SEQUENCE; DISTANCE; SIMULATION	Motivation: Accurate predictive models for the impact of single amino acid substitutions on protein stability provide insight into protein structure and function. Such models are also valuable for the design and engineering of new proteins. Previously described methods have utilized properties of protein sequence or structure to predict the free energy change of mutants due to thermal (Delta Delta G) and denaturant (Delta Delta G(H2O)) denaturations, as well as mutant thermal stability (Delta T(m)), through the application of either computational energy-based approaches or machine learning techniques. However, accuracy associated with applying these methods separately is frequently far from optimal. Results: We detail a computational mutagenesis technique based on a four-body, knowledge-based, statistical contact potential. For any mutation due to a single amino acid replacement in a protein, the method provides an empirical normalized measure of the ensuing environmental perturbation occurring at every residue position. A feature vector is generated for the mutant by considering perturbations at the mutated position and its ordered six nearest neighbors in the 3-dimensional (3D) protein structure. These predictors of stability change are evaluated by applying machine learning tools to large training sets of mutants derived from diverse proteins that have been experimentally studied and described. Predictive models based on our combined approach are either comparable to, or in many cases significantly outperform, previously published results.

John			Multi-dimensional classification of biomedical text: Toward automated, practical provision of high-utility text to diverse users	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; GENE	Motivation: Much current research in biomedical text mining is concerned with serving biologists by extracting certain information from scientific text. We note that there is no average biologist client; different users have distinct needs. For instance, as noted in past evaluation efforts (BioCreative, TREC, KDD) database curators are often interested in sentences showing experimental evidence and methods. Conversely, lab scientists searching for known information about a protein may seek facts, typically stated with high confidence. Text-mining systems can target specific end-users and become more effective, if the system can first identify text regions rich in the type of scientific content that is of interest to the user, retrieve documents that have many such regions, and focus on fact extraction from these regions. Here, we study the ability to characterize and classify such text automatically. We have recently introduced a multi-dimensional categorization and annotation scheme, developed to be applicable to a wide variety of biomedical documents and scientific statements, while intended to support specific biomedical retrieval and extraction tasks. Results: The annotation scheme was applied to a large corpus in a controlled effort by eight independent annotators, where three individual annotators independently tagged each sentence. We then trained and tested machine learning classifiers to automatically categorize sentence fragments based on the annotation. We discuss here the issues involved in this task, and present an overview of the results. The latter strongly suggest that automatic annotation along most of the dimensions is highly feasible, and that this new framework for scientific sentence categorization is applicable in practice.

As the classical rough set model can just be used to evaluate categorical features, we generalize this model with neighborhood relations and introduce a neighborhood rough set model. The proposed model will degrade to the classical one if we specify the size of neighborhood zero. The neighborhood model is used to reduce numerical and categorical features by assigning different thresholds for different kinds of attributes. In this model the sizes of the neighborhood lower and upper approximations of decisions reflect the discriminating capability of feature subsets. The size of lower approximation is computed as the dependency between decision and condition attributes. We use the neighborhood dependency to evaluate the significance of a subset of heterogeneous features and construct forward feature subset selection algorithms. The proposed algorithms are compared with some classical techniques. Experimental results show that the neighborhood model based method is more flexible to deal with heterogeneous data.

To study the impact of ESEs on alternative splicing it would be useful to have a possibility to detect them in exons. Identifying SR protein-binding sites in human DNA sequences by machine learning techniques is a formidable task, since the exon sequences are also constrained by their functional role in coding for proteins. Results: The choice of training examples needed for machine learning approaches is difficult since there are only few exact locations of human ESEs described in the literature which could be considered as positive examples. Additionally, it is unclear which sequences are suitable as negative examples. Therefore, we developed a motif-oriented data-extraction method that extracts exon sequences around experimentally or theoretically determined ESE patterns. Positive examples are restricted by heuristics based on known properties of ESEs, e.g. location in the vicinity of a splice site, whereas negative examples are taken in the same way from the middle of long exons. We show that a suitably chosen SVM using optimized sequence kernels (e.g., combined oligo kernel) can extract meaningful properties from these training examples. Once the classifier is trained, every potential ESE sequence can be passed to the SVM for verification. Using SVMs with the combined oligo kernel yields a high accuracy of about 90 percent and well interpretable parameters. Conclusion: The motif-oriented data-extraction method seems to produce consistent training and test data leading to good classification rates and thus allows verification of potential ESE motifs. The best results were obtained using an SVM with the combined oligo kernel, while oligo kernels with oligomers of a certain length could be used to extract relevant features.

We describe the development and content of a novel custom SNP panel that contains 3404 SNPs in 983 genes, representing cellular functions and pathways that may influence disease severity at diagnosis, toxicity, progression or other treatment outcomes. A systematic search of national databases was used to identify non-synonymous coding SNPs and SNPs within transcriptional regulatory regions. To explore SNP associations with PFS we compared SNP profiles of short term (less than 1 year, n = 70) versus long term progression-free survivors (greater than 3 years, n = 73) in two phase III clinical trials. Results: Quality controls were established, demonstrating an accurate and robust screening panel for genetic variations, and some initial racial comparisons of allelic variation were done. A variety of analytical approaches, including machine learning tools for data mining and recursive partitioning analyses, demonstrated predictive value of the SNP panel in survival. While the entire SNP panel showed genotype predictive association with PFS, some SNP subsets were identified within drug response, cellular signaling and cell cycle genes. Conclusion: A targeted gene approach was undertaken to develop an SNP panel that can test for associations with clinical outcomes in myeloma. The initial analysis provided some predictive power, demonstrating that genetic variations in the myeloma patient population may influence PFS.

J	Jacob, L; Hoffmann, B; Stoven, V; Vert, JP				Jacob, Laurent; Hoffmann, Brice; Stoven, Veronique; Vert, Jean-Philippe			Virtual screening of GPCRs: An in silico chemogenomics approach	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED-RECEPTORS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DRUG DISCOVERY; GRAPH KERNELS; SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; LIGANDS; BINDING; DESIGN; PREDICTION; TARGETS	Background: The G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily is currently the largest class of therapeutic targets. In silico prediction of interactions between GPCRs and small molecules in the transmembrane ligand-binding site is therefore a crucial step in the drug discovery process, which remains a daunting task due to the difficulty to characterize the 3D structure of most GPCRs, and to the limited amount of known ligands for some members of the superfamily. Chemogenomics, which attempts to characterize interactions between all members of a target class and all small molecules simultaneously, has recently been proposed as an interesting alternative to traditional docking or ligand-based virtual screening strategies. Results: We show that interaction prediction in the chemogenomics framework outperforms state-of-the-art individual ligand-based methods in accuracy both for receptor with known ligands and without known ligands. This is done with no knowledge of the receptor 3D structure. In particular we are able to predict ligands of orphan GPCRs with an estimated accuracy of 78.1%. Conclusion: We propose new methods for in silico chemogenomics and validate them on the virtual screening of GPCRs. The methods represent an extension of a recently proposed machine learning strategy, based on support vector machines (SVM), which provides a flexible framework to incorporate various information sources on the biological space of targets and on the chemical space of small molecules. We investigate the use of 2D and 3D descriptors for small molecules, and test a variety of descriptors for GPCRs. We show that incorporating information about the known hierarchical classification of the target family and about key residues in their inferred binding pockets significantly improves the prediction accuracy of our model.

Our objective is to combine multiple independently learned models from several users to construct an advanced ensemble-based decision model by taking the knowledge of multiple users into account in a decentralized manner, for example, in a peer-to-peer overlay network. High accuracy of the corresponding supervised (classification) and unsupervised (clustering) methods is achieved by restrictively leaving out uncertain documents rather than assigning them to inappropriate topics or clusters with low confidence. We introduce a formal probabilistic model for the resulting ensemble based meta methods and explain how it can be used for constructing estimators and for goal-oriented tuning. Comprehensive evaluation results on different reference data sets illustrate the viability of our approach.

J	Menczer, F; Wu, LS; Akavipat, R				Menczer, Filippo; Wu, Le-Shin; Akavipat, Ruj			Intelligent Peer Networks for Collaborative Web Search	AI MAGAZINE			English	Article								Collaborative query routing is a new paradigm for web search that treats both established search engines and other publicly available indexes as intelligent peer agents in a search network. The approach makes it transparent for anyone to build his or her own (micro) search engine by integrating established web search services, desktop search, and topical crawling techniques. The challenge in this model is that each of these agents must team about its environment-the existence, knowledge, diversity, reliability and trustworthiness of other agents-by analyzing the queries received from and results exchanged with these other agents. We present the 6S peer network, which uses machine-learning techniques to learn about the changing query environment. We show that simple reinforcement learning algorithms are sufficient to detect and exploit semantic locality in the network, resulting in efficient routing and high-quality search results. A prototype of 6S is available for public use and is intended to assist in the evaluation of different AI techniques employed by the networked agents.

A recent focus in machine-learnings research has been to extend traditional machine-learning classification techniques to classify nodes in such networks. In this article, we provide a brief introduction to this area of research and how it has progressed during the past decade. We introduce four of the most widely used inference algorithms for classifying networked data and empirically compare them on both synthetic and real-world data.

PREDICTIVE LEARNING VIA RULE ENSEMBLES	ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Regression; classification; learning ensembles; rules; interaction effects; variable importance; machine learning; data mining	REGRESSION; SHRINKAGE	General regression and classification models are constructed as linear combinations of simple rules derived from the data. Each rule consists of a conjunction of a small number of simple statements concerning the values of individual input variables. These rule ensembles are shown to produce predictive accuracy comparable to the best methods. However, their principle advantage lies in interpretation. Because of its simple form, each rule is easy to understand, as it its influence on individual predictions, selected subsets of predictions, or globally over the entire space of joint input variable values. Similarly, the degree of relevance of the respective input variables can be assessed globally, locally in different regions of the input space, or at individual prediction points. Techniques are presented for automatically identifying those variables that are involved in interactions with other variables, the strength and degree of those interactions, as well as the indentities of the other variables with which they interact. Graphical representations are used to visualize both main and interaction effects.

Kernel parameter setting in the SVM training process, along with the feature selection, significantly affects classification accuracy. The objective of this study is to obtain the better parameter values while also finding a subset of features that does not degrade the SVM classification accuracy. This study develops a simulated annealing (SA) approach for parameter determination and feature selection in the SVM, termed SA-SVM. To measure the proposed SA-SVM approach, several datasets in UCI machine learning repository are adopted to calculate the classification accuracy rate. The proposed approach was compared with grid search which is a conventional method of performing parameter setting, and various other methods. Experimental results indicate that the classification accuracy rates of the proposed approach exceed those of grid search and other approaches. The SA-SVM is thus useful for parameter determination and feature selection in the SVM. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kianmehr, K; Alhajj, R				Kianmehr, Keivan; Alhajj, Reda			CARSVM: A class association rule-based classification framework and its application to gene expression data	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Machine learning; Association rule mining; Associative classifiers; Support vector machine; Data mining; Gene expression analysis; Gene expression classification; Gene selection	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; EMERGING PATTERNS; CANCER; PREDICTION; SELECTION	Objective: In this study, we aim at building a classification framework, namely the CARSVM model, which integrates association rule mining and support vector machine (SVM). The goal is to benefit from advantages of both, the discriminative knowledge represented by class association rules and the classification power of the SVM algorithm, to construct an efficient and accurate classifier model that improves the interpretability problem of SVM as a traditional machine learning technique and overcomes the efficiency issues of associative classification algorithms. Method: In our proposed framework: instead of using the original training set, a set of rule-based feature vectors, which are generated based on the discriminative ability of class association rules over the training samples, are presented to the learning component of the SVM algorithm. We show that rule-based feature vectors present a high-qualified source of discrimination knowledge that can impact substantially the prediction power of SVM and associative classification techniques. They provide users with more conveniences in terms of understandability and interpretability as well. Results: We have used four datasets from LICI ML repository to evaluate the performance of the developed system in comparison with five well-known existing classification methods. Because of the importance and popularity of gene expression analysis as real world application of the classification model, we present an extension of CARSVM combined with feature selection to be applied to gene expression data. Then, we describe how this combination wilt provide biologists with an efficient and understandable classifier model. The reported test results and their biological interpretation demonstrate the applicability, efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model. Conclusion: From the results, it can be concluded that a considerable increase in classification accuracy can be obtained when the rule-based feature vectors are integrated in the learning process of the SVM algorithm. In the context of applicability according to the results obtained from gene expression analysis, we can conclude that the CARSVM system can be utilized in a variety of real world applications with some adjustments.

J	Weiner, JH; Li, L				Weiner, Joel H.; Li, Liang			Proteome of the Escherichia coli envelope and technological challenges in membrane proteome analysis	BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOMEMBRANES			English	Review						cytoplasmic membrane; periplasm; outer membrane; mass spectrometry; proteomics; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis	2-DIMENSIONAL GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS; CHROMATOGRAPHY MALDI MS/MS; ASSISTED ACID-HYDROLYSIS; CODED AFFINITY TAGS; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; OUTER-MEMBRANE; QUANTITATIVE PROTEOMICS; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; FUMARATE REDUCTASE; SIGNAL PEPTIDES	The envelope of Escherichia coli is a complex organelle composed of the outer membrane, periplasm-peptidoglycan layer and cytoplasmic membrane. Each compartment has a unique complement of proteins, the proteome. Determining the proteome of the envelope is essential for developing an in silico bacterial model, for determining cellular responses to environmental alterations, for determining the function of proteins encoded by genes of unknown function and for development and testing of new experimental technologies such as mass spectrometric methods for identifying and quantifying hydrophobic proteins. The availability of complete genomic information has led several groups to develop computer algorithms to predict the proteome of each part of the envelope by searching the genome for leader sequences, beta-sheet motifs and stretches of alpha-helical hydrophobic amino acids. In addition, published experimental data has been mined directly and by machine learning approaches. In this review we examine the somewhat confusing available literature and relate published experimental data to the most recent gene annotation of E. coli to describe the predicted and experimental proteome of each compartment. The problem of characterizing integral versus membrane-associated proteins is discussed. The E. coli envelope proteome provides an excellent test bed for developing mass spectrometric techniques for identifying hydrophobic proteins that have generally been refractory to analysis. We describe the gel based and solution based proteome analysis approaches along with protein cleavage and proteolysis methods that investigators are taking to tackle this difficult problem.

PuReD-MCL: a graph-based PubMed document clustering methodology	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							BIOLOGY; INFORMATION; ANNOTATION	Motivation: Biomedical literature is the principal repository of biomedical knowledge, with PubMed being the most complete database collecting, organizing and analyzing such textual knowledge. There are numerous efforts that attempt to exploit this information by using text mining and machine learning techniques. We developed a novel approach, called PuReD-MCL (Pubmed Related Documents-MCL), which is based on the graph clustering algorithm MCL and relevant resources from PubMed. Methods: PuReD-MCL avoids using natural language processing (NLP) techniques directly; instead, it takes advantage of existing resources, available from PubMed. PuReD-MCL then clusters documents efficiently using the MCL graph clustering algorithm, which is based on graph flow simulation. This process allows users to analyse the results by highlighting important clues, and finally to visualize the clusters and all relevant information using an interactive graph layout algorithm, for instance BioLayout Express 3D. Results: The methodology was applied to two different datasets, previously used for the validation of the document clustering tool TextQuest. The first dataset involves the organisms Escherichia coli and yeast, whereas the second is related to Drosophila development. PuReD-MCL successfully reproduces the annotated results obtained from TextQuest, while at the same time provides additional insights into the clusters and the corresponding documents.

Synergistic effects of the dopaminergic and glutamatergic system on hippocampal volume in alcohol-dependent patients	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						alcohol addiction; COMT; dopamine; mGluR3; glutamate; hippocampal volume; machine learning; P-SVM; variable selection	CATECHOL-O-METHYLTRANSFERASE; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; LONG-TERM-MEMORY; GENETIC-VARIATION; USE DISORDERS; HUMAN BRAIN; INDUCED REINSTATEMENT; RECEPTOR SUBTYPES; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; SEX-DIFFERENCES	Several genes of the dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems have been found to be associated with alcohol disease and related intermediate phenotypes. Here, we evaluated genetic variants of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and the metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3) genes in alcohol-dependent patients and their association with volumetric measurements of brain structures. By combined analysis of imaging data and genotyping results, large numbers of variables are produced that overstrain conventional statistical methods based on tests for group differences. Limitations in assessment of epistatic effects and multiple testing problems are encountered. Therefore, we introduce a novel method for detecting associations between a set of genetic markers and phenotypical measurements based on machine learning techniques. Hippocampal volume was found to be associated with epistatic effects of the COMT-mGluR3 genes in alcohol-dependent patients but not in controls. These data are in line with prior studies supporting a role for dopamine-glutamate interaction in modulation of alcohol disease. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The genetic algorithm was employed to select the variables that resulted in the best-fitted models. A comparison between the obtained results using support vector machine with those of multiple linear regression revealed that support vector machine model was much better than multiple linear regression. The root mean square errors of the training set and the test set for support vector machine model were calculated to be 0.102 and 0.205, and the correlation coefficients (r2) were 0.956 and 0.852, respectively. Furthermore, the obtained statistical parameter of leave-one-out (Q(LOO)(2)) and leave-group-out (Q(LGO)(2)) cross-validation test on support vector machine model were 0.893 and 0.881, respectively, which prove the reliability of this model. The results suggest that branching, volume and lipophilicity are the main independent factors contributing to the antiviral activities of the studied compounds.

J	Marechal, E				Marechal, Eric			Chemogenomics: A discipline at the crossroad of high throughput technologies, biomarker research, combinatorial chemistry, genomics, cheminformatics, bioinformatics and artificial intelligence	COMBINATORIAL CHEMISTRY & HIGH THROUGHPUT SCREENING			English	Article						chemogenomics; chemical genetics; bioinformatics; cheminformatics; biomarker; machine learning		Chemogenomics is the study of the interaction of functional biological systems with exogenous small molecules, or in broader sense the study of the intersection of biological and chemical spaces. Chemogenomics requires expertises in biology, chemistry and computational sciences (bioinformatics, cheminformatics, large scale statistics and machine learning methods) but it is more than the simple apposition of each of these disciplines. Biological entities interacting with small molecules can be isolated proteins or more elaborate systems, from single cells to complete organisms. The biological space is therefore analyzed at various postgenomic levels (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic or any phenotypic level). The space of small molecules is partially real, corresponding to commercial and academic collections of compounds, and partially virtual, corresponding to the chemical space possibly synthesizable. Synthetic chemistry has developed novel strategies allowing a physical exploration of this universe of possibilities. A major challenge of cheminformatics is to charter the virtual space of small molecules using realistic biological constraints (bioavailability, druggability, structural biological information). Chemogenomics is a descendent of conventional pharmaceutical approaches, since it involves the screening of chemolibraries for their effect on biological targets, and benefits from the advances in the corresponding enabling technologies and the introduction of new biological markers. Screening was originally motivated by the rigorous discovery of new drugs, neglecting and throwing away any molecule that would fail to meet the standards required for a therapeutic treatment. It is now the basis for the discovery of small molecules that might or might not be directly used as drugs, but which have an immense potential for basic research, as probes to explore an increasing number of biological phenomena. Concerns about the environmental impact of chemical industry open new fields of research for chemogenomics.

J	Vert, JP; Jacob, L				Vert, Jean-Philippe; Jacob, Laurent			Machine learning for in silico virtual screening and chemical genomics: New strategies	COMBINATORIAL CHEMISTRY & HIGH THROUGHPUT SCREENING			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; PROTEIN-COUPLED-RECEPTORS; DRUG DISCOVERY; GRAPH KERNELS; HOMOLOGY DETECTION; ALIGNMENT KERNELS; FOLD RECOGNITION; STRING KERNELS; PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION	Support vector machines and kernel methods belong to the same class of machine learning algorithms that has recently become prominent in both computational biology and chemistry, although both fields have largely ignored each other. These methods are based on a sound mathematical and computationally efficient framework that implicitly embeds the data of interest, respectively proteins and small molecules, in high-dimensional feature spaces where various classification or regression tasks can be performed with linear algorithms. In this review, we present the main ideas underlying these approaches, survey how both the "biological" and the "chemical" spaces have been separately constructed using the same mathematical framework and tricks, and suggest different avenues to unify both spaces for the purpose of in silico chemogenomics.

Conditional random fields for entity extraction and ontological text coding	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL ORGANIZATION THEORY			English	Article						ontological text coding; semantic networks; entity extraction; supervised machine learning; conditional models; Conditional Random Fields		Previous research suggests that one field with a strong yet unsatisfied need for automatically extracting instances of various entity classes from texts is the analysis of socio-technical systems (Feldstein in Media in Transition MiT5, 2007; Hampe et al. in Netzwerkanalyse und Netzwerktheorie, 2007; Weil et al. in Proceedings of the 2006 Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium, 2006; Diesner and Carley in XXV Sunbelt Social Network Conference, 2005). Traditional as well as non-traditional and customized sets of entity classes and the relationships between them are often specified in ontologies or taxonomies. We present a Conditional Random Fields (CRF)-based approach to distilling a set of entities that are defined in an ontology originating from organization science. CRF, a supervised sequential machine learning technique, facilitates the derivation of relational data from corpora by locating and classifying instances of various entity classes. The classified entities can be used as nodes for the construction of socio-technical networks. We find the outcome sufficiently accurate (82.7 percent accuracy of locating and classifying entities) for future application in the described problem domain. We propose using the presented methodology as a crucial step in the process of advanced modeling and analysis of complex and dynamic networks.

J	Reidsma, D; Carletta, J				Reidsma, Dennis; Carletta, Jean			Reliability measurement without limits	COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS			English	Editorial Material							CLASSIFICATION	In computational linguistics, a reliability measurement of 0.8 on some statistic such as. is widely thought to guarantee that hand-coded data is fit for purpose, with 0.67 to 0.8 tolerable, and lower values suspect. We demonstrate that the main use of such data, machine learning, can tolerate data with low reliability as long as any disagreement among human coders looks like random noise. When the disagreement introduces patterns, however, the machine learner can pick these up just like it picks up the real patterns in the data, making the performance figures look better than they really are. For the range of reliability measures that the field currently accepts, disagreement can appreciably in. ate performance configures, and even a measure of 0.8 does not guarantee that what looks like good performance really is. Although this is a commonsense result, it has implications for how we work. At the very least, computational linguists should look for any patterns in the disagreement among coders and assess what impact they will have.

J	Daya, E; Roth, D; Wintner, S				Daya, Ezra; Roth, Dan; Wintner, Shuly			Identifying Semitic roots: Machine learning with linguistic constraints	COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS			English	Article							INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL SYSTEM; WORDS	Words in Semitic languages are formed by combining two morphemes: a root and a pattern. The root consists of consonants only, by default three, and the pattern is a combination of vowels and consonants, with non-consecutive "slots" into which the root consonants are inserted. Identifying the root of a given word is an important task, considered to be an essential part of the morphological analysis of Semitic languages, and information on roots is important for linguistics research as well as for practical applications. We present a machine learning approach, augmented by limited linguistic knowledge, to the problem of identifying the roots of Semitic words. Although programs exist which can extract the root of words in Arabic and Hebrew, they are all dependent on labor-intensive construction of large-scale lexicons which are components of full-scale morphological analyzers. The advantage of our method is an automation of this process, avoiding the bottleneck of having to laboriously list the root and pattern of each lexeme in the language. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of machine learning to this problem, and one of the few attempts to directly address non-concatenative morphology using machine learning. More generally, our results shed light on the problem of combining classifiers under (linguistically motivated) constraints.

Three kinds of probabilistic induction: Universal distributions and convergence theorems	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						algorithmic Probability; universal probability distribution; machine learning; statistical learning theory; classification; identification problem; curve fitting; prediction; regression; grammatical induction; time series prediction; proof of convergence	FORMAL THEORY; COMPLEXITY; INFERENCE	We will describe three kinds of probabilistic induction problems, and give general solutions for each, with associated convergence theorems which show that they tend to give good probability estimates. The first kind extrapolates a sequence of strings and/or numbers. The second extrapolates an unordered set of strings and/or numbers. The third extrapolates an unordered set of ordered pairs of elements that may be strings and/or numbers. Given the first element of a new pair, to get a probability distribution on possible second elements of the pair. Each of the three kinds of problems is solved using an associated universal distribution. In each case a corresponding convergence theorem is given, showing that as sample size grows, the expected error in probability estimate decreases rapidly. The solutions given are very general and cover a great variety of induction problems. Time series prediction, grammar discovery (for both formal and natural languages), curve fitting, the identification problem and the categorization problem, are a few of the kinds of problems amenable to the methods described.

J	Guh, RS; Shiue, YR				Guh, Ruey-Shiang; Shiue, Yeou-Ren			An effective application of decision tree learning for on-line detection of mean shifts in multivariate control charts	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Statistical process control; Decision tree learning; Multivariate processes; Control charts; Neural networks	NEURAL-NETWORK APPROACH; QUALITY-CONTROL; PATTERN RECOGNIZER; IDENTIFICATION; VARIABLES; SYSTEM	With modern data acquisition system and on-line computer used during production, it is now common to monitor several correlated quality variables simultaneously. Various multivariate control charts (e.g., Hotelling's T-2, multivariate cumulative sum, and multivariate exponentially weighted moving average charts) have been designed for detecting mean shifts. The main problem of such charts is that they can detect an out-of-control event but do not directly determine which variable or group of variables has caused the out-of-control signal. Using decision tree learning techniques, this work proposes a straightforward and effective model to detect the mean shifts in multivariate control charts. Experimental results using simulation show that the proposed model cannot only efficiently detect the mean shifts but also accurately identify the variables that have deviated from their original means. The shift direction of each of the deviated variables call also be determined in the meantime. The experimental results also indicate that the learning speed of the proposed decision tree learning-based model is much faster (25 times in this research) than that of a neural network-based model (another machine learning-based approach) for detecting mean shifts in multivariate control charts. The feature of fast learning makes the proposed DT learning-based model more adaptable to a dynamic process-monitoring scenario, in which constant model re-designing and re-learning is required. A bivariate case of the proposed multivariate model is presented. A demonstrative application is provided to illustrate the usage of the proposed decision tree learning-based approach to multivariate quality control. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, their usefulness in real-world multi-class problems has not been demonstrated yet. In these frequently occurring multi-class cases, simple accuracy meters that do compensate for random successes, such as the kappa statistic, are needed. ROC curves are two-dimensional graphs. Kappa is a scalar. Each comes from an entirely different discipline. This research investigates whether they do have anything in common. A mathematical formulation that links ROC spaces with the kappa statistic is derived here for the first time. The understanding of how these two accuracy meters relate to each other can assist in a better understanding of their respective pros and cons. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Existing computer models for automatic assessment of carpet wear are at this moment not capable of matching the human expertise. Therefore, we present a completely new approach to tackle this problem. A three-dimensional laser scanner is used to obtain a digital copy of the carpet. Due to the specific characteristics of the laser scanner data, new algorithms are developed to extract relevant information from the raw data. These features are used as input to a classifier system that defines a partial ranking over the objects. To this end, ordinal regression and multi-class classification models are applied. Experiments demonstrate that our approach gives rise to promising results with correlations up to 0.77 between extracted features and quality labels. The performance obtained with nested cross-validation, including a C-index of more than 0.95, an accuracy of 76% and only 3% serious errors of a full point, gives rise to a substantial improvement compared to other approaches mentioned in the literature.

Furthermore, there is increasing evidence for the important contribution of ABC-transporters to bioavailability, distribution, elimination and blood-brain barrier permeation of drug candidates. This review presents an overview on the different computational methods and models pursued to predict ABC-transporter substrate properties of drug-like compounds. They range from linear discriminant analysis to pharmacophore modelling and machine learning algorithms. Many of these models show a satisfying performance within the study-specific, defined chemical space but general applicability for the whole drug-like chemical space still needs to be proven. First attempts aiming towards selectivity profiling for ligands of the two polyspecific transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2 is also discussed. This might pave the way for a pharmacological profiling of compound series with special focus on their ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) properties.

J	Tsai, CF				Tsai, Chih-Fong			Financial decision support using neural networks and support vector machines	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						bankruptcy prediction; credit scoring; financial decision support; support vector machines; neural networks	BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; BUSINESS	Bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring are the two important problems facing financial decision support. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) network has shown its applicability to these problems and its performance is usually superior to those of other traditional statistical models. Support vector machines (SVMs) are the core machine learning techniques and have been used to compare with MLP as the benchmark. However, the performance of SVMs is not fully understood in the literature because an insufficient number of data sets is considered and different kernel functions are used to train the SVMs. In this paper, four public data sets are used. In particular, three different sizes of training and testing data in each of the four data sets are considered (i.e. 3:7, 1:1 and 7:3) in order to examine and fully understand the performance of SVMs. For SVM model construction, the linear, radial basis function and polynomial kernel functions are used to construct the SVMs. Using MLP as the benchmark, the SVM classifier only performs better in one of the four data sets. On the other hand, the prediction results of the MLP and SVM classifiers are not significantly different for the three different sizes of training and testing data.

A feed forward backpropagation artificial neural network (ANN) is designed for classifying a set of road lines through a supervised learning process, attempting to emulate a classification performed by a human expert for cartographic generalization purposes. The main steps of the process are presented in this paper: (a) experimental data selection; (b) segmentation of lines into homogeneous sections, (c) sections enrichment through a set of quantitative measures derived from a principal component analysis, and qualitative information derived from road network and road type; (d) expert classification of the sections; and finally (e) the ANN design, training and validation.

Differentiation of Proteins and Viruses Using Pyrolysis Gas Chromatography Differential Mobility Spectrometry (PY/GC/DMS) and Pattern Recognition	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Biosensor; differential mobility spectrometer (DMS); genetic algorithm; microelectronics; neural networks; pyrolysis	TRANSFORM-INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; HEPATITIS-A VIRUS; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; GENETIC ALGORITHM; PCR; TECHNOLOGY; ROTAVIRUS; COMPLEXES; SPECIMENS; BACTERIA	It is extremely important to develop novel analytical sensors for pathogen detection. Applications of such sensors range from ensuring environmental monitoring, to providing human health diagnostic measures, and to early warning systems for bioterrorism. Certain viruses and bacteria pathogens are of special concern for their ability to spread rapidly in human populations during a pandemic, and emerging variants of these pathogens are challenging to detect. This paper provides a reliable detection strategy to classify viruses from innocuous proteins. Our novel instrumentation is based on pyrolysis gas chromatography differential mobility spectrometry (PY/GC/DMS), and couples a genetic algorithm based machine learning method for pattern recognition with a microfabricated solid state biosensor. Together, this hardware and software combination allowed for an extremely high classification accuracy (94%) between the T4 bacteriophage from bovine serum albumin (BSA), an unrelated protein. This study suggests that this portable sensor can be used along with the sophisticated data mining method as a fast, reliable, and accurate tool for the recognition of viruses.

J	Parikh, D; Chen, TH				Parikh, Devi; Chen, Tsuhan			Data fusion and cost minimization for intrusion detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY			English	Article						cost minimization; data fusion; dCMS; dLEARNIN; pattern recognition for intrusion detection	COMBINING CLASSIFIERS; NEURAL-NETWORKS	Statistical pattern recognition techniques have recently been shown to provide a finer balance between misdetections and false alarms than the more conventional intrusion detection approaches, namely misuse detection and anomaly detection. A variety of classical machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms has been applied to intrusion detection with varying levels of success. We make two observations about intrusion detection. One is that intrusion detection is significantly more effective by using multiple sources of information in an intelligent way, which is precisely what human experts rely on. Second, different errors in intrusion detection have different costs associated with them-a simplified example being that a false alarm may be more expensive than a misdetection and, hence, the true objective function to be minimized is the cost of errors and not the error rate itself. We present a pattern recognition approach that addresses both of these issues. It utilizes an ensemble of a classifiers approach to intelligently combine information from multiple sources and is explicitly tuned toward minimizing the cost of the errors as opposed to the error rate itself. The information fusion approach dLEARNIN alone is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performances better than those reported in the literature so far, and the cost minimization strategy dCMS further reduces the cost with a significant margin.

The solutions currently on the market allow for good detection and location of defects, but their characterization in terms of the exact determination of defect shape and dimensions is still an open question. This paper proposes a method for the reliable estimation of crack shape and dimensions in conductive materials using a suitable nondestructive instrument based on the eddy current principle and machine learning system postprocessing. After the design and tuning stages, a performance comparison between the two machine learning systems [artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM)] was carried out. An experimental validation carried out on a number of specimens with different known cracks confirmed the suitability of the proposed approach for defect characterization.

J	Abbasi, A; Chen, H; Thoms, S; Fu, T				Abbasi, Ahmed; Chen, Hsinchun; Thoms, Sven; Fu, Tianjun			Affect analysis of web forums and blogs using correlation ensembles	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						affective computing; discourse; emotion recognition; linguistic processing; machine learning; text mining	LANGUAGE	Analysis of affective intensities in computer-mediated communication is important in order to allow a better understanding of online users' emotions and preferences. Despite considerable research on textual affect classification, it is unclear which features and techniques are most effective. In this study, we compared several feature representations for affect analysis, including learned n-grams and various automatically and manually crafted affect lexicons. We also proposed the support vector regression correlation ensemble (SVRCE) method for enhanced classification of affect intensities. SVRCE uses an ensemble of classifiers each trained using a feature subset tailored toward classifying a single affect class. The ensemble is combined with affect correlation information to enable better prediction of emotive intensities. Experiments were conducted on four test beds encompassing web forums, blogs, and online stories. The results revealed that learned n-grams were more effective than lexicon-based affect representations. The findings also indicated that SVRCE outperformed comparison techniques, including Pace regression, semantic orientation, and WordNet models. Ablation testing showed that the improved performance of SVRCE was attributable to its use of feature ensembles as well as affect correlation information. A brief case study was conducted to illustrate the utility of the features and techniques for affect analysis of large archives of online discourse.

The criteria for measuring the importance of images on Websites are based on their frequency of occurrence, characteristics of their content, and Web link information. As a case study, this work focuses on logo and trademark images. These are important characteristic signs of corporate Websites or of products presented there. The proposed method incorporates machine learning for distinguishing logo and trademarks from images of other categories (e.g., landscapes and faces). Because the same logo or trademark may appear many times in various forms within the same Website, duplicates are detected and only unique logo and trademark images are extracted. These images are then ranked by importance taking frequency of occurrence, image content, and Web link information into account. The most important logos and trademarks are finally selected to form the image-based summary of a Website. Evaluation results of the method on real Websites are also presented. The method has been implemented and integrated into a fully automated image-based summarization system, which is accessible on the Web at http://www.intelligence.tuc.gr/websummarization.

Inferring boundary information of discontinuous-domain proteins	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NANOBIOSCIENCE			English	Article						discontinuous domain; domain boundary; machine learning; protein domain	SECONDARY STRUCTURE; PREDICTION; SEQUENCE; ASSIGNMENT; PROFILES; REGIONS	Wetlaufer introduced the classification of domains into continuous and discontinuous. Continuous domains form from a single-chain segment and discontinuous domains are composed of two or more chain segments. Richardson identified approximately 100 domains in her review. Her assignment was based on the concepts that the domain would be independently stable and/or could undergo rigid-body-like movements with respect to the entire protein. There are now several instances where structurally similar domains occur in different proteins in the absence of noticeable sequence similarity. Possibly, the most notable of such domains is the trios-phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel. With the increase in the number of known sequences, computer algorithms are required to identify the discontinuous domain of an unknown protein chain in order to determine its structure and function. We have developed a novel algorithm for discontinuous-domain boundary prediction based on a machine learning algorithm and interresidue contact interactions values. We have used 415 proteins, including 100 discontinuous-domain chains for training. There is no method available that is designed solely on a sequence based for the prediction of discontinuous domain. DomainDiscovery performed significantly well compared to the structure-based methods like structural classification of proteins (SCOP), class, architecture, topology and homologous superfamily (CATH), and DOMain MAKer (DOMAK).

We suggest describing the documents not directly by selected multimodal features ( audio, visual, or text) but rather by considering cross-document similarities relative to their multimodal characteristics. This idea leads us to propose a particular form of dissimilarity space that is adapted to the asymmetric classification problem and, in turn, to the query-by-example and relevance feedback paradigm, widely used in information retrieval. Based on the proposed dissimilarity space, we then define various strategies to fuse modalities through a kernel-based learning approach. The problem of automatic kernel setting to adapt the learning process to the queries is also discussed. The properties of our strategies are studied and validated on artificial data. In a second phase, a large annotated video corpus (i.e., TRECVID '05) indexed by visual, audio, and text features is considered to evaluate the overall performance of the dissimilarity space and fusion strategies. The obtained results confirm the validity of the proposed approach for the representation and retrieval of multimodal information in a real-time framework.

Combining automatic acquisition of knowledge with machine learning approaches for multilingual temporal recognition and normalization	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						temporal information; machine learning; temporal expressions; temporal expression recognition; temporal expression normalization; natural language processing; temporal reasoning	MODELS; TRANSLATION; ENTROPY; ENGLISH; SPEECH; SYSTEM; TEXT	This paper presents an improvement in the temporal expression (TE) recognition phase of a knowledge based system at a multilingual level. For this purpose, the combination of different approaches applied to the recognition of temporal expressions are studied. In this work, for the recognition task, a knowledge based system that recognizes temporal expressions and had been automatically extended to other languages (TERSEO system) was combined with a system that recognizes temporal expressions using machine learning techniques. In particular, two different techniques were applied: maximum entropy model (ME) and hidden Markov model (HMM), using two different types of tagging of the training corpus: (1) BIO model tagging of literal temporal expressions and (2) BIO model tagging of simple patterns of temporal expressions. Each system was first evaluated independently and then combined in order to: (a) analyze if the combination gives better results without increasing the number of erroneous expressions in the same percentage and (b) decide which machine learning approach performs this task better. When the TERSEO system is combined with the maximum entropy approach the best results for F-measure (89%) are obtained, improving TERSEO recognition by 4.5 points and ME recognition by 7.

J	Fathian, M; Amiri, B				Fathian, Mohammad; Amiri, Babak			A honeybee-mating approach for cluster analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						clustering; K-means; honeybee mating; SOM; market segmentation	K-MEANS ALGORITHM; EVOLVING FUZZY RULES; MARKET-SEGMENTATION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; EFFICIENCY; MODEL	Cluster analysis, which is the subject of active research in several fields, such as statistics, pattern recognition, machine learning, and data mining, is to partition a given set of data or objects into clusters. K-means is used as a popular clustering method due to its simplicity and high speed in clustering large datasets. However, K-means has two shortcomings. First, dependency on the initial state and convergence to local optima. The second is that global solutions of large problems cannot be found with reasonable amount of computation effort. In order to overcome local optima problem lots of studies done in clustering. Over the last decade, modeling the behavior of social insects, such as ants and bees, for the purpose of search and problem solving has been the context of the emerging area of swarm intelligence. Honeybees are among the most closely studied social insects. Honeybee mating may also be considered as a typical swarm-based approach to optimization, in which the search algorithm is inspired by the process of marriage in real honeybee. Neural networks algorithms are useful for clustering analysis in data mining. This study proposes a two-stage method, which first uses self-organizing feature maps (SOM) neural network to determine the number of clusters and then uses honeybee mating optimization algorithm based on K-means algorithm to find the final solution. We compared proposed algorithm with other heuristic algorithms in clustering, such as GA, SA, TS, and ACO, by implementing them on several well-known datasets. Our finding shows that the proposed algorithm works better than others. In order to further demonstration of the proposed approach's capability, a real-world problem of an Internet bookstore market segmentation based on customer loyalty is employed.

Analyzing the variety of pedagogically valuable facets of learners' interactions is a time consuming and effortful process. Improving automated analyses of such highly valued processes of collaborative learning by adapting and applying recent text classification technologies would make it a less arduous task to obtain insights from corpus data. This endeavor also holds the potential for enabling substantially improved on-line instruction both by providing teachers and facilitators with reports about the groups they are moderating and by triggering context sensitive collaborative learning support on an as-needed basis. In this article, we report on an interdisciplinary research project, which has been investigating the effectiveness of applying text classification technology to a large CSCL corpus that has been analyzed by human coders using a theory-based multidimensional coding scheme. We report promising results and include an in-depth discussion of important issues such as reliability, validity, and efficiency that should be considered when deciding on the appropriateness of adopting a new technology such as TagHelper tools. One major technical contribution of this work is a demonstration that an important piece of the work towards making text classification technology effective for this purpose is designing and building linguistic pattern detectors, otherwise known as features, that can be extracted reliably from texts and that have high predictive power for the categories of discourse actions that the CSCL community is interested in.

However with increasing Grid size and complexity, the manual diagnosis of application faults becomes impractical, tedious and time-consuming. So far there has been a lack of systematic and comprehensive studies in organization and classification of Grid faults. We address this gap with a multi-perspective Grid fault taxonomy precisely describing an incident using eight different characteristics. Based on that, we develop a pragmatic model-based technique for application-specific fault diagnosis using indicators, symptoms and rules. Customized wrapper services then apply this knowledge to reason about the root causes of failures. In addition to applying user-provided diagnosis models we demonstrate that given a set of past classified fault events it is possible to automatically extract new models through learning. We investigated and compared several supervised classification learning and cluster analysis algorithms for this purpose. Our approach was implemented as part of the Otho Toolkit, a framework for "service-enabling" legacy applications by synthesizing tailor-made wrapper service.

On merging classification rules	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING			English	Article						data mining; classification; meta-learning	ALGORITHM	One of the main challenges of today's data mining systems is their ability to manage a huge volume of data generated possibly by different sources. On the other hand, inductive learning algorithms have been extensively researched in machine learning using small amounts of judiciously chosen laboratory examples. There is an increasing concern in classifiers handling data that are substantially larger than available main memory on a single processor. One approach to the problem is to combine the results of different classifiers supplied with different subsets of the data, in parallel. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for combining partial classification rules. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be used to match classification rules in a distributed environment, where different subsets of data may have different domains. The latter is achieved by using given concept hierarchies for the identification of matching classification rules. We also present empirical tests that demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has a significant speedup with respect to the analog non-distributed classification algorithm, at a cost of a lower classification accuracy.

Conventional support vector regression implicitly assumes that the parameters in the optimization problems are known exactly. However, in practice, the parameters have perturbations since they are estimated from the training data that are usually subject to noise. In this article, we propose a second-order cone programming formulation for designing regression functions which are robust to input uncertainty. In addition, we give the intuitive geometric interpretation of the proposed formulation and extend it to the nonlinear case. The preliminary numerical experiments confirm the robustness of the proposed formulation.

In this paper, a promising method for detecting the domain structure of a protein from sequence information alone is presented. The method is based on analyzing multiple sequence alignments derived from a database search. Multiple measures are defined to quantify the domain information content of each position along the sequence. Then they are combined into a single predictor using support vector machine. What is more important, the domain detection is first taken as an imbalanced data learning problem. A novel undersampling method is proposed on distance-based maximal entropy in the feature space of Support Vector Machine (SVM). The overall precision is about 80%. Simulation results demonstrate that the method can help not only in predicting the complete 3D structure of a protein but also in the machine learning system on general imbalanced datasets.

Classification and Diagnostic Output Prediction of Cancer Using Gene Expression Profiling and Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING OF JAPAN			English	Article						Bioinformatics; Data Mining; Gene Expression Profiling; Cancer Classification; Supervised Clustering	ADAPTIVE RESONANCE THEORY; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; MICROARRAY DATA; TUMOR CLASSIFICATION; COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS; BREAST-CANCER; SELECTION; LEUKEMIA; PATTERNS	In this paper, a new supervised clustering and classification method is proposed. First, the application of discriminant partial least squares (DPLS) for the selection of a minimum number of key genes is applied on a gene expression microarray data set. Second, supervised hierarchical clustering based on the information of the cancer type is subsequently proposed to find key gene groups and to group the cancer samples into different subclasses. Here, the weights of the genes in the DPLS are proportional to their importance in the determination of the class labels, that is, the variable importance in the projection (VIP) information of the DPLS method. The power of the gene selection method and the proposed supervised hierarchical clustering method is illustrated on a three microarray data sets of leukemia, breast, and colon cancer. Supervised machine learning algorithms thus enable the subtype classification 3 data sets solely on the basis of molecular-level monitoring. Compared to unsupervised clustering, the supervised method performed better for discriminating between cancer types and cancer subtypes for the leukemia data set. The performance of the proposed method, using only a limited set of informative genes, is demonstrated to be comparable or better than results reported in the literature for the three data sets. Furthermore the method was successful in predicting the outcome of medical treatment (success or failure) based on the microarray data, which could make the method an important tool for clinical doctors.

The "distance to model" can be defined as a metric that defines the similarity between the training set molecules and the test set compound for the given property in the context of a specific model. It could be expressed in many different ways, e.g., using Tanimoto coefficient, leverage, correlation in space of models, etc. In this paper we have used mixtures of Gaussian distributions as well as statistical tests to evaluate six types of distances to models with respect to their ability to discriminate compounds with small and large prediction errors. The analysis was performed for twelve QSAR models of aqueous toxicity against T. pyriformis obtained with different machine-learning methods and various types of descriptors. The distances to model based oil standard deviation of predicted toxicity calculated from the ensemble of models afforded the best results. This distance also successfully discriminated molecules with low and large prediction errors for a mechanism-based model developed using log P and the Maximum Acceptor Superdelocalizability descriptors. Thus, the distance to model metric could also be used to augment mechanistic QSAR models by estimating their prediction errors. Moreover, the accuracy of prediction is mainly determined by the training set data distribution in the chemistry and activity spaces but not by QSAR approaches used to develop the models. We have shown that incorrect validation of a model may result in the wrong estimation of its performance and suggested how this problem could be circumvented. The toxicity of 3182 and 48774 molecules from the EPA High Production Volume (HPV) Challenge Program and EINECS (European chemical Substances Information System), respectively, was predicted, and the accuracy of prediction was estimated. The developed models are available online at http://www.qspr.org site.

J	Mohr, JA; Jain, BJ; Obermayer, K				Mohr, Johannes A.; Jain, Brijnesh J.; Obermayer, Klaus			Molecule kernels: A descriptor- and alignment-free quantitative structure-activity relationship approach	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							GRID-INDEPENDENT DESCRIPTORS; COMFA	Quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analysis is traditionally based on extracting a set of molecular descriptors and using them to build a predictive model. In this work, we propose a QSAR approach based directly on the similarity between the 3D structures of a set of molecules measured by a so-called molecule kernel, which is independent of the spatial prealignment of the compounds. Predictors can be build using the molecule kernel in conjunction with the potential support vector machine (P-SVM), a recently proposed machine learning method for dyadic data. The resulting models make direct use of the structural similarities between the compounds in the test set and a subset of the training set and do not require an explicit descriptor construction. We evaluated the predictive performance of the proposed method on one classification and four regression QSAR datasets and compared its results to the results reported in the literature for several state-of-the-art descriptor-based and 3D QSAR approaches. In this comparison, the proposed molecule kernel method performed better than the other QSAR methods.

Because most humans harbor S. mutans, but not all manifest disease, it has been proposed that the strains of S. mutans associated with S-ECC are genetically distinct from those found in caries-free (CF) children. The objective of this study was to identify common DNA fragments from S. mutans present in S-ECC but not in CF children. Using suppressive subtractive hybridization, we found a number of DNA fragments (biomarkers) present in 88 to 95% of the S-ECC S. mutans strains but not in CF S. mutans strains. We then applied machine learning techniques including support vector machines and neural networks to identify the biomarkers with the most predictive power for disease status, achieving a 92% accurate classification of the strains as either S-ECC or CF associated. The presence of these gene fragments in 90 to 100% of the 26 S-ECC isolates tested suggested their possible functional role in the pathogenesis of S. mutans associated with dental caries.

Incorporation of features such as secondary structure, solvent accessibility, or evolutionary information improve sequence to structure alignment accuracy, but conventional generative estimation techniques for alignment models impose independence assumptions that make these features difficult to include in a principled way. In this paper, we overcome this problem using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) method that provides a well-founded way of estimating complex alignment models with hundred of thousands of parameters. Furthermore, we show that the method can be trained using a variety of loss functions. In a rigorous empirical evaluation, the SVM algorithm outperforms the generative alignment method SSALN, a highly accurate generative alignment model that incorporates structural information. The alignment model learned by the SVM aligns 50% of the residues correctly and aligns over 70% of the residues within a shift of four positions.

Despite much progress in side-chain prediction, performance is far from satisfactory. As an example, the ROSETTA program that uses simulated annealing to select the minimum energy conformations, correctly predicts the first two side-chain angles for approximately 72% of the buried residues in a standard data set. Is further improvement more likely to come from better search methods, or from better energy functions? Given that exact minimization of the energy is NP hard, it is difficult to get a systematic answer to this question. In this paper, we present a novel search method and a novel method for learning energy functions from training data that are both based on Tree Reweighted Belief Propagation (TRBP). We find that TRBP can obtain the global optimum of the ROSETTA energy function in a few minutes of computation for approximately 85% of the proteins in a standard benchmark set. TRBP can also effectively bound the partition function which enables using the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) framework for learning. Interestingly, finding the global minimum does not significantly improve side-chain prediction for an energy function based on ROSETTA's default energy terms (less than 0.1%), while learning new weights gives a significant boost from 72% to 78%. Using a recently modified ROSETTA energy function with a softer Lennard-Jones repulsive term, the global optimum does improve prediction accuracy from 77% to 78%. Here again, learning new weights improves side-chain modeling even further to 80%. Finally, the highest accuracy (82.6%) is obtained using an extended rotamer library and CRF learned weights. Our results suggest that combining machine learning with approximate inference can improve the state-of-the-art in side-chain prediction.

Specificity of MHC binding to peptide fragments from cellular and pathogens' proteins has been found to correlate with disease outcome and pathogen or cancer evolution. In this paper we propose a novel approach to predicting binding configurations and energies for MHC class II molecules, whose epitopes are generally predicted less well than the MHC I epitopes due in part to larger variation in bound peptide length. We treat the relative position of the peptide as a hidden variable, and model the ensemble of different binding configurations, rather than use a separate alignment procedure to narrow it down to one. Thus, our predictor infers a distribution over peptide positions from the MHC II and peptide sequences, and computes the total binding affinity. The training procedure iterates the predictions with re-estimation of the parameters of the binding groove model. For a given relative peptide position, any MHC class I prediction model can be used. Here we choose the physics based model of Jojic et al. (2006). We show that the parameters of the binding model can be learned efficiently from the training data and then used to estimate binding energies for previously untested peptides. Our technique performs on par with previous approaches to MHC II epitope prediction. Furthermore, our model choice allows generalization to new MHC class II alleles, which were not a part of the training set.

Sapiyan			Automatic multilevel medical image annotation and retrieval	JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING			English	Article						image classification; image annotation; image processing; machine learning	FACE DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION	Image retrieval at the semantic level mostly depends on image annotation or image classification. Image annotation performance largely depends on three issues: (1) automatic image feature extraction; (2) a semantic image concept modeling; (3) algorithm for semantic image annotation. To address first issue, multilevel features are extracted to construct the feature vector, which represents the contents of the image. To address second issue, domain-dependent concept hierarchy is constructed for interpretation of image semantic concepts. To address third issue, automatic multilevel code generation is proposed for image classification and multilevel image annotation. We make use of the existing image annotation to address second and third issues. Our experiments on a specific domain of X-ray images have given encouraging results.

The proposed method is based on RF, a novel ensemble classifier which builds a number of decision trees to improve the single tree classifier. Although there are several existing techniques for faults diagnosis, the application research on RF is meaningful and necessary because of its fast execution speed, the characteristics of tree classifier, and high performance in machine faults diagnosis. The proposed method is demonstrated by a case study on induction motor fault diagnosis. Experimental results indicate the validity and reliability of RF-based diagnosis method.

To overcome the obstacles of data noises in MS analysis, we proposed a new approach of knowledge-integrated biomarker discovery using data from Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) patients. We first built up a cardiovascular-related network based on protein information coming from protein annotations in Uniprot, protein-protein interaction (PPI), and signal transduction database. Distinct from the previous machine learning methods in MS data processing, we then used statistical methods to discover biomarkers in cardiovascular-related network. Through the tradeoff between known protein information and data noises in mass spectrometry data, we finally could firmly identify those high-confident biomarkers. Most importantly, aided by protein-protein interaction network, that is, cardiovascular-related network, we proposed a new type of biomarkers, that is, network biomarkers, composed of a set of proteins and the interactions among them. The candidate network biomarkers can classify the two groups of patients more accurately than current single ones without consideration of biological molecular interaction.

J	Meng, HY; Freeman, M; Pears, N; Bailey, C				Meng, Hongying; Freeman, Michael; Pears, Nick; Bailey, Chris			Real-time human action recognition on an embedded, reconfigurable video processing architecture	JOURNAL OF REAL-TIME IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						Human motion recognition; Reconfigurable architectures; Embedded computer vision; FPGA; Machine learning		In recent years, automatic human action recognition has been widely researched within the computer vision and image processing communities. Here we propose a real-time, embedded vision solution for human action recognition, implemented on an FPGA-based ubiquitous device. There are three main contributions in this paper. Firstly, we have developed a fast human action recognition system with simple motion features and a linear support vector machine classifier. The method has been tested on a large, public human action dataset and achieved competitive performance for the temporal template class of approaches, which include "Motion History Image" based techniques. Secondly, we have developed a reconfigurable, FPGA based video processing architecture. One advantage of this architecture is that the system processing performance can be reconfigured for a particular application, with the addition of new or replicated processing cores. Finally, we have successfully implemented a human action recognition system on this reconfigurable architecture. With a small number of human actions (hand gestures), this stand-alone system is operating reliably at 12 frames/s, with an 80% average recognition rate using limited training data. This type of system has applications in security systems, man-machine communications and intelligent environments.

In this study, we used machine learning algorithms to construct models that predict life span in a stock of genetically heterogeneous mice. Life-span prediction accuracy of 22 algorithms was evaluated using a cross-validation approach, in which models were trained and tested with distinct subsets of data. Using a combination of body weight and T-cell subset measures evaluated before 2 years of age, we show that the life-span quartile to which an individual mouse belongs can be predicted with an accuracy of 35.3% (+/- 0.10%). This result provides a new benchmark for the development of life-span-predictive models, but improvement can be expected through identification of new predictor variables and development of computational approaches. Future work in this direction can provide tools for aging research and will shed light on associations between phenotypic traits and longevity.

J	Peng, T; Zuo, WL; He, FL				Peng, Tao; Zuo, Wanli; He, Fengling			SVM based adaptive learning method for text classification from positive and unlabeled documents	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						text classification; machine learning; improved 1-DNF algorithm; SVM; PSO; focused web crawling		Automatic text classification is one of the most important tools in Information Retrieval. This paper presents a novel text classifier using positive and unlabeled examples. The primary challenge of this problem as compared with the classical text classification problem is that no labeled negative documents are available in the training example set. Firstly, we identify many more reliable negative documents by an improved 1-DNF algorithm with a very low error rate. Secondly, we build a set of classifiers by iteratively applying the SVM algorithm on a training data set, which is augmented during iteration. Thirdly, different from previous PU-oriented text classification works, we adopt the weighted vote of all classifiers generated in the iteration steps to construct the final classifier instead of choosing one of the classifiers as the final classifier. Finally, we discuss an approach to evaluate the weighted vote of all classifiers generated in the iteration steps to construct the final classifier based on PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization), which can discover the best combination of the weights. In addition, we built a focused crawler based on link-contexts guided by different classifiers to evaluate our method. Several comprehensive experiments have been conducted using the Reuters data set and thousands of web pages. Experimental results show that our method increases the performance (F(1)-measure) compared with PEBL, and a focused web crawler guided by our PSO-based classifier outperforms other several classifiers both in harvest rate and target recall.

Mol Mech Malignant Lymphomas	Pathway activation patterns in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas	LEUKEMIA			English	Article						lymphoma; oncogenic pathways; transcriptional modules; cancer	GENE-EXPRESSION; MOLECULAR DIAGNOSIS; BURKITTS-LYMPHOMA; HODGKIN LYMPHOMA; FOXP1; SURVIVAL; HYBRIDIZATION; SIGNATURES; SUBGROUPS; PROFILES	Deregulation of cell signaling pathways controlling cell growth and cell survival is a common feature of all cancers. Although a core repertoire of oncogenic mechanisms is widely conserved between various malignancies, the constellation of pathway activities can vary even in patients with the same malignant disease. Modern molecularly targeted cancer drugs intervene in cell signaling compensating for pathway deregulation. Hence characterizing tumors with respect to pathway activation will become crucial for treatment decisions. Here we have used semi-supervised machine learning methodology to generate signatures of eight oncogene-inducible pathways, which are conserved across epithelial and lymphoid tissues. We combined them to patterns of pathway activity called PAPs for pathway activation patterns and searched for them in 220 morphologically, immunohistochemically and genetically well-characterized mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas including 134 cases with clinical data available. Besides Burkitt lymphoma, which was characterized by a unique pattern, the PAPs identified four distinct groups of mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas across independent gene expression studies with distinct biological characteristics, genetic aberrations and prognosis. We confirmed our findings through cross-platform analysis in an independent data set of 303 mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas.

J	Pasanek, B; Sculley, D				Pasanek, Brad; Sculley, D.			Mining millions of metaphors	LITERARY AND LINGUISTIC COMPUTING			English	Article								One of the first decisions made in any research concerns the selection of an appropriate scale of analysis-are we looking out into the heavens, or down into atoms? To conceive a digital library as a collection of a million books may restrict analysis to only one level of granularity. In this article, we examine the consequences and opportunities resulting from a shift in scale, where the desired unit of interpretation is something smaller than a text: it is a keyword, a motif, or a metaphor. A million books distilled into a billion meaningful components become raw material for a history of language, literature, and thought that has never before been possible. While books herded into genres and organized by period remain irregular, idiosyncratic, and meaningful in only the most shifting and context-dependent ways, keywords or metaphors are lowest common denominators. At the semantic level-the level of words, images, and metaphors-long-term regularity and patterns emerge in collection, analysis, and taxonomy. This article follows the foregoing course of thought through three stages: first, the manual curation of a high quality database of metaphors; second, the expansion of this database through automated and human-assisted techniques; finally, the description of future experiments and opportunities for the application of machine learning, data mining, and natural language processing techniques to help find patterns and meaning concealed at this important level of granularity.

By taking into account the full spatial pattern of brain activity measured simultaneously at many locations, these methods allow detecting subtle, non-strictly localized effects that may remain invisible to the conventional analysis with univariate statistical methods. Ill typical fMRI applications, pattern recognition algorithms "learn" a functional relationship between brain response patterns and a perceptual, cognitive or behavioral state of a subject expressed in terms of a label, which may assume discrete (classification) or continuous (regression) values. This learned functional relationship is then used to predict the unseen labels from a new data set ("brain reading"). In this article, we describe the mathematical foundations of machine learning applications in fMRI We focus on two methods, support vector machines and relevance vector machines, which are respectively suited for the classification and regression of fMRI patterns. Furthermore, by means of several examples and applications, we illustrate and discuss the methodological challenges Of Using machine learning algorithms in the context of fMRI data analysis.

On the k-NN performance in a challenging scenario of imbalance and overlapping	PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						imbalanced data; nearest neighbour rule; class overlap; local and global learning; overall imbalance ratio; local imbalance ratio	LEARNING ALGORITHMS; CLASSIFIERS	A two-class data set is said to be imbalanced when one (minority) class is heavily under-represented with respect to the other (majority) class. In the presence of a significant overlapping, the task of learning from imbalanced data can be a very difficult problem. Additionally, if the overall imbalance ratio is different from local imbalance ratios in overlap regions, the task can become in a major challenge. This paper explains the behaviour of the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) rule when learning from such a complex scenario. This local model is compared to other machine learning algorithms, attending to how their behaviour depends on a number of data complexity features (global imbalance, size of overlap region, and its local imbalance). As a result, several conclusions useful for classifier design are inferred.	[Garcia, V.] Inst Tecnol Toluca, Lab Reconocimiento Patrones, Metepec 52140, Mexico; [Mollineda, R. A.; Sanchez, J.

These tasks are performed by optimizing a global loss function that includes a term associated with the empirical loss and another one representing a feature selection and regularization constraint on the parameters. To minimize this function we use a recently proposed technique, the Boosted Lasso algorithm, that follows the regularization path of the empirical risk associated with our loss function. We develop the algorithm for a well known non-parametrical classification method, the relevance vector machine, and perform experiments using a synthetic data set and three databases from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The results show that our method is able to select the relevant features, increasing in some cases the classification accuracy when feature selection is performed.

In recent years approaches have been proposed to deal with VO extraction as a classification problem. This type of methods calls for state-of-the-art classifiers because the performance is directly related to the accuracy of classification. Promising results have been reported for single object extraction using support vector machines (SVM) and its extensions. Multiple object extraction, on the other hand, still imposes great difficulty as multi-category classification is an ongoing research topic in machine learning. This paper introduces a new scheme of multi-category learning for multiple VO extraction, and demonstrates its effectiveness and advantages by experiments. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wu, YC; Lee, YS; Yang, JC				Wu, Yu-Chieh; Lee, Yue-Shi; Yang, Jie-Chi			Robust and efficient multiclass SVM models for phrase pattern recognition	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						machine learning; multiclass classification; natural language processing; support vector machines	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CLASSIFICATION	Phrase pattern recognition (phrase chunking) refers to automatic approaches for identifying predefined phrase structures in a stream of text. Support vector machines (SVMs)-based methods had shown excellent performance in many sequential text pattern recognition tasks such as protein name finding, and noun phrase (NP)-chunking. Even though they yield very accurate results, they are not efficient for online applications, which need to handle hundreds of thousand words in a limited time. In this paper, we firstly re-examine five typical multiclass SVM methods and the adaptation to phrase chunking. However, most of them were inefficient when the number of phrase types scales. We thus introduce the proposed two new multiclass SVM models that make the system substantially faster in terms of training and testing while keeps the SVM accurate. The two methods can also be applied to similar tasks such as named entity recognition and Chinese word segmentation. Experiments on CoNLL-2000 chunking and Chinese base-chunking tasks showed that our method can achieve very competitive accuracy and at least 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art SVM-based phrase chunking method. Besides, the computational time complexity and the time cost analysis of our methods were also given in this paper. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, CM				Zhang, Chunming			Prediction error estimation under Bregman divergence for non-parametric regression and classification	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS			English	Article						cross-validation; exponential family; generalized varying-coefficient model; local likelihood; loss function; prediction error	QUASI-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION; GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS; CROSS-VALIDATION; KERNEL; PARAMETERS; SELECTION	Prediction error is critical to assess model fit and evaluate model prediction. We propose the cross-validation (CV) and approximated CV methods for estimating prediction error under the Bregman divergence (BD), which embeds nearly all of the commonly used loss functions in the regression, classification procedures and machine learning literature. The approximated CV formulas are analytically derived, which facilitate fast estimation of prediction error under BD. We then study a data-driven optimal bandwidth selector for local-likelihood estimation that minimizes the overall prediction error or equivalently the covariance penalty. It is shown that the covariance penalty and CV methods converge to the same mean-prediction-error-criterion. We also propose a lower-bound scheme for computing the local logistic regression estimates and demonstrate that the algorithm monotonically enhances the target local likelihood and converges. The idea and methods are extended to the generalized varying-coefficient models and additive models.

SOSwarm can be used for unsupervised learning. In the algorithm, input vectors are projected into a lower-dimensional map space producing a visual representation of the input data in a manner similar to a self-organising map (SOM). In SOSwarm, particles react to input data during the learning process by modifying their velocities using an adaptation of the PSO velocity update function. SOSwarm is successfully applied to ten benchmark problems drawn from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The paper also demonstrates how the canonical SOM can be explored within the PSO paradigm. Illustrating this linkage between the heretofore distinct literatures of SOM and PSO opens up several new avenues of research for the development of novel self-organising algorithms.

Using Support Vector Machines to develop pedotransfer functions for water retention of soils in Poland	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; LOCAL MINIMA; PREDICTIONS; PARAMETERS; ACCURACY; SCALE	Pedotransfer functions (PTFs), which estimate soil hydraulic parameters from easy, to measure soil properties, are an important data Source for hydrologic modeling. Recently artificial neural networks (ANNs) have become the tool of choice in PTF development. Recent developments in machine learning methods include the growing research and application of the alternative data-driven method called Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Support Vector Machines have gained Popularity in many traditionally ANN dominated fields. Using the SVM eliminates the local minimum issue-the minimum found is always the global one. The objective of this work was to see whethers using the SVM to develop PTFs may have some advantages compared with the ANN. We have used the Sod Profiles Bank of Polish Mineral Soils that includes hydraulic properties for 806 soil samples taken from 290 soil profiles. This database was repeatedly randomly split into training and testing data sets, and both SVMs and ANNs were trained and tested for each split with bulk density, sand and clay as input variables, and water contents at 11 soil water potentials as the output variables. The PTF performance was evaluated by using die rest datasets to compute the coefficient of determination, the root-mean-squared error, and the slope and the intercept of the linear regression "predicted vs. measured water contents." The three-parameter SVMs performed mostly better than or with the same accuracy as the eleven-parameter ANNs. The advantage of SVM was more pronounced at soil matric potentials where larger relative errors have been encountered and the correlation between predicted and measured soil water contents was lower. It is worthwhile to consider SVM as a tool to develop PTF.	[Pachepsky, Y.] USDA ARS, Environm Microbial Safety Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; [Lamorski, K.; Slawihski, C.; Walczak, R.

In this study, we outline a multifactor approach to evaluating models that we developed in order to select an appropriate student model for our medical ITS. The combination of areas under the receiver-operator and precision-recall curves, with residual analysis, proved to be a useful and valid method for model selection. We improved on Bayesian Knowledge Tracing with models that treat help differently from mistakes, model all attempts, differentiate skill classes, and model forgetting. We discuss both the methodology we used and the insights we derived regarding student modeling in this novel domain.

Abrogation of T cell quiescence characterizes patients at high risk for multiple sclerosis after the initial neurological event	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						clinically isolated syndrome; gene expression	CLINICALLY ISOLATED SYNDROMES; AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVITY; ANTIMYELIN ANTIBODIES; GENE-EXPRESSION; OSTEOPONTIN; PROGRESSION; CRITERIA; CONVERSION; DEFINITE	Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) refers to the earliest clinical manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS). Currently there are no prognostic biological markers that accurately predict conversion of CIS to clinically definite MS (CDMS). Furthermore, the earliest molecular events in MS are still unknown. We used microarrays to study gene expression in naive CD4(+) T cells from 37 CIS patients at time of diagnosis and after 1 year. Supervised machine-learning methods were used to build predictive models of disease conversion. We identified 975 genes whose expression segregated CIS patients into four distinct subgroups. A subset of 108 genes further discriminated patients in one of these (group 1) from other CIS patients. Remarkably, 92% of patients in group 1 converted to CDMS within 9 months. Consistent down-regulation of TOB1, a critical regulator of cell proliferation, was characteristic of group 1 patients. Decreased TOB1 expression at the RNA and protein levels also was confirmed in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Finally, a genetic association was observed between TOB1 variation and MS progression in an independent cohort. These results indicate that CIS patients at high risk of conversion have impaired regulation of T cell quiescence, possibly resulting in earlier activation of pathogenic CD4(+) cells.

The key to this soft-computing technique is how to set up and make use of the fuzzy attribute reduct in fuzzy rough set theory. Given a fuzzy information system, we may find many fuzzy attribute reducts and each of them can have different contributions to decision-making. If only one of the fuzzy attribute reducts, which may be the most important one, is selected to induce decision rules, some useful information hidden in the other reducts for the decision-making will be losing unavoidably. To sufficiently make use of the information provided by every individual fuzzy attribute reduct in a fuzzy information system, this paper presents a novel induction of multiple fuzzy decision trees based on rough set technique. The induction consists of three stages. First several fuzzy attribute reducts are found by a similarity based approach, and then a fuzzy decision tree for each fuzzy attribute reduct is generated according to the fuzzy ID3 algorithm. The fuzzy integral is finally considered as a fusion tool to integrate the generated decision trees, which combines together all outputs of the multiple fuzzy decision trees and forms the final decision result. An illustration is given to show the proposed fusion scheme. A numerical experiment on real data indicates that the proposed multiple tree induction is superior to the single tree induction based on the individual reduct or on the entire feature set for learning problems with many attributes.

When learning from imbalanced data in which most examples are labeled as one class and only few belong to another class, traditional data mining approaches do not have a good ability to predict the crucial minority instances. Unfortunately, many real world data sets like health examination, inspection, credit fraud detection, spam identification and text mining all are faced with this situation. In this study, we present a novel model called the "Information Granulation Based Data Mining Approach" to tackle this problem. The proposed methodology, which imitates the human ability to process information, acquires knowledge from Information Granules rather then from numerical data. This method also introduces a Latent Semantic Indexing based feature extraction tool by using Singular Value Decomposition, to dramatically reduce the data dimensions. In addition, several data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Experimental results show that our method can significantly increase the ability of classifying imbalanced data. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The template structure is used in later phases of the calculation to construct an atomically detailed model for the target. We have built from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) a large-scale learning set that includes tens of millions of pair matches that can be either a true template or a false one. Discriminatory learning (learning from positive and negative examples) is used to train a decision tree. Each branch of the tree is a mathematical programming model. The decision tree is tested on an independent set from PDB entries and on the sequences of CASP7. It provides significant enrichment of true templates (between 50 and 100%) when compared to PSI-BLAST The model is further verified by building atomically detailed structures for each of the tentative true templates with modeller. The probability that a true match does not yield an acceptable structural model (within 6 angstrom RMSD from the native structure) decays linearly as a function of the TM structuralalignment score.

J	Rangwala, H; Karypis, G				Rangwala, Huzefa; Karypis, George			fRMSDPred: Predicting local RMSD between structural fragments using sequence information	PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						structure prediction; comparative modeling; machine learning; classification; regression	PROTEIN SECONDARY STRUCTURE; SUBSTITUTION MATRICES; ALIGNMENT ALGORITHMS; PROFILE ALIGNMENT; SCORING FUNCTIONS; FOLD RECOGNITION; CLASSIFICATION; SEARCH; SCOP	The effectiveness of comparative modeling approaches for protein structure prediction can be substantially improved by incorporating predicted structural information in the initial sequence-structure alignment. Motivated by the approaches used to align protein structures, this article focuses on developing machine learning approaches for estimating the RMSD value of a pair of protein fragments. These estimated fragment-level RMSD values can be used to construct the alignment, assess the quality of an alignment, and identify high-quality alignment segments. We present algorithms to solve this fragment-level RMSD prediction problem using a supervised learning framework based on support vector regression and classification that incorporates protein profiles, predicted secondary structure, effective information encoding schemes, and novel second-order pairwise exponential kernel functions. Our comprehensive empirical study shows superior results compared with the profile-to-profile scoring schemes. We also show that for protein pairs with low sequence similarity (less than 12% sequence identity) these new local structural features alone or in conjunction with profile-based information lead to alignments that are considerably accurate than those obtained by schemes that use only profile and/or predicted secondary structure information.

This challenges a stable operation of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems. The classical approach is to train users by neurofeedback to produce fixed stereotypical patterns of brain activity. In the machine learning approach, a widely adapted method for dealing with those variances is to record a so called calibration measurement on the beginning of each session in order to optimize spatial filters and classifiers specifically for each subject and each day. This adaptation of the system to the individual brain signature of each user relieves from the need of extensive user training. In this paper we suggest a new method that overcomes the requirement of these time-consuming calibration recordings for long-term BCI users. The method takes advantage of knowledge collected in previous sessions: By a novel technique, prototypical spatial filters are determined which have better generalization properties compared to single-session filters. In particular, they can be used in follow-up sessions without the need to recalibrate the system. This way the calibration periods can be dramatically shortened or even completely omitted for these 'experienced' BCI users. The feasibility of our novel approach is demonstrated with a series of online BCI experiments. Although performed without any calibration measurement at all, no loss of classification performance was observed.

Probabilistic photometric redshifts for galaxies and quasars in the SDSS and GALEX	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						catalogs; cosmology : miscellaneous; methods : data analysis; quasars : general	DIGITAL-SKY-SURVEY; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SPECTROSCOPIC TARGET SELECTION; LUMINOUS RED GALAXIES; BROAD-BAND PHOTOMETRY; EARLY DATA RELEASE; DEEP FIELD; CLASSIFICATION; CATALOG; SAMPLE	We apply machine learning in the form of a nearest neighbor instance-based algorithm (NN) to generate full photometric redshift probability density functions (PDFs) for objects in the Fifth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR5). We use a conceptually simple but novel application of NN to generate the PDFs, perturbing the object colors by their measurement error and using the resulting instances of nearest neighbor distributions to generate numerous individual redshifts. When the redshifts are compared to existing SDSS spectroscopic data, we find that the mean value of each PDF has a dispersion between the photometric and spectroscopic redshift consistent with other machine learning techniques, being sigma = 0: 0207 +/- 0.0001 for main sample galaxies to r less than or similar to 17: 77 mag, sigma = 0.0243 +/- 0: 0002 for luminous red galaxies to rP19: 2 mag, and sigma = 0.343 +/- 0.005 for quasars to i < 20: 3 mag. The PDFs allow the selection of subsets with improved statistics. For quasars, the improvement is dramatic: for those with a single peak in their probability distribution, the dispersion is reduced from 0.343 to sigma = 0.117 +/- 0.010, and the photometric redshift is within 0.3 of the spectroscopic redshift for 99: 3% +/- 0: 1% of the objects. Thus, for this optical quasar sample, we can virtually eliminate "catastrophic" photometric redshift estimates. In addition to the SDSS sample, we incorporate ultraviolet photometry from the Third Data Release of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer All- Sky Imaging Survey ( GALEX AIS GR3) to create PDFs for objects seen in both surveys. For quasars, the increased coverage of the observed- frame UV of the SED results in significant improvement over the full SDSS sample, with sigma = 0.234 +/- 0.010. We demonstrate that this improvement is genuine and not an artifact of the SDSS- GALEX matching process.

Yet it might be difficult to define a succinct set of rules that capture the aesthetic preferences of the raters. In this work, we explore a data-driven approach to aesthetic enhancement of such shapes. Specifically, we focus on the challenging problem of enhancing the aesthetic appeal (or the attractiveness) of human faces in frontal photographs (portraits), while maintaining close similarity with the original. The key component in our approach is an automatic facial attractiveness engine trained on datasets of faces with accompanying facial attractiveness ratings collected from groups of human raters. Given a new face, we extract a set of distances between a variety of facial feature locations, which define a point in a,high-dimensional "face space". We then search the face space for a nearby point with a higher predicted attractiveness rating. Once such a point is found, the corresponding facial distances are embedded in the plane and serve as a target to define a 2D warp field which maps the original facial features to their adjusted locations. The effectiveness of our technique was experimentally validated by independent rating experiments. which indicate that it is indeed capable of increasing the facial attractiveness of most portraits that we have experimented with.

Statist. 34 (2006) 1436-1462] showed that, for neighborhood selection in Gaussian graphical models, under a neighborhood stability condition, the LASSO is consistent, even when the number of variables is of greater order than the sample size. Zhao and Yu [(2006) J. Machine Learning Research 7 2541-2567] formalized the neighborhood stability condition in the context of linear regression as a strong irrepresentable condition. That paper showed that under this condition, the LASSO selects exactly the set of nonzero regression coefficients, provided that these coefficients are bounded away from zero at a certain rate. In this paper, the regression coefficients outside an ideal model are assumed to be small, but not necessarily zero. Under a sparse Riesz condition on the correlation of design variables, we prove that the LASSO selects a model of the correct order of dimensionality, controls the bias of the selected model at a level determined by the contributions of small regression coefficients and threshold bias, and selects all coefficients of greater order than the bias of the selected model. Moreover, as a consequence of this rate consistency of the LASSO in model selection, it is proved that the sum of error squares for the mean response and the l(alpha)-loss for the regression coefficients converge at the best possible rates under the given conditions. An interesting aspect of our results is that the logarithm of the number of variables can be of the same order as the sample size for certain random dependent designs.

This paper reports on the application of artificial neural networks for genus-wide FAME-based identification of Bacillus species. Using 1,071 FAME profiles covering a genus-wide spectrum of 477 strains and 82 species, different balanced and imbalanced data sets have been created according to different validation methods and model parameters. Following training and validation, each classifier was evaluated on its ability to identify the profiles of a test set. Comparison of the classifiers showed a good identification rate favoring the imbalanced data sets. The presence of the Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis groups made clear that it is of great importance to take into account the limitations of FAME analysis resolution for the construction of identification models. Indeed, as members of such a group cannot easily be distinguished from one another based upon FAME data alone, identification models built upon this data can neither be successful at keeping them apart. Comparison of the different experimental setups ultimately led to a few general recommendations. With respect to the routinely used commercial Sherlock Microbial Identification System (MIS, Microbial ID, Inc. (MIDI), Newark, Delaware, USA), the artificial neural network test results showed a significant improvement in Bacillus species identification. These results indicate that machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks are most promising tools for FAME-based classification and identification of bacterial species.

J	Lee, ZJ				Lee, Zne-Jung			A robust learning algorithm based on support vector regression and robust fuzzy cerebellar model articulation controller	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						robust learning; SVR; CMAC; fuzzy CMAC; particle swarm optimization	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; CMAC; CONVERGENCE; PARAMETERS; NOISE	For real-world applications, the obtained data are always subject to noise or outliers. The learning mechanism of cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC), a neurological model, is to imitate the cerebellum of human being. CMAC has an attractive property of learning speed in which a small subset addressed by the input space determines output instantaneously. For fuzzy cerebellar model articulation controller (FCMAC), the concept of fuzzy is incorporated into CMAC to improve the accuracy problem. However, the distributions of errors into the addressed hypercubes may cause unacceptable learning performance for input data with noise or outliers. For robust fuzzy cerebellar model articulation controller (RFCMAC), the robust learning of M-estimator can be embedded into FCMAC to degrade noise or outliers. Meanwhile, support vector machine (SVR) is a machine learning theory based algorithm which has been applied successfully to a number of regression problems when noise or outliers exist. Unfortunately, the practical application of SVR is limited to defining a set of parameters for obtaining admirable performance by the user. In this paper, a robust learning algorithm based on support SVR and RFCMAC is proposed. The proposed algorithm has both the advantage of SVR, the ability to avoid corruption effects, and the advantage of RFCMAC, the ability to obtain attractive properties of learning performance and to increase accurate approximation. Additionally, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied to obtain the best parameters setting for SVR. From simulation results, it shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms.

Knowledge-based gene expression classification via matrix factorization	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; MICROARRAY DATA; RANDOM FOREST; SELECTION; CANCER; ARRAYS; TOOL	Motivation: Modern machine learning methods based on matrix decomposition techniques, like independent component analysis (ICA) or non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), provide new and efficient analysis tools which are currently explored to analyze gene expression profiles. These exploratory feature extraction techniques yield expression modes (ICA) or metagenes (NMF). These extracted features are considered indicative of underlying regulatory processes. They can as well be applied to the classification of gene expression datasets by grouping samples into different categories for diagnostic purposes or group genes into functional categories for further investigation of related metabolic pathways and regulatory networks. Results: In this study we focus on unsupervised matrix factorization techniques and apply ICA and sparse NMF to microarray datasets. The latter monitor the gene expression levels of human peripheral blood cells during differentiation from monocytes to macrophages. We show that these tools are able to identify relevant signatures in the deduced component matrices and extract informative sets of marker genes from these gene expression profiles. The methods rely on the joint discriminative power of a set of marker genes rather than on single marker genes. With these sets of marker genes, corroborated by leave-one-out or random forest cross-validation, the datasets could easily be classified into related diagnostic categories. The latter correspond to either monocytes versus macrophages or healthy vs Niemann Pick C disease patients.	[Schachtner, R.; Lutter, D.; Knollmueller, P.; Theis, F. J.; Lang, E.

Risk prediction models can be derived with many different statistical approaches. To compare them, measures of predictive performance are derived from ROC methodology and from probability forecasting theory. These tools can be applied to assess single markers, multivariable regression models and complex model selection algorithms. This article provides a systematic review of the modem way of assessing risk prediction models. Particular attention is put on proper benchmarks and resampling techniques that are important for the interpretation of measured performance. All methods are illustrated with data from a clinical study in head and neck cancer patients.

We represent styles as differences between stylistic and introduced neutral motions, including timing differences and spatial differences. Tinting differences are defined its time alignment curves, while spatial differences are found by a machine learning technique: independent feature subspaces analysis, which is the combination of multidimensional independent component analysis and invariant feature subspaces. This technique is used to decompose two motions into several subspaces. One of these subspaces call be defined as style subspace that describes the style aspects of the stylistic motion. In order to find the style subspace, we compare norms of the projections of two motions oil each subspace. Once the time alignment curves and style subspaces of several motion clips are obtained, animators call tone, transfer, and merge the style subspaces to synthesize new mortion clips With various styles. Our method is easy to use since manual manipulations and large training data sets are riot necessary. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Emulating human perception of motion similarity	COMPUTER ANIMATION AND VIRTUAL WORLDS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	21st Annual Conference on Computer Animation and Social Agents (CASA 2008)	SEP 01-03, 2008	Seoul, SOUTH KOREA			3D human motion similarity; human perception; pattern recognition		Evaluating the similarity of motions is useful for motion retrieval, motion blending, and performance analysis of dancers and athletes. Euclidean distance between corresponding joints has been Widely adopted in measuring similarity of postures and hence motions. However, such a measure does not necessarily conform to the human perception of motion similarity. In this paper, eve propose a new similarity measure based on machine learning techniques. We make: rise of the results of questionnaires from subjects answering whether arbitrary pairs of motions appear similar or not. Using tire relative distance between the joints as the basic features, we train the system to compute tire similarity of arbitrary pair of motions. Experimental results show that our method outperforms methods based on Euclidean distance between corresponding joints. Our method is applicable to content-based motion retrieval of human motion for large-scale database systems. It is also applicable to e-Learning systems which automatically evaluates the performance of dancers and athletes by comparing tire subjects' motions With those by experts.

Knowledge is presented as patterns of classes. Each pattern includes attributes with weight and fitness values concerning the class. With the knowledge discovery method it is possible to form fitness values from data. Knowledge formation is based on frequency distributions of attributes. Knowledge formed by the knowledge discovery method is tested with two vertigo data sets and compared to experts' knowledge. The experts' and machine learnt knowledge are also combined in various ways in order to examine effects of weights on classification accuracy. The classification accuracy of knowledge discovery method is compared to 1- and 5-nearest neighbour method and Naive-Bayes classifier. The results showed that knowledge bases combining machine learnt knowledge with the experts' knowledge yielded the best classification accuracies. Further, attribute weighting had an important effect on the classification capability of the system. When considering different diseases in the used data sets, the performance of the knowledge discovery method and the inference method is comparable to other methods employed in this study.

Construction and analysis of educational tests using abductive machine learning	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						abductive machine learning; abductive networks; neural networks; optimal test design; educational measurements; item response theory; test analysis; test construction	TEST DESIGN; OPTIMIZATION; NETWORKS; MODEL	Recent advances in educational technologies and the wide-spread use of computers in schools have fueled innovations in test construction and analysis. As the measurement accuracy of a test depends on the quality of the items it includes, item selection procedures play a central role in this process. Mathematical programming and the item response theory (IRT) are often used in automating this task. However, when the item bank is very large, the number of item combinations increases exponentially and item selection becomes more tedious. To alleviate the computational complexity, researchers have previously applied heuristic search and machine learning approaches, including neural networks, to solve similar problems. This paper proposes a novel approach that uses abductive network modeling to automatically identify the most-informative subset of test items that can be used to effectively assess the examinees without seriously degrading accuracy. Abductive machine learning automatically selects only effective model inputs and builds an optimal network model of polynomial functional nodes that minimizes a predicted squared error criterion. Using a training dataset of 1500 cases (examinees) and 45 test items, the proposed approach automatically selected only 12 items which classified an evaluation population of 500 cases with 91%) accuracy. Performance is examined for various levels of model complexity and compared with that of statistical IRT-based techniques. Results indicate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of test items required while maintaining acceptable test quality. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although many approaches exist for reconstructing network structure, few approaches recover the full dynamic behavior of a network. We survey such approaches that originate from computational scientific discovery, a subfield of machine learning. These take as input measured time course data, as well as existing domain knowledge, such as partial knowledge of the network structure. We demonstrate the use of these approaches on illustrative tasks of finding the complete dynamics of biological networks, which include examples of rediscovering known networks and their dynamics, as well as examples of proposing models for unknown networks.

How proteins get in touch: Interface prediction in the study of biomolecular complexes	CURRENT PROTEIN & PEPTIDE SCIENCE			English	Review						protein-protein complexes; interface prediction; binding site prediction	INTERACTION-SITE PREDICTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; BINDING-SITES; RESIDUE CONSERVATION; SEQUENCE PROFILE; INFORMATION; SURFACE; HOMOLOGS; DOCKING; HETEROCOMPLEXES	Protein-protein interface prediction is a booming field, with a substantial growth in the number of new methods being published the last two years. The increasing number of available three-dimensional structures of protein-protein complexes has enabled large-scale statistical analyses of protein interfaces, considering evolutionary, physicochemical and structural properties. Successful combinations of these properties have led to more accurate interface predictors in recent years. In addition to parametric combination, machine learning algorithms have become popular. In the meantime, assessing the absolute and relative performance of interface predictors remains very difficult: This is due to differences in both the output of the various interface predictors, and in the evaluation criteria used by their respective authors. This review provides an overview of the state of the art in the field, and discusses the performance of existing interface predictors. The focus is mainly on protein-protein interface prediction, although most issues are also valid for other kinds of interface prediction.	[de Vries, Sjoerd J.; Bonvin, Alexandre M. J.

Cancer classification by gradient LDA technique using microarray gene expression data	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						DNA microarray; linear discriminant analysis (LDA); Gradient LDA (GLDA); dimensionality reduction; cancer classification; feature selection; feature extraction	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; BAYESIAN MODEL; SELECTION; PREDICTION; MULTICLASS; REGRESSION; PROFILES	Cancer classification is one of the major applications of the microarray technology. When standard machine learning techniques are applied for cancer classification, they face the small sample size (SSS) problem of gene expression data. The SSS problem is inherited from large dimensionality of the feature space (due to large number of genes) compared to the small number of samples available. In order to overcome the SSS problem, the dimensionality of the feature space is reduced either through feature selection or through feature extraction. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a well-known technique for feature extraction-based dimensionality reduction. However, this technique cannot be applied for cancer classification because of the singularity of the within-class scatter matrix due to the SSS problem. In this paper, we use Gradient LDA technique which avoids the singularity problem associated with the within-class scatter matrix and shown its usefulness for cancer classification. The technique is applied on three gene expression datasets; namely, acute leukemia, small round blue-cell tumour (SRBCT) and lung adenocarcinoma. This technique achieves lower misclassification error as compared to several other previous techniques. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Li, XC; Wang, L; Sung, E				Li, Xuchun; Wang, Lei; Sung, Eric			AdaBoost with SVM-based component classifiers	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						AdaBoost; Support Vector Machine; component classifier; diversity	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; LEARNING ALGORITHMS; DIVERSITY; ENSEMBLES; ACCURACY	The use of SVM (Support Vector Machine) as component classifier in AdaBoost may seem like going against the grain of the Boosting principle since SVM is not an easy classifier to train. Moreover, Wickramaratna et al. [2001. Performance degradation in boosting. In: Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Multiple Classifier Systems, pp. 11-21] show that AdaBoost with strong component classifiers is not viable. In this paper, we shall show that AdaBoost incorporating properly designed RBFSVM (SVM with the RBF kernel) component classifiers, which we call AdaBoostSVM, can perform as well as SVM. Furthermore, the proposed AdaBoostSVM demonstrates better generalization performance than SVM on imbalanced classification problems. The key idea of AdaBoostSVM is that for the sequence of trained RBFSVM component classifiers, starting with large a values (implying weak learning), the sigma values are reduced progressively as the Boosting iteration proceeds. This effectively produces a set of RBFSVM component classifiers whose model parameters are aclaptively different manifesting in better generalization as compared to AdaBoost approach with SVM component classifiers using a fixed (optimal) sigma value. From benchmark data sets, we show that our AdaBoostSVM approach outperforms other AdaBoost approaches using component classifiers such as Decision Trees and Neural Networks. AdaBoostSVM can be seen as a proof of concept of the idea proposed in Valentini and Dietterich [2004. Bias-variance analysis of support vector machines for the development of SVM-based ensemble methods. Journal of Machine Learning Research 5, 725-775] that Adaboost with heterogeneous SVMs could work well. Moreover, we extend AdaBoostSVM to the Diverse AdaBoostSVM to address the reported accuracy/diversity dilemma of the original Adaboost. By designing parameter adjusting strategies, the distributions of accuracy and diversity over RBFSVM component classifiers are tuned to maintain a good balance between them and promising results have been obtained on benchmark data sets.

Divergent estimation error in portfolio optimization and in linear regression	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B			English	Article							MATRICES	The problem of estimation error in portfolio optimization is discussed, in the limit where the portfolio size N and the sample size T go to infinity such that their ratio is fixed. The estimation error strongly depends on the ratio N/T and diverges for a critical value of this parameter. This divergence is the manifestation of an algorithmic phase transition, it is accompanied by a number of critical phenomena, and displays universality. As the structure of a large number of multidimensional regression and modelling problems is very similar to portfolio optimization, the scope of the above observations extends far beyond finance, and covers a large number of problems in operations research, machine learning, bioinformatics, medical science, economics, and technology.

In order to model the past, we chose two of the most climatically significant events recognized affecting the species distribution: the last glacial maximum (LGM, 21 000 cal. BP), and the mid Holocene (6000 cal. BP). In order to model the distributions, we based the future scenarios of climate change upon the four storylines projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (A1, A2, B1 and B2). The results obtained for the past show a contraction in the distribution area during the LGM and a subsequent expansion, coinciding with an improvement in climate in the mid Holocene. The presence of isolated populations of Pinus sylvestris at low altitudes could support the existence of refuges for Northern European taxa. The results obtained for the future, even in the least aggressive scenario, show a rapid decrease in this species' distribution and a vertical migration as a response to climate change. Pinus sylvestris populations would be restricted in the future to the higher altitudes of the mountains in the north of the Iberian Peninsula (mainly the Pyrenees), and the species would disappear from the central and southern mountain ranges. These results identify a risk to high-mountain forest species in the Iberian Peninsula from the effects of global warming.

J	Zhang, BT				Zhang, Byoung-Tak			Hypernetworks: A molecular evolutionary architecture for cognitive learning and memory	IEEE COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE MAGAZINE			English	Article							NETWORKS; SPECIFICITY; CLASSIFIERS; ALGORITHM; SYSTEMS; MODELS	Recent interest in human-level intelligence suggests a rethink of the role of machine learning in computational intelligence. We argue that without cognitive learning the goal of achieving human-level synthetic intelligence is far from completion. Here we review the principles underlying human learning and memory, and identify three of them, i.e., continuity, glocality, and compositionality, as the most fundamental to human-level machine learning. We then propose the recently-developed hypernet-work model as a candidate architecture for cognitive learning and memory. Hypernetworks are a random hypergraph structure higher-order probabilistic relations of data by an evolutionary self-organizing process based on molecular self-assembly. The chemically-based massive interaction for information organization and processing in the molecular hypernetworks, referred to as hyperinteractionism, is contrasted with the symbolist, connectionist, and dynamicist approaches to mind and intelligence. We demonstrate the generative learning capability of the hypernetworks to simulate linguistic recall memory, visual imagery, and language-vision crossmodal translation based on a video corpus of movies and dramas in a multimodal memory game environment. We also offer prospects for the hyperinteractionistic molecular mind approach to a unified theory of cognitive learning.

Accelerometers and force sensing resistors for optimal control of walking of a hemiplegic	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						artificial neural networks (ANNs); functional electrical stimulation (FES); gait; machine learning; optimal control; sensory system	FUNCTIONAL ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES; FREQUENCY CONTENT; GAIT; MUSCLE; ORIENTATION; MOVEMENT; FES; INTEGRATION; KINEMATICS	We developed a method for use of accelerometers and force sensing resistors (FSRs) within an optimal controller of walking for hemiplegic individuals. The data from four dual-axis accelerometers and four FSRs were inputs, while six muscle activation profiles were outputs. The controller includes two stages: 1) estimating the target gait pattern using artificial neural networks; and 2) optimal control minimizing tracking errors (from the estimated gait pattern) and muscle efforts. The controller was tested using data collected from six healthy subjects walking at five speeds (0.6-1.4 m/s). The average root mean square errors (RMSEs) normalized by the peak-to-peak value of the target signals [normalized RMSE (NRMSE)] were below 6%,7%,8%, and 3% for estimation of joint angles, hip acceleration, ground reaction force, and movement of the center of pressure, respectively. Using the estimated data as inputs, the simulation generated the target healthy-like gait patterns and reproducible muscle activation profiles in 90% of 300 tested gait trials. Overall tracking NRMSE was between 2% and 9%. The optimal controller was developed for testing the feasibility of healthy-like gait patterns in hemiplegic individuals, and generating a knowledge base that is required for the synthesis of a sensory-driven control of walking assisted by functional electrical stimulation.

We employ the least-squares collocation principle to define an appropriate objective function, which is optimized using GP. Two approaches are presented for the repair of the symbolic expression for the field variables evolved by the GP algorithm to ensure that the governing equations as well as the boundary conditions are satisfied. In the case of problems defined on geometrically simple domains, we augment the solution evolved by GP with additional terms, such that the boundary conditions are satisfied by construction. To satisfy the boundary conditions for geometrically irregular domains, we combine the GP model with a radial basis function network. We improve the computational efficiency and accuracy of both techniques with gradient boosting, a technique originally developed by the machine learning community. Numerical studies are presented for operator problems on regular and irregular boundaries to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.

J	Chong, SY; Tino, P; Yao, X				Chong, Siang Yew; Tino, Peter; Yao, Xin			Measuring generalization performance in coevolutionary learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						Chebyshev's inequality; coevolutionary learning; evolutionary computation; generalization; iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD)	ITERATED PRISONERS-DILEMMA; NEURAL-NETWORKS; EVOLUTION; GAME	Coevolutionary learning involves a training process where training samples are instances of solutions that interact strategically to guide the evolutionary (learning) process. One main research issue is with the generalization performance, i.e., the search for solutions (e.g., input-output mappings) that best predict the required output for any new input that has not been seen during the evolutionary process. However, there is currently no such framework for determining the generalization performance in coevolutionary learning even though the notion of generalization is well-understood in machine learning. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework to address this research issue. We present the framework in terms of game-playing although our results are more general. Here, a strategy's generalization performance is its average performance against all test strategies. Given that the true value may not be determined by solving analytically a closed-form formula and is computationally prohibitive, we propose an estimation procedure that computes the average performance against a small sample of random test strategies instead. We perform a mathematical analysis to provide a statistical claim on the accuracy of our estimation procedure, which can be further improved by performing a second estimation on the variance of the random variable. For game-playing, it is well-known that one is more interested in the generalization performance against a biased and diverse sample of "good" test strategies. We introduce a simple approach to obtain such a test sample through the multiple partial enumerative search of the strategy space that does not require human expertise and is generally applicable to a wide range of domains. We illustrate the generalization framework on the coevolutionary learning of the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) games. We investigate two definitions of generalization performance for the IPD game based on different performance criteria, e.g., in terms of the number of wins based on individual outcomes and in, terms of average payoff. We show that a small sample of test strategies can be used to estimate the generalization performance. We also show that the generalization performance using a biased and diverse set of "good" test strategies is lower compared to the unbiased case for the IPD game. This is the first time that generalization is defined and analyzed rigorously in coevolutionary learning. The framework allows the evaluation of the generalization performance of any coevolutionary learning system quantitatively.

J	Huang, ZH; Gedeon, TD; Nikravesh, M				Huang, Zhiheng; Gedeon, Tamas D.; Nikravesh, Masoud			Pattern Trees Induction: A New Machine Learning Method	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Fuzzy classification model; fuzzy decision trees (FDTs); pattern trees (PTs)	FUZZY DECISION TREES; CLASSIFICATION; RULES	Fuzzy classification is one of the most important applications in fuzzy set and fuzzy-logic-related research. Its goal is to find a set of fuzzy rules that form a classification model. Most of the existing fuzzy rule induction methods (e.g., the fuzzy decision trees (FDTs) induction method) focus on searching rules consisting of triangular norms (t-norms) (i.e., AND) only, but not triangular conorms (t-conorms) (OR) explicitly. This may lead to the omission of generating important rules that involve t-conorms explicitly. This paper proposes a type of tree termed pattern trees (PTs) that makes use of different aggregations, including both t-norms and t-conorms. Like decision trees, PTs are an effective tool for classification applications. This paper discusses the difference between decision trees and PTs, and also shows that the subsethood-based method (SBM) and the weighted-subsethood-based method (WSBM) are two specific cases of PT induction. A novel PT induction method is proposed using similarity measure and fuzzy aggregations. The comparison to other classification methods including SBM, WSBM, C4.5, nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and FDT induction shows that: 1) PTs can obtain high accuracy rates in classifications; 2) PTs are robust to overfitting; and 3) PTs, especially simple pattern trees (SPTs), maintain compact tree structures.

J	Chiang, JH; Lee, TLM				Chiang, Jung-Hsien; Lee, Tsung-Lu Michael			In Silico Prediction of Human Protein Interactions Using Fuzzy-SVM Mixture Models and Its Application to Cancer Research	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Fuzzy modeling; fuzzy-SVM mixture models (FSMMs); mixture models; support vector machines (SVMs)	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; DATABASE; PROTEOMICS; NETWORKS; GENE; IDENTIFICATION; INFORMATION; KNOWLEDGE; RESOURCE	Proteomics technologies and bioinformatics tools have been widely used to analyze protein-protein interactions of complex biological systems, which are essential for understanding the mechanisms of human and cancer biology. Although many studies have tackled the problem of high-throughput protein-protein interaction identifications in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster, the effort to predict human and cancer-related protein-protein interaction is still limited. Moreover, low consistency and high false positive rates are major drawbacks of these high-throughput methods. In this research, the focus is on predicting human cancer-related protein-protein interaction and reducing false positive rates with integrated classifiers. We propose a hybrid machine learning system by merging fuzzy multiset-based classifiers and support vector machines (SVMs) into fuzzy-SVM mixture models (FSMMs). Our experimental result of the FSMMs approach achieves consistent prediction accuracy on human protein-protein interactions (PPIs) with an receiver operating curve score of 0.965 that outperforms other models. Overall, prediction results on cancer-related protein pairs indicate that our proposed system is effective for identifying both known and novel PPIs to assist cancer research in discovering novel interactions.

J	Zhou, L; Shi, YM; Zhang, DS				Zhou, Lina; Shi, Yongmei; Zhang, Dongsong			A statistical language modeling approach to online deception detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						machine learning; classification; language models; text mining; knowledge management applications; security	COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION; CUES	Online deception is disrupting our daily life, organizational process, and even national security. Existing approaches to online deception detection follow a traditional paradigm by using a set of cues as antecedents for deception detection, which may be hindered by ineffective cue identification. Motivated by the strength of statistical language models (SLMs) in capturing the dependency of words in text without explicit feature extraction, we developed SLMs to detect online deception. We also addressed the data-sparsity problem in building SLMs in general and in deception detection in specific using smoothing and vocabulary pruning techniques. The developed SLMs were evaluated empirically with diverse data sets. The results showed that the proposed SLM approach to deception detection outperformed a state-of-the-art text categorization method, as well as traditional feature-based methods.

We compare results using this approach to using standard density measures. We show that the proposed method can quantify both age related effects and effects caused by HRT. Age effects are significantly detected by our method where standard methodologies fail. The separation of HRT subpopulations using our approach is comparable to the best methodology, which is interactive.

J	Geng, X; Zhou, ZH; Smith-Miles, K				Geng, Xin; Zhou, Zhi-Hua; Smith-Miles, Kate			Individual stable space: An approach to face recognition under uncontrolled conditions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						face recognition (FR); individual stable space (ISS); machine learning; neural networks; pattern recognition	PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS; IMAGE; ILLUMINATION; SELECTION; ENSEMBLE	There usually exist many kinds of variations in face images taken under uncontrolled conditions, such as changes of pose, illumination, expression, etc. Most previous works on face recognition (FR) focus on particular variations and usually assume the absence of others. Instead of such a "divide and conquer" strategy, this paper attempts to directly address face recognition under uncontrolled conditions. The key is the individual stable space (ISS), which only expresses personal characteristics. A neural network named ISNN is proposed to map a raw face image into the ISS. After that, three ISS-based algorithms are designed for FR under uncontrolled conditions. There are no restrictions for the images fed into these algorithms. Moreover, unlike many other FR techniques, they do not require any extra training information, such as the view angle. These advantages make them practical to implement under uncontrolled conditions. The proposed algorithms are tested on three large face databases with vast variations and achieve superior performance compared with other 12 existing FR techniques.

The Q-norm complexity measure and the minimum gradient method: A novel approach to the machine learning structural risk minimization problem	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						complexity measure; multiobjective training algorithms; neural networks; parallel layer perceptron (PLP); regularization methods; structural risk minimization (SRM)	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; IMPROVING GENERALIZATION; KERNEL; CLASSIFIERS; ALGORITHM; VALIDATION; WEIGHTS; SIZE	This paper presents a novel approach for dealing with the structural risk minimization (SRM) applied to a general setting of the machine learning problem. The formulation is based on the fundamental concept that supervised learning is a bi-objective optimization problem in which two conflicting objectives should be minimized. The objectives are related to the empirical training error and the machine complexity. In this paper, one general Q-norm method to compute the machine complexity is presented, and, as a particular practical case, the minimum gradient method (MGM) is derived relying on the definition of the fat-shattering dimension. A practical mechanism for parallel layer perceptron (PLP) network training, involving only quasi-convex functions, is generated using the aforementioned definitions. Experimental results on 15 different benchmarks are presented, which show the potential of the proposed ideas.	[Vieira, D. A. G.; Vasconcelos, J. A.; Caminhas, W.

Learning flexible features for conditional random fields	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						machine learning; statistical models; induction; text analysis; pixel classification; Markov random fields		Extending traditional models for discriminative labeling of structured data to include a higher order structure in the labels results in an undesirable exponential increase in model complexity. In this paper, we present a model that is capable of learning such structures using a random field of parameterized features. These features can be functions of arbitrary combinations of observations, labels, and auxiliary hidden variables. We also present a simple induction scheme to learn these features, which can automatically determine the complexity needed for a given data set. We apply the model to two real-world tasks, information extraction and image labeling, and compare our results to several other methods for discriminative labeling.

Power utility nontechnical loss analysis with extreme learning machine method	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS			English	Article						classification techniques; extreme machine learning (ELM); nontechnical losses (NTL); support vector machine (SVM)	FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; LOAD PROFILES	This paper presents a new approach to nontechnical loss (NTL) analysis for utilities using the modern computational technique extreme learning machine (ELM). Nontechnical losses represent a significant proportion of electricity losses in both developing and developed countries. The ELM-based approach presented here uses customer load-profile information to expose abnormal behavior that is known to be highly correlated with NTL activities. This approach provides a method of data mining for this purpose, and it involves extracting patterns of customer behavior from historical kWh consumption data. The results yield classification classes that are used to reveal whether any significant behavior that emerges is due to irregularities in consumption. In this paper, ELM and online sequential-ELM (OS-ELM) algorithms are both used to achieve an improved classification performance and to increase accuracy of results. A comparison of this approach with other classification techniques, such as the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, is also undertaken and the ELM performance and accuracy in NTL analysis is shown to be superior.

In this paper, we focus on a broad category of problems of collaborative data analysis realized by a collection of agents having access to their individual data and exchanging findings through their collaboration activities. Such problems of data analysis arise in the context of building a global view at a certain phenomenon (process) by viewing it from different perspectives (and thus engaging various collections of attributes by various agents). Our goal is to develop some interaction between the agents so that they could form an overall perspective, where the knowledge available locally is shared and reconciled. The underlying format of knowledge built by the agents is that of information granules and fuzzy sets in particular. We develop a comprehensive optimization scheme and discuss its two-phase nature in which the communication phase of the granular findings intertwines with the local optimization being realized by the agents at the level of the individual datasite and exploits the evidence collected from other sites. We show how the mechanism of fuzzy granulation realized in the form of a well-known fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering can be augmented to support collaborative activities required by the agents. For this purpose, we introduce augmented versions of the original objective function used in the FCM and derive algorithmic details. We also discuss an issue of optimizing the strength of collaborative linkages, so that the reconciled findings attain the highest level of consistency (agreement). The presented experimental studies include some synthetic data and selected data sets coming from the Machine Learning repository.

J	Pedrycz, W; Rai, P; Zurada, J				Pedrycz, Witold; Rai, Partab; Zurada, Jozef			Experience-consistent modeling for radial basis function neural networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						experience-consistent neural network; knowledge transfer; data quality	PATTERN-RECOGNITION; IDENTIFICATION	We develop a new approach to the design of neural networks, which utilizes a collaborative framework of knowledge-driven experience. In contrast to the "standard" way of developing neural networks, which explicitly exploits experimental data, this approach incorporates a mechanism of knowledge-driven experience. The essence of the proposed scheme of learning is to take advantage of the parameters (connections) of neural networks built in the past for the same phenomenon (which might also exhibit some variability over time or space) for which are interested to construct the network on a basis of currently available data. We establish a conceptual and algorithmic framework to reconcile these two essential sources of information (data and knowledge) in the process of the development of the network. To make a presentation more focused and come up with a detailed quanti. cation of the resulting architecture, we concentrate on the experience-based design of radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs). We introduce several performance indexes to quantify an effect of utilization of the knowledge residing within the connections of the networks and establish an optimal level of their use. Experimental results are presented for low-dimensional synthetic data and selected datasets available at the Machine Learning Repository.

J	Yang, ZH; Lin, HF; Li, YP				Yang, Zhihao; Lin, Hongfei; Li, Yanpeng			Exploiting the contextual cues for bio-entity name recognition in biomedical literature	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						text mining; information extraction; named entity recognition; conditional random fields; contextual cue	TEXT; GENE	To extract biomedical information about bio-entities from the huge amount of biomedical literature, the first key step is recognizing their names in these literatures, which remains a challenging task due to the irregularities and ambiguities in bio-entities nomenclature. The recognition performances of the current popular methods, machine learning techniques, still have much space to be improved. This paper presents a Conditional Random Field-based approach used to recognize the names of bio-entities including gene, protein, cell type, cell line and studies the methods of improving the performance by the exploitation of the contextual cues including bracket pair, heuristic syntax structure and interaction words cue. Experiment results on both JNLPBA2004 and BioCreative2004 task 1A datasets show that these methods can improve Conditional Random Field-based recognition performance by more than 2 points in F-score.

Our contributions include a precise description of the task including annotation guidelines, theoretical analysis and discussion. We show that good agreement can be achieved using our guidelines and present a publicly available benchmark dataset for the task. We argue for separation of the acquisition and classification phases in semi-supervised machine learning, and present a probabilistic acquisition model which is evaluated both theoretically and experimentally. We explore the impact of different sample representations on classification accuracy across the learning curve and demonstrate the effectiveness of using machine learning for the hedge identification task. Finally, we examine the errors made by our approach and point toward avenues for future research. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Infobuttons are decision support tools that offer links to information resources based on the context of the interaction between a clinician and an electronic medical record (EMR) system. The objective of this study was to explore machine learning and web usage mining methods to produce classification models for the prediction of information resources that might be relevant in a particular infobutton context. Design. Classification models were developed and evaluated with an infobutton usage dataset. The performance of the models was measured and compared with a reference implementation in a series of experiments. Measurements. Level of agreement (K) between the models and the resources that clinicians actually used in each infobutton session. Results. The classification models performed significantly better than the reference implementation (p < .0001). The performance of these models tended to decrease over time, probably due to a phenomenon known as concept drift. However, the performance of the models remained stable when concept drift handling techniques were used. Conclusions. The results suggest that classification models are a promising method for the prediction of information resources that a clinician would use to answer patient care questions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Reduced graph queries	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							THROUGHPUT SCREENING DATA; INHIBITION; DESIGN; CLASSIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION; FINGERPRINTS; CLASSIFIERS; MOLECULES; MODEL; TREES	A new machine learning method is presented for extracting interpretable structure-activity relationships from screening data. The method is based on an evolutionary algorithm and reduced graphs and aims to evolve a reduced graph query (subgraph) that is present within the active compounds and absent from the inactives. The reduced graph representation enables heterogeneous Compounds, such as those found in high-throughput screening data, to be captured in a single representation with the resulting query encoding structure-activity information in a form that is readily interpretable by a chemist. The application of the method is illustrated using data sets extracted from the well-known MDDR data set and GSK in-house screening data. Queries are evolved that are consistent with the known SARs, and they are also shown to be robust when applied to independent sets that were not used in training.

Using multiobjective optimization to derive multiple models	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							REDUCED GRAPHS; SIMILARITY; FINGERPRINTS	A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is described for evolving multiple structure-activity relationships (SARs). The SARs are encoded in easy-to-interpret reduced graph queries which describe features that are preferentially present in active compounds compared to inactives. The MOEA addresses a limitation associated with many machine learning methods; that is, the inherent tradeoff that exists in recall and precision which is usually handled by combining the two objectives into a single measure with a consequent loss of control. By simultaneously optimizing recall and precision, the MOEA generates a family of SARs that lie on the precision-recall (PR) curve. The user is then able to select a query with an appropriate balance in the two objectives: for example, a low recall-high precision query may be preferred when establishing the SAR, whereas a high recall-low precision query may be more appropriate in a virtual screening context. Each query on the PR curve aims at capturing the structure -activity information into a single representation, and each can be considered as an alternative (equally valid) solution. We then investigate combining individual queries into teams with the aim of capturing multiple SARs that may exist in a data set, for example, as is commonly seen in high-throughput screening data sets. Team formation is carried out iteratively as a postprocessing step following the evolution of the individual queries. The inclusion of uniqueness as a third objective within the MOEA provides an effective way of ensuring the queries are complementary in the active compounds they describe. Substantial improvements in both recall and precision are seen for some data sets. Furthermore, the resulting queries provide more detailed structure-activity information than is present in a single query.

If HTS screening is carried Out at the level of the intact organism, as is commonly done in crop protection, this strategy has the potential of uncovering a completely new mechanism of actions. The challenge in running a cost-effective HTS operation is to identify ways in which to improve the overall success rate in discovering new biologically active Compounds. To this end, we describe Our efforts directed at making full use of the data stream arising from HTS. This paper describes a comparative study in which several machine learning and chemometric methodologies were used to develop classifiers on the same data sets derived from in vivo HTS campaigns and their predictive performances compared in terms of false negative and false positive error profiles.

The success of these algorithms rests on the assumption that the function(s) to be studied (learned, interpolated, etc.) are smooth with respect to the geometry of the data. In this paper we present a method for modifying the given geometry so the function(s) to be studied are smoother with respect to the modified geometry, and thus more amenable to treatment using harmonic analysis methods. Among the many possible applications, we consider the problems of image denoising and transductive classification. In both settings, our approach improves on standard diffusion based methods.

Exponentiated Gradient Algorithms for Conditional Random Fields and Max-Margin Markov Networks	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						exponentiated gradient; log-linear models; maximum-margin models; structured prediction; conditional random fields	LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; SUBGRADIENT METHODS; VECTOR MACHINES; OPTIMIZATION; DESCENT	Log-linear and maximum-margin models are two commonly-used methods in supervised machine learning, and are frequently used in structured prediction problems. Efficient learning of parameters in these models is therefore an important problem, and becomes a key factor when learning from very large data sets. This paper describes exponentiated gradient (EG) algorithms for training such models, where EG updates are applied to the convex dual of either the log-linear or max-margin objective function; the dual in both the log-linear and max-margin cases corresponds to minimizing a convex function with simplex constraints. We study both batch and online variants of the algorithm, and provide rates of convergence for both cases. In the max-margin case, O (1/epsilon) EG updates are required to reach a given accuracy e in the dual; in contrast, for log-linear models only O (log (1/epsilon)) updates are required. For both the max-margin and log-linear cases, our bounds suggest that the online EG algorithm requires a factor of n less computation to reach a desired accuracy than the batch EG algorithm, where n is the number of training examples. Our experiments confirm that the online algorithms are much faster than the batch algorithms in practice. We describe how the EG updates factor in a convenient way for structured prediction problems, allowing the algorithms to be efficiently applied to problems such as sequence learning or natural language parsing. We perform extensive evaluation of the algorithms, comparing them to L-BFGS and stochastic gradient descent for log-linear models, and to SVM-Struct for max-margin models. The algorithms are applied to a multi-class problem as well as to a more complex large-scale parsing task. In all these settings, the EG algorithms presented here outperform the other methods.

J	Huang, VS; Shadmehr, R; Diedrichsen, J				Huang, Vincent S.; Shadmehr, Reza; Diedrichsen, Joern			Active learning: Learning a motor skill without a coach	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							ACQUISITION; PRINCIPLES; RETENTION; DYNAMICS; HUMANS; MEMORY	When we learn a new skill (e. g., golf) without a coach, we are "active learners": we have to choose the specific components of the task on which to train (e. g., iron, driver, putter, etc.). What guides our selection of the training sequence? How do choices that people make compare with choices made by machine learning algorithms that attempt to optimize performance? We asked subjects to learn the novel dynamics of a robotic tool while moving it in four directions. They were instructed to choose their practice directions to maximize their performance in subsequent tests. We found that their choices were strongly influenced by motor errors: subjects tended to immediately repeat an action if that action had produced a large error. This strategy was correlated with better performance on test trials. However, even when participants performed perfectly on a movement, they did not avoid repeating that movement. The probability of repeating an action did not drop below chance even when no errors were observed. This behavior led to suboptimal performance. It also violated a strong prediction of current machine learning algorithms, which solve the active learning problem by choosing a training sequence that will maximally reduce the learner's uncertainty about the task. While we show that these algorithms do not provide an adequate description of human behavior, our results suggest ways to improve human motor learning by helping people choose an optimal training sequence.

We identified statistically significant diagnostic features of phosphopeptide tandem mass spectra based on ion trap CID MS/MS experiments. Statistics for the features are calculated from 376 validated phosphopeptide spectra and 376 nonphosphopeptide spectra. A probability-based support vector machine (SVM) program, Colander, was then trained on five selected features. Data sets were assembled both from LC/LC-MS/MS analyses of large-scale phosphopeptide enrichments from proteolyzed cells, tissues and synthetic phosphopeptides. These data sets were used to evaluate the capability of Colander to select pS/pT-containing phosphopeptide tandem mass spectra. When applied to unknown tandem mass spectra, Colander can routinely remove 80% of tandem mass spectra while retaining 95% of phosphopeptide tandem mass spectra. The program significantly reduced computational time spent on database search by 60-90%. Furthermore, prefiltering tandem mass spectra representing phosphopeptides can increase the number of phosphopeptide identifications under a predefined false positive rate.

J	Balcan, MF; Blum, A; Srebro, N				Balcan, Maria-Florina; Blum, Avrim; Srebro, Nathan			A theory of learning with similarity functions	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Kernel functions; Similarity functions; Margins		Kernel functions have become an extremely popular tool in machine learning, with an attractive theory as well. This theory views a kernel as implicitly mapping data points into a possibly very high dimensional space, and describes a kernel function as being good for a given learning problem if data is separable by a large margin in that implicit space. However, while quite elegant, this theory does not necessarily correspond to the intuition of a good kernel as a good measure of similarity, and the underlying margin in the implicit space usually is not apparent in "natural" representations of the data. Therefore, it may be difficult for a domain expert to use the theory to help design an appropriate kernel for the learning task at hand. Moreover, the requirement of positive semi-definiteness may rule out the most natural pairwise similarity functions for the given problem domain. In this work we develop an alternative, more general theory of learning with similarity functions (i.e., sufficient conditions for a similarity function to allow one to learn well) that does not require reference to implicit spaces, and does not require the function to be positive semi-definite (or even symmetric). Instead, our theory talks in terms of more direct properties of how the function behaves as a similarity measure. Our results also generalize the standard theory in the sense that any good kernel function under the usual definition can be shown to also be a good similarity function under our definition (though with some loss in the parameters). In this way, we provide the first steps towards a theory of kernels and more general similarity functions that describes the effectiveness of a given function in terms of natural similarity-based properties.

The system automatically extracts kerogen pieces from the image and labels each piece as either inertinite or vitrinite. The image pre-processing analysis consists of background removal, identification of kerogen material, object segmentation, object extraction (individual images of pieces of kerogen) and feature calculation for each object. An expert palynologist was asked to label the objects into categories inertinite and vitrinite, which provided the ground truth for the classification experiment. Ten state-of-the-art classifiers and classifier ensembles were compared: Naive Bayes, decision tree, nearest neighbour, the logistic classifier, multilayered perceptron (MLP), support vector machines (SVM), AdaBoost, Bagging, LogitBoost and Random Forest. The logistic classifier was singled out as the most accurate classifier, with an accuracy greater than 90. Using a 10 times 10-fold cross-validation provided within the Weka software, we found that the logistic classifier was significantly better than five classifiers (p < 0.05) and indistinguishable from the other four classifiers. The initial set of 32 features was subsequently reduced to 6 features without compromising the classification accuracy. A further evaluation of the system alerted us to the possible sensitivity of the classification to the ground truth that might vary from one human expert to another. The analysis also revealed that the logistic classifier made most of the correct classifications with a high certainty.	[Kuncheva, L. I.; Charles, J. J.; Lim, I.

Alta-Cyclic: a selfoptimizing base caller for next-generation sequencing	NATURE METHODS			English	Article							GENOME	Next-generation sequencing is limited to short read lengths and by high error rates. We systematically analyzed sources of noise in the Illumina Genome Analyzer that contribute to these high error rates and developed a base caller, Alta-Cyclic, that uses machine learning to compensate for noise factors. Alta-Cyclic substantially improved the number of accurate reads for sequencing runs up to 78 bases and reduced systematic biases, facilitating confident identification of sequence variants.

The points are assumed to form a repository of information granules. At a global level, statistical methods discriminate between regular points and outliers. Then the local component of the information embedded in the former is used to draw an optimal regression curve. We address the challenge of using a variety of standard machine learning tools such as support vector machine (SVM) or slight variants of them within the unifying hat of Granular Computing realm to obtain a definitely new featured nonlinear regression method. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated with the aid of three well-known benchmarks and ad hoc featured datasets. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, there is the need for modeling adaptation of fuzzy logic programs, so that machine learning techniques, such as connectionist-based learning, can be applied. Weighted fuzzy logic programs bring fuzzy logic programs and connectionist models closer together by associating a significant weight with each atom in the body of a fuzzy rule: by exploiting the existence of the weights, it is possible to construct a connectionist model that reflects the exact structure of a weighted fuzzy logic program. Based on the connectionist representation, we first define the weight adaptation problem as the task of adapting the weights of the rules of a weighted fuzzy logic program, so that they fit: best a set of training data, and then we develop a subgradient descent learning algorithm for the connectionist model that allows us to obtain an approximate solution for the weight adaptation problem.

They are based on the selection of a subset of training patterns when a new query is received. Usually, that selection is based on the k closest neighbors and it is a static selection, because the number of patterns selected does not depend on the input space region in which the new query is placed. In this paper, a lazy strategy is applied to train radial basis neural networks. That strategy incorporates a dynamic selection of patterns, and that selection is based on two different kernel functions, the Gaussian and the inverse function. This lazy learning method is compared with the classical lazy machine learning methods and with eagerly trained radial basis neural networks. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Junho			FCANN: A new approach for extraction and representation of knowledge from ANN trained via Formal Concept Analysis	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						rule extraction from neural networks; formal concept analysis; machine learning	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; RULES	Nowadays, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are being widely used in the representation of different systems and physics processes. Once trained, the networks are capable of dealing with operational conditions not seen during the training process, keeping tolerable errors in their responses. However, humans cannot assimilate the knowledge kept by those networks, since such implicit knowledge is difficult to be extracted. In this work, Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is being used in order to extract and represent knowledge from previously trained ANN. The new FCANN approach permits to obtain a complete canonical base, non-redundant and with minimum implications, which qualitatively describes the process being studied. The approach proposed has a sequence of steps such as the generation of a synthetic dataset. The variation of data number per parameter and the discretization interval number are adjustment factors to obtain more representative rules without the necessity of retraining the network. The FCANN method is not a classifier itself as other methods for rule extraction; this approach can be used to describe and understand the relationship among the process parameters through implication rules. Comparisons of FCANN with C4.5 and TREPAN algorithms are made to show its features and efficacy. Applications of the FCANN method for real world problems are presented as case studies.

J	Wang, AP; Afshar, P; Wang, H				Wang, Aiping; Afshar, Puya; Wang, Hong			Complex stochastic systems modelling and control via iterative machine learning	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						stochastic systems; RBF neural networks; iterative learning mechanism; probability density functions	PROBABILITY DENSITY-FUNCTIONS; MINIMUM ENTROPY CONTROL; OUTPUT PDFS; DISTRIBUTIONS; DESIGN	Complex stochastic systems require the control of their stochastic distributions (i.e., the shape of their output probability density functions (PDFs)). This paper will address both modelling and control of such systems and will consist of a brief survey of the recent developments and the description of a detailed design procedure on an iterative learning-based output PDF control algorithm. In this context, a radial basis function (RBF) neural network is used to approximate the output PDFs, and the system dynamics is represented by a mathematical model between the weights of the RBF neural networks and the control input. The whole control horizon is divided into a number of batches, where within each batch fixed RBFs are used. However, between batches, iterative machine learning for the shape update of the RBFs is developed so as to improve the closed loop performance batch-by-batch. A simulated example is given so as to demonstrate the design procedure. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Online clustering of switching models based on a subspace framework	NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-HYBRID SYSTEMS			English	Article						Identification; Markov parameters estimation; Machine learning; Dynamical classification; Switching systems		This paper deals with the modelling of switching systems and focuses on the characterization of the local functioning modes using the online clustering approach. The system considered is represented as a weighted sum of local linear models where each model could have its own structure. This implies that the parameters and the order of the switching system could change when the system switches. Moreover, possible constants of the local models are also unknown. The method presented consists of two steps. First, an online estimation method of the Markov parameters matrix of the local linear models is established. Secondly, the labelling of these parameters is done using a dynamical decision space worked out with learning techniques; each local model being represented by a cluster. The paper ends with an example and a discussion with an aim of illustrating the method's performance. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Pekpe, K.

Design: Observational cross-sectional study. Participants: Eighty-nine age-matched normal and perimetric glaucoma participants enrolled in the Advanced Imaging for Glaucoma Study. Methods: The Zeiss Stratus OCT system was used to obtain the circumpapillary RNFL thickness in both eyes of each participant. Right and left eye clock-hour data are analyzed together, assuming mirror-image symmetry. The RNFL diagnostic parameters were combined using either or-logic or and-logic approaches. Main Outcome Measures: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC), sensitivity, and specificity are used to evaluate diagnostic performance. Results: Overall average RNFL thickness has the highest AROC value (0.89) of all single parameters evaluated, followed by the inferior and superior quadrants (0.88 and 0.86, respectively). The clock hours with the best AROC values are in the inferior and superior quadrants. The highest AROC (0.92) was achieved by the or-logic combination of overall, inferior, and superior quadrant RNFL thicknesses. The 3-parameter combination was significantly better than the overall average alone (P = 0.01). The addition of more quadrants or clock hours to the combination reduced diagnostic performance. Conclusions: The best stand-alone diagnostic strategy for Stratus OCT RNFL data is to classify an eye as glaucomatous if the overall, inferior quadrant, or superior quadrant RNFL thickness average is below normal.

Methods - A detailed dysmorphology evaluation, history of prenatal alcohol exposure, and 3D facial laser scans were obtained from 149 individuals (86 FAS; 63 Control) recruited from two study sites (Cape Town, South Africa and Helsinki, Finland). Computer graphics, machine learning, and pattern recognition techniques were used to automatically identify a set of facial features that best discriminated individuals with FAS from controls in each sample. Results - An automated feature detection and analysis technique was developed and applied to the two study populations. A unique set of facial regions and features were identified for each population that accurately discriminated FAS and control faces without any human intervention. Conclusion - Our results demonstrate that computer algorithms can be used to automatically detect facial features that can discriminate FAS and control faces.

In this scheme, we have exploited the capabilities of machine learning (ML) approaches for nonlinearly classifying the embedded bits. The proposed technique adaptively modifies the decoding strategy in view of the anticipated attack. The extraction of bits is considered as a binary classification problem. Conventionally, a hard decoder is used with the assumption that the underlying distribution of the discrete cosine transform coefficients do not change appreciably. However, in case of attacks related to real world applications of watermarking, such as JPEG compression in case of shared medical image warehouses, these coefficients are heavily altered. The sufficient statistics corresponding to the maximum likelihood based decoding process, which are considered as features in the proposed scheme, overlap at the receiving end, and a simple hard decoder fails to classify them properly. In contrast, our proposed ML decoding model has attained highest accuracy on the test data. Experimental results show that through its training phase, our proposed decoding scheme is able to cope with the alterations in features introduced by a new attack. Consequently, it achieves promising improvement in terms of bit correct ratio in comparison to the existing decoding scheme. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bernard, M; Boyer, L; Habrard, A; Sebban, M				Bernard, Marc; Boyer, Laurent; Habrard, Amaury; Sebban, Marc			Learning probabilistic models of tree edit distance	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						tree edit distance; EM algorithm; generative model; discriminative model	HANDWRITTEN CHARACTER-RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM	Nowadays, there is a growing interest in machine learning and pattern recognition for tree-structured data. Trees actually provide a suitable structural representation to deal with complex tasks such as web information extraction, RNA secondary structure prediction, computer music, or conversion of semi-structured data (e.g. XML documents). Many applications in these domains require the calculation of similarities over pairs of trees. In this context, the tree edit distance (ED) has been subject of investigations for many years in order to improve its computational efficiency. However, used in its classical form, the tree ED needs a priori fixed edit costs which are often difficult to tune, that leaves little room for tackling complex problems. In this paper, to overcome this drawback, we focus on the automatic learning of a non-parametric stochastic tree ED. More precisely, we are interested in two kinds of probabilistic approaches. The first one builds a generative model of the tree ED from a joint distribution over the edit operations, while the second works from a conditional distribution providing then a discriminative model. To tackle these tasks, we present an adaptation of the expectation-maxin-tization algorithm for leaming these distributions over the primitive edit costs. Two experiments are conducted. The first is achieved on artificial data and confirms the interest to learn a tree ED rather than a priori imposing edit costs; The second is applied to a pattern recognition task aiming to classify handwritten digits.

Several manifold learning algorithms are applied to extract the intrinsic features of different prototypes in high dimensional space by preserving the local geometric characteristics. However, due to the locality geometry preservation, these manifold learning methods, including locally linear embedding (LLE), are sensitive to noise. To solve the noisy manifold learning problem, this paper proposes a Neighbor Smoothing Embedding (NSE) for noisy points sampled from a nonlinear manifold. Based on LLE and local linear surface estimator, the NSE smoothes the neighbors of each manifold data and then computes the reconstruction matrix of the projections on the principal surface. Experiments on synthetic data as well as real world patterns demonstrate that the suggested algorithm can efficiently maintain an accurate low-dimensional representation of the noisy manifold data with less distortion, and give higher average classification rates compared to others.

Such association metrics, despite their central role in gene network inference and machine learning, have largely ignored the impact of dynamics or variation in mRNA stability. Here we introduce a simple, but powerful, new similarity metric called lead-lag R(2) that successfully accounts for the properties of gene dynamics, including varying mRNA degradation and delays. Using yeast cell-cycle time-series gene expression data, we demonstrate that the predictive power of lead-lag R(2) for the identification of co-regulated genes is significantly higher than that of standard similarity measures, thus allowing the selection of a large number of entirely new putatively co-regulated genes. Furthermore, the lead-lag metric can also be used to uncover the relationship between gene expression time-series and the dynamics of formation of multiple protein complexes. Remarkably, we found a high lead-lag R(2) value among genes coding for a transient complex.

J	Shazman, S; Mandel-Gutfreund, Y				Shazman, Shula; Mandel-Gutfreund, Yael			Classifying RNA-Binding Proteins Based on Electrostatic Properties	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; GENE-EXPRESSION; STRUCTURAL INFORMATION; EFFICIENT PREDICTION; RECOGNITION MOTIF; PRIMARY SEQUENCE; DNA; SITES; CLASSIFICATION; SYNTHETASE	Protein structure can provide new insight into the biological function of a protein and can enable the design of better experiments to learn its biological roles. Moreover, deciphering the interactions of a protein with other molecules can contribute to the understanding of the protein's function within cellular processes. In this study, we apply a machine learning approach for classifying RNA-binding proteins based on their three-dimensional structures. The method is based on characterizing unique properties of electrostatic patches on the protein surface. Using an ensemble of general protein features and specific properties extracted from the electrostatic patches, we have trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish RNA-binding proteins from other positively charged proteins that do not bind nucleic acids. Specifically, the method was applied on proteins possessing the RNA recognition motif (RRM) and successfully classified RNA-binding proteins from RRM domains involved in protein-protein interactions. Overall the method achieves 88% accuracy in classifying RNA-binding proteins, yet it cannot distinguish RNA from DNA binding proteins. Nevertheless, by applying a multiclass SVM approach we were able to classify the RNA-binding proteins based on their RNA targets, specifically, whether they bind a ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a transfer RNA (tRNA), or messenger RNA (mRNA). Finally, we present here an innovative approach that does not rely on sequence or structural homology and could be applied to identify novel RNA-binding proteins with unique folds and/or binding motifs.

J	Taylor, RC; Acquaah-Mensah, G; Singhal, M; Malhotra, D; Biswal, S				Taylor, Ronald C.; Acquaah-Mensah, George; Singhal, Mudita; Malhotra, Deepti; Biswal, Shyam			Network Inference Algorithms Elucidate Nrf2 Regulation of Mouse Lung Oxidative Stress	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							ANTIOXIDANT RESPONSE ELEMENT; GENE-EXPRESSION; MEDIATED EXPRESSION; PROTEIN; DJ-1; GLUTATHIONYLATION; ACTIVATION; DISEASES; ALS2; DEGENERATION	A variety of cardiovascular, neurological, and neoplastic conditions have been associated with oxidative stress, i.e., conditions under which levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are elevated over significant periods. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) regulates the transcription of several gene products involved in the protective response to oxidative stress. The transcriptional regulatory and signaling relationships linking gene products involved in the response to oxidative stress are, currently, only partially resolved. Microarray data constitute RNA abundance measures representing gene expression patterns. In some cases, these patterns can identify the molecular interactions of gene products. They can be, in effect, proxies for protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. Traditional techniques used for clustering coregulated genes on high-throughput gene arrays are rarely capable of distinguishing between direct transcriptional regulatory interactions and indirect ones. In this study, newly developed information-theoretic algorithms that employ the concept of mutual information were used: the Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks (ARACNE), and Context Likelihood of Relatedness (CLR). These algorithms captured dependencies in the gene expression profiles of the mouse lung, allowing the regulatory effect of Nrf2 in response to oxidative stress to be determined more precisely. In addition, a characterization of promoter sequences of Nrf2 regulatory targets was conducted using a Support Vector Machine classification algorithm to corroborate ARACNE and CLR predictions. Inferred networks were analyzed, compared, and integrated using the Collective Analysis of Biological Interaction Networks (CABIN) plug-in of Cytoscape. Using the two network inference algorithms and one machine learning algorithm, a number of both previously known and novel targets of Nrf2 transcriptional activation were identified. Genes predicted as novel Nrf2 targets include Atf1, Srxn1, Prnp, Sod2, Als2, Nfkbib, and Ppp1r15b. Furthermore, microarray and quantitative RT-PCR experiments following cigarette-smoke-induced oxidative stress in Nrf2(+/+) and Nrf2(-/-) mouse lung affirmed many of the predictions made. Several new potential feed-forward regulatory loops involving Nrf2, Nqo1, Srxn1, Prdx1, Als2, Atf1, Sod1, and Park7 were predicted. This work shows the promise of network inference algorithms operating on high-throughput gene expression data in identifying transcriptional regulatory and other signaling relationships implicated in mammalian disease.

J	Wang, M; Yang, XG; Xue, Y				Wang, Min; Yang, Xue-Gang; Xue, Ying			Identifying hERG potassium channel inhibitors by machine learning methods	QSAR & COMBINATORIAL SCIENCE			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; QT INTERVAL PROLONGATION; CARDIAC-ARRHYTHMIA; CHEMICAL-COMPOUNDS; K+ CHANNEL; PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; BLOCKERS; MODEL; QSAR	The human Ether-a-Go-Go-Related Gene (hERG) potassium ion channel plays a crucial role in cardiac repolarization. The inhibition of this channel by marketed drug may prolong the length of time between the start of Q wave and end of the T wave oil an electrocardiogram (QT interval) and then possibly leads to fatal cardiac arrhythmia. Therefore, it is vital to predict the potential hERG inhibitors in early stages of drug discovery. This work explored the identifying of hERG inhibitors by different machine learning methods including C4.5 Decision Tree (C4.5 DT), multilayer perceptron, Radial Basis Function Network (RBFNetwork), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), a feature selection method, was used to select molecular descriptors appropriate for distinguishing hERG inhibitors and noninhibitors. For Data_91 classification system with 91 compounds., the prediction accuracies of those methods are 72.1 - 92.3% for hERG inhibitors and 81.7 - 98.1% for noninhibitors in a five-fold crossvalidation calculation. For an independent validation set of 47 compounds of Data 91, these methods gave an overall accuracy of 72.3-80.9% using the selected descriptors. This suggests that the combination of the machine learning methods and the feature selection method can provide an effective way to filter the hERG inhibitors in the drug discovery process.

A GCHP system is a multi-variable system that is hard to model by conventional methods. As regards the SVM, it has a superior capability for generalization, and this capability is independent of the dimensionality of the input data. In this study, a SVM based method was intended to adopt GCHP system for efficient modeling. The Lin-kernel SVM method was quite efficient in modeling purposes and did not require a pre-knowledge about the system. The performance of the proposed methodology was evaluated by using several statistical validation parameters. It is found that the root-mean squared (RMS) value is 0.002722, the coefficient of multiple determinations (R-2) value is 0.999999, coefficient of variation (cov) value is 0.077295, and mean error function (MEF) value is 0.507437 for the proposed Lin-kernel SVM method. The optimum parameters of the SVM method were determined by using a greedy search algorithm. This search algorithm was effective for obtaining the optimum parameters. The simulation results show that the SVM is a good method for prediction of the COP of the GCHP system. The computation of SVM model is faster compared with other machine learning techniques (artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)); because there are fewer free parameters and only support vectors (only a fraction of all data) are used in the generalization process.

Methods: A total of 857 CLSM tumour images including 408 benign nevi and 449 melanoma images was evaluated. Image analysis was based on features of the wavelet transform. For classification purposes we used a classification tree software (CART). Moreover, automated image analysis results were compared with the prediction success of an independent human observer. Results: CART analysis of the whole set of CLSM tumour images correctly classified 97.55% and 96.32% of melanoma and nevi images. In contrast, sensitivity and specificity of 85.52% and 80.15% could be reached by the human observer. When the image set was randomly divided into a learning (67% of the images) and a test set (33% of the images), overall 97.31% and 81.03% of the tumour images in the learning and test set could be classified correctly by the CART procedure. Conclusion: Provided automated decisions can be used as a second opinion. This can be valuable in assisting diagnostic decisions in this new and exciting imaging technique.

Machine-learning classification of non-melanoma skin cancers from image features obtained by optical coherence tomography	SKIN RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						optical coherence tomography; non-melanoma skin cancer; actinic keratosis; basal cell carcinoma; non-parametric machine learning algorithms	BASAL-CELL CARCINOMA; IN-VIVO	Background/purpose: A number of publications have suggested that optical coherence tomography (OCT) has the potential for non-invasive diagnosis of skin cancer. Currently, individual diagnostic features do not appear sufficiently discriminatory. The combined use of several features may however be useful. Methods: OCT is based on infrared light, photonics and fibre optics. The system used has an axial resolution of 10 mu m, lateral 20 mu m. We investigated the combined use of several OCT features from basal cell carcinomas (BCC) and actinic keratosis (AK). We studied BCC (41) and AK (37) lesions in 34 consecutive patients. The diagnostic accuracy of the combined features was assessed using a machine-learning tool. Results: OCT images of normal skin typically exhibit a layered structure, not present in the lesions imaged. BCCs showed dark globules corresponding to basaloid islands and AKs showed white dots and streaks corresponding to hyperkeratosis. Differences in OCT morphology were not sufficient to differentiate BCC from AK by the naked eye. Machine-learning analysis suggests that when a multiplicity of features is used, correct classification accuracies of 73% (AK) and 81% (BCC) are achieved. Conclusion: The data extracted from individual OCT scans included both quantitative and qualitative measures, and at the current level of resolution, these single factors appear insufficient for diagnosis. Our approach suggests that it may be possible to extract diagnostic data from the overall architecture of the OCT images with a reasonable diagnostic accuracy when used in combination.

J	Wang, L; Li, ZF; He, Y; Liu, F				Wang Li; Li Zeng-fang; He Yong; Liu Fe			Fast detection of sugar content in fruit vinegar using NIR spectroscopy	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS			Chinese	Article						NIR spectroscopy; fruit vinegar; sugar content; principal component analysis; least squares support vector machines	NEAR-INFRARED-SPECTRA; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; VARIETIES; DISCRIMINATION; RECOGNITION; QUALITY	For the fast and exact detection of sugar content of fruit vinegar, near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy technique combined with least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) algorithm was used to build the prediction model of sugar content in the present research. NIR spectroscopy is a nondestructive, fast and accurate technique for the measurement of chemical components based on overtone and combination bands of specific functional groups. The pivotal step for spectroscopy technique is how to extract quantitative data from mass spectral data and eliminate spectral interferences. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a method which has been Widely used in the spectroscopic analysis, and LS-SVM is a new data mining algorithm developed from the machine learning community. In the present study, they were used for the spectroscopic analysis. First, the near infrared transmittance spectra of three hundred samples were obtained, then PCA was applied for reducing the dimensionality of the original spectra, and six principal components (PCs) were selected according the accumulative reliabilities (AR). The six PCs could be used to replace the complex spectral data. The three hundred samples were randomly separated into calibration set and validation set. I-east squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) algorithm was used to build prediction model of sugar content based on the calibration set, then this model was employed for the prediction of the validation set. Correlation coefficient (r) of prediction and root mean square error prediction (RMSEP) were used as the evaluation standards, and the results indicated that the r and RMSEP for the prediction of sugar content were 0.993 9 and 0.363, respectively. Hence, PCA and LS-SVM model with high prediction precision could be applied to the determination of sugar content in fruit vinegar.

A Reinforcement Learning approach to evaluating state representations in spoken dialogue systems	SPEECH COMMUNICATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	INTERSPEECH 2006 Conference	SEP   17, 2006	Pittsburgh, PA			spoken dialogue systems; evaluation; adaptive systems; Reinforcement Learning; Markov decision processes; feature selection; machine learning; affect; tutoring systems		Although dialogue systems have been all area of research for decades, finding accurate ways of evaluating different systems is still a very active subfield since many leading methods, such as task completion rate or user satisfaction, capture different aspects of the end-to-end human-computer dialogue interaction. In this work, we step back the focus from the complete evaluation of a dialogue system to presenting metrics for evaluating one internal component of a dialogue system: its dialogue manager. Specifically, we investigate how to create and evaluate the best state space representations for a Reinforcement Learning model to learn an optimal dialogue control strategy. We present three metrics for evaluating the impact of different state models and demonstrate their use oil the domain of a spoken dialogue tutoring system by comparing the relative utility of adding three features to a model of user, or student, state. The motivation for this work is that if one knows which features are best to use, one can construct a better dialogue manager, and thus better performing dialogue systems. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This is the fundamental task of dialogue management. Researchers have recently pursued methods for automating the design of spoken dialogue management using machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning. In this paper, we discuss how dialogue management is handled in industry and critically evaluate to what extent current state-of-the-art machine learning methods can be of practical benefit to application developers who are deploying commercial production systems. In examining the strengths and weaknesses of these methods, we highlight what academic researchers need to know about commercial deployment if they are to influence the way industry designs and practices dialogue management.

J	Pozdnoukhov, A; Kanevski, M				Pozdnoukhov, Alexei; Kanevski, Mikhail			Multi-scale support vector algorithms for hot spot detection and modelling	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT			English	Article						machine learning; support vector regression; multi-scale environmental modelling; spatial mapping; kernel methods	REGRESSION; CLASSIFICATION; MACHINES; TUTORIAL; NETWORK	The algorithmic approach to data modelling has developed rapidly these last years, in particular methods based on data mining and machine learning have been used in a growing number of applications. These methods follow a data-driven methodology, aiming at providing the best possible generalization and predictive abilities instead of concentrating on the properties of the data model. One of the most successful groups of such methods is known as Support Vector algorithms. Following the fruitful developments in applying Support Vector algorithms to spatial data, this paper introduces a new extension of the traditional support vector regression (SVR) algorithm. This extension allows for the simultaneous modelling of environmental data at several spatial scales. The joint influence of environmental processes presenting different patterns at different scales is here learned automatically from data, providing the optimum mixture of short and large-scale models. The method is adaptive to the spatial scale of the data. With this advantage, it can provide efficient means to model local anomalies that may typically arise in situations at an early phase of an environmental emergency. However, the proposed approach still requires some prior knowledge on the possible existence of such short-scale patterns. This is a possible limitation of the method for its implementation in early warning systems. The purpose of this paper is to present the multi-scale SVR model and to illustrate its use with an application to the mapping of Cs-137 activity given the measurements taken in the region of Briansk following the Chernobyl accident.

Developing a generalizable detector of when students game the system	USER MODELING AND USER-ADAPTED INTERACTION			English	Article						gaming the system; latent response models; cognitive tutors; behavior detection; machine learning; generalizable models; student modeling; interactive learning environments		Some students, when working in interactive learning environments, attempt to "game the system", attempting to succeed in the environment by exploiting properties of the system rather than by learning the material and trying to use that knowledge to answer correctly. In this paper, we present a system that can accurately detect whether a student is gaming the system, within a Cognitive Tutor mathematics curricula. Our detector also distinguishes between two distinct types of gaming which are associated with different learning outcomes. We explore this detector's generalizability, and find that it transfers successfully to both new students and new tutor lessons.	[Baker, Ryan S.

J	Schmidt, K; Behrens, T; Scholten, T				Schmidt, Karsten; Behrens, Thorsten; Scholten, Thomas			Instance selection and classification tree analysis for large spatial datasets in digital soil mapping	GEODERMA			English	Article						digital soil mapping; classification trees; instance selection; grid learning; pruning; random sampling; spatial data mining	LAND-COVER; LANDSCAPE; PREDICTION; SYSTEM; STRATEGIES; RULES; MAP	Digital soil mapping is currently experiencing a tremendous increase in available environmental covariates and resolution for spatial soil predictions, resulting in computational problems in terms of limited data handling capabilities of machine learning approaches. This is of particular importance when gridded spatial soil class maps are used as a basis for predictions containing large amounts of redundant instances and noisy information. In this study we systematically analyze the effect of instance selection, which aims at reducing sample size, while preserving or even increasing prediction accuracy. On a soil class dataset with 95,000 instances we tested two sampling approaches in relation to parameter settings of decision tree based learning: proportional and disproportional stratified random sampling. An automated grid search approach was used to find the best performing parameter settings of the decision tree. The results show that an appropriate sampling method in combination with a grid search method returns better results than those obtained when grid learning is applied without instance selection. Instance selection increases prediction accuracy especially if the frequency distribution of the soil classes is low compared to the surrounding area. However, instance selection does not help in pedological interpretation. Nevertheless, it is a valuable pre-processing method to handle large spatial high resolution datasets in digital soil class prediction in terms of accuracy and computational costs. As suggested on the basis of the results of this study, spatially constrained instance selection as well as boundary based digital soil mapping in terms of soil taxonomic contrast should be investigated in future pedometric research.

J	Zhou, C; Bowler, LD; Feng, JF				Zhou, Cong; Bowler, Lucas D.; Feng, Jianfeng			A machine learning approach to explore the spectra intensity pattern of peptides using tandem mass spectrometry data	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							INDUCED DISSOCIATION SPECTRA; PROTEIN IDENTIFICATION; LOW-ENERGY; SEQUENCE DATABASES; STATISTICAL CHARACTERIZATION; PROTONATED PEPTIDES; FRAGMENTATION; PREDICTION; CLEAVAGE; VALIDATION	Background: A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in gas-phase fragmentation of peptides is essential for the development of more reliable algorithms for high-throughput protein identification using mass spectrometry ( MS). Current methodologies depend predominantly on the use of derived m/z values of fragment ions, and, the knowledge provided by the intensity information present in MS/MS spectra has not been fully exploited. Indeed spectrum intensity information is very rarely utilized in the algorithms currently in use for high-throughput protein identification. Results: In this work, a Bayesian neural network approach is employed to analyze ion intensity information present in 13878 different MS/MS spectra. The influence of a library of 35 features on peptide fragmentation is examined under different proton mobility conditions. Useful rules involved in peptide fragmentation are found and subsets of features which have significant influence on fragmentation pathway of peptides are characterised. An intensity model is built based on the selected features and the model can make an accurate prediction of the intensity patterns for given MS/MS spectra. The predictions include not only the mean values of spectra intensity but also the variances that can be used to tolerate noises and system biases within experimental MS/MS spectra. Conclusion: The intensity patterns of fragmentation spectra are informative and can be used to analyze the influence of various characteristics of fragmented peptides on their fragmentation pathway. The features with significant influence can be used in turn to predict spectra intensities. Such information can help develop more reliable algorithms for peptide and protein identification.

Results: This paper presents a machine learning strategy to study and validate essential enzymes of a metabolic network. Each single enzyme was characterized by its local network topology, gene homologies and co-expression, and flux balance analyses. A machine learning system was trained to distinguish between essential and non-essential reactions. It was validated by a comprehensive experimental dataset, which consists of the phenotypic outcomes from single knockout mutants of Escherichia coli (KEIO collection). We yielded very reliable results with high accuracy (93%) and precision (90%). We show that topologic, genomic and transcriptomic features describing the network are sufficient for defining the essentiality of a reaction. These features do not substantially depend on specific media conditions and enabled us to apply our approach also for less specific media conditions, like the lysogeny broth rich medium. Conclusion: Our analysis is feasible to validate experimental knockout data of high throughput screens, can be used to improve flux balance analyses and supports experimental knockout screens to define drug targets.

Hyperbolic SOM-based clustering of DNA fragment features for taxonomic visualization and classification	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							GENOMIC SIGNATURE; SEQUENCES; EXPLORATION; PHYLOGENY	Motivation: Modern high-throughput sequencing technologies enable the simultaneous analysis of organisms in an environment. The analysis of species diversity and the binning of DNA fragments of non-sequenced species for assembly are two major challenges in sequence analysis. To achieve reasonable binnings and classifications, DNA fragment structure has to be represented appropriately, so it can be processed by machine learning algorithms. Results: Hierarchically growing hyperbolic Self-Organizing maps (H (2)SOMs) are trained to cluster small variable-length DNA fragments (0.250 kb) of 350 prokaryotic organisms at six taxonomic ranks Superkingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Genus and Species in the Tree of Life. DNA fragments are mapped to three different types of feature vectors based on the genomic signature: basic features, features considering the importance of oligonucleotide patterns as well as contrast enhanced features. The H (2)SOM classifier achieves high classification rates while at the same time its visualization allows further insights into the projected data and has the potential to support binning of short sequence reads, because DNA fragments can be grouped into phylogenetic groups.

In addition, non-contiguous retention data obtained with different LC-MS instruments or in different laboratories must be aligned to confirm and utilize rapidly accumulating published proteomics data. Results: We have developed a new alignment method for peptide retention times based on linear solvent strength (LSS) theory. We found that log k(0) (logarithm of retention factor for a given organic solvent) in the LSS theory can be utilized as a universal retention index of peptides (RIP) that is independent of LC gradients, and depends solely on the constituents of the mobile phase and the stationary phases. We introduced a machine learning-based scheme to optimize the conversion function of gradient retention times (t(g)) to log k(0). Using the optimized function, t(g) values obtained with different LC-MS systems can be directly compared with each other on the RIP scale. In an examination of Arabidopsis proteomic data, the vast majority of retention time variability was removed, and five datasets obtained with various LC-MS systems were successfully aligned on the RIP scale.

MRI scans of 37 patients with AD and 37 age-matched cognitively normal elderly individuals, as well as 12 patients with FTD and 12 age-matched cognitively normal elderly individuals, were analyzed using voxel-based analysis and high-dimensional pattern classification. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of spatial patterns of regional brain atrophy found to be characteristic of AD and FTD were determined via cross-validation and via split-sample methods. Complex spatial patterns of relatively reduced brain volumes were identified, including temporal, orbitofrontal, parietal and cingulate regions, which were predominantly characteristic of either AD or FTD. These patterns provided 100% diagnostic accuracy, when used to separate AD or FTD from healthy controls. The ability to correctly distinguish AD from FTD averaged 84.3%. All estimates of diagnostic accuracy were determined via cross-validation. In conclusion, AD-and FTD-specific patterns of brain atrophy can be detected with high accuracy using high-dimensional pattern classification of MRI scans obtained in a typical clinical setting.

A mitochondrial protein compendium elucidates complex I disease biology	CELL			English	Article							SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION; GENOME; MOUSE; YEAST; SEQUENCE; DYSFUNCTION; EXPRESSION; EVOLUTION; SUBUNITS; MUSCLE	Mitochondria are complex organelles whose dysfunction underlies a broad spectrum of human diseases. Identifying all of the proteins resident in this organelle and understanding how they integrate into pathways represent major challenges in cell biology. Toward this goal, we performed mass spectrometry, GFP tagging, and machine learning to create a mitochondrial compendium of 1098 genes and their protein expression across 14 mouse tissues. We link poorly characterized proteins in this inventory to known mitochondrial pathways by virtue of shared evolutionary history. Using this approach, we predict 19 proteins to be important for the function of complex I (CI) of the electron transport chain. Wevalidate a subset of these predictions using RNAi, including C8orf38, which we further show harbors an inherited mutation in a lethal, infantile CI deficiency. Our results have important implications for understanding CI function and pathogenesis and, more generally, illustrate how our compendium can serve as a foundation for systematic investigations of mitochondria.

Gaertn.) tree	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Ecological Modelling	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2006	Yamaguchi, JAPAN			wetland forest; black alder; forest growth model; feature selection; machine learning; STELLA model	NITROGEN-FIXATION; GLUTINOSA; PHOTOSYNTHESIS	Nowadays it is extremely important to understand ecosystem function and its dynamics to predict future changes and consequently to perform appropriate measures. Hydromeliorations and subsequent decrease in groundwater table are thought to be a major reason for a decline in the vitality of black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.) wetland forests in Northeastern Slovenia. In this study radial increments of trees were used as indicators of black alder forest function and its disturbances. The aim of the study was to build a model of annual radial increments of black alder trees, to use this model to identify environmental attributes that most importantly affect ecosystem's function and to predict changes in the forest function under different scenarios of environmental conditions in the future. The model was induced with a machine learning algorithm CIPER and it was based on the data about site conditions and applied management measures in the past 35 years. Groundwater levels in combination with the duration of sun radiation were identified as the most important environmental attributes affecting annual radial increments. Radial increments were the lowest in very wet and cloudy years. On the other hand, radial increments were decreased under drought stress as well. Changes in groundwater level and in duration of sun radiation, as well as increased oscillations of groundwater level, all cause important increase in oscillations of modeled radial increments, indicating higher stress. Radial increments were further negatively affected by late white frosts in the spring. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Among other things, they allow us to investigate the effects of using different crop varieties, cropping systems and farming practices on the levels of adventitious presence of GM material in conventional crops. We propose to use machine learning methods to analyse the output of simulation models to learn co-existence rules that directly link the above mentioned causes and effects. The outputs of the GENESYS model, designed to study the co-existence of conventional and GM oilseed rape crops, were analysed by using the machine learning methods of regression tree induction and relational decision tree induction. Co-existence and adventitious presence of GM material were studied in several contexts, including gene flow between pairs of fields, the interactions of this process with farming practices (cropping systems), and gene flow in the context of an entire field plan. Accurate models were learned, which also make use of the relational aspects of a field plan, using information on the neighboring fields of a field, and the farming practices applied in it. The use of relational decision tree induction to analyse the results of simulation models is a novel approach and holds the promise of learning more general co-existence rules by allowing us to vary the target field within a chosen field plan, as well as to consider completely different field plans at the same time.

A pool containing more than 6,000 barks, which were recorded in six different communicative situations was used as the sound sample. The algorithm's task was to learn which acoustic features of the barks, which were recorded in different contexts and from different individuals, could be distinguished from another. The program conducted this task by analyzing barks emitted in previously identified contexts by identified dogs. After the best feature set had been obtained (with which the highest identification rate was achieved), the efficiency of the algorithm was tested in a classification task in which unknown barks were analyzed. The recognition rates we found were highly above chance level: the algorithm could categorize the barks according to their recorded situation with an efficiency of 43% and with an efficiency of 52% of the barking individuals. These findings suggest that dog barks have context-specific and individual-specific acoustic features. In our opinion, this machine learning method may provide an efficient tool for analyzing acoustic data in various behavioral studies.

An alternative approach for the prediction of significant wave heights based on classification and regression trees	APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH			English	Article						Wave prediction; Data mining; Machine learning; Classification; Decision trees; Regression trees; C5 algorithm; CART	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; WEST-COAST; PARAMETERS	In this study, the performances of classification and regression trees for the prediction of significant wave heights were investigated. The data set used in this study is comprised of 5 years of wave and wind data gathered from a deep water location in Lake Michigan. Training and testing data include wind speed and wind direction as the input variables and significant wave heights (H(s)) as the output variable. To build the classification trees, a C5 algorithm was invoked. Then, significant wave heights for the whole data set were grouped into wave height bins of 0.25 m and a class was assigned to each bin. For evaluation of the developed model, the index of each predicted class was compared with that of the observed data. The CART algorithm was employed for building and evaluating regression trees. Results of decision trees were then compared with those of artificial neural networks (ANNs). The error statistics of decision trees and ANNs were nearly similar. Results indicate that the decision tree, as an efficient novel approach with an acceptable range of error, can be used successfully for prediction of H(s). It is argued that the advantage of decision trees is that, in contrast to neural networks, they represent rules. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods and materials: The system consists of a software application and a knowledge base of observation data, parameters, and results. The data were obtained from anal swabs for the diagnosis of enterobiasis, from questionnaires for children's parents, observations in nursery schools and interviews with supervisors of the groups. The total number of studied children was 1905. Ten parallel ML processes were conducted to find the best set of weights for features and cases. Results: The best goodness-of-fit according to the true skill statistic (TSS) was 0.381. Approximately equal fit can be reached using different sets of features. Cross-validation TSS of logit-regression and classification tree models was <0.24. In addition to the higher prediction fit, Constud is not sensitive to missing values of explanatory variables. The overall prevalence of enterobiasis was 22.8%; the mean of risk estimations was 47.8%. The overestimation of the prevalence in risk calculations can be interpreted as an inefficacy of the single swab analysis, or may be due to the relative constancy of the risk compared to the lability of infection and the applied objective function. Conclusions: In addition to the higher prediction fit, Constud is not sensitive to missing values of explanatory variables. The main risk factors of enterobiasis among nursery school children were the child's age, communication partners, habits, and cleanness of rooms in the nursery school. Mixed age groups at nursery schools also enhance the risk. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kim, H; Soibelman, L; Grobler, F				Kim, Hyunioo; Soibelman, Lucio; Grobler, Francois			Factor selection for delay analysis using Knowledge Discovery in Databases	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						knowledge Discovery in Databases; construction delay; statistics; machine learning; factor selection	CONSTRUCTION; EXAMPLE	Today's construction project has become a very complex, high-risk, multiparty endeavor. Construction projects are composed of many interrelated elements of labor, cost, material, schedule, and other resources, making it difficult to discern which factors were the main causes for delay on a given project. Were all relevant factors to be considered, it would become an overwhelming task. On the other hand, it would be very difficult to know on which factors to focus if only a limited number of factors were to be considered. This paper presents a methodology for factor selection; identifying which factors in an on-going construction project contribute most to the experienced delays. Factor selection is defined as the process of finding relevant factors among a large set of original attributes with the objective of best representing the original dataset and utilizes Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), which is a data analysis process to discover useful knowledge in a large database. A specific construction project has been analyzed to identify main factors of construction delays through the process of statistical measurements and machine learning algorithms.

The Sleipnir library for computational functional genomics	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							BIOLOGICAL DATA; INTEGRATION; CONTEXT	Motivation: Biological data generation has accelerated to the point where hundreds or thousands of whole-genome datasets of various types are available for many model organisms. This wealth of data can lead to valuable biological insights when analyzed in an integrated manner, but the computational challenge of managing such large data collections is substantial. In order to mine these data efficiently, it is necessary to develop methods that use storage, memory and processing resources carefully. Results: The Sleipnir C library implements a variety of machine learning and data manipulation algorithms with a focus on heterogeneous data integration and efficiency for very large biological data collections. Sleipnir allows microarray processing, functional ontology mining, clustering, Bayesian learning and inference and support vector machine tasks to be performed for heterogeneous data on scales not previously practical. In addition to the library, which can easily be integrated into new computational systems, prebuilt tools are provided to perform a variety of common tasks. Many tools are multithreaded for parallelization in desktop or high-throughput computing environments, and most tasks can be performed in minutes for hundreds of datasets using a standard personal computer.

J	Cao, YQ; Jiang, T; Girke, T				Cao, Yiqun; Jiang, Tao; Girke, Thomas			A maximum common substructure-based algorithm for searching and predicting drug-like compounds	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th ISMB Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology	JUL 19-23, 2008	Toronto, CANADA	ISMB			SUBGRAPH; GRAPHS; RETRIEVAL; DATABASE	Motivation: The prediction of biologically active compounds is of great importance for high-throughput screening (HTS) approaches in drug discovery and chemical genomics. Many computational methods in this area focus on measuring the structural similarities between chemical structures. However, traditional similarity measures are often too rigid or consider only global similarities between structures. The maximum common substructure (MCS) approach provides a more promising and flexible alternative for predicting bioactive compounds. Results: In this article, a new backtracking algorithm for MCS is proposed and compared to global similarity measurements. Our algorithm provides high flexibility in the matching process, and it is very efficient in identifying local structural similarities. To predict and cluster biologically active compounds more efficiently, the concept of basis compounds is proposed that enables researchers to easily combine the MCS-based and traditional similarity measures with modern machine learning techniques. Support vector machines (SVMs) are used to test how the MCS-based similarity measure and the basis compound vectorization method perform on two empirically tested datasets. The test results show that MCS complements the well-known atom pair descriptor-based similarity measure. By combining these two measures, our SVM-based model predicts the biological activities of chemical compounds with higher specificity and sensitivity.

In this work, we present RAF (RNA Alignment and Folding), an efficient algorithm for simultaneous alignment and consensus folding of unaligned RNA sequences. Algorithmically, RAF exploits sparsity in the set of likely pairing and alignment candidates for each nucleotide (as identified by the CONTRAfold or CONTRAlign programs) to achieve an effectively quadratic running time for simultaneous pairwise alignment and folding. RAFs fast sparse dynamic programming, in turn, serves as the inference engine within a discriminative machine learning algorithm for parameter estimation. Results: In cross-validated benchmark tests, RAF achieves accuracies equaling or surpassing the current best approaches for RNA multiple sequence secondary structure prediction. However, RAF requires nearly an order of magnitude less time than other simultaneous folding and alignment methods, thus making it especially appropriate for high-throughput studies.

Detection of IUPAC and IUPAC-like chemical names	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th ISMB Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology	JUL 19-23, 2008	Toronto, CANADA	ISMB			IDENTIFICATION; TEXT; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION; CHEMISTRY; PROTEIN; GENE	Motivation: Chemical compounds like small signal molecules or other biological active chemical substances are an important entity class in life science publications and patents. Several representations and nomenclatures for chemicals like SMILES, InChI, IUPAC or trivial names exist. Only SMILES and InChI names allow a direct structure search, but in biomedical texts trivial names and Iupac like names are used more frequent. While trivial names can be found with a dictionary-based approach and in such a way mapped to their corresponding structures, it is not possible to enumerate all IUPAC names. In this work, we present a new machine learning approach based on conditional random fields (CRF) to find mentions of IUPAC and IUPAC-like names in scientific text as well as its evaluation and the conversion rate with available name-to-structure tools. Results: We present an IUPAC name recognizer with an F(1) measure of 85.6% on a MEDLINE corpus. The evaluation of different CRF orders and offset conjunction orders demonstrates the importance of these parameters. An evaluation of hand-selected patent sections containing large enumerations and terms with mixed nomenclature shows a good performance on these cases (F(1) measure 81.5%). Remaining recognition problems are to detect correct borders of the typically long terms, especially when occurring in parentheses or enumerations. We demonstrate the scalability of our implementation by providing results from a full MEDLINE run.

Recent studies have shown that genotypic information might not be sufficient for the design of therapies and that other clinical and demographical factors may play a role in therapy failure. This study is designed to assess the improvement in prediction achieved when such information is taken into account. We use these factors to generate a prediction engine using a variety of machine learning methods and to determine which clinical conditions are most misleading in terms of predicting the outcome of a therapy. Results: Three different machine learning techniques were used: generative-discriminative method, regression with derived evolutionary features, and regression with a mixture of effects. All three methods had similar performances with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.77. A set of three similar engines limited to genotypic information only achieved an AUC of 0.75. A straightforward combination of the three engines consistently improves the prediction, with significantly better prediction when the full set of features is employed. The combined engine improves on predictions obtained from an online state-of-the-art resistance interpretation system. Moreover, engines tend to disagree more on the outcome of failure therapies than regarding successful ones. Careful analysis of the differences between the engines revealed those mutations and drugs most closely associated with uncertainty of the therapy outcome.

Computational intelligence (CI) approaches such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy systems and evolutionary computation are being used with increasing frequency to contend with this problem, in light of noise, non-linearity and temporal dynamics in the data. Such methods can be used to develop robust models of processes either on their own or in combination with standard statistical approaches. This is especially true for database mining, where modeling is a key component of scientific understanding. This review provides an introduction to current CI methods, their application to biological problems, and concludes with a commentary about the anticipated impact of these approaches in bioinformatics.

In vitro methods to screen for PXR agonists are used widely. In the current study, computational models for human PXR activators and PXR nonactivators were developed using recursive partitioning (RP), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms with, VolSurf descriptors. Following 10-fold randomization, the models correctly predicted 82.6-98.9% of activators and 62.0-88.6% of nonactivators. The models were validated using separate test sets. The overall (n = 15) test set prediction accuracy for PXR activators with RP, RF, and SVM PXR models is 80-93.3%, representing an improvement over models previously reported. All models were tested with a second test set (n = 145), and the prediction accuracy ranged from 63 to 67% overall. These test set molecules were found to cover the same area in a principal component analysis plot as the training set, suggesting that the predictions were within the applicability domain. The FlexX docking method combined with logistic regression performed poorly in classifying this PXR test set as compared with RP, RF, and SVM but may be useful for qualitative interpretion of interactions within the LBD. From this analysis, VolSurf descriptors and machine learning methods had good classification accuracy and made reliable predictions within the model applicability domain. These methods could be used for high throughput virtual screening to assess for PXR activation, prior to in vitro testing to predict potential drug-drug interactions.

J	Boissard, P; Martin, V; Moisan, S				Boissard, Paul; Martin, Vincent; Moisan, Sabine			A cognitive vision approach to early pest detection in greenhouse crops	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						IPM; greenhouse crops; pest early detection; cognitive vision; knowledge-based system; machine learning	DIGITAL IMAGE-ANALYSIS; OBJECT RECOGNITION; STRESS; DAMAGE; LEAF; APHIDIDAE; WHEAT	Early disease detection is a major challenge in horticulture. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) combines prophylactic, biological and physical methods to fight bioagressors of crops while minimizing the use of pesticides. This approach is particularly promising in the context of ornamental crops in greenhouses because of the high level of control needed in such agrosystems. However, IPM requires frequent and precise observations of plants (mainly leaves), which are not compatible with production constraints. Our goal is early detection of bioagressors. In this paper, we present a strategy based on advances in automatic interpretation of images applied to leaves of roses scanned in situ. We propose a cognitive vision system that combines image processing, learning and knowledge-based techniques. This system is illustrated with automatic detection and counting of a whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood) at a mature stage. We have compared our approach with manual methods and our results showed that automatic processing is reliable. Special attention was paid to low infestation cases, which are crucial to agronomic decisions. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Early detection of IHD may effectively prevent severity and reduce mortality rate. Recently, magnetocardiography (MCG) has been developed for the detection of heart malfunction. Although MCG is capable of monitoring the abnormal patterns of magnetic field as emitted by physiologically defective heart, data interpretation is time-consuming and requires highly trained professional. Hence, we propose an automatic method for the interpretation of IHD pattern of MCG recordings using machine learning approaches. Two types of machine learning techniques, namely back-propagation neural network (BNN) and direct kernel self-organizing map (DK-SOM), were applied to explore the IHD pattern recorded by MCG. Data sets were obtained by sequential measurement of magnetic field emitted by cardiac muscle of 125 individuals. Data were divided into training set and testing set of 74 cases and 51 cases, respectively. Predictive performance was obtained by both machine learning approaches. The BNN exhibited sensitivity of 89.7%, specificity of 54.5% and accuracy of 74.5%, while the DK-SOM provided relatively higher prediction performance with a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 86.2%, 72.7% and 80.4%, respectively. This finding suggests a high potential of applying machine learning approaches for high-throughput detection of IHD from MCG data. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ozsen, S; Gunes, S				Oezsen, Seral; Guenes, Salih			Effect of feature-type in selecting distance measure for an artificial immune system as a pattern recognizer	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						hybrid feature vectors; distance measures; artificial immune systems; statlog heart disease; BUPA liver disorders		In designing an artificial immune system (AIS) for a problem domain, one must select a distance measure to find the affinity between system units and input data after determining a representation type. Euclidean distance is a commonly used distance measure in many proposed methods and is selected intuitively or due to simplicity of implementation. But this selection must be done carefully by considering the properties of problem domain. For example, most problems use data vectors with discrete, real-valued and nominal feature values. Whereas Euclidean distance can be used in this kind of problems, some other similarity measures designed for these hybrid vectors would give better results. To call attention of AIS designer to this point, we have tested three distance criteria which are Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and hybrid similarity measure on a simple AIS for the classification of two medical dataset taken from the UCI machine learning repository. One of the datasets, Statlog heart disease, contains nominal, discrete and real-valued vectors while the other one, BUPA liver disorders dataset, consists of purely real-valued vectors. For Statlog dataset, the best classification result was obtained with hybrid similarity measure as expected because this dataset consists of three-types of features while results for BUPA dataset were not different so much for the used measures, which is also an expected result considering the nature of this dataset.

Classification is implemented by developing a model with existing records by using sample data. One of the aims of classification is to increase the reliability of the results obtained from the data. Fuzzy and crisp values are used together in medical data. Regarding to this, a new method is presented for classification of data of a medical database in this study. Also a hybrid neural network that includes artificial neural network (ANN) and fuzzy neural network (FNN) was developed. Two real-time problem data were investigated for determining the applicability of the proposed method. The data were obtained from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. The datasets are Pima Indians diabetes and Cleveland heart disease. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method accuracy, sensitivity and specificity performance measures that are used commonly in medical classification studies were used. The classification accuracies of these datasets were obtained by k-fold cross-validation. The proposed method achieved accuracy values 84.24% and 86.8% for Pima Indians diabetes dataset and Cleveland heart disease dataset, respectively. It has been observed that these results are one of the best results compared with results obtained from related previous studies and reported in the UCI web sites. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Classification of the fragrance properties of chemical compounds based on support vector machine and linear discriminant analysis	FLAVOUR AND FRAGRANCE JOURNAL			English	Article						classification; fragrance property; linear discriminant analysis; support vector machine	ODOR RELATIONSHIPS; DESCRIPTORS; CHEMISTRY; NETWORKS; PATTERN	Classification models of the fragrance properties of chemical compounds were performed using linear and non-linear models. The dataset was divided into three classes on the basis of their fragrances: apple, pineapple and rose. The three-class problem was first explored by a linear classifier approach, using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). A more accurate prediction model, the non-linear machine-learning technique, support vector machine (SVM), was subsequently investigated. Descriptors calculated from the molecular structures alone were used to represent the characteristics of compounds. The model containing four descriptors founded by SVM showed better predictive ability than LDA. The accuracy in the prediction for the three datasets was 96.6%, 80.0% and 100% for SVM, respectively. The results indicate that SVM can be used as a powerful modelling tool for QSAR studies and the selected descriptors can represent the fragrances of these chemical compounds.

While some investigators are focused on identifying informative genes and proteins that play a role in specific diseases, other researchers have attempted instead to use patients based on their expression profiles to prognosticate disease status. A major limitation in the ability to accurately classify these high-dimensional data sets stems from the "curse of dimensionality," occurring in situations where the number of genes or peptides significantly exceeds the total number of patient samples. Previous attempts at dealing with this issue have mostly centered on the use of a dimensionality reduction (DR) scheme, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to obtain a low-dimensional projection of the high-dimensional data. However, linear PCA and other linear DR methods, which rely on euclidean distances to estimate object similarity, do not account for the inherent underlying nonlinear structure associated with most biomedical data. While some researchers have begun to explore nonlinear DR methods for computer vision problems such as face detection and recognition, to the best of our knowledge, few such attempts have been made for classification and visualization of high-dimensional biomedical data. The motivation behind this work is to identify the appropriate DR methods for analysis of high-dimensional gene and protein expression studies. Toward this end, we empirically and rigorously compare three nonlinear (Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding, and Laplacian Eigenmaps) and three linear DR schemes (PCA, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Multidimensional Scaling) with the intent of determining a reduced subspace representation in which the individual object classes are more easily discriminable. Owing to the inherent nonlinear structure of gene and protein expression studies, our claim is that the nonlinear DR methods provide a more truthful low-dimensional representation of the data compared to the linear DR schemes. Evaluation of the DR schemes was done by 1) assessing the discriminability of two supervised classifiers (Support Vector Machine and C4.5 Decision Trees) in the different low-dimensional data embeddings and 2) five cluster validity measures to evaluate the size, distance, and tightness of object aggregates in the low-dimensional space. For each of the seven evaluation measures considered, statistically significant improvement in the quality of the embeddings across 10 cancer data sets via the use of three nonlinear DR schemes over three linear DR techniques was observed. Similar trends were observed when linear and nonlinear DR was applied to the high-dimensional data following feature pruning to isolate the most informative features. Qualitative evaluation of the low-dimensional data embedding obtained via the six DR methods further suggests that the nonlinear schemes are better able to identify potential novel classes (e. g., cancer subtypes) within the data.

J	Shotton, J; Blake, A; Cipolla, R				Shotton, Jamie; Blake, Andrew; Cipolla, Roberto			Multiscale categorical object recognition using contour fragments	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						edge and feature detection; feature representation; size and shape; object recognition; computer vision; machine learning	FEATURES; TRACKING; TEXTURE; SPACE	Psychophysical studies [9], [17] show that we can recognize objects using fragments of outline contour alone. This paper proposes a new automatic visual recognition system based only on local contour features, capable of localizing objects in space and scale. The system first builds a class-specific codebook of local fragments of contour using a novel formulation of chamfer matching. These local fragments allow recognition that is robust to within-class variation, pose changes, and articulation. Boosting combines these fragments into a cascaded sliding-window classifier, and mean shift is used to select strong responses as a final set of detection. We show how learning can be performed iteratively on both training and test sets to bootstrap an improved classifier. We compare with other methods based on contour and local descriptors in our detailed evaluation over 17 challenging categories and obtain highly competitive results. The results confirm that contour is indeed a powerful cue for multiscale and multiclass visual object recognition.

The paper brings powerful convex analytic and set theoretic estimation arguments in machine learning by revisiting the standard kernel-based classification as the problem of finding: a point which belongs to a closed halfspace (a special closed convex set) in an RKHS. In this way, classification in an online setting, where data arrive sequentially, is viewed as the problem of finding a point (classifier) in the nonempty intersection of an infinite sequence of closed halfspaces in the RKHS. Convex analysis is also used to introduce sparsification arguments in the design by imposing an additional simple convex constraint on the norm of the classifier. An algorithmic solution to the resulting optimization problem, where new convex constraints are added every time instant, is given by the recently introduced adaptive projected subgradient method (APSM), which generalizes a number of well-known projection-based adaptive filtering algorithms such as the classical normalized least mean squares (NLMS) and the affine projection algorithm (APA). Under mild conditions, the generated sequence of estimates enjoys monotone approximation, strong convergence, asymptotic optimality, and a characterization of the limit point. Further, we show that the additional convex constraint on the norm of the classifier naturally leads to an online sparsification of the resulting kernel series expansion. We validate the proposed design by considering the adaptive equalization problem of a nonlinear channel, and by comparing it with classical as well as with recently developed stochastic gradient descent techniques.

Statistical characterization of the components of various frequency bands is exploited to allow blind extraction of the watermark. Experimental results show that the proposed ML based decoding scheme can adapt to suit the watermark application by learning the alterations in the feature space incurred by the attack employed.
