We examine the effect of these measures on the resulting tree structures. Our experiments study these effects against various sampling policies. The emphasis of earlier works in this field has been on the overall size of the tree, pruned or unpruned, in terms of the number of levels and the number of leaf nodes. We take a more informative view of tree structure which takes the functionality of decision trees into consideration. Our structure-evaluating criterion combines classification proportions with the combinatorial structures. We shall demonstrate that the information-based measures outperform the non-information based ones for unpruned trees against classification proportion thresholds. Among the information-based measures, the information gain appears to be the best. Pruning improves the performance of non-information based measures. We also show that classification performance is not only related to the attribute selection measures but also to the sampling policies.

The database describes 382 patients for which 177 markers were tested. Two data mining techniques, clustering and decision tree induction were used, as well as a heuristic set cover algorithm. Clustering was used to group markers according to their appearance across patients, while a heuristic set covering algorithm was used to select as small a set of markers that cover as many patients with deletions as possible. This algorithm created a diagnostic set of 13 markers that cover more than 90% of the patients with deletions. Finally, decision tree induction was used to relate deletion patterns to the severity of the clinical phenotype. A decision tree induced from the data uses 5 markers, ail of which are also in the diagnostic set of 13 markers, to show relations between the severity of the clinical phenotype and deletion patterns which have not been known previously.

The first module was based on decision tree which was the result of Assistant algorithm applied to thyroid laboratory test results. Instead of improving decision rules, the "second opinion" module was designed based on Spad-S software. Diagnosis obtained with both modules were compared with results before introducing the "second opinion" module. From the first results it was clear that introducing the "second opinion" module decreased the number of misclassified records from the first module. With three or more modules, the final diagnosis could be obtained by voting or more complex procedures.

These deficiencies were exacerbated by the challenges of expanding classification categories as new defects were discovered. Our diversified product mix had accumulated a knowledge base of approximately seventy defect types, posing a formidable learning challenge for even the most knowledgeable inspector. Not surprisingly, the average accuracy of the group in classifying defects was similar to 55%, and even the best inspector scored around 70%. To address these issues, we developed a comprehensive methodology for classifying defects. This methodology includes both word descriptions of the physical appearance of defects and a hierachical questionnaire leading to precise defect classification. After adopting this methodology and implementing strong training programs, our team significantly improved its defect review process, ultimately reaching similar to 80% classification accuracy. With this degree of accuracy, we were able to implement defect specific statistical process control (SPC) charts, together with formalized "decision tree" procedures for correcting defect excursions. These formalisms then became an effective part of the fab's yield improvement program. Today, as technology advances into the realm of automatic defect classification (ADC), the lessons learned from human defect inspection form a strong foundation by establishing a comprehensive set of defect categories uniquely related to causality and supporting defect identification standards that can be used by the entire community of ADC training engineers.

The algorithm is computationally efficient and can discriminate between various digital and analog signal modulations, delivering reliable decisions using very short observation times. Communications formats, such as AMPS, GSM and US Digital Cellular, can also be recognized. The implementation of this algorithm in a practical spectrum monitoring system is discussed. Measurements using off-the-air signals, and computer simulations, indicate that the system performs well in different surveillance scenarios.

In the present paper we focus on learning set sampling (Breiman's bagging) and random feature subset selections (Bay's Multiple Feature Subsets). We present a combination scheme labeled 'Bagfs', in which new learning sets are generated on the basis of both bootstrap replicates and selected feature subsets. The performances of the three methods (Bagging, MFS and Bagfs) are assessed by means of a decision-tree inducer (C4.5) and a majority voting rule. In addition, we also study whether the way in which weak classifiers are created has a significant influence on the performance of their combination. To answer this question, we undertook the strict application of the Cochran Q test. This test enabled us to compare the three weakening methods together on a given database, and to conclude whether or not these methods differ significantly. We also used the McNemar test to compare algorithms pair by pair. The first results, obtained on 14 conventional databases, show that on average, Bagfs exhibits the best agreement between prediction and supervision. The Cochran Q test indicated that the weak classifiers so created significantly influenced combination performance in the case of at least 4 of the 14 databases analyzed.

The distinguishing characteristic of our work from most of the related work in the field is that we aim at the disambiguation of all content words in the text, rather than focussing on a small number of words. In an earlier study we have shown that a decision tree induction algorithm performs well on this task. This study compares decision tree induction with other popular learning methods and discusses their advantages and disadvantages. Our results confirm the good performance of decision tree induction, which outperforms the other algorithms, due to its ability to order the features used for disambiguation, according to their contribution in assigning the correct sense.

J	Hamzei, GHS; Mulvaney, DJ				Hamzei, GHS; Mulvaney, DJ			Implementation of an intelligent control system using fuzzy ITI	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						adaptive fuzzy associative memories; decision tree fuzzy controller; decision trees; fuzzy ITI; hybrid fuzzy controller		This paper proposes a new multi-strategy (hybrid) intelligent control technique whose concept is applicable to the control of a wide range of processes. The proposed technique uses Incremental Tree Induction (ITI) as the learning algorithm, and incorporates fuzzy logic to deal with uncertainties apparent in the process to be controlled. ITI operates solely on symbolic fuzzy knowledge, as both the input features (data obtained from the process to be controlled) and the output decisions of the intelligent controller are described by fuzzy linguistic variables. Fuzzy associative memories (FAMs) are employed to store and manage the fuzzy knowledge, and are simulated operationally by fuzzy binary decision trees which encode the input-output space. The main novelty of this approach is the automatic synthesis (both off-line and on-line) of multi-dimensional FAMs front inception, ill contrast to the manual implementation of traditional FAMs. A second important advantage is the self-explanatory nature of the FAMs (and their underlying control laws) generated by this approach. The new technique is demonstrated in its application to the intelligent navigation of a mobile robot.

Data corresponding to these measurements were used to train artificial neural nets to recognise the faults, and to discriminate between them and normal operation. Individually trained nets, some of which were trained on sub-tasks, were combined to form a multi-net system. The multi-net system is shown to be effective when compared with the performance of the component nets from which it was assembled. The system is also shown to outperform a decision-tree algorithm (C5.0), and a human expert; comparisons which show the complexity of the required discrimination. The results illustrate the improvements in performance that can come about from the effective use of both problem decomposition and redundancy in the construction of multi-net systems.

These FAFs are realized using an unnormalized type-a TSK fuzzy logic system. We apply our DFE to a nonlinear time-varying channel, and demonstrate that it can implement the Bayesian equalizer for such a channel, has a simple structure, and provides fast inference. A clustering method is used to adaptively design the parameters of the FAF. Our DFE vastly reduces computational complexity as compared to a transversal equalizer (TE). Simulation results show that our type-2 FAF-based DFE performs much better than nearest neighbor classifiers (NNC) or a DFE based on type-1 FAFs.

An example of this type of fuzzy rule is "Most data whose attribute A is large are small in the attribute B," where the "large" and "small" are fuzzy sets of attributes A and B, respectively, and "most" is a fuzzy quantifier. For selecting a combination of fuzzy sets in attributes for fuzzy rules, we use a fuzzy IDS-based method to generate a fuzzy decision tree for a specified class. From each tree, we extract a quantified fuzzy rule from a path of the root to a class node by evaluating its understandability and informativeness. We apply the method to iris classification problem by R.A. Fisher and diagnosis data by gas in oil.

The odour samples are obtained from an electronic nose that contains conducting polymer sensors with partially overlapping sensitivities to odours. The sensor responses are represented by means of the coefficients of their Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). A feature reduction method is applied to reduce the feature space dimension. Then, an Unsupervised Fuzzy Divisive Hierarchical Clustering (UFDHC) method is used to establish the optimal number of clusters in the data set, as well as the optimal cluster structure. The output of UFDHC is a binary hierarchy of fuzzy classes that are adopted to build a supervised fuzzy hierarchical classifier. At each level of the hierarchy a separating hyperplane of the two corresponding fuzzy classes is determined. The hyperplane identifies two crisp decision regions, which will be refined at the next level of the hierarchy. In this way, we obtain a hierarchy of regions, which defines a crisp decision tree. Each region is, therefore, related to a specific expected output of the system. Two small-scale applications demonstrate the effectiveness and the good recognition performance of the proposed method.

However, they have suffered from overfitting in noisy domains. This problem has been remedied, in C4.5 for example, by tree pruning, resulting in improved performance. More recently, fuzzy representations have been combined with decision trees. How does the performance of fuzzy decision trees compare to that of pruned decision trees? In this paper, we propose a comparative study of pruned decision trees and fuzzy decision trees. Further, for continuous inputs, we explore different ways (1) for selecting the granularity of the fuzzy input variables, and (2) for defining the membership functions of the fuzzy input values. We carry out an empirical study using 12 data sets. The results show that a fuzzy decision tree constructed using FID3, combined with fuzzy clustering (to build membership functions) and cluster validity (to decide on granularity), is superior to pruned decision trees.

Despite advances in diagnostic modalities, some pulmonary carcinomas are found to be nonresectable at surgery. The objective is to assess the cost-effectiveness of the chest CT plus FDG-PET strategy. Methods. Decision-tree sensitivity analysis was designed, based on the two competing strategies of chest CT alone vs, chest CT plus chest or whole-body FDG-PET. A simulation of patients suspected of having non-small cell lung carcinima (NSCLC), was created using baselines of other relevant variables in regard to sensitivity, specificity, mortality life expectancy, and cost from published data. We surveyed the relevant literature for the choice of variables. Results, The chest CT plus chest FDG-PET strategy yielded an expected life expectancy gain of 0.607 years per patient, compared to the alternative strategy of chest CT alone. Using a FDG-PET examination cost of 1.0 x 10(5) yen (around US $700) per study, the cost increment was 2.18 x 10(5) yen/year/patient. The chest CT plus whole-body FDG-PET strategy yielded a saving of approximately 372,000 yen/patient without a loss of life expectancy as compared to the alternative strategy of CT alone. Conclusions. The chest CT plus FDG-PET strategy in patients with NSCLC shows the potential cost-effectiveness of using FDG-PET, with better results in whole-body FDG-PET than in chest FDG-PET.

The likelihood of any introduced gene product being an allergen is probabilistically extremely low, but developers of biotechnology crops must specifically address these risks as a part of the safety evaluation process. Definitive immunodiagnostic methods are in place to detect the transfer of known protein allergens, or an increase in their abundance. A combination of genetic and physicochemical criteria can provide reasonable assurance that proteins from sources with no allergenic history pose no significant allergenic concern. Using the decision tree approach developed by the Allergy and Immunology Institute and the International Food Biotechnology Council, that combines diagnostic and predictive criteria, it is possible to assess the potential allergenicity of foods derived through biotechnology. Consistent application of this assessment procedure can provide reasonable assurance that genetically modified foods introduced into the marketplace are as safe as foods derived from new plant varieties developed through traditional breeding.

For such complex data (that requires a large number of very specific rules to achieve a high accuracy), smaller rule sets, composed of more general rules, may be preferable, even if they are less accurate. The GA presented here allows the user to encourage smaller rule sets by setting a parameter The rule sets found are also compared to those created by standard decision-tree algorithms, The results illustrate tradeoffs involving the number of rules, descriptive accuracy, predictive accuracy, and accuracy in describing and predicting positive examples across different rule sets.

The extraction of rules, therefore, from ANNs trained on continuous data is of great importance. The system described here uses a genetic algorithm to generate input patterns which are presented to the network and the output from the ANN is then used to calculate the fitness function for the algorithm. These patterns can contain null characters which represent a zero input to the ANN and allows the genetic algorithm to find patterns which can be converted into additive rules with few antecedent clauses, These antecedents provide information as to where and how the neural network has partitioned the continuous data and can be combined together to make rules. These rules compare favourably with the results of those generated by See5 (a decision tree based data mining tool) when executed on a dataset consisting of continuous attributes.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2000 CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOLS 1 AND 2	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	2000 Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC2000)	JUL 16-19, 2000	LA JOLLA, CA	IEEE Neural Network Council, Evolutionary Programming Soc, Inst Elect Engineers, Parallel Problem Solving Nat, EvoNet, Evolut Artificielle, ANTS, SEAL				Genetic Programming (GP) has proved useful in optimization problems. The way of representing individuals in this methodology is particularly good when we want to construct decision trees. Decision trees are well suited to representing explicit information and relationships among parameters studied. A set of decision trees could make up a decision support system. In this paper we set out a methodology for developing decision support systems as an aid to medical decision making. Above all, we apply it to diagnosing the evolution of a burn, which is a really difficult task even For specialists. A learning classifier system is developed by means of Multipopulations Genetic Programming (MGP). It uses a set of parameters, obtained by specialist doctors, to predict the evolution of a burn according to its initial stages. The system is First trained with a set of parameters and results of evolutions which have been recorded over a set of clinic cases, Once the system is trained, it is useful for deciding how new cases will probably evolve, Thanks to the use of GP, an explicit expression of the input parameter is provided. This explicit expression takes the form of a decision tree which will be incorporated into software tools that help physicians in their everyday work.

It has many positive features, but one drawback is that it does not provide estimates of class membership probabilities. In this paper, we present a novel method for obtaining class membership probabilities from a transformation-based rule fist classifier. Three experiments are presented which measure the modeling accuracy and cross-entropy of the probabilistic classifier on unseen data and the degree to which the output probabilities from the classifier can be used to estimate confidences in its classification decisions. The results of these experiments show that, for the task of text chunking(1), the estimates produced by this technique axe more informative than those generated by a state-of-the-art decision tree.

However, when the language model for Chinese is applied in a novel domain, the accuracy is reduced significantly, from 96% to 78% in our evaluation. We apply pattern recognition techniques (i.e. Bayesian, decision tree and neural network classifiers) to discover language model errors. We have examined 2 general types of features: model-based and language-specific features. In our evaluation, Bayesian classifiers produce the best recall performance of 80% but the precision is low (60%). Neural network produced good recall (75%) and precision (80%) but both Bayesian and Neural network have low skip ratio (65%). The decision tree classifier produced the best precision (81%) and skip ratio (76%) but its recall is the lowest (73%).

A Bayesian Network was developed in collaboration with an expert specialist who regularly utilizes a non-automated diagnostic algorithm in clinical practice, The original Bayesian network was later refined using a more connected approach, Diagnoses del el mined from all automated approaches were compared,vith the diagnoses of a single human compared. In most cases, Bayesian networks were found to be at least as accurate as the Decision Tree approach. The refined Connected Bayesian Network was found to be more accurate than the Original Bayesian Network This Is likely due to the more generalized nature Bayesian Network accurately discriminated between diagnoses despite the small sample site, In contrast, the Connected and Decision TI ee approaches were less able to discriminate between diagnoses. The original Bayesian Network was found to provide an excellent basis for graphically communicating the correlation between symptoms and laxity defects in a given anatomical zone, Performance measures in both networks indicate that Bayesian networks could provide a potentially useful tool in the management elf female pelvic door dysfunction. before the technique call be utilized in practice, well established teaming algorithms should be applied to improve network structure, A larger training data set should also improve network accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

Large scale databases are usually constructed through the participation of multiple people with different backgrounds for the collection and description of data. Since the meaning represented by symbol or the usage of symbol in data description can be different depending on individuals due to their respective viewpoints, there can be inconsistency in the description of data which are stored in databases. To discover the difference in the usage of symbol for data description, decision trees for the classification of respective cases are first constructed. After that, mutual classification of diagnosis cases is utilized to find out the correlation between the nodes in decision trees so as not to destroy the original characteristics or structure of each decision tree.

In this paper we describe some simple rules for selection of discourse markers. These rules were derived for use in an intelligent tutoring system by applying decision-tree machine learning to human tutoring language. The fact that these selection rules operate within the environment of an intention-based planner encouraged us to derive our decision tree partly based an intention-based features. The resulting tree, when applied to the generation task, is relatively easy to understand because it can be referred to traditional intention-based linguistic explanations of discourse marker behavior.

On January 17, 1995, Kobe experienced the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake with plenty of victims and damages which produced confusion in the influenza surveillance system. We conducted a decision analysis based on the decision-tree model whether the vaccination for influenza should be performed or not in terms of maximizing life expectancy under the risk caused by the vaccination. As a result, we theoretically formulated the decision level at which the benefit of the vaccination overcomes the risk of it. The obtained mathematical formula will be helpful for decision makers who wonder when the influenza vaccination should be performed for the high-risk groups under the disaster circumstances in which the surveillance data suggest the influenza epidemic is highly likely to be predicted to get serious.

The process developed for discrimination is based on the different spectral response and its different temporal evolution according to the crop phenological evolution. The classification procedure has followed multitemporal supervised classification by combining maximum likelihood algorithms, decision-tree criteria and context classifiers, which operate on scenes obtained on different dates. It has produced an improvement when we have introduced other dates, obtaining a global precision from 82.7% to 92.7% for classification accuracy. To consider the level of precision in the estimated crops areas from the classified image, we compare these areas with the calculated areas from the digital rural cadastre, through the intersection of the land use raster map and the digital rural cadastre vector map in a Geographical Information System.

Following the basic idea behind CBR, the timetables from previously solved problems are employed to aid in the generation of solutions for new time-tabling problems. A list of feature-value pairs is insufficient to represent all the necessary information. We show that attribute graphs can be used to represent information such as the relations between events and thus can help to retrieve re-usable cases that have similar structures to the new problems. The case base is organised as a decision tree that stores the attribute graphs of previously solved time-tabling problems hierarchically. A new problem is classified to a node in the tree and all the cases stored below that node are retrieved for re-use. An example is given to illustrate the retrieval, re-use and adaptation of structured cases. The results from our experiments show the effectiveness of the retrieval and adaptation in the proposed method.

It allows to increase the recognition rate on average and also to use a modular principle of designing of the recognition program via connecting additional modules while the complexity of the recognition task is increased. The task of the development of optimal recognition strategy in untrivial statement should be connected with an overall performance of the system as a whole, but not just with the condition of achievement of the given recognition accuracy. The complete formalization of the decision of this task for a general case is unknown today and is hardly possible [1]. The formalization of the procedure of the development of the effective recognition strategy is possible only when feature sets of patterns are chosen by informal methods, and the criteria for the efficiency estimation are also chosen. Then the formal statement of the task of the development of the effective recognition strategy can be formulated as the task of the optimal decision tree searching, which is based on the general-system efficiency criterion. On each step of this hierarchical decision tree such features subset is selected, which reduces the entropy about patterns in maximum degree and increases the classification rate.

Unlike conventional M-ary decision fusion systems, our fusion system breaks a complex M-ary decision fusion problem into a sequence of simpler binary decision fusion problems. In our system, a binary decision tree (BDT) is employed to hierarchically partition the object space at all system elements. The traversal of the BDT is synchronized by the fusion center. The sensor observations are assumed conditionally independent given the unknown object type. We use a greedy performance criterion in which the probability of error is minimized at individual nodes. Using this performance criterion, we characterize the optimal fusion rules and the optimal sensor rules. We compare our results with some important results on conventional one-stage binary fusion.

Chess systems like Deep Blue have achieved Grandmaster chess play with a brute-force search of the game tree and human-supplied information, like piece-values and opening books. However, subtle aspects of chess, including positional features and advanced concepts, are not capable of being represented or processed efficiently with the standard method. Since 1989, Morph I-III have exhibited more autonomy and learning ability than traditional chess programs in "adaptive pattern-oriented chess". (2) Like its predecessors, Morph TV is a reinforcement learner, but it also uses a new technique we call pattern-level TD and Q-learning to mathematically map the state space and effectively learn to classify situations. Its three knowledge sources include two traditional ones: material and a piece-square table, and a new method called Distance. These are combined using a simple genetic algorithm and a decision tree. This paper shows the effectiveness of fusing knowledge to replace search in real-time situations, since an agent which combines all sources is capable of consistently beating an agent which employs any of the individual knowledge sources. Surprisingly, the pattern-level TD agent is slightly superior to the pattern-level Q-learning agent, despite the fact that the Q-learning agent updates more Q-values on each temporal step.

We describe a system implementing the four steps in ODA, focusing our attention on the data-mining step where our goal is to predict the value of a performance parameter (e.g., response time, cpu utilization, memory utilization) in the future. Our approach to the prediction problem extracts patterns from a database containing information from thousands of historical records and across computers. We show empirically how a multivariate linear regression model applied on all available records outperforms 1) a linear univariate model per machine, 2) a linear multivariate model per machine, and 3) a decision tree for regression across all machines. We conclude that global patterns relating characteristics across different computer models exist and can be extracted to improve the accuracy in predicting future performance behavior.

This paper argues that one of the key reasons for the large number of rules is that an inefficient knowledge representation scheme has been used. The current predominant representation of the discovered knowledge is the if-then rules. This representation often severely fragments the knowledge that exists in the data, thereby resulting in a large number of rules. The fragmentation also makes the discovered rules hard to understand and to use. In this paper, we propose a more efficient representation scheme, called general rules & exceptions. In this representation, a unit of knowledge consists of a single general rule and a set of exceptions. This scheme reduces the complexity of the discovered knowledge substantially. It is also intuitive and easy to understand. This paper focuses on using the representation to express the knowledge embedded in a decision tree. An algorithm that converts a decision tree to the new representation is presented. Experiment results show that the new representation dramatically simplifies the decision tree. Real-life applications also confirm that this representation is more intuitive to human users.

Rather, they create new sentences that are grammatical, that cohere with one another, and that capture the most salient pieces of information in the original document. Given that large collections of text/abstract pairs are available online, it is now possible to envision algorithms that are trained to mimic this process. In this paper, we focus on sentence compression, a simpler version of this larger challenge. We aim to achieve two goals simultaneously: our compressions should be grammatical, and they should retain the most important pieces of information. These two goals can conflict. We devise both noisy-channel and decision-tree approaches to the problem, and we evaluate results against manual compressions and a simple baseline.

The sharing of information measured by local sensors via communication links across the battle group should allow for optimal or near optimal decisions. The survival of the battle group or members of the group depends on the automatic real-time allocation of various resources. A fuzzy logic algorithm has been developed that automatically allocates electronic attack (EA) resources in real-time. The particular approach to fuzzy logic that is used is the fuzzy decision tree, a generalization of the standard artificial intelligence technique of decision trees. The controller must be able to make decisions based on rules provided by experts. The fuzzy logic approach allows the direct incorporation of expertise forming a fuzzy linguistic description, i.e., a formal representation of the system in terms of fuzzy if-then rules. Genetic algorithm based optimization is conducted to determine the form of the membership functions for the fuzzy root concepts. The isolated platform and multiple platform resource manager models are discussed as well as the underlying multi-platform communication model. The resource manager is shown to exhibit excellent performance under many demanding scenarios.

Unfortunately, this weight prays an important role in many real world problems. In this paper, we present an effective approach for learning fuzzy weighted classification rules from data. The weights for each rule antecedent propositions will be assigned based on a Relative Weight Matrix. Some experiments are conducted and the results show that this approach usually can obtain a compact set of fuzzy rules and considerable classification accuracy, especially, the learning accuracy can be improved by incorporating the weight.

Such systems consist of a collection of coupled vision sub-systems each one dedicated to a particular sensor. Interaction between the vision sub-systems is controlled by an organising agent. Each vision sub-system is implemented on the basis of a partition tree image labelling representation and an associated multiagent hierarchy of classifiers controlled by an organising agent. Each classifier in the multiagent hierarchy of classifiers may be implemented as a decision tree of neural network classifiers acting on feature vectors derived from regions in the partition tree. Therefore the image labelling and image classification sub-systems can be described in terms of hierarchical networks of neural networks from which an interpretation in terms of multiagents very naturally follows. The vision sub-systems have a multiresolution image representation and concurrency between and within the image labelling and image classification vision sub-system components.

Comparisons to ScalParC, a previous attempt to build a fast parallelization of a decision tree classifier, are provided. Our parallel classifier executes on the "ASCI Red" supercomputer. Experiments demonstrate that datasets too large to be processed on a single processor can be efficiently handled in parallel, and suggest that there need not be any decrease in accuracy relative to a monolithic classifier constructed on a single processor.

The recognition system consists of coarse and fine classification based on a variety of stable and reliable global features and local features. For the coarse classifier: a four-layer feed forward neural networks with back propagation learning algorithm is employed to distinguish six subsets {0}, {6}, {8}, {1,7}, {4,9}, {2,3,5} based on the similarity of character's geometrical features. Three character classes {0},{6} and {8} are directly recognized from ANN. For each of the last three subsets, a decision tree classifier is built for a fine classification as follows: Firstly, the specific feature-class relationship is heuristically and empirically created between the feature primitives and corresponding semantic class. Then, an iterative growing and pruning algorithm is used to form a tree classifier. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed hybrid recognition system is robust and flexible, which can achieve a high recognition rate.

These approaches exhibit a good performance even when there are cognitive uncertainties in the data. Most systems in this paradigm use the information gain criterion an selecting attributes when learning. This paper presents an alternative approach. A heuristic measure of the impurity level of rules when dealing with fuzzy data is described and used in a classification algorithm. Results on the Sports classification problem are reported and compared with those of other learning algorithms.

The ability to classify videos into various classes such as sports, news, movies, or documentaries, increases the efficiency of indexing, browsing, and retrieval of video in large databases. In this paper, we discuss the extraction of features that enable identification of sports videos directly from the compressed domain of MPEG video. These features include detecting the presence of action replays, determining the amount of scene text in video, and calculating various statistics on camera and/or object motion. The features are derived from the macroblock, motion, and bit-rate information that is readily accessible from MPEG video with very minimal decoding, leading to substantial gains in processing speeds. Full-decoding of selective frames is required only for text analysis. A decision tree classifier built using these features is able to identify sports clips with an accuracy of about 93%.

In April 1997 and 1998, intensive snow surveys were conducted in the 6.9-km(2) Loch Vale watershed (LVWS), Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. Binary decision trees were used to model the large-scale variations in snow depth, while the small-scale variations were modeled through kriging interpolation methods. Binary decision trees related depth to the physically based independent variables of net solar radiation, elevation, slope, and vegetation cover type. These decision tree models explained 54-65% of the observed variance in the depth measurements. The tree-based modeled depths were then subtracted from the measured depths, and the resulting residuals were spatially distributed across LVWS through kriging techniques. The kriged estimates of the residuals were added to the tree-based modeled depths to produce a combined depth model. The combined depth estimates explained 60-85% of the variance in the measured depths. Snow densities were mapped across LVWS using regression analysis. Snow-covered area was determined from high-resolution aerial photographs. Combining the modeled depths and densities with a snow cover map produced estimates of the spatial distribution of snow water equivalence (SWE). This modeling approach offers improvement over previous methods of estimating SWE distribution in mountain basins.

J	Nance, LB; Colman, BR				Nance, LB; Colman, BR			Evaluating the use of a nonlinear two-dimensional model in downslope windstorm forecasts	WEATHER AND FORECASTING			English	Article							MOUNTAIN WAVES; PREDICTION	Severe downslope windstorms are a mesoscale, primarily wintertime, phenomenon that affect regions in the lee of large mountain ranges. The resolution of current weather prediction models is too coarse to explicitly predict downslope windstorms. Hence, additional operational tools are needed for making downslope windstorm forecasts. Current windstorm forecast techniques commonly utilize a tool referred to as a " decision tree. '' Although decision trees provide valuable guidance, operational forecasters have not found this type of tool to be highly reliable. With recent advances in computer technology, a new type of operational tool is available for forecasting downslope windstorms: two- dimensional, nonlinear, mesoscale numerical models. This study investigates whether this type of model, initialized with upstream profiles taken from operational Eta Model forecasts, can produce accurate downslope windstorm forecasts. Numerical simulations for high- wind events that affected seven regions in the United States between January 1993 and April 1997 indicate this tool is able to produce lee- slope wind speeds that meet the local peak gust threshold for a High Wind Warning for a majority of those cases where observed winds met this threshold. These simulations were initialized with upstream soundings taken from the 12- and 18- h Eta forecasts valid at the time of each high- wind event. A comparison for one region between the number of events for which High Wind Watches were posted and the number of events for which the two- dimensional model prediction met the peak gust threshold suggests this new tool would be a definite improvement over the current forecast technique. On the other hand, a preliminary test of the model's ability to differentiate between windstorm and nonwindstorm events suggests the false warning rate for this tool may be high. Further testing of this tool is ongoing and will continue through the winter months of 2000/ 01.

A good web site should help visitors find the information they want easily. Visitors typically find information by searching for selected terms of interest or by following links from one web page to another. The first approach is more useful if the visitor knows exactly what he is seeking, while the second approach is useful when the visitor has less of a preconceived notion about what he wants. The organization of a web site is especially important in the latter case. Traditionally, web site organization is done by hand. In this paper, we introduce the problem of automatic web site construction and propose a solution for solving a major step of the problem based on decision tree algorithms. The solution is found to be useful in automatic construction of product catalogs.

However learning decision trees from large datasets, particularly in data mining, is quite different from learning from small or moderately sized datasets. When learning from large datasets, decision tree induction programs often produce very large trees. How to visualize efficiently trees in the learning process, particularly large trees, is still questionable and currently requires efficient tools. This paper presents an visualization tool for interactive learning of large decision trees, that includes a new visualization technique called T2.5D (stands for Trees 2.5 Dimensions). After a brief discussion on requirements for tree visualizers and related work, the paper focuses on presenting developing techniques for the issues (I) how to visualize efficiently large decision trees; and (2) how to visualize decision trees in the learning process.

Still, the knowledge engineering effort may be demanding. In this paper we present a tool which helps to reduce the knowledge acquisition effort for building a typical CBR retrieval stage consisting of a decision-tree index and similarity measure. We use Genetic Algorithms to determine the relevance/importance of case features and to find optimal retrieval parameters. The optimisation is done using the data contained in the case-base. Because no (or little) other knowledge is needed this results in a self-optimising CBR retrieval. To illustrate this we present how the tool has been applied to optimise retrieval for a tablet formulation problem.

In our experiments we tested various methods for building univariate decision frees in order to find the best induction strategy On a hard real world problem of the orthopaedic fracture data with 2637 cases, described by 23 attributes and a decision with three possible values, we built decision trees with four classical approaches, one hybrid approach where we combined neural networks and decision trees, and with evolutionary approach. The results show, that all approaches had problems with either accuracy sensitivity or decision tree size. The comparison shows that the best compromise in hard real world problem decision trees building is the evolutionary approach.

In this paper we suggest a technique that searches for a strategic splitting of the feature space identifying the best subsets of features for each instance. Our technique is based on the wrapper approach where a classification algorithm is used as the evaluation function to differentiate between several feature subsets. We apply the recently developed technique for dynamic integration of classifiers and use decision trees. For each test instance we consider only those feature combinations that include features present in the path taken by the test instance in the decision tree. We evaluate our technique on medical datasets from the UCI machine learning repository.

Information about pi is available only via queries that yield pi(x)(y) from any x is an element of {0, 1,...,2(n) - 1} and y is an element of {0, 1,...,2(n) - 1) (where m is polynomial in n). The resource under consideration is the number of these queries (hence our model of computation is the decision tree). We show that the number of queries necessary to solve the problem in the classical probabilistic bounded-error model is exponential in n. This contrasts sharply with the quantum bounded-error model, where a constant number of queries suffices.

Perceptual grouping is performed in a model-based framework, in which decision tree classifier is employed for learning and retrieving geometric information of the 3-D model object. On the other hand, in order to extract the polygonal patch structure, initial grouping result is represented by a Gestalt graph. Polygonal patch hypotheses are then generated by graph search and verified by the consistency test with the model. In the experiments, it is shown that the model-based grouping reduces the number of the generated hypotheses efficiently, and further more, robust recognition and reconstruction are achieved by means of the graph search technique.

A goal of these missions is to understand the origin and evolution of the planetary system and the physical and chemical processes that led to the evolution of life. Among the variety of new technologies needed for such exploration are small, highly mobile, autonomous and relatively inexpensive platforms known as biomorphic explorers. These miniaturized robotic devices will be particularly valuable for study and exploration of the surfaces of planets, moons, and small bodies. Large numbers of small, dexterous explorers could seek out and deploy sensors in places not accessible by larger rover vehicles or landers. The low cost of such microdevices would also enable the exploration of heretofore high-risk and dangerous landing sites excluded by large, more expensive systems. This paper addresses the problem of determining the tradeoff space between the likelihood of each device achieving its stated science goal and the number of units needed to obtain the minimum required mission probability of success. Probabilistically, to a first order, the paper addresses the question, "If the probability of a single unit achieving its goal is x%, what is the required number of units to achieve 95% probability of mission success?" The impacts of cost are discussed using a linear fixed and variable cost model to derive the optimum number of units for deployment. The issues relevant to the analysis and deployment of multiple, low cost, microelectronic and electromechanicaI devices (MEMs) biomorphic explorers and the corresponding risks are also presented. A simple decision tree is presented with a parametric cost model to illustrate the potential to address risk and cost trade-offs. Three-dimensional visualizations of the probabilistic trade space are presented to illustrate these issues.

These systems usually make use of large speech databases and employ sophisticated search algorithms to determine the optimal unit sequence to use to synthesise each sentence. For many applications it is not possible to have the entire database, which may be as large as several hundred megabytes. available to the synthesiser at runtime. What is required is some form of off-line pre-selection algorithm to determine which subset of the database enables the highest quality speech synthesis to be performed for a given runtime system size. This paper describes a pre-selection algorithm developed at IBM for use with decision-tree-based concatenative speech synthesisers.

We consider a combined measure of confidence that utilizes the language model back-off sequence, language model score, and phonetic length of recognized words as indicators of speech recognition confidence. The paper investigates the ability of each feature to detect speech recognition errors and out-of-domain utterances as well as two methods for combining the features contextually: a multi-layer perceptron and a statistical decision tree. We illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by considering utterances from the ATIS airline information task as either in-domain and out-of-domain for the DARPA Communicator task. Using this hand-labeled data, it is shown that 27.9% of incorrectly recognized words and 36.4% of out-of-domain phrases are detected at a 2.5% false alarm rate.

This can be obtained by increasing the number of gaussian densities in the models by splitting of the gaussians. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for this splitting operation. It is based on the phonetic decision tree used for the state tying in context dependent modelling. Advantage of the method is that it improves the capability of the acoustic models to discriminate between the different tied states. The proposed splitting algorithm was evaluated on the Wall Street Journal recognition task. Comparison with a commonly used splitting algorithm clearly shows that our method can provide smaller (thus faster) acoustic models and results in lower error rates.

It focuses on decision-tree based context-dependent acoustic modeling for large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition. Extensive phonological and phonetic knowledge are incorporated to design questions conerning the left and right context of sub-syllable units, namely INITIALs and FINALs. This results in a set of class-triphone models for each dialect. Syllable recognition accuracy of 81.7% and 75.5% are attained for Mandarin and Cantonese respectively. Such a performance gap is accountable by various linguistic and practical reasons, including: 1)phonological and phonetic discrepancies between the two dialects; 2) design of training databases; and 3) design of phonetic questions in decision-tree clustering.

Two different approaches for the definition of multilingual set of triphones (bottom-up and a top-down) are investigated. A new clustering algorithm for the definition of multilingual set of triphones is proposed. The agglomerative clustering algorithm (bottom-up) bases on a definition of a distance measure for triphones defined as a weighted sum of explicit estimates of the context similarity on a monophone level. The monophone similarity estimation method is based on the algorithm of Houtgast. The second type of system uses tree-based clustering (top-down) with common decision tree. The experiments were based on the SpeechDat II databases (Slovenian, Spanish and German 1000 FDB SpeechDat II). Experiments have shown that the use of agglomerative clustering algorithm results in a significant reduction of the number of triphones with minor degradation of word accuracy.

In this paper, we proposed a decision tree based approach to obtain the quantitative result of tone pattern variation in continuous Mandarin speech. Many possible factors other than tone of neighboring syllables were taken into consideration when the decision tree was constructed. After the tree was established, 29 tone patterns were automatically obtained, and we found that syllable position in the word together with Consonant/Vowel type of the syllable made important contribution to tone pattern variation in continuous utterance. We also presented a novel approach to integrate tone information into search process at word level. Experimental results showed that the character error rate was reduced by 15.2%.

A representative set of system operating states are classified as transiently stable or unstable by the Extended Equal Area Criterion (EEAC) for fast evaluation of transient stability and used as a training set for the decision tree, which outputs a set of classification rules. Security control is achieved by selecting optimal control actions to change the current, insecure state into a state within a secure region, without violating the acquired security rules. The technique is demonstrated on the 39 bus New England test system.

We investigate and analyze the relationship between morphology and intelligence acquired from different tasks, and the characteristic differences of functions emerges from this relationship. In this paper, robotic morphology and intelligence are encoded using genetic programming: GP operations, and robot dynamics are handled wing a two-dimensional dynamics simulation. As the robotic morphology we utilize position-changeable visual sensors through evolution by GP operations, and its the robotic intelligence, we use a decision tree which is able to evolve by GP operations. A task of the robot is to keep a certain distance from an abject. The simulation results clarify the importance of harmony and/or balance between morphology and intelligence, and show that a new function emerges as the result of harmony and/or balance between morphology, intelligence and a task.

The conventional method such as geometric reconstruction from landmark observations is generally time-consuming and prone to errors. This paper proposes a method which constructs a decision tree and prediction trees of the landmark appearance that enable a mobile robot with ct limited visual angle to observe efficiently and make decisions without global positioning in the environment. By constructing these trees based on information criterion, the robot can accomplish the given task efficiently. The validity of the method is shown with a four legged robot.

However, its intrinsic weakness in initialization mid topology changes handling limits its application in complicated situations. In this research, we focus our work on atherosclerotic blood vessel tracking and lumen contour segmentation of Magnetic Resource (MR) image sequences, along which the blood vessel bifurcates at indefinite position. To automatically capture this topology change in the processing, a practical solution is proposed by extending our previous research work. The procedure first presegments each MR slice into regions, and then uses decision tree to track blood vessel's topology change. Finally, Minimal Path Snake (MPS) algorithm is applied to further search optimal lumen contours. Some experimental results in the preliminary study are provided to demonstrated its encouraging performance.

Data on patients with Meniere's disease, vestibular schwannoma, traumatic vertigo, sudden deafness, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and vestibular neuritis were retrieved from the database of the otoneurologic expert system ONE for the development and testing of the accuracy of decision trees in the diagnostic workup. Decision trees were constructed separately for each disease. The accuracies of the best decision trees were 94%, 95%, 90%, 99%, 100%, and 100% for the respective diseases. The most important questions concerned the presence of vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus; duration of vertigo; frequency of vertigo attacks severity of rotational vertigo; onset and type of hearing loss; and occurrence of head injury in relation to the timing of onset of vertigo. Meniere's disease was the most difficult to classify correctly. The validity and structure of the decision trees are easily comprehended and can be used outside the expert system.

Design/Measures: Physicians selected triage options for 15 digitized images of skin lesions, with and without use of the decision support software. Participants/Settings: Twenty primary care physicians practicing in a health maintenance organization or a city health clinic. Intervention: Decision support software designed to help physicians arrive at a triage recommendation consisted of a clinical information form, a decision tree, and support features (teaching points, example images, and diagrams). Results: Without using the decision support software, physicians chose the wrong triage decision 36.7% of the time; using the decision support software, they chose the wrong response only 13.3% of the time. Not using the decision support software, they failed to correctly perform a biopsy on or refer patients with cancerous lesions 22.1% of the time; using the software, they failed to correctly perform a biopsy on or refer patients with cancerous lesions only 3.6% of the time. Physicians scored an average of 3 points (of a possible 15 points) higher when they used the software (signed rank, 101.0; P<.001). They scored an average of 1 point higher on the 7 cancerous lesions when they used the software (signed rank, 65.5; P<.001). Conclusions: Use of decision support software could improve primary care physicians' triage decisions for lesions suggestive of nonmelanoma skin cancer, and potentially reduce morbidity and health care costs. We are designing a larger study to evaluate the accuracy and utility of the software with patients seen in clinical practice.

Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the chest CT plus chest FDG-PET strategy in Japan. Design: Decision-tree sensitivity analysis based on the two competing strategies of chest CT-alone vs chest CT plus chest FDG-PET, Study selection: A simulation of 1,000 patients in whom NSCLC, stage IIIB or less, was suspected was created using baselines of other relevant variables in regard to sensitivity, specificity, mortality, life expectancy, and cost from published data, Methods: We surveyed the relevant literature for the choice of variables. Main outcome measures: Expected marginal cost and expected life expectancy gain for NSCLC patients. Results: The chest CT plus chest FDG-PET strategy yielded an expected life expectancy gain of 0.607 years (7.3 months) per patient, compared with the alternative strategy of chest CT-alone, Using an FDG-PET examination cost of 1.0 x 10(5) yen (around $700 US) per study, the cost increment was 2.18 x 10(5) yen/yr/patient. Conclusions: The chest CT plus chest FDG-PET strategy in patients with NSCLC is unlikely to be cost-effective in Japan. However, patient life expectancy gain would increase as a result of improved staging of NSCLC. These preliminary results should be confirmed by further studies for specific environments.

J	Major, RL				Major, RL			A complexity model and a polynomial algorithm for decision-tree-based feature construction	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						computational complexity; concept learning; feature construction; knowledge acquisition; primitive attributes; rank of decision trees	EXAMPLES	Using decision trees as a concept description language, we examine the time complexity for learning Boolean functions with polynomial-sized disjunctive normal form expressions when feature construction is performed on an initial decision tree containing only primitive attributes. A shortcoming of several feature-construction algorithms found in the literature is that it is difficult to develop time complexity results for them. We illustrate a way to determine a limit on the number of features to use for building more concise trees within a standard amount of time. We introduce a practical algorithm thar forms a finite number of features using a decision tree in a polynomial amount of time. We show empirically that our procedure forms many features that subsequently appear in a tree and the new features aid in producing simpler trees when concepts are being learned from certain problem domains. Expert systems developers can use a method such as this to create a knowledge base of information that contains specific knowledge in the form of If-Then rules.

The purpose of this decision analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, Methods: A decision tree was modeled using the data of 7 published prospective placebo-controlled trials. Infectious complications were classified as grade I (requiring local care), grade II (requiring intravenous antibiotics), or grade III (requiring surgery), Medication costs were estimated from the United States average wholesale prices of the 1998 Red Book. Physician and facility costs were estimated based on the 1998 Medicare costs, A one-way sensitivity analysis was performed by varying the probability rates of the complications associated with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and the costs of their treatment. Results The average cost of prophylactic antibiotics was $13.10, Antibiotic prophylaxis led to expected cost savings of $76.72 per percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, A sensitivity analysis suggested that antibiotic prophylaxis for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was the preferred strategy unless the average probability of grade III complications dropped below an improbably low threshold value of 0.09%, Conclusion: Antibiotic prophylaxis in percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is a cost-effective strategy.

The potential of this algorithm for learning control rules is illustrated by means of the Van de Pol system. A data set of control paths is generated using an existing on-line controller. This is then used to generate a set of quantified linguistic control rules. The effectiveness and robustness of this rule-base is then demonstrated.

J	Frohwein, HI; Lambert, JH				Frohwein, HI; Lambert, JH			Risk of extreme events in multiobjective decision trees part 1. Severe events	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						decision tree; multiple objectives; extreme events; conditional expected value	HAZARDOUS MATERIALS; PROBABILITY-DISTRIBUTIONS; OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS; MODEL	Earlier work with decision trees identified nonseparability as an obstacle to minimizing the conditional expected value, a measure of the risk of extreme events, by the well-known method of averaging out and folding back. This first of two companion papers addresses the conditional expected value that is defined as the expected outcome assuming the exceedance of a threshold beta, where beta is preselected by the decision maker. An approach is proposed to overcome the need to evaluate all policies in order to identify the optimal policy. The approach is based on the insight that the conditional expected value is separable into two constituent elements of risk and can thus be optimized along with other objectives, including the unconditional expected value of the outcome, by using a multiobjective decision tree. An example of sequential decision making for improving highway capacity is given.

J	Frohwein, HI; Haimes, YY; Lambert, JH				Frohwein, HI; Haimes, YY; Lambert, JH			Risk of extreme events in multiobjective decision trees part 2. Rare events	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						decision tree; multiple objectives; extreme events; conditional expected value		Earlier work with decision trees identified nonseparability as an obstacle to minimizing the conditional expected value, a measure of the risk of extreme events, by the well-known method of averaging out and folding back. This second of two companion papers addresses the conditional expected value that is defined as the expected outcome assuming that a random variable is observed only in the upper 100 (1 - alpha) percent of potential outcomes, where cc is a cumulative probability preselected by the decision maker. An approach is proposed to overcome the need to evaluate all policies in order to identify the optimal policy. The approach is based in part on approximating the conditional expected value by using statistics of extremes. An existing convenient approximation of the conditional expected value is shown to be separable into two constituent elements of risk and can thus be optimized, along with other objectives including the unconditional expected Value of the outcome, in a multiobjective decision tree. An example of sequential decision making for remediation or environmental contamination is provided. The importance of the results for risk analyis beyond the minimization of conditional expected values is pointed out.

The case of invasive American species in France	WEED RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th Symposium of the European-Weed-Research-Society on Towards 25 Years	JUL, 1999	BASEL, SWITZERLAND	European Weed Res Soc		invasion; N and S American exotics; agricultural weed; risk assessment; decision tree	PLANTS	In Europe, exotic species are assessed for their potential threat only after they have already become weeds. To test hypotheses underlying risk assessment procedures, 274 North and South American exotic species naturalized in France were compared to differentiate environmental from agricultural weeds and to characterize weeds of several crops. Most agricultural exotic weeds belonged to the Asteraceae and the Poaceae, but proportionally to the total number of invasive species from a family the most successful families were the Amaranthaceae, Euphorbiaceae and Poaceae. Weed status in North and South America was the best predictor of agricultural weed status in France, and a pre-1900 date of introduction was associated with a greater likelihood of having become a major weed. The characteristics of 78 species present in field crops were examined in relation to management practices. In annual crops, the life-cycle compatibility of weeds appeared to be the main factor of selection. Exotic species differed in their C4 photosynthesis pathway in maize and rice. In vineyards, many ecological strategies are possible because the habitat is heterogeneous. Intrageneric comparison of exotic and native species showed a superior relative growth rate and higher biomass production under nutrient-rich conditions for exotics. However, it is still difficult to find a predictive function that fits well with all observed cases of weed invasion.

The current paper tests the performance of a decision-tree-based adaptive production control system operating in a flexible manufacturing cell in more random environments. A decision-tree-based production control system, which periodically chooses, on the basis of the current state of the system, the most appropriate scheduling rule, out of several predetermined ones, is presented. The performance of the decision-tree-based production control system was tested by simulating a flexible manufacturing cell operating in two different operational environments, distinct by the variability of their demand. The decision tree-based-production control system has performed rather well in the produce-to-order environment. However, it does not outperform the alternative scheduling rules in a highly random produce-to-order environment.

J	Glance, LG				Glance, LG			The cost effectiveness of anesthesia workforce models: A simulation approach using decision-analysis modeling	ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA			English	Article							PATIENT OUTCOMES; PROVIDERS; PERSPECTIVE; CLINICIAN; MINNESOTA; MORTALITY; CHAIRMAN; SURGERY	The objective of this study was to evaluate the incremental cost effectiveness of anesthesia workforce staffing scenarios, as a function of skill mix, by using the technique of decision analysis. A decision tree model was constructed to compare the incremental cost effectiveness of alternative delivery systems for anesthesia care from the perspective of the payer. Five different staffing scenarios, ranging from physician-intensive to nurse-intensive, were modeled. in the nurse-intensive model, low- and intermediate-risk patients were cared for by solo certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) and high-risk patients were cared for by physicians. In the physician-intensive model, physicians anesthetized all patients. In the first-, second-, and third-team models, all high-risk patients were cared for by physicians working alone, and all intermediate-risk patients were cared for using an anesthesia care team approach with a ratio of one physician to two CRNAs. The low-risk patients Mere managed by using an anesthesia care team approach with physician to CRNA ratios of 1:2, 1:4 and 1:8 in the first; second-, and third-team models, respectively. The findings of this decision-analysis model suggest that physician-only anesthesia is not cost effective. However, the third-team model is cost effective when compared with the nurse-intensive model. Implications: An anesthesia care-team approach with a physician to certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) ratio of 1:2 is the preferred staffing scenario for intermediate-risk patients. Although medical direction of CRNAs caring for low-risk patients is cost-effective, the small improvement in outcome resulting from increasing the physician to CRNA ratio from 1:8 to 1: 1 may not be justified by the added cost.

More precisely, we provide a diagnostic model that discriminate between cerebellum-pontine angle (CPA) tumors and otorhinolaryngological (ENT) disorders. Usually in order to distinguish between CPA tumors and ENT disorders one must perform clinical-neurological examination together with expensive radiological imagery (CT and MRI). The proposed model was obtained through artificial intelligence methods and presented a good accuracy level (88.4%) when tested against new cases, considering only clinical examination without radiological imagery results.

J	Chawla, M; Ellis, RP				Chawla, M; Ellis, RP			The impact of financing and quality changes on health care demand in Niger	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article							USER FEES; ACCESS; PRICE	This paper assesses the demand effects of a cost recovery and quality improvement pilot study conducted in Niger in 1993. Direct user charges and indirect insurance payments were implemented in government health care facilities in different parts of the country, and were preceded or accompanied by quality changes in these facilities. Decision-making by patients is modelled as a three-stage process of reporting an illness, seeking treatment and choice of provider; and multinomial nested legit techniques are used to estimate the parameters of the decision-tree. Overall, the results give a reasonably favourable impression of the policy changes. In neither case is there evidence of serious reductions in access or increases in cost. Particularly notable is that despite an increase in formal user charges, the observed decline in rates of visits is statistically insignificant, suggesting the success of measures to improve quality of health care in public facilities. The observed increase in the probability of formal visits in the district with indirect payments is also striking. Both contrast with the control region of Illela, where neither user charges were introduced nor were any efforts made to improve quality. The data suggest that higher utilization of formal care, probably due to improvements in quality, outweighed the decrease in utilization that may have come about due to introduction of cost recovery, so that the net effect of the policy changes was an increase in utilization. Quality considerations appear to be important in ensuring the long-term success of cost sharing.

In intelligent systems for paper document processing this information capture process is based on knowledge of the specific layout and logical structures of the documents. This article proposes the application of machine learning techniques to acquire the specific knowledge required by an intelligent document processing system, named WISDOM++, that manages printed documents, such as letters and journals. Knowledge is represented by means of decision trees and first-order rules automatically generated from a set of training documents. In particular, an incremental decision tree learning system is applied for the acquisition of decision trees used for the classification of segmented blocks, while a first-order learning system is applied for the induction of rules used for the layout-based classification and understanding of documents. Issues concerning the incremental induction of decision trees and the handling of both numeric and symbolic data in first-order rule learning are discussed, and the validity of the proposed solutions is empirically evaluated by processing a set of real printed documents.

We compared the cost of cystoscopy and cytology (standard care) to that of urinary markers (modified care) for patients with a history of superficial bladder cancer. Materials and Methods: We constructed a decision analysis model that compared the 2 strategies for a hypothetical followup interval of 3 years. Probabilities required for the decision tree were based on a cohort of 361 patients diagnosed with superficial bladder cancer from 1987 to 1997. Sensitivity analyses were used to determine whether test sensitivity and specificity would affect cost thresholds. Costs for each strategy were then applied to actual practice patterns. Results: The cost of modified care ranged from $158 to $228 for each followup visit when using a urinary marker with a sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 77%, respectively. The cost of standard care was $240 for each followup visit. Based on sensitivity analyses the probability of disease recurrence and urinary marker accuracy were important determinants of expected costs. Mean number of followup assessments for patients followed more than 3 years was 4.3, 2.2 and 1.5 for years 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Cumulative costs of modified care were lower than those of standard care. Conclusions: Urinary marker testing for followup of patients with superficial bladder cancer is less expensive than the standard method of cystoscopy and urinary cytology based on our model. Future studies will be required to consider other factors that could affect the cost advantage of urinary markers, including indirect costs, the psychosocial impact of testing and different surveillance frequencies.

J							NAMS	A decision tree for the use of estrogen replacement therapy or hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women: Consensus opinion of the North American Menopause Society	MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY			English	Article						decision tree; estrogen replacement therapy; hormone replacement therapy; menopause; NAMS consensus opinion	BREAST-CANCER; URINARY-INCONTINENCE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CONTROLLED TRIAL; BONE LOSS; RISK; OSTEOPOROSIS; ALENDRONATE; PREVENTION; ESTRADIOL	Objective: Menopause is associated with physiologic changes that may have negative effects on quality of life in some women and/or that may increase morbidity and mortality secondary to osteoporosis and/or coronary heart disease. Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) and combined estrogen/progestogen therapy (hormone replacement therapy [HRT]) play an important role in reducing these negative effects. The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) sought: to develop treatment algorithms that could assist the clinician in deciding whether to recommend ERT/HRT to postmenopausal women. Design: NAMS held a closed conference of experts to develop a decision tree that outlined the rational use of ERT/HRT in postmenopausal women on the basis of risks versus benefits. The proceedings of the conference were used to assist the NAMS Board of Trustees in developing this consensus opinion of the Society. Results: On the basis of the conference proceedings, NAMS developed three algorithms for the clinician to use as a tool in deciding whether to recommend ERT/HRT to a woman who is postmenopausal: (1) menopause-related symptoms, (2) cardiovascular risk, and (3) osteoporosis risk, Conclusions: The goal of ERT/HRT is to enhance women's quality of life as well as to reduce the risks of death and disability associated with osteoporosis and coronary heart disease. The decision to initiate ERT/HRT must be individualized according to each woman's needs.

The reevaluation process for outpatients recalled for Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia has not been standardized. Children who return ill or with new serious focal infections require admission and parenteral antibiotic therapy. Limited data exist to guide the follow-up management of those patients identified as having occult pneumococcal bacteremia. Objectives. Characterize the outcomes of outpatients with pneumococcal bacteremia based on their evaluation at follow-up. For patients who are well-appearing without serious focal infection, propose a management scheme for reevaluation. Methods. Retrospective review of outpatients with pneumococcal bacteremia. Patients with immunocompromise, those identified with focal bacterial infection at the initial visit, or those admitted at the initial visit were excluded. Data were collected from the initial visit (when blood culture drawn) and follow-up visit with regard to clinical parameters, laboratory data, diagnoses, and any antibiotic treatment. Decision tree analysis was used to generate a model to predict children at high risk for persistent bacteremia (PB). Results. A total of 548 episodes of pneumococcal bacteremia were studied. Seventy-three children received no antibiotic, 239 oral antibiotic, and 236 parenteral antibiotic at the initial visit. Median age, temperature, and white blood cell (WBC) count were 13.5 months, 40.0 degrees C, and 20 400/mm(3). Forty-one patients had PB or new focal infections (15 with PB alone, 4 had focal infection and PB). Eight patients had meningitis at follow-up. Ninety-two percent returned because of notification of the positive blood culture result. A repeat blood culture was obtained in 92%, 23% had a lumbar puncture, 33% had a chest radiograph, and 12% were admitted. PB was associated with the antibiotic treatment group, elevation of temperature, and WBC count at follow-up. A simple management scheme using 2 sequential decision nodes of antibiotic treatment (none vs any) and then temperature at follow-up (>38.8 degrees C) would have predicted 16/19 patients with PB (sensitivity = .84 and specificity = .86). Conclusions. All patients with pneumococcal bacteremia need prompt reevaluation. For well-appearing patients without new focal infection, the utility of diagnostic testing (specifically repeat blood cultures) and the need for admission may be determined by the use of antibiotics at the initial evaluation and the presence of fever at follow-up. The majority of patients can be managed as outpatients entirely. Patients who did not receive antibiotics at the initial evaluation and those treated with oral antibiotics but remain febrile are at the highest risk for persistent bacteremia.

To determine what factors primary care pediatricians believe are important in establishing the initial diagnosis of childhood asthma and to identify variations in physicians' beliefs concerning this clinical decision. Study Design. Massachusetts American Academy of Pediatrics Fellows were surveyed about their beliefs concerning the importance of 20 clinical factors associated with establishing the initial diagnosis of asthma. Results. Most clinicians considered recurrent wheeze (96%), symptomatic improvement with a bronchodilator (90%), recurrent cough (89%), exclusion of alternative diagnoses (87%), and suggestive peak flow findings (82%) as important in diagnosing asthma. However, there was substantial heterogeneity among clinicians as to which combinations of factors they each considered relevant; for example, only 60% identified all 5 of the above factors to be necessary or important. Further, <50% identified presence of any of the 20 factors as necessary. Although national guidelines cite objective assessment of pulmonary function as essential, spirometry and peak expiratory flow testing were identified as necessary by only 8% and 10%, respectively. Two factors believed to contribute to establishing the asthma diagnosis contradicted the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines and expert opinion (age >2 years and absence of fever during episodes) and these beliefs were more likely held by those clinicians in practice for >5 years. Conclusions. The majority of pediatricians believe several common clinical factors establish a diagnosis of childhood asthma, but disagree over what combinations of these factors are important. Some misconceptions persist despite wide dissemination of clinical practice guidelines. We believe that future asthma guidelines will need to organize diagnostic criteria in an easily understood format, like a decision tree, to facilitate early recognition of asthma in young children.

J	Nielsen, K; Fiore, MC				Nielsen, K; Fiore, MC			Cost-benefit analysis of sustained-release bupropion, nicotine patch, or both for smoking cessation	PREVENTIVE MEDICINE			English	Article						smoking cessation; bupropion; nicotine transdermal patch; cost-benefit; economic analysis	HEALTH-CARE COSTS; WORK	Background. The nicotine transdermal patch (NTP) has been shown previously to be a cost-effective smoking cessation intervention. This is the first economic analysis comparing the NTP with the only non-nicotine-containing pharmacological intervention, bupropion HCl. Methods. Decision-tree analysis, based on a previously published cost-benefit smoking-cessation model, was used to determine the optimal treatment from the standpoint of costs versus benefits, from the employer's perspective. Base-case probabilities of successful quitting in our model came from clinical trial point-prevalence data at the end of a 1-year follow-up study (N = 893) comparing placebo, bupropion, NTP, and bupropion/NTP in combination, administered along with minimal counseling. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the effects of variations in base-case assumptions regarding the monetary benefits that would accrue if an intervention were successful, probabilities of quitting, drug costs, cost of lost work time for a health care provider visit, and cost of the visit itself. Results. The analysis showed that bupropion is more cost-beneficial than either NTP or bupropion/NTP, with a net benefit in the first post-quit year of up to $338 per employee who attempts to quit compared with $26 for NTP, $178 for the two in combination, and $258 for placebo. These results were robust to most plausible variations in the assumptions used in the model. One exception was the monetary benefit of successful intervention (assumed in the base-case to be $1,654). If this benefit were actually less than $1,112, placebo (i.e., minimal counseling with no pharmacological intervention) would be more cost-beneficial than any of the active treatments. Conclusion. From an employer's perspective, bupropion 300 mg/day for 9 weeks is a more cost-beneficial smoking cessation intervention than the nicotine patch, and under most scenarios, bupropion is also more cost-beneficial than placebo.

Methods: Data points for the decision analysis were obtained from three sources: 1) prevalence of BAT and the sensitivity and specificity of each diagnostic modality were determined through a criteria-based review of the literature; 2) rate of BAT necessitating immediate intervention, perioperative complication rate, and operative mortality rate were calculated using data from the authors' institution's trauma registry; and 3) outcome utilities were determined lay telephone survey of adults in a random sample of households in the region. The decision tree was constructed and evaluated in standard fashion. For each diagnostic modality, the authors calculated the EU using the minimum, mean, and maximum sensitivity and specificity across a range of prevalence. Mean outcome utilities were used for each branch of the tree when calculating the EU. Results: The EU of CT was consistently lower than the EUs of DPL and US at all levels of prevalence. However, the rank order of the EUs of US and DPL varied with the prevalence of BAT. When the prevalence was <30%, the EU of US was higher than that for DPL. When the prevalence was 30-40%, the EUs were similar. When the prevalence was >40%, the EU of US was less than that of DPL. Conclusions: Among institutions operating under constraints similar to those used in this model, the optimal diagnostic modality for the evaluation of BAT can be determined based on the sensitivity and specificity of the modality at their institution and the prevalence of BAT in their patient population.

Aim: To determine the benefit of post-treatment assessment of H. pylori eradication in patients with uncomplicated duodenal ulcer. Materials and methods: A decision analysis was performed in patients with uncomplicated duodenal ulcer who were H. pylori-positive and had received eradication therapy. A decision tree was devised to compare the costs per patient of two different strategies: (a) systematic performance of post-treatment urea breath test and new treatment if positive; and (b) clinical follow-up, C-13-urea breath test if dyspeptic symptoms recurred and eradication treatment if the test was positive. Results: Post-eradication C-13-urea breath test was notably more expensive than clinical follow-up, both in a low-cost per care setting (197 vs. 132 Euros) and in a high-cost per care (614 vs. 340 US $) scenario. This conclusion remained stable for a wide range of variations of the variables included in the decision tree (e.g. cure rates of eradication treatment, cost of the urea breath test or sensitivity, and specificity of urea breath test to detect eradication). Conclusion: In patients with uncomplicated duodenal ulcer, evaluation of eradication after H. pylori treatment markedly increases costs with no clear improvement in results and therefore should not be performed routinely.

This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of various imaging and biopsy strategies for characterizing adrenal masses in patients with newly diagnosed non-small cell carcinoma of the lung. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A decision-analysis model was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of nine strategies. Initial imaging included unenhanced CT using an adenoma or nonadenoma threshold of 0 or 10 H or in- and opposed-phase MR imaging. When initial imaging did not confirm an adenoma, CT-guided biopsy or subsequent imaging was performed. Medicare reimbursement was used as a surrogate of cost. Net costs were calculated as the difference in costs between two limbs of the decision tree. Net benefits were calculated as the difference between strategies and were calculated for life expectancy in years. MR imaging, CT, and biopsy accuracy, average life expectancy, and surgical mortality rates were based on the literature. RESULTS. The base case analysis determined that the most cost-effective strategy was CT with an adenoma or nonadenoma threshold of 10 H followed by MR imaging, if necessary. CT with a threshold of 0 H followed by biopsy, if necessary, was the least costly. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between these two strategies was $16,370 per year of life gained. CONCLUSION.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are distressing for patients and may increase costs in an ambulatory surgical unit. The authors compared the cost-effectiveness of four prophylactic intravenous regimens for PONV: 4 mg ondansetron, 0.625 mg droperidol, 1.25 mg droperidol, and placebo. Methods: Adult surgical outpatients at high risk for PONV were studied. Study drugs were administered intravenously within 20 min of induction of nitrous oxide-isoflurane or enflurane anesthesia. A decision-tree analysis was used to group patients into 12 mutually exclusive subgroups based on treatment and outcome. Costs were calculated for the prevention and treatment of PONV, Cost-effectiveness analysis was per formed for each group. Results: Two thousand sixty-one patients were enrolled. Efficacy data for study drugs have been previously reported, and the database from that study was used for pharmacoeconomic analysis. The mean-median total cost per patient who received prophylactic treatment with 4 mg ondansetron, 0.625 mg droperidol, 1.25 mg droperidol, and placebo were $112 or $16.44, $109 or $0.63, $104 or $0.51, and $164 or $51.20, respectively (P = 0.001, active treatment groups vs. placebo). The use of a prophylactic antiemetic agent significantly increased patient satisfaction (P < 0.05), Personnel costs in managing PONV and unexpected hospital admission constitute major cost components In our analysis. Exclusion of nursing labor costs from the calculation did not alter the overall conclusions regarding the relative costs of antiemetic therapy. Conclusion The use of prophylactic antiemetic therapy in high-risk ambulatory surgical patients was more effective in preventing PONV and achieved greater patient satisfaction at a lower cost compared with placebo. The use of 1.25 mg droperidol Intravenously was associated with greater effectiveness, lower costs, and similar patient satisfaction compared with 0.625 mg droperidol intravenously and 4 mg ondansetron intravenously.

The crucial point in recognizing gestures is that it requires great computational power to deal with spatio-temporal patterns. In this paper, a syntactic approach is proposed to provide a simple recognition algorithm. In order to verify the proposed method, we apply it to recognize 3D arm movements involved in the Taiwanese Sign Language. We extract prime patterns from the input patterns. The classification is then accomplished by deciding which one of possible arm movements can produce the sequence of primary patterns. Experiments were conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the method. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of the current study was to determine the diagnostic value of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzyme analysis for the diagnosis of CNS involvement in hematooncologic patients. METHODS. The study was comprised of 63 consecutive hematooncologic patients without previous CNS disease who underwent CSF examination as an integral part of their initial staging procedures (44 patients) or for the evaluation of neurologic symptoms (19 patients). Fifteen of these patients had CNS involvement by leukemia or lymphoma. The LDH isoenzyme pattern was established in the CSF of all patients and analyzed by the classification and regression trees (CART) method to construct a decision tree for the prediction of CNS involvement. An additional group of 30 consecutive patients comprised a validation set that was used for cross-validation of the CART-derived decision tree. RESULTS. A decision tree, with a single split at LDH5 greater than or equal to 2.8% for the prediction of CNS involvement, was constructed and validated by data from a validation set of patients. The decision tree had a sensitivity of 93% and a negative predictive value of 98%. One patient (1.6%) and 2 patients (6.6%) were misclassified in the derivation and validation sets, respectively. Overall, in the combined derivation and validation patient population, the decision tree misclassified 3.2% of patients, whereas CSF cytologic examination misclassified 4.3% of patients. CONCLUSIONS. Analysis of the LDH isoenzyme pattern in CSF fluid may be helpful in the evaluation of CNS involvement in patients with hematologic malignancies. The combination of CSF cytology and LDH isoenzyme analysis may improve the sensitivity of CSF cytology significantly. (C) 2000 American Cancer Society.

We compared the cost-effectiveness of several realistic strategies involving IVF using no treatment as the reference strategy. Design: A decision tree was constructed for a subfertile couple in which the clinician had to decide whether to offer treatment with IVF. No treatment at all was used as the reference strategy. Setting: An analytic decision-making framework. Patient(s): Hypothetical subfertile couples. Intervention(s): Two potential treatment approaches: three IVF cycles performed as soon as possible, or no treatment performed initially and then three or four IVF cycles performed if a pregnancy resulting in a live birth does not occur naturally after 21/2 years. Main Outcome Measure(s): The cost of establishing one pregnancy that results in a live birth. Result(s): The cost-effectiveness of IVF depended not only on the costs and expected success rates of IVF itself but also on the couple-specific chances of treatment-independent conception. Consequently, the cost-effectiveness of NF is strongly dependent on the age of the female partner. This finding corresponds with everyday clinical experience.

J	Zanagger, P; Detsky, A				Zanagger, P; Detsky, A			Computer-assisted decision analysis in orthopedics - Resurfacing the patella in total knee arthroplasty as an example	JOURNAL OF ARTHROPLASTY			English	Article						decision analysis; knee prosthesis; patella	PRIMER; REPLACEMENT	The purpose of the present study was to illustrate the use of computer-assisted decision analysis in making decisions in the field of orthopaedic surgery, using the choice between resurfacing and not resurfacing the patella in total knee arthroplasty as an example. We used a decision analysis technique based on probability theory and on Bayesian logic, with the help of an especially developed computer software. The process involves building a decision tree, searching for probabilities and utilities in the literature, folding back the tree to compute the baseline result, and running sensitivity analyses. Our literature search provided 26 useful articles, only 3 of which were randomized controlled trials. In the baseline analysis, both options were rated similarly, with resurfacing the patella faring slightly better. Sensitivity analyses revealed that Mor resurfacing becomes the procedure of choice if the probability of postoperative anterior knee pain with an unresurfaced patella falls below 14%, or if the probability of having pain with a resurfaced patella rises above 8%, or if the utility of patellar implant failure falls below 80% of the utility of a perfect health state. Computer-assisted decision analysis is a promising, evidence-based tool to assist clinical decision making in orthopaedic surgery. However, its validity is limited by the poor quality of data found in the orthopaedic literature, especially the scarcity of randomized controlled trials.

Following the basic idea behind CBR, the solutions of previously solved problems are employed to aid finding the solutions for new problems. A list of feature-value pairs is insufficient to represent all the necessary information. We show that attribute graphs can represent more information and thus can help to retrieve re-usable cases that have similar structures to the new problems. The case base is organised as a decision tree to store the attribute graphs of solved problems hierarchically. An example is given to illustrate the retrieval, re-use and adaptation of structured cases. The results from our experiments show the effectiveness of the retrieval and adaptation in the proposed method. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

The learning process is supervised and obtains a language model oriented to resolve POS ambiguities, consisting of a set of statistical decision trees expressing distribution of tags and words in some relevant contexts. The acquired decision trees have been directly used in a tagger that is both relatively simple and fast, and which has been tested and evaluated on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus with competitive accuracy. However, better results can be obtained by translating the trees into rules to feed a flexible relaxation labeling based tagger. In this direction we describe a tagger which is able to use information of any kind (n-grams, automatically acquired constraints, linguistically motivated manually written constraints, etc.), and in particular to incorporate the machine-learned decision trees. Simultaneously, we address the problem of tagging when only limited training material is available, which is crucial in any process of constructing, from scratch, an annotated corpus. We show that high levels of accuracy can be achieved with our system in this situation, and report some results obtained when using it to develop a 5.5 million words Spanish corpus from scratch.

Methods: This cost-benefit analysis was based on a decision-analytic approach. The British strategy included screening by a first-trimester ultrasound at 10-14 weeks for nuchal translucency thickness, and the American strategy included only second-trimester screening by using maternal age and maternal serum screening. The key probabilities of the decision-tree analysis and all cost estimates were based on American standards. The best scenario of the British strategy assumed ultrasound nuchal translucency thickness sensitivity (for detecting Down syndrome) of 80% and a false-positive rate of 5% and the worst scenario assumed a sensitivity of 50% and a false-positive rate of 10%. The results were expressed in annual costs based on approximately 4 million births per year in the United States. Results: As compared with do-nothing, the American strategy was found to allow savings of approximately $96 million per year and the best scenario for the British strategy was savings of approximately $5 million per year. The financial costs of the British and American strategies would be comparable only if the first-trimester ultrasound had a sensitivity of 80% and a false-positive rate of 5% in detecting Down syndrome. Conclusion: The British strategy does not appear to be economically beneficial in the United States even under the most ideal scenarios of ultrasound accuracy.

Analysis of the fundamental description of toxicity (dT/dE = dT/dDxdD/dKxdK/dE, where T stands for toxicity, D for toxicodynamics, K for toxicokinetics and E for exposure) yields the recognition of three independent time scales, the first being an intrinsic property of a given compound (what does the chemical do to the organism), which is the dynamic time scale. The second time scale is an intrinsic property of a the organism (what does the organism do to the chemical), which represents the kinetic time scale. The frequency of exposure denotes the third time scale, which is independent of the dynamic and kinetic time scales. Frequency of exposure depends on the experimental design or on nature. but not on the organism or substance. A liminal condition occurs when the frequency becomes so high that it is indistinguishable from continuous exposure. Continuous exposure forces the two other lime scales to become synchronized thereby reducing complexity to three variables: dose, effect and one time scale. Keeping one of those variables constant allows for the study of the other two variables reproducibly under isoeffective or isodosic or isotemporal conditions. However. any departure from continuous exposure will introduce the full complexity of four independent variables (dose and kinetic, dynamic and frequency time scales) impacting on the effect (dependent variable) at the same time. The examples discussed in this paper demonstrate how nature in the form of long half-lives provides liminal conditions when either kinetic or dynamic half lives force synchronization of all three time scales. However. for compounds having very short dynamic or kinetic half-lives, only continuous exposure will provide a synchronized time scale. A decision tree-type approach is being used to illustrate how to reduce the enormous complexity generated by five variables (dose, effect and up to three time scales) in toxicology to manageable proportions by identifying and modeling the rate-determining (-limiting) step(s) in the manifestation of toxicity.

The development of a comprehensive training, testing and validation site network for the globe to support supervised and unsupervised classification models is fraught with problems imposed by scale, bioclimatic representativeness of the sites, availability of ancillary map and high spatial resolution remote sensing data, landscape heterogeneity, and vegetation variability. The System for Terrestrial Ecosystem Parameterization (STEP)-a model for characterizing site biophysical, vegetation and landscape parameters to be used for algorithm training and testing and validation-has been developed to support supervised land cover mapping. This system was applied in Central America using two classification systems based on 428 sites. The results indicate that: (1) it is possible to generate site data efficiently at the regional scale; (2) implementation of a supervised model using artificial neural network and decision tree classification algorithms is feasible at the regional level with classification accuracies of 75-88%; and (3) the STEP site parameter model is effective for generating multiple classification systems and thus supporting the development of global surface biophysical parameters.

Focusing on conventional hidden Markov model technology, we review implicit use of linguistic features as questions in decision-tree design for both coarticulation and pronunciation modelling and describe possibilities for more explicit use. The importance of conditioning on (hierarchical) syllable and prosodic structure is discussed, and the problem of modelling relative timing of feature-dependent acoustic cues is raised as a key limitation of current models.

A simple diagnostic procedure has been developed to automatically ensure that the quality of results is not compromised by system degradation. The diagnosis procedure was studied in two different stages of instrument operation: the normal operating stage and the warm-up stage. For normal operating stage monitoring, a decision tree was derived with the C4.5 induction engine applied to As-based signals allowing instrument performance to be classified as either normal or abnormal. Abnormal signals were further classified as to their probable cause. Signals present in both deionized water and 0.5% nitric acid spectra are sufficient for diagnosis with an accuracy of 96.0% and 94.0%, respectively, allowing the use of 'blank' solutions to monitor instrument performance. For the warm-up stage diagnosis, a standard solution containing Li, In, Ba and Bi, was used. Stepwise regression was applied as the key factor filter while partial least square (PLS) was adapted to be the classifier. In addition to the modeling test, the importance of the intensities and intensity ratios of different masses was studied. By eliminating the standard element signals from the model, the possibility of using water/nitric acid as test solutions was also studied. The overall prediction accuracy for the warm-up stage is approximately 92% using the standard solution or either the water or nitric acid type blank solutions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Design: Measures of utility including sensitivity, specificity, and predictive power were examined. Independent t tests and nonparametric statistics were used to evaluate group differences where appropriate. Setting: The stroke and geriatric unit of a freestanding urban medical rehabilitation hospital. Subjects: In study 1, 173 older, consecutively admitted medical rehabilitation patients completed all cognitive measures. In study 2, a separate sample of 313 older adults completed the Geriatric Depression Scale during admission. Main Outcome Measure: The MacNeill-Lichtenberg Decision Tree (MLDT) was compared with the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, and the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale. Results: Study 1: The decision tree accurately triaged 87% of mental health problems and allowed for deferral of 41% of cases, for whom further assessment was unnecessary. The MLDT was superior to the MMSE, with higher sensitivity and a lower failure rate. Study 2. The emotional status component of the MLDT was useful in triaging cases for depression evaluation. Conclusion: The MLDT was useful in prioritizing cases with regard to mental health problems leg, dementia, depression) and making quick referral decisions. The MLDT is a unique instrument that not only evaluates cognitive status, but also considers psychosocial factors and emotional status in older adults.

Most of these galaxies will be newly cataloged objects. The survey catalog will have both high completeness and reliability down to J = 15.0 mag and K(s) = 13.5 mag, equivalent to 1.6 and 2.9 mJy, respectively. Galaxies as small as 10 " are resolved, and those as large as similar to 2.'5 are fully imaged. 2MASS will discover galaxies never seen before in the "zone of avoidance" caused by the obscuring effects of Galactic dust and gas, limited only by the extreme number of stars at very low Galactic latitude, especially toward the Galactic center. This paper describes the basic algorithms used to detect and characterize extended sources in the 2MASS database and catalog. Critical procedures include tracking the point-spread function, image background removal, artifact removal, photometry and basic parameterization, star-galaxy discrimination, and object classification using a decision tree technique. We introduce and provide examples of the types of extended sources that 2MASS detects across the sky, including galaxies, Galactic nebulae and resolved stellar objects, multiple stars and clusters, and, finally, artifacts arising from bright stars and transient events. A future paper will provide a full statistical analysis and verification of the completeness, reliability, and integrity of the first release catalog, as well as some of the basic scientific results of the catalog, including galaxy colors, number counts, and redshift distribution.

The current study assesses artificial intelligence methods to identify prostate carcinoma patients at low risk for lymph node spread. If patients can be assigned accurately to a low risk group, unnecessary lymph node dissections can be avoided, thereby reducing morbidity and costs. METHODS. A rule-derivation technology for simple decision-tree analysis was trained and validated using patient data from a large database (4133 patients) to derive low risk cutoff, values for Gleason sum and prostate specific antigen (PSA) level. An empiric analysis was used to derive a low risk cutoff value for clinical TNM stage. These cutoff Values then were applied to 2 additional, smaller databases (227 and 330 patients, respectively) from separate institutions. RESULTS. The decision-tree protocol derived cutoff values of less than or equal to 6 for Gleason sum and less than or equal to 10.6 ng/mL for PSA. The empiric analysis yielded a clinical TNM stage low risk cutoff value of less than or equal to T2a. When these cutoff values were applied to the larger database, 44% of patients were classified as being at low risk for lymph node metastases (0.8% false-negative rate). When the same cutoff values were applied to the smaller databases, between II and 43% of patients were classified as low risk with a false-negative rate of between 0.0 and 0.7%. CONCLUSIONS, The results of the current study indicate that a population of prostate carcinoma patients at low risk for lymph node metastases can be identified accurately using a simple decision algorithm that considers preoperative PSA, Gleason sum, and clinical TNM stage. The risk of lymph node metastases in these patients is less than or equal to 1%; therefore, pelvic lymph node dissection may be avoided safely. The implications of these findings in surgical and nonsurgical treatment are significant. (C) 2000 American Cancer Society.

This paper deals with a supervised approach to SAR image classification that exploits spatial features within a hierarchical classification framework. In contrast to the classical approach, which makes the hypothesis about sample data independence, in the proposed method, the spatial dependence of neighboring pixels is taken into account to estimate relatively simple statistical features such as sample spatial mean and sample spatial variance, thus allowing contextual information to he easily handled. The Bhattacharyya distribution distance is used during the training phase, and the generated tree is applied during the test phase. After this, both phases are based on the proposed features. As a result, second-order statistics play a major role in the present classification problem, Experimental results on different SAR data sets are reported. It is shown that the accuracy of the proposed method is better than that of the ML classifier and that the new method is also computationally more convenient.

J	Amin, A				Amin, A			Recognition of hand-printed Latin characters based on generalized Hough transform and decision tree learning techniques	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						parallel thinning algorithm; Latin characters; Hough transform; feature extraction; machine learning C4.5	MACHINE RECOGNITION; HEBREW CHARACTERS; ARABIC TEXT; HANDWRITTEN	This paper presents a new technique for the recognition of hand-printed Latin characters using machine learning. Conventional methods have relied on manually constructed dictionaries which are not only tedious to construct but also difficult to make tolerant to variation in writing styles. The advantages of machine learning are that it can generalize over a large degree of variation between writing styles, and recognition rules can be constructed by example. Characters are scanned into the computer and preprocessing techniques transform the bit-map representation of the characters into a set of primitives which can be represented in an attribute base form. A set of such representations for each character is then input to C4.5 which produces a decision tree for classifying each character.

Setting: Department of Ophthalmology, Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris VI University, Paris, Methods: Topographies of 208 corneas were evaluated. The corneas were from 8 groups of patients classified by the following diagnoses: normal, regular astigmatism, cataract, radial keratotmy, photorefractive keratectomy, myopic keratomileusis, penetrating keratoplasty (PKP), and keratoconus. Nine statistical indices derived from EyeSys data, 2 Holladay Diagnosis Summary indices (coefficient of uniformity and coefficient of as phercity [Asph]), and our refractive power symmetry index were studied. A training set of 104 corneas was used to determine the most efficient threshold value of each index based on sensitivity and specificity curves. Decision trees combining 2 indices were generated. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated in a validation set composed of the remaining 104 corneas. Results: Based on the results of the training set, the optimum indices were SDSD (standard deviation of the standard deviations of the radii of curvature of each ring) and Asph. In the validation set, the decision tree using these indices featured 88.5% sensitivity and 94.9% specificity the 4 false-positive cases were in corneas in the PKP group of patients. Conclusions: Clinically apparent keratoconus can be detected among normal corneas and irregular corneal shape patterns using the EyeSys System 2000 data and a decision tree combining 2 indices.

Biochemical studies in laryngeal cancer have shown a potential prognostic significance of cathepsin D content determination. We studied immunohistochemical positivity of cathepsin D in tumor epithelium and stroma of 61 surgical specimens of squamous cell laryngeal cancer. Immunohistochemical reaction was quantitatively assessed using a PC-based image analysis system SFORM-VAMS. The results were correlated to clinical and morphological parameters and survival. Immunohistochemical positivity was noted in neoplastic cells and tumor stroma. Significant prognostic value for cathepsin D was established separately for epithelial tumor component and tumor stroma using log-rank test, the Cox proportional hazards regression model, and C4.5 machine learning system. In all groups, patients above the median cathepsin D staining showed significantly shorter survival time. C4.5 machine learning system extracted cutoff values for the decision tree that defines the probabilities of patients survival and death with high sensitivity (92.8% alive, 73.6% dead), 100% specificity, and 86.9% accuracy. This makes immunohistochemical cathepsin D estimation an independent prognostic parameter in laryngeal carcinomas within a 5-year period from the time of tumor surgery.

In Study 1, standard machine learning techniques were used to create a decision tree that could be used to classify 8124 different mushrooms as being edible or poisonous on the basis of 21 different Features (Schlimmer, 1987). In Study 2, extra output learning was used to insert this decision tree into a PDP network being trained on the identical problem. An interpretation of the trained network revealed a perfect mapping from its internal structure to the decision tree, representing a precise translation of the classical theory to the connectionist model. In Study 3, a second network was trained on the mushroom problem without using extra output learning. An interpretation of this second network revealed a different algorithm for solving the mushroom problem, demonstrating that the Study 2 network was indeed a proper theory translation.

J	Grobman, WA; Peaceman, AM; Socol, ML				Grobman, WA; Peaceman, AM; Socol, ML			Cost-effectiveness of elective cesarean delivery after one prior low transverse cesarean	OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY			English	Article							UTERINE RUPTURE; VAGINAL BIRTH; TRIAL; LABOR; SECTION; WOMEN; RISK	Objective: This analysis was undertaken to better understand the costs and health consequences of a trial of labor after cesarean when compared with a policy of routine elective repeat cesarean delivery. Methods: A decision-tree model incorporating a Markov analysis was used to examine the reproductive life of a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 pregnant women whose only prior pregnancy was delivered through a low transverse cesarean incision. Using this model, the policy of performing routine elective cesarean delivery was compared with a policy of allowing a trial of labor. Main outcome measures were maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, total costs to the health care system, and cost per major neonatal complication avoided (death or permanent neurologic sequelae). Results: The consequences of routine elective cesarean delivery for a second birth are significant, with an additional 117,748 cesarean deliveries, 5500 maternal morbid events, and $179 million incurred during the reproductive life of 100,000 women. The prevention of one major adverse neonatal outcome requires 1591 cesarean deliveries and $2.4 million. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the analysis. Conclusion: Routine elective cesarean for a second delivery for women with a prior low transverse cesarean incision results in an excess of maternal morbidity and mortality and a high cost to the medical system.

J	Crowley, SJ; Tognarini, D; Desmond, PV; Lees, M				Crowley, SJ; Tognarini, D; Desmond, PV; Lees, M			Cost-effectiveness analysis of lamivudine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B	PHARMACOECONOMICS			English	Article							TERM FOLLOW-UP; CHRONIC ACTIVE HEPATITIS; CIRRHOSIS TYPE-B; INTERFERON-ALFA; ALPHA-INTERFERON; E-ANTIGEN; HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA; PROGNOSTIC FACTORS; CONTROLLED TRIAL; VIRAL-HEPATITIS	Objective: To estimate the short term and long term cost effectiveness, from a healthcare perspective, associated with the introduction of lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B. Design: The analysis used a 2-step modelling approach. A decision tree was used to estimate clinical outcomes and costs after 1 year. The 1-year results were then extrapolated to 70 years using a Markov model. Patients: The study population comprised hypothetical cohorts of patients with chronic hepatitis B, representative of those likely to receive treatment in clinical practice in Australia. Main outcome measures and results: In the short term, more patients seroconverted when lamivudine was available, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 3341 Australian dollars ($A) per additional seroconversion. In the long term, the introduction of lamivudine increased life expectancy by 3.9 years [3.2 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)] compared with when interferon-alpha was the only treatment, or 4.6 years (3.8 QALYs) compared with no treatment. There were reductions in lifetime risk of developing compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma of 5, 11 and 11%, respectively, when lamivudine was available. The incremental cost of having lamivudine available, as opposed to interferon-alpha only, was $A633 per year of life saved or $A735 per QALY. Conclusion: The introduction of lamivudine is expected to reduce and delay the progression of chronic hepatitis B, increasing the life expectancy and quality of life of patients for a small overall increase in healthcare costs.

Design: Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive power were calculated for prediction of cognition and depressive symptoms. Correlational analyses were performed to examine the relationship between demographic variables and MLDT measures. Correlational and logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the utility of the cognitive component of the MLDT. Setting: A freestanding urban, university affiliated rehabilitation hospital in the Midwest. Participants: One hundred eighty-seven elderly, predominantly African American medical rehabilitation patients who lived alone before hospitalization. Main Outcome Measure: The MLDT was compared with the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale and the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale. Results: The cognitive component of the MLDT demonstrated high positive and negative predictive value; the affective component evidenced excellent negative predictive value. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with previous research and provide further evidence of the utility of the MLDT in (a) quickly and accurately identifying geriatric rehabilitation patients with cognitive impairment, (b) guiding the nature of the referral question, and (c) reducing the number of unnecessary referrals for both cognitive deficits and depression.

Fuzzy ID3 and its variants are popular and efficient methods of making fuzzy decision trees from a group of training examples. This paper points out the inherent defect of the likes of Fuzzy ID3, presents two optimization principles of fuzzy decision trees, proves that the algorithm complexity of constructing a kind of minimum fuzzy decision tree is NP-hard, and gives a new algorithm which is applied to three practical problems. The experimental results show that, with regard to the size of trees and the classification accuracy for unknown cases, the new algorithm is superior to the likes of Fuzzy ID3.

J	Protheroe, J; Fahey, T; Montgomery, AA; Peters, TJ				Protheroe, J; Fahey, T; Montgomery, AA; Peters, TJ			The impact of patients' preferences on the treatment of atrial fibrillation: observational study of patient based decision analysis	BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							CONTROLLED TRIAL; COMMUNITY; WARFARIN; THERAPY; MEDICINE; HEALTH; AIDS	Objective To investigate the impact of patients' preferences for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, by using individualised decision analysis combining probability and utility assessments into a decision tree. Design Observational study based on interviews with patients. Setting Eight general practices in Avon. Participants 260 randomly selected patients aged 70-85 years with atrial fibrillation. Main outcome measures Patients' treatment preferences regarding anticoagulation treatment warfarin) after individualised decision analysis; comparison of these preferences with treatment guidelines on the basis of comorbidity and absolute risk and compared with current prescription. Results Of 195 eligible patients, 97 participated in decision making using decision analysis. Among these 97, the decision analysis indicated that 59 (61%; 95% 97, the decision analysis indicated that (61%; 95%, confidence interval 50% to 71%) would prefer anticoagulation treatment-considerably fewer than those who would be recommended treatment according to guidelines. There was marked disagreement between the decision analysis and guideline recommendations (kappa = 0.25 or less). Of 38 patients whose decision analysis indicated a preference for anticoagulation, 17 (45%) were being prescribed warfarin; on the other hand, 28 (47%) of 59 patients were not being prescribed warfarin although the results of their decision analysis suggested they wanted to be. Conclusions in the context of shared decision making, individualised decision analysis is valuable in a sizeable proportion of elderly patients with atrial fibrillation. Taking account of patients' preferences would lead to fewer prescriptions for warfarin than under published guideline recommendations. Decision analysis as a shared decision making tool should be evaluated in a randomised controlled trial.

In this paper, we discuss how uncertainty associated with diagnostic testing can be included in a decision analysis using pay-off tables and decision trees (decision-flow diagrams). Variables associated with diagnostic test interpretation (such as pre-test and post-test probability of disease; test sensitivity, specificity and predictive values; fixed cut-offs versus continuous measurement scales; test dependence associated with the use of multiple tests) are considered. Several decision criteria and output measures are discussed (including MAXIMIN and MAXIMAX criteria, opportunity costs, expected monetary values, expected utility, sensitivity and risk-profile analysis, and threshold analysis). The application of decision analysis to diagnostic testing for Johne's disease and traumatic reticuloperitonitis of cattle, and for canine heartworm disease are used to illustrate both population- and patient-oriented applications and criteria for ranking the desirability of different outcomes.

STUDY DESIGN: We derived 6 management options from the literature. These were (1) to treat all women with tocolytics and corticosteroids ("treat all"); (2) to treat all women while awaiting results of the "traditional" fetal fibronectin test results, then discontinue treatment on those with negative results; (3) to treat only those with abnormal cervical length measurements as detected by ultrasonography; (4) to treat only those with abnormal "rapid" fetal fibronectin test results; (5) to perform rapid fetal fibronectin testing and cervical length measurements and treat those with a positive result on either or both; (6) not to treat any women ("treat none"). To assess the contributions of tocolytics and corticosteroids to our outcomes, we analyzed 3 additional treatment options: (7) to treat all women with outpatient corticosteroids but not give tocolytics, (8) to administer corticosteroids to all but give tocolytics only to those with abnormal rapid fetal fibronectin test results, and (9) to administer corticosteroids to all but give tocolytics only to those with abnormal cervical length. We used decision-analytic techniques to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: A decision tree was constructed on the basis of these strategies. We reviewed the literature to derive all probability information. We derived sensitivity and specificity for delivery <37 weeks for fetal fibronectin and for abnormal cervical length. Outcomes of interest were respiratory distress syndrome and neonatal death. We derived cost variables from institutional statistics and from values quoted in the literature. Total costs, cases of respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal deaths, and cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for each of the strategies. We conducted sensitivity analyses on all variables. Universal administration of outpatient corticosteroids was the least expensive option, but it resulted in more cases of respiratory distress syndrome and deaths than "treat all." Rapid fetal fibronectin plus corticosteroids, traditional fetal fibronectin, and cervical length plus corticosteroids were the next least expensive options and resulted in numbers of cases of respiratory distress syndrome and deaths that were similar to those in the "treat all" strategy. The "rapid" fetal fibronectin test, cervical length measurement, rapid fetal fibronectin test plus cervical length measurement, and "treat none" strategies resulted in more respiratory distress syndrome, more deaths, and higher costs. Treating all patients resulted in the fewest number of cases of respiratory distress syndrome and deaths but the greatest costs. CONCLUSION: Risk prediction strategies with the fetal fibronectin assay or corticosteroids plus rapid fetal fibronectin testing or cervical length assessment may offer cost savings compared with treatment of all women with threatened preterm labor and may prevent similar numbers of cases of respiratory distress syndrome and neonatal deaths.

However, other subtypes of CC are not infrequent and may be particularly difficult to distinguish from CRM by histology and even immunohistochemistry. Therefore, 48 CC from different locations, either peripheral (n = 19), or nonperipheral, that is, from the large intrahepatic bile ducts, the hilum, and the extrahepatic bile ducts (n = 29), and with different cytoarchitectural patterns were tested for CK7 and CK20 and compared with 31 CRM. CC were positive for CK7 and CK20 in 96% and 70% respectively, whatever the architecture and differentiation of the tumor. The labeling index (LI) of CK7 in CC was always high, whereas it was low or moderate for CK20. CK20-positive phenotype was significantly more frequent in nonperipheral than in peripheral CC (82% vs 47%; p = 0.007). CRM were all positive for CK20 with a high LI, and mostly negative (81%) for CK7. In conclusion, (1) the CK immunoprofile of CC varies according to the location of the tumor in the biliary tract, peripheral CC being more often CK7+/CK20-, and nonperipheral ones CK7+/CK20+; and (2) a decision tree based on CK20 LI and CK7 positivity allows the distinction of CRM and CC, even for the nonperipheral type.

Although the literature provides good evidence for the effectiveness of noninvasive ventilation in addition to standard therapy compared with standard therapy alone in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (avoiding intubation and improving hospital mortality), the associated costs have not been rigorously measured. Adding noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) to standard therapy in the setting of a severe, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in patients with respiratory acidosis who are at high risk of requiring endotracheal intubation is both more effective and less expensive. Design: Economic evaluation based on theoretical model. Setting This analysis base case was modeled for a tertiary care, teaching hospital. Patients or other Participants: Carefully selected patients with severe exacerbations of COPD. Intervention: The two alternative therapies compared were standard therapy (oxygen, bronchodilators, steroids, and antibiotics) and standard therapy plus NPPV. Measurements and Main Results: As the hypothesis was dominance, the main outcomes modeled and calculated were costs, mortality rate, and rates of intubation between the two interventions. To determine clinical effectiveness, we used a metaanalysis of randomized trials evaluating the impact of NPPV on hospital survival. A decision tree was constructed and probabilities were applied at each chance node using research evidence and a comprehensive regional database. To provide data for this economic evaluation, MEDLINE literature searches were conducted. Bibliographies of relevant articles were reviewed, as were personal files. To estimate the costs of the alternative therapeutic approaches, eight types of hospitalization days were costed using the London Health Sciences Center costing data. Sensitivity analyses were performed, varying all assumptions made. The metaanalysis yielded an odds ratio for hospital mortality in the NPPV arm, compared with standard therapy, of 0.22 (95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.66). By using baseline case assumptions, we found a cost savings of $3,244 (1996, Canadian), per patient admission, if NPPV were adopted in favor of standard therapy. These findings present a scenario of clear dominance for treatment with NPPV. Sensitivity analyses did not alter the results appreciably. Conclusions: We conclude that from a hospital's perspective, NPPV and standard therapy for carefully selected patients with acute, severe exacerbations of COPD are more effective and less expensive than standard therapy alone.

Design: A birth cohort of 85 000 individuals was followed over their lifetime, using a decision-tree analysis. Published data were used to simulate the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the cohort, the consecutive clinical outcomes and the associated costs. Five new vaccination scenarios were assessed and compared with a baseline strategy of vaccination of high-risk groups. The 5 new vaccination scenarios were: (i) systematic prenatal screening and vaccination of newborns at risk; (ii) universal vaccination of infants; (iii) universal vaccination of school children; (iv) universal vaccination of infants and school children; and (v) universal vaccination of infants, school children and adolescents. Results: The incremental cost per year of life saved for systematic prenatal screening and vaccination of newborns at risk compared with the baseline scenario was estimated to be 23 350 Swiss francs (SwF; 1996 values). The 4 universal vaccination scenarios had a much larger impact on the number of chronic infections and deaths prevented. The incremental cost per year of life saved for universal vaccination compared with systematic prenatal screening and vaccination of newborns at risk ranged from SwF6120 (infant vaccination strategy) to SwF10 200 (school children vaccination strategy). In the sensitivity analysis, prevalence, vaccine price and discount rate were key elements. Conclusion: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are lower with universal vaccination strategies than with selective vaccination. Furthermore, with universal vaccination strategies, increasingly ambitious strategies result in higher costs but also in more incremental years of life saved.

This study reports findings from seven HIV/AIDS education and training projects. Participants in more than 600 training sessions described themselves, their professional background and their general reasons for laking the training Immediately following the training, they also rated the quality of their educational experience along several dimensions. Trainee characteristics were related to assessments of training quality, using a regression decision-tree analytic approach. Although effect sizes were generally small, quality ratings of the HIV/AIDS training experiences were associated with certain projects, basic trainee demographic characteristics, professional background, and experience in the HIV field. Greater understanding about participant characteristics can provide clues about how these training experiences are perceived and processed and may inform decision making about instructional HIV/AIDS curricula.

This month's column presents a cost-effectiveness analysis of two different formulations of sumatriptan using a decision-tree approach. The analysis introduces a new concept, rank-order stability analysis (ROSA), in assessing the sensitivity of a decision-tree model. The ROSA showed that the results of the cost-effectiveness analysis were elastic to variation in the primary clinical efficacy measure. However, because the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was not large, most health care organizations will likely want to make both sumatriptan products available.

The method achieves about 1-dB improvement over standard decision-feedback equalization for typical magnetic recording channels used in hard disk drives. The implementation complexity is modest and is compared with other improved derision-feedback structures.

The purpose of this study was to assess if breast cancer screening using sestamibi scintimammography (SSMM) in conjunction with mammography (MM) is cost effective ill avoiding biopsies in healthy patients. Methods. Quantitative decision tree sensitivity analysis was used to compare the conventional MM alone strategy (strategy A) with two decision strategies for screening with SSMM; SSMM after an indeterminate mammogram (strategy B) or SSMM after both a positive and an indeterminate mammogram (strategy C). Cost effectiveness was measured by calculating the expected cost per patient and the average Life expectancy per patient for baseline values as web as over a range of values for all of the variables of each strategy. Results. Based on Medicare reimbursement values, strategies B and C showed a cost savings of $9 and $20 per patient respectively as compared to strategy A. This translates into respective savings of $189 and $420 million per year assuming 21 million females undergo screening each year. Strategies B and C did however have a loss of mean life expectancy of 0.000178 and 0.000222 years respectively as compared to strategy A due to interval progression of breast cancer in a small number of women. Strategies B and C significantly lowered the number of biopsies performed on healthy patients in the screening population by 750,063 and 1,557,915 biopsies respectively as compared to strategy A. Conclusions. These results quantitatively verify the potential utility of using SSMM in avoiding unnecessary biopsies.

J	Valk, PE				Valk, PE			Clinical trials of cost effectiveness in technology evaluation	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						cost benefit analysis; technology, medical; technology assessment, biomedical; clinical trials	HEALTH-CARE TECHNOLOGIES; ECONOMIC-EVALUATION; SENSITIVITY; EFFICACY; DESIGN	This article discusses models of efficacy, design of clinical trials and the role of mathematical modeling in diagnostic technology evaluation and determination of cost-effectiveness, A multi-tiered model of efficacy, which views diagnostic imaging as part of a global process of patient management and outcome, has been described, The first tier involves imaging efficacy, which must be determined by clinical trial, Direct comparison of new and established modalities in a single study population has major advantages over randomized controlled trials, which are extremely costly and time-consuming and are not appropriate for most evaluations of diagnostic modalities, Selection of patients for inclusion in the trial, interpretation and verification of results, and determination of a reference standard are all possible sources of bias, which need to be identified and controlled, Decision analysis modeling can be used to assess diagnostic, therapeutic, patient-outcome and cost efficacy, once imaging efficacy has been evaluated by clinical trial Decision analysis is easier and less expensive to perform than clinical trials, and results are easily generalizable to other settings, Disadvantages arise from the nondescriptive nature of modeling and lack of transparency, which make it difficult to evaluate the appropriateness of decision tree structures and input data. Modeling is an unavoidable fact of Life in technology evaluation, since the resources that would be required for full evaluation of imaging modalities by clinical trial are not available.

J	Agrawal, R; Srikant, R				Agrawal, R; Srikant, R			Privacy-preserving data mining	SIGMOD RECORD			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Management of Data	MAY 16-18, 2000	DALLAS, TEXAS	Assoc Comp Machinery, Special Interest Grp Management Data			SECURITY	A fruitful direction for future data mining research will be the development of techniques that incorporate privacy concerns. Specifically, we address the following question. Since the primary task in data mining is the development of models about aggregated data, can we develop accurate models without access to precise information in individual data records? We consider the concrete case of building a decision-tree classifier from training data in which the values of individual records have been perturbed. The resulting data records look very different from the original records and the distribution of data values is also very different from the original distribution. While it is not possible to accurately estimate original values in individual data records, we propose a novel reconstruction procedure to accurately estimate the distribution of original data values. By using these reconstructed distributions, we are able to build classifiers whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of classifiers built with the original data.

J	Marchetti, M; Barosi, G				Marchetti, M; Barosi, G			Cost-effectiveness of epoetin and autologous blood donation in reducing allogeneic blood transfusions in coronary artery bypass graft surgery	TRANSFUSION			English	Article							RECOMBINANT-HUMAN-ERYTHROPOIETIN; OPEN-HEART-SURGERY; ACUTE LUNG INJURY; BACTERIAL-CONTAMINATION; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; CARDIAC OPERATIONS; CELL TRANSFUSION; FOLLOW-UP; RED-CELLS; TOTAL-HIP	BACKGROUND: Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery accounts for a substantial portion of all allogeneic units of blood transfused. Drugs and autologous blood donation (ABD) are alternative or adjunctive methods for reducing complications and costs induced by allogeneic blood transfusions. Recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin) has the potential to decrease perioperative need for allogeneic blood during CABG, but its high cost calls for a careful economic evaluation before it can be recommended for widespread use. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A decision tree was used to compare a hypothetical strategy of no epoetin with one in which epoetin was utilized to control blood transfusion needs in CABG; each strategy was tested with and without ABD. The impact of these strategies on both the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs ($US) was calculated. RESULTS: Using epoetin alone and with ABD, respectively, avoided the transfusion of 0.61 and 1.35 units of allogeneic blood per patient and saved 0.000086 and 0.000146 QALYs per patient. This made cost-effectiveness (CE) higher than $7 million and $5 million for each QALY saved, respectively. ABD alone cost more than $1 million per QALY saved. If the risk of bacterial infections following allogeneic transfusions was included in the model, epoetin alone cost $6288 per QALY saved, while ABD, both alone and with epoetin, saved money. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the existing evidence, neither of the blood-saving strategies modeled was a cost-effective means of avoiding the deleterious health effects of perioperative blood transfusions in CABG.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with endoscopic diagnosis of peptic ulcer were randomized to one of two strategies: al treatment during 7 days with omeprazole, tetracycline, metronidazole and bismuth subcitrate ("quadruple" therapy) and if failure second-line treatment with omeprazole, amoxycillin and clarithromycin during 7 days (OCA7), and b) initial treatment with OCA7 and if failure treatment with "quadruple therapy". End point was eradication 8 weeks after last treatment dose. Direct and indirect costs were estimated (euros, 1997) and a cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision-tree model was undertaken after real clinical data. 95% confidence intervals are given. RESULTS: After screening 255 patients, 97 were finally included. 48 patients were given strategy a and 49 strategy b. Eradication was obtained (intention-to-treat) in 72.9% (CI 95%: 58.2-84.7) in group a versus 91.8% (CI 95%: 80.4-97.7) (p < 0.05) in group b. Mean cost per case treated was lower in group a (237 versus 268 euros) but cost per case eradicated was lower in group b (320 versus 296 euros). The cost was primarily determined by efficacy. diagnosis daysCONCLUSIONS: Treatment with OCA7 followed by rescue with "quadruple" therapy if failure is more efficient in our area that the inverse strategy. Efficiency is mostly determined by efficacy.

J	Grigni, M; Mirelli, V; Papadimitriou, CH				Grigni, M; Mirelli, V; Papadimitriou, CH			On the difficulty of designing good classifiers	SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						linear decision tree; hardness of approximation; parameterized complexity	CHROMATIC NUMBER; HARDNESS; NP	We consider the problem of designing a near-optimal linear decision tree to classify two given point sets B and W in R-n. A linear decision tree defines a polyhedral subdivision of space; it is a classifier if no leaf region contains points from both sets. We show hardness results for computing such a classifier with approximately optimal depth or size in polynomial time. In particular, we show that unless NP = ZPP, the depth of a classifier cannot be approximated within any constant factor, and that the total number of nodes cannot be approximated within any fixed polynomial. Our proof uses a simple connection between this problem and graph coloring and uses the result of Feige and Kilian on the inapproximability of the chromatic number. We also study the problem of designing a classifier with a single inequality that involves as few variables as possible and point out certain aspects of the difficulty of this problem.

This study aimed to detect artifact patterns across multiple physiologic data signals from a neonatal ICU using decision tree induction. Approximately 200 h of bedside data were analyzed. Artifacts in the data streams were visually located and annotated retrospectively by an experienced clinician. Derived values were calculated for successively overlapping time intervals of raw values, and then used as feature attributes for the induction of models trying to classify 'artifact' versus 'not artifact' cases. The results are very promising, indicating that integration of multiple signals by applying a classification system to sets of values derived from physiologic data streams may be a viable approach to detecting artifacts in neonatal ICU data.

J	Gehrke, J; Ramakrishnan, R; Ganti, V				Gehrke, J; Ramakrishnan, R; Ganti, V			RainForest - A framework for fast decision tree construction of large datasets	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						data mining; decision trees; classification; scalability	DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; KNAPSACK	Classification of large datasets is an important data mining problem. Many classification algorithms have been proposed in the literature, but studies have shown that so far no algorithm uniformly outperforms all other algorithms in terms of quality. In this paper, we present a unifying framework called Rain Forest for classification tree construction that separates the scalability aspects of algorithms for constructing a tree from the central features that determine the quality of the tree. The generic algorithm is easy to instantiate with specific split selection methods from the literature (including C4.5, CART, CHAID, FACT, ID3 and extensions, SLIQ, SPRINT and QUEST). In addition to its generality, in that it yields scalable versions of a wide range of classification algorithms, our approach also offers performance improvements of over a factor of three over the SPRINT algorithm, the fastest scalable classification algorithm proposed previously. In contrast to SPRINT, however, our generic algorithm requires a certain minimum amount of main memory, proportional to the set of distinct values in a column of the input relation. Given current main memory costs, this requirement is readily met in most if not all workloads.

We consider the configuration of the container stack and the weight distribution of containers in the yard-bay. A dynamic programming model is formulated to determine the storage location to minimize the number of relocation movements expected for the loading operation. We also develop a decision tree from the set of the optimal solutions to support real time decisions. The performance of the decision tree is evaluated by the number of decisions that are different from the optimal solutions of the slower dynamic programming solution method.

In this paper, an example knowledge base for the selection of a coordinate measuring machine was induced and analyzed from the diffusive information in the example. The goal is to reduce the amount of knowledge related to the event so as to represent the knowledge in the knowledge base with the fewest number of rules possible. Then the concise decision tree is established by means of the knowledge acquisition model to describe the entire selection problem of coordinate measuring machines.

Materials and Methods: We constructed a decision tree modeling surveillance versus immediate prophylactic adjuvant radiation in patients with a positive surgical margin(s) after radical prostatectomy. Literature and institution based estimates were determined for certain factors, including the probability of undetectable prostate specific antigen (PSA) in patients followed expectantly postoperatively and those treated with immediate adjuvant radiotherapy, complications of radiotherapy after prostatectomy and probability of undetectable PSA in those treated with therapeutic radiation for detectable PSA postoperatively. A panel of experts assigned utilities to the various outcomes. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine threshold values required to change the model outcome. Results: Using average probability estimates from a literature review the decision model recommended initial surveillance. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the model depended on the probability of disease recurrence in men followed expectantly after surgery as well as the efficacy of therapeutic radiation. We tested the decision model again for patient groups based on tumor grade, pathological stage, preoperative PSA and number of positive margins. The model recommended initial radiation for patients with low to intermediate grade disease, no evidence of seminal vesicle invasion and multiple positive margins. Conclusions: The results of our decision analysis imply that immediate radiation may be appropriate for patients with a positive surgical margin(s) and a high likelihood of recurrent local rather than distant disease. This model may be useful to physicians and patients who use individual probability estimates and utility values to determine the preferred course of management after surgery.

J	Zheng, ZJ				Zheng, ZJ			Constructing X-of-N attributes for decision tree learning	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						constructive induction; new attributes; decision tree learning; classification; induction	MINIMUM DESCRIPTION LENGTH; INDUCTION	While many constructive induction algorithms focus on generating new binary attributes, this paper explores novel methods of constructing nominal and numeric attributes. We propose a new constructive operator, X-of-N. An X-of-N representation is a set containing one or more attribute-value pairs. For a given instance, the value of an X-of-N representation corresponds to the number of its attribute-value pairs that are true of the instance. A single X-of-N representation can directly and simply represent any concept that can be represented by a single conjunctive, a single disjunctive, or a single M-of-N representation commonly used for constructive induction, and the reverse is not true. In this paper, we describe a constructive decision tree learning algorithm, called XofN. When building decision trees, this algorithm creates one X-of-N representation, either as a nominal attribute or as a numeric attribute, at each decision node. The construction of X-of-N representations is carried out by greedily searching the space defined by all the attribute-value pairs of a domain. Experimental results reveal that constructing X-of-N attributes can significantly improve the performance of decision tree learning in both artificial and natural domains in terms of higher prediction accuracy and lower theory complexity. The results also show the performance advantages of constructing X-of-N attributes over constructing conjunctive, disjunctive, or M-of-N representations for decision tree learning.

J	Nugent, CD; Webb, JAC; Black, ND				Nugent, CD; Webb, JAC; Black, ND			Feature and classifier fusion for 12-lead ECG classification	MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND THE INTERNET IN MEDICINE			English	Article						feature and classifier fusion; neural networks; electrocardiology	NEURAL NETWORKS; RECOGNITION; DIAGNOSIS	Two methodologies, feature and classifier fusion, for the problem of computerized 12-lead electrocardiogram classifcation, are investigated. Firstly, the entire classification problem is subdivided into a number of smaller bi-dimensional ones. By employing bi-group Neural Network classifiers, independent feature vectors for each diagnostic class are examined individually and the output from each classifier are fused together to produce one single result. Secondly, two classifiers, namely the aforementioned and a decision tree, are fused together through a novel approach of a Specificity Matrix. This methodology addresses the problem of unresolved conflict during fusion of classifiers and aims to exploit the merits of each classifier and suppress their weaknesses. 290 validated 12-lead electrocardiogram recordings, comprising six diagnostic classes, were used to train, validate and test both methodologies. The framework of bi-group classifiers enhanced the overall performance by 12.0% in comparison with conventional approaches. In the second instance, the fusion of the two classifiers produced a performance level of 81.3%; superior to either classifier in isolation. This approach offers a viable solution to the unresolved problem of conflict between classifiers during fusion and can be extended readily to accommodate any number of diagnostic classes and classifiers.

J	Banerjee, M; Biswas, D; Sakr, W; Wood, DP				Banerjee, M; Biswas, D; Sakr, W; Wood, DP			Recursive partitioning for prognostic grouping of patients with clinically localized prostate carcinoma	CANCER			English	Article						prostate carcinoma; radical prostatectomy; disease free survival; recursive partitioning and amalgamation	STRUCTURED SURVIVAL ANALYSIS; RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY; DISEASE RECURRENCE; CANCER STATISTICS; HIGH-RISK; TREES; SELECTION; MEN	BACKGROUND. Patients treated with radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate carcinoma present considerable heterogeneity in terms of disease free survival outcome. Multiple studies have attempted to create prognostic groupings of these patients in the perioperative phase, using information available regarding several clinicopathologic variables. Such groupings allow physicians to make early yet prudent decisions regarding adjuvant combination therapies. The current study presents results from a statistical analysis that enables the natural identification of such prognostic groups. METHODS. Examination of consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens was performed between January 1991 and December 1995 at Wayne State University, Harper Hospital, Detroit, Michigan. Disease free survival in a cohort of 485 of these men was analyzed using recursive partitioning and amalgamation technique. Clinicopathologic parameters evaluated included age, race, preoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, clinical and pathologic stage, and Gleason grade of the fine-needle biopsy as well as the radical prostatectomy specimen. RESULTS. A binary decision tree representation was generated fur classifying patients based on the clinicopathologic variables mentioned earlier. The worst prognosis was for patients with either advanced stage and a PSA level > 24.1 ng/mL or advanced stage, a PSA level less than or equal to 24.1 ng/mL, and age less than or equal to 65 years. This group had an estimated median disease free survival of only 10.3 months. Patients with lower pathologic stage, prostatectomy Gleason scores of less than or equal to 7, and a preoperative PSA level less than or equal to 22.7 ng/mL had the best prognosis. CONCLUSIONS. The recursive partitioning analyses allows easy characterization of a patient for prognosis shortly after radical prostatectomy, This will enable a physician to make more prudent decisions regarding whether to employ watchful waiting, proceed with accepted adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy or hormonal therapy), or refer patients to a research center that is able to administer experimental adjuvant therapy.

AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY			English	Article							BARRETTS-ESOPHAGUS; GASTRIC CARDIA; ADENOCARCINOMA; CANCER; RISK; SURVEILLANCE; TOBACCO; ALCOHOL; THERAPY	OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic screening in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) to rule our high-grade dysplasia of Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: Using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio as outcome measure, the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic screening was compared to not screening in a decision tree. It was assumed that GERD patients at age 60 yr undergo a one-time endoscopy with esophageal biopsies, targeting abnormal-appearing epithelium. Positive biopsies with respect to high-grade dysplasia or early esophageal adenocarcinoma result in esophagectomy. Transition rates were estimated from U.S. cancer statistics, as well as published data of endoscopic sensitivity, specificity, and surgical outcome. Costs of screening and cancer care were estimated from Medicare reimbursement data from the perspective of a third-party-payor. RESULTS: Compared with no screening, screening endoscopy cost $24,700 per life-year saved. The cost-effectiveness of screening is quite sensitive to the prevalence of Barrett's esophagus, high-grade dysplasia, and adenocarcinoma, as well as the sensitivity, specificity, and cost of screening endoscopy. A small drop in the health-related quality of life associated with postsurgical states markedly reduced the effectiveness of screening. Simultaneous variations of the prevalence, specificity, and health-related quality of life can easily change screening endoscopy from a life-saving into a life-losing strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Under favorable conditions, general screening by endoscopy of all patients with reflux symptoms to prevent death from esophageal adenocarcinoma may represent a cost-effective strategy; however, such conditions may be difficult to meet.

J	Boutilier, C; Dearden, R; Goldszmidt, M				Boutilier, C; Dearden, R; Goldszmidt, M			Stochastic dynamic programming with factored representations	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						decision-theoretic planning; Markov decision processes; Bayesian networks; regression; decision trees; abstraction	OBSERVABLE MARKOV-PROCESSES; DECISION-PROCESSES; INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS; INFINITE HORIZON; ALGORITHMS; STRIPS	Markov decision processes (MDPs) have proven to be popular models for decision-theoretic planning, but standard dynamic programming algorithms for solving MDPs rely on explicit, state-based specifications and computations. To alleviate the combinatorial problems associated with such methods, we propose new representational and computational techniques for MDPs that exploit certain types of problem structure. We use dynamic Bayesian networks (with decision trees representing the local families of conditional probability distributions) to represent stochastic actions in an MDP, together with a decision-tree representation rewards. Based on this representation, we develop versions of standard dynamic programming algorithms that directly manipulate decision-tree representations of policies and value functions. This generally obviates the need for state-by-state computation, aggregating states at the leaves of these trees and requiring computations only for each aggregate state. The key to these algorithms is a decision-theoretic generalization of classic regression analysis, in which we determine the features relevant to predicting expected value. We demonstrate the method empirically on several planning problems, showing significant savings for certain types of domains. We also identify certain classes of problems for which this technique fails to perform well and suggest extensions and related ideas that may prove useful in such circumstances. We also briefly describe an approximation scheme based on this approach. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The purpose of the present study was to use ethnographic decision tree modeling to describe and predict decisions to refer clients to either a brief or a longer substance use program. Eleven clinicians who complete intakes at an addiction treatment agency engaged in two semi-structured interviews regarding actual referral decisions; one interview was to develop a decision tree model and the other was to test the accuracy of the model. The setting for the referrals was an addiction treatment facility with both a brief and a longer outpatient program. Results showed that the decision tree was accurate in predicting 85% of new referral decisions. The decision tree indicated that clinicians tended to use the longer outpatient treatment as the default, with a series of constraints being put on referral to the briefer treatment program. The decision tree also suggested that there are a number of contextual factors that arise in decisions that present a challenge for simple implementation strategies of general clinical guidelines in substance use treatment.

J	Dietterich, TG				Dietterich, TG			An experimental comparison of three methods for constructing ensembles of decision trees: Bagging, boosting, and randomization	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						decision trees; ensemble learning; bagging; boosting; C4.5; Monte Carlo methods	ALGORITHMS	Bagging and boosting are methods that generate a diverse ensemble of classifiers by manipulating the training data given to a "base" learning algorithm. Breiman has pointed out that they rely for their effectiveness on the instability of the base learning algorithm. An alternative approach to generating an ensemble is to randomize the internal decisions made by the base algorithm. This general approach has been studied previously by Ali and Pazzani and by Dietterich and Kong. This paper compares the effectiveness of randomization, bagging, and boosting for improving the performance of the decision-tree algorithm C4.5. The experiments show that in situations with little or no classification noise, randomization is competitive with (and perhaps slightly superior to) bagging but not as accurate as boosting. In situations with substantial classification noise, bagging is much better than boosting, and sometimes better than randomization.

J	Webb, GI				Webb, GI			MultiBoosting: A technique for combining boosting and wagging	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						boosting; bagging; wagging; aggregation; decision committee; decision tree	ALGORITHMS; VARIANCE; BIAS	MultiBoosting is an extension to the highly successful AdaBoost technique for forming decision committees. MultiBoosting can be viewed as combining AdaBoost with wagging. It is able to harness both AdaBoost's high bias and variance reduction with wagging's superior variance reduction. Using C4.5 as the base learning algorithm, MultiBoosting is demonstrated to produce decision committees with lower error than either AdaBoost or wagging significantly more often than the reverse over a large representative cross-section of UCI data sets. It offers the further advantage over AdaBoost of suiting parallel execution.

Primary astrocytomas were analysed for parameters (mean nuclear size, mitosis count, area fraction of endothelial cells and tumour necrosis, area fraction of nuclei, and Ki-67 (MIB-1) labelling index), which are closely related to the World Health Organization (WHO) 1979 and WHO 1993 grading criteria. All estimates correlated with the WHO histopathological grade and patient outcome. According to the receiver-operating characteristics curve, the presence of tumour necrosis and mitosis count (cut-off at 3 mitoses/mm(2) of neoplastic tissue) showed the best sensitivity and specificity in separating patients with different survival. The multivariate survival analyses confirmed this result. A decision-tree model was constructed based on these two variables: twig I with less than 3 mitoses/mm(2), twig II with equal or more than 3 mitoses/mm(2) but no necrosis, and twig III with tumour necrosis. This model was found to be more strongly associated with survival than the WHO 1979 or WHO 1993 grading schemes. Low-malignancy astrocytomas (WHO grade II or twig I tumours) could be further divided into two prognostic categories by the image cytometric DNA analysis. The results put an emphasis on astrocytoma grading on mitosis counts (grade II vs. III) and tumour necrosis (grade III vs. IV). To standardize the sampling for mitosis counting, it is suggested that a parallel Ki-67 immunostaining be used for the identification of the most proliferative areas.

J	Amin, A				Amin, A			Recognition of printed arabic text based on global features and decision tree learning techniques	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						pattern recognition; printed Arabic text; connected component; skew detection and correction; global features; structural classification; machine learning C4.5; cross-validation	CHARACTER-RECOGNITION	Machine simulation of human reading has been the subject of intensive research for almost three decades. A large number of research papers and reports have already been published on Latin, Chinese and Japanese characters. However, little work has been conducted on the automatic recognition of Arabic in both on-line and off-line, has been achieved towards the automatic recognition of Arabic characters. This is a result of the lack of adequate support in terms of funding, and other utilities such as Arabic text databases, dictionaries, etc., and of course because of the cursive nature of its writing rules, and this problem is still an open research field. This paper presents a new technique for the recognition of Arabic text using the C4.5 machine learning system. The advantage of machine learning are twofold: it can generalize over the large degree of variations between different fonts and writing style and recognition rules can be constructed by examples. The technique can be divided into three major steps. The first step is digitization and pre-processing to create connected component, detect the skew of a document image and correct it. Second, feature extraction. where global features of the input Arabic word is used to extract features such as number of subwords, number of peaks within the subword, number and position of the complementary character etc., to avoid the difficulty of segmentation stage. Finally, machine learning C4.5 is used to generate a decision tree for classifying each word. The system was tested with 1000 Arabic words with different fonts (each word has 15 samples) and the correct average recognition rate obtained using cross-validation was 92%.

J	Freeman, H; Arikian, S; Lenox-Smith, A				Freeman, H; Arikian, S; Lenox-Smith, A			Pharmacoeconomic analysis of antidepressants for major depressive disorder in the United Kingdom	PHARMACOECONOMICS			English	Article							COST-EFFECTIVENESS; VENLAFAXINE	Objective: To estimate the cost effectiveness of different classes of antidepressants in the UK National Health Service. Design, patients and interventions: The use of the serotonin (5-hydroxyhyptamine; 5-HT) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine was compared with that of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). A meta-analysis determined the clinical success rate, and a decision tree was constructed by interviewing general practitioners and psychiatrists. Adding pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment costs, meta-analytic rates were applied to the decision tree to calculate the expected cost and outcome for each drug. Cost effectiveness was determined using a composite measure of outcome [symptom-free days (SFD)]. Main outcome measures and results: The meta-analysis included data from 44 studies on 4033 patients. The highest overall efficacy rate for outpatients with MDD was with venlafaxine use (73.7%), compared with 61.4% for SSRIs and 59.3% for TCAs. Treatment with venlafaxine yielded the lowest outpatient cost for a SFD (pound 10.53), compared with pound 13.23 for SSRIs and pound 15.52 for TCAs (1998 values). Conclusions: Using this economic model, venlafaxine appears to be a cost-effective treatment for outpatients with MDD in the UK.

To provide estimates of the response variable y (dissolved. oxygen), a set of jointed decision rules is constructed by successive binary splitting of the predictor space composed of wind speed and freshwater flow data. The prediction model is displayed in the shape of a binary decision tree. We propose a transfer procedure in order to improve the prediction error of the tree model. Results obtained on the 'Etang de Berre' data set allow to describe and precise the effects of the environmental variables on the dissolved oxygen dynamics. The transfer procedure applied after the tree building process gives gains of prediction accuracy of about 17%. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The use of this model in interpretation of mammograms is discussed. Also is discussed, the inevitability of using a fuzzy approach in the problem. Finally, the two different fuzzy approaches for secondary classification are compared on basis of their performance as far as clustering is concerned. The idea of using a fuzzy covariance matrix [5,6] in the distance metric of the classical c-means algorithm [1-3] has also been tried. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We focus our study on a coastal region of Gabon, which has a variety of land cover types common to most tropical regions. A decision tree classifier does not assume a particular probability density distribution of the input data, and is thus well adapted for SAR image classification. A total of seven features, including wavelet-based multiscale texture measures (at scales of 200, 400, and 800 m) and multiscale multitemporal amplitude data (two dates at scales 100 and 400 m), are used to discriminate the land cover classes of interest. Among these layers, the best features for separating classes are found by constructing exploratory decision trees from various feature combinations. The decision tree structure stability is then investigated by interchanging the role of the training samples for decision tree growth and testing. We show that the construction of exploratory decision trees can improve the classification results. The analysis also proves that the radar backscatter amplitude is important for separating basic land cover categories such as savannas, forests, and flooded vegetation. Texture is found to be useful for refining flooded vegetation classes. Temporal information from SAR images of two different dates is explicitly used in the decision tree structure to identify swamps and temporarily flooded vegetation.

J	Reichl, W; Chou, W				Reichl, W; Chou, W			Robust decision tree state tying for continuous speech recognition	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING			English	Article						acoustic modeling; decision tree state tying; speech recognition		In this paper, methods of improving the robustness and accuracy of acoustic modeling using decision tree based state tying are described. A new two-level segmental clustering approach is devised which combines the decision tree based state tying with agglomerative clustering of rare acoustic phonetic events. In addition, a unified maximum likelihood framework for incorporating both phonetic and nonphonetic features in decision tree based state tying is presented, In contrast to other heuristic data separation methods, which often lead to training data depletion, a tagging scheme is used to attach various features of interest and the selection of these features in the decision tree is data driven. Finally, two methods of using multiple-mixture parameterization to improve the quality of the evaluation function in decision tree state tying are described. One method is based on the approach of Ic-means fitting and the other method is based on a novel use of a local multilevel optimal subtree. Both methods provide more accurate likelihood evaluation in decision tree clustering and are consistent with the structure of the decision tree. Experimental results on Wall Street Journal corpora demonstrate that the proposed approaches lead to a significant improvement in model quality and recognition performance.

J	Gao, SX; Lin, GH				Gao, SX; Lin, GH			Decision tree complexity of graph properties with dimension at most 5	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						monotone graph property; decision tree; complexity; elusive		A graph property is a set of graphs such that if the set contains some graph G then it also contains each isomorphic copy of G (with the same vertex set). A graph property P on n vertices is said to be elusive, if every decision tree algorithm recognizing P must examine all a(n - 1)/2 pairs of vertices in the worst case. Karp conjectured that every nontrivial monotone graph property is elusive. In this paper, this conjecture is proved for some cases. Especially, it is shown that if the the abstract simplicial complex of a nontrivial monotone graph property P has dimension not exceeding 5, then P is elusive.

Methods: A systematic review of the English literature from 1969 to 1998 was performed using specified indexing terms. The number of retrieved articles in dentistry was compared with the number of articles in medicine. The quality of articles in dentistry presenting a decision tree with utilities and a sensitivity analysis was judged using a published peer review process. We report weaknesses of the analyses together with selected applications. Results: Sixty-seven articles were published on decision analysis in dentistry. Whilst the number of articles published in medicine has accelerated there has been a decline in the last four years in dental publications. Only 22 of the articles in dentistry presented a decision analysis with utilities and a sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: Current weaknesses of the decision analyses reported were: opaque basic assumptions in the description of the analysis, lack of data on patient preferences and of reliable data on the chances of the long-term effects and side effects of intervention together with an absence of sensitivity analyses. The decision analysis approach complements that of "evidence-based health care" by enabling the best empirical evidence to be used in clinical practice. Formal methods such as decision analysis will promote the rational use of existing knowledge. For it to do this the quality of research data will have to improve in dentistry. Furthermore decision analysis is important in education to demonstrate explicitly how decisions might be arrived at and improved. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Sorensen, EH; Miller, KL; Ooi, CK				Sorensen, EH; Miller, KL; Ooi, CK			The decision tree approach to stock selection - An evolving tree model performs the best.	JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT			English	Article							RISK	A frequent question regarding quantitative investing is: What are good variables for stock selection? Traditional quantitative strategies are variations of screening techniques. Quantitative investment managers seek to narrow the investable universe to a manageable number of stocks that have desirable characteristics. The authors introduce an alternative approach to traditional methods of stock screening based on a statistical technique known as classification and regression tree (CART). CART allows screening factors to interact on a conditional basis. The end result is a hierarchical (tree) structure that assigns a probability of outperformance (or underperformance) for each stock. The authors apply two alternative CART strategies to the selection of technology stocks, and evaluate their performance. The models demonstrate significant improvement over the more ad hoc stock ranking techniques.

J	Lim, TS; Loh, WY; Shih, YS				Lim, TS; Loh, WY; Shih, YS			A comparison of prediction accuracy, complexity, and training time of thirty-three old and new classification algorithms	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						classification tree; decision tree; neural net; statistical classifier	FINE-NEEDLE ASPIRATION; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; NEURAL NETWORKS; DECISION TREES; REGRESSION; DIAGNOSIS	Twenty-two decision tree, nine statistical, and two neural network algorithms are compared on thirty-two datasets in terms of classification accuracy, training time, and (in the case of trees) number of leaves. Classification accuracy is measured by mean error rate and mean rank of error rate. Both criteria place a statistical, spline-based, algorithm called POLYCLSSS at the top, although it is not statistically significantly different from twenty other algorithms. Another statistical algorithm, logistic regression, is second with respect to the two accuracy criteria. The most accurate decision tree algorithm is QUEST with linear splits, which ranks fourth and fifth, respectively. Although spline-based statistical algorithms tend to have good accuracy, they also require relatively long training times. POLYCLASS, for example, is third last in terms of median training time. It often requires hours of training compared to seconds for other algorithms. The QUEST and logistic regression algorithms are substantially faster. Among decision tree algorithms with univariate splits, C4.5, IND-CART, and QUEST have the best combinations of error rate and speed. But C4.5 tends to produce trees with twice as many leaves as those from IND-CART and QUEST.

Northern Illinois University's heating plant manager and staff meteorologist, along with a group of meteorology students, worked together to assess different types of available information that could be used in an autumn natural gas purchasing decision. Weather information assessed included the impact of ENSO events on winters in northern Illinois and the Climate Prediction Center's (CPC) long-range climate outlooks. Non-weather factors, such as the cost and available supplies of natural gas prior to the heating season, contribute to the complexity of the natural gas purchase decision. A decision tree was developed and it incorporated three parts:(a)natural gas supply levels, (b) the CPC long-lead climate outlooks for the region, and (c) an ENSO model developed for DeKalb. The results were used to decide in autumn whether to lock in a price or ride the market each winter. The decision tree was tested for the period 1995-99, and returned a cost-effective decision in three of the four winters.

Objective: To compare the cost effectiveness of different CMV management strategies for renal transplant patients: prophylaxis with (i) oral valaciclovir or (ii) intravenous ganciclovir; viral testing for CMV followed by (iii) pre-emptive therapy with intravenous ganciclovir or (iv) adjustment of immunosuppression and intensive monitoring; or (v) waiting to treat when CMV disease develops. Methods: A decision-tree model was constructed that included the different management strategies for the donor seropositive/recipient seronegative (D+R-) population. Clinical outcomes for the D+R- population came from clinical trials. Treatment algorithms and costs for CMV syndrome and tissue invasive disease were developed from published literature and UK physician interviews. One- and 2-way sensitivity analyses were performed. Study Perspective: UK National Health Service. Results: Prophylaxis with either oral valaciclovir or intravenous ganciclovir dominated (lower costs and fewer cases of CMV disease) the pre-emptive treatment and wait-and-treat strategies. The cost per patient was from pound 157 to pound 438 higher with oral valaciclovir prophylaxis compared with intravenous ganciclovir prophylaxis and the incremental cost per case of CMV disease avoided with valaciclovir prophylaxis ranged from pound 2243 to pound 8111 (1996 values). These results are sensitive to the efficacy of intravenous ganciclovir prophylaxis and CMV management costs. Conclusions: For D+R- renal transplant patients, prophylaxis is the dominant (more effective and less costly) management strategy compared with pre-emptive and wait-and-treat strategies. The cost per patient with oral valaciclovir prophylaxis compared with intravenous ganciclovir prophylaxis is slightly higher in our base case scenario, but may be lower under reasonable alternative assumptions.

Speech segmentation is challenging, since the cues typically present for segmenting text (headers, paragraphs, punctuation) are absent in spoken language. We investigate the use of prosody (information gleaned from the timing and melody of speech) for these tasks. Using decision tree and hidden Markov modeling techniques, we combine prosodic cues with word-based approaches, and evaluate performance on two speech corpora, Broadcast News and Switchboard. Results show that the prosodic model alone performs on par with, or better than, word-based statistical language models - for both true and automatically recognized words in news speech. The prosodic model achieves comparable performance with significantly less training data, and requires no hand-labeling of prosodic events. Across tasks and corpora, we obtain a significant improvement over word-only models using a probabilistic combination of prosodic and lexical information. Inspection reveals that the prosodic models capture language-independent boundary indicators described in the literature. Finally, cue usage is task and corpus dependent. For example, pause and pitch features are highly informative for segmenting news speech, whereas pause, duration and word-based cues dominate for natural conversation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Eccleston, CH				Eccleston, CH			The decision-identification tree: A new NEPA scoping tool	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						scoping; decision; planning; decision tree; EIS; NEPA		No single methodology has been universally accepted for determining the appropriate scope of analysis for an environmental impact statement (EIS). Most typically, the scope of analysis is determined by first identifying actions and facilities that need to be analyzed. Once the scope of actions and facilities is identified, the scope of impacts is determined. Yet agencies sometimes complete an EIS only to discover that the analysis does not adequately support decisions that need to be made. Such discrepancies can often be traced to disconnects between scoping, the subsequent: analysis, and the final decision-making process that follows. A new and markedly different approach-decision-based scoping-provides an effective methodology for improving the EIS scoping process. Decision-based scoping, in conjunction with a new tool. the decision-identification tree (DIT), places emphasis on first identifying the potential decisions that may eventually need to be made. The DIT provides a methodology for mapping alternative courses of action as a function of fundamental decision points. Once these decision points have been correctly identified, the range of actions, alternatives, and impacts can be more accurately assessed; this approach can improve the effectiveness of EIS planning, while reducing the risk of future disconnects between the EIS analysis and reaching a final decision. This approach also has applications in other planning disciplines beyond that of the EIS.

Trainers described over 600 training sessions from these projects in terms of their structural characteristics and design elements, while trainees described these sessions on several dimensions related to training quality. Training characteristics were compared to trainee assessments of training quality. Using a decision-tree analytic approach for major training attributes, considerable support emerged for links between training characteristics and perceived quality of the HIV/AIDS training experience. More favorable quality ratings were associated with certain projects, the training setting, the types of trainees served by the training, the intended training impact, discussion of special populations, and training methods involving interactive learning. With increased knowledge regarding how these educational experiences relate to the ways they are perceived and processed, more targeted approaches to training design on HIV/AIDS can be developed.

Two reviewers conducted the literature search and the review. Both full and partial economic evaluations published in English, Dutch, or German were included. The criteria list published in the textbook of Drummond was used to determine the quality of the economic evaluations. The methodological quality of three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which the economic evaluations obtained probability estimates of NSAID induced gastropathy and adverse events was assessed by a list of internal validity criteria. The conclusions were based on a rating system consisting of four levels of evidence. Ten economic evaluations were included; three were based on RCTs. All evaluations studied misoprostol as prophylactic treatment: in one evaluation misoprostol was studied as a fixed component in a combination with diclofenac (Arthrotec). All economic evaluations comprised analytical studies containing a decision tree. The three trials were of high methodological quality. Nine economic evaluations were considered high quality and one economic evaluation was considered of low methodological quality. There is strong evidence (level "A") that the use of misoprostol for the prevention of NSAID induced gastropathy is cost effective, and limited evidence (level "C") that the use of Arthrotec is cost effective. Although the levels of evidence used in this review are arbitrary, it is believed that a qualitative analysis is useful: quantitative analyses in this field are hampered by the heterogeneity of economic evaluations. Existing criteria to evaluate the methodological quality of economic evaluations may need refinement for use in systematic reviews.

J	El-Solh, AA; Saltzman, SK; Ramadan, FH; Naughton, BJ				El-Solh, AA; Saltzman, SK; Ramadan, FH; Naughton, BJ			Validity of an artificial neural network in predicting discharge destination from a postacute geriatric rehabilitation unit	ARCHIVES OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						geriatrics; neural networks (computer); rehabilitation; skilled nursing facilities	DECISION-TREE; STROKE; ILLNESS; OUTCOMES; SEVERITY; SURVIVAL; LENGTH; INDEX; STATE	Objective: To develop an artificial neural network (ANN) designed to predict discharge destination from postacute geriatric rehabilitation units. Design: Nonconcurrent prospective study. Setting: Postacute geriatric rehabilitation units: a 20-bed unit in a nonproprietary skilled nursing facility and a 40-bed unit in a suburban private facility. Patients: Consecutive sample of 661 patients admitted between January 1995 and February 1999, including a derivation group of 452 patients and a validation group of 209 patients. Interventions: A feed-forward, back-propagation neural network to predict discharge destination. Main Outcome Measure: Discharge destination from postacute geriatric rehabilitation. Results: An ANN was trained on clinical pattern set derived from 452 patients and validated prospectively on 209 consecutive patients admitted to postacute geriatric rehabilitation units. The neural network achieved a sensitivity of 85.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 83.7-89.4) and specificity of 94.1% (95% CI, 84.4-99.1) in identifying discharge destination with a corresponding area under the curve of 95.7% (95% CI, 92.1-98.3). Conclusion: An ANN can predict discharge to the community postacute rehabilitation with a high degree of accuracy. It could have particular value to predict return to the community for older adults with multiple comorbidities after an acute hospitalization.

J	Rastogi, R; Shim, K				Rastogi, R; Shim, K			PUBLIC: A decision tree classifier that integrates building and pruning	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						data mining; classification; decision tree	PERFORMANCE	Classification is an important problem in data mining. Given a database of records, each with a class label, a classifier generates a concise and meaningful description for each class that can be used to classify subsequent records. A number of popular classifiers construct decision trees to generate class models. These classifiers first build a decision tree and then prune subtrees from the decision tree in a subsequent pruning phase to improve accuracy and prevent "overfitting". Generating the decision tree in two distinct phases could result in a substantial amount of wasted effort since an entire subtree constructed in the first phase may later be pruned in the next phase. In this paper, we propose PUBLIC, an improved decision tree classifier that integrates the second "pruning" phase with the initial "building" phase. In PUBLIC, a node is not expanded during the building phase, if it is determined that it will be pruned during the subsequent pruning phase. In order to make this determination for a node, before it is expanded, PUBLIC computes a lower bound on the minimum cost subtree rooted at the node. This estimate is then used by PUBLIC to identify the nodes that are certain to be pruned, and for such nodes, not expend effort on splitting them. Experimental results with real-life as well as synthetic data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of PUBLIC's integrated approach which has the ability to deliver substantial performance improvements.

This paper investigates the possibilities of decision tree induction systems as an alternative approach. The ability of decision frees to represent heuristic decision rules is evaluated and a method of capturing interactions across decisions In a sequential decision model is outlined. Decision tree induction algorithms, such as C4.5, CART, and CHAID, are suited to device the decision rules from empirical data. A case study to illustrate the approach considers decisions of individuals when they are faced with the choice to combine different out-of-home activities into a multipurpose, multistop trip or make a trip fbr each activity separately. Data fron a large-scale activity diary survey are used to induce the decision rules. Possible directions of future research are identified.

A clustering method is used to adaptively design the parameters of the FAF. Two structures are used for the equalizer: transversal equalizer (TE) and decision feedback equalizer (DFE), A new decision tree structure is used to implement the decision feedback equalizer, in which each leaf of the tree is a type-2 FAF, This DFE vastly reduces computational complexity as compared to a TE, Simulation results show that equalizers based on type-2 FAFs perform much better than nearest neighbor classifiers (NNC) or equalizers based on type-1 FAFs.

J	Tsang, ECC; Wang, XZ; Yeung, DS				Tsang, ECC; Wang, XZ; Yeung, DS			Improving learning accuracy of fuzzy decision trees by hybrid neural networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						approximate reasoning; fuzzy decision trees; hybrid neural networks; knowledge acquisition; learning; local and global weights	EXPERT-SYSTEMS; RULES; INDUCTION; NETS	Although the induction of fuzzy decision tree (FDT) has been a very popular learning methodology due to its advantage of comprehensibility, it is often criticized to result in poor learning accuracy Thus, one fundamental problem is how to improve the learning accuracy while the comprehensibility is kept. This paper focuses on this problem and proposes using a hybrid neural network (HNN) to refine the FDT. This HNN, designed according to the generated FDT and trained by an algorithm derived in this paper, results in a FDT with parameters, called weighted FDT. The weighted FDT is equivalent to a set of fuzzy production rules with local weights (LWs) and global weights (GWs) introduced in our previous work. Moreover, the weighted FDT, in which the reasoning mechanism incorporates the trained LWs and GWs, significantly improves the FDTs learning accuracy while keeping the FDTs comprehensibility. The improvements are verified on several selected databases. Furthermore, a brief comparison of our method with two benchmark Learning algorithms, namely, fuzzy ID3 and traditional backpropagation, is made. The synergy between FDT induction and HNN training offers new insight into the construction of hybrid intelligent systems with higher learning accuracy.

Different misclassification costs are specified for false trips versus failures to trip in order to adjust their relative frequencies of occurrence. Pattern recognition approaches to discrete event control can potentially be trained and tested for this and for other applications in large-scale simulation.

J	Girardi, A; Singer, H; Shikano, K; Nakamura, S				Girardi, A; Singer, H; Shikano, K; Nakamura, S			Maximum likelihood successive state splitting algorithm for tied-mixture HMnet	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						speech recognition; acoustic modeling; HMM; tied-mixture; clustering	DESIGN	This paper shows how a divisive state clustering algorithm that generates acoustic Hidden Markov models (HMM) can benefit from a tied-mixture representation of the probability density function (pdf) of a state and increase the recognition performance. Popular decision tree based clustering algorithms, like for example the Successive State Splitting algorithm (SSS) make use of a simplification when clustering data. They represent a state using a single Gaussian pdf. We show that this approximation of the true pdf by a single Gaussian is too coarse, for example a single Gaussian cannot represent the differences in the symmetric parts of the pdf's of the new hypothetical states generated when evaluating the state split gain (which will determine the state split). The use of more sophisticated representations would lead to intractable computational problems that we solve by using a tied-mixture pdf representation. Additionally, we constrain the codebook to be immutable during the split. Between state splits, this constraint is relaxed and the codebook is updated. In this paper, we thus propose an extension to the SSS algorithm, the so-called Tied-mixture Successive State Splitting algorithm (TM-SSS). TM-SSS shows up to about 31% error reduction in comparison with Maximum-Likelihood Successive State Split algorithm (ML-SSS) for a word recognition experiment.

It now seems possible to diagnose catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBI) without removing the device; recent studies showed that paired quantitative blood cultures are the most reliable and convenient method for diagnosis of CRBI. Can CRBI be cured and treated without device removal? A decision-tree/flow-chart resulting from analysis of international data by French International Experts is presented. Futures trends are reviewed: new techniques for prevention, including catheters impregnated with antimicrobials and, antiseptic hubs; flushing and antibiotic lock techniques that can be used both for prevention and treatment.

We propose an interactive model, RuleViz, for visualizing the process of knowledge discovery and data mining. The RuleViz model consists of five components, each or which can be interacted and visualized by using different visualization techniques. According to this model two interactive systems, AViz and CViz, for visualizing the process of discovering numerical association rules and the process of learning classification rules have been implemented, respectively. To preprocess the data, each system provides users with three approaches for discretizing numerical attributes and the corresponding rule discovery algorithms. The discretization approaches and the algorithms for discovering association rules and learning classification rules are presented, and the approaches to visualizing discretized data and discovered rules are developed. The discovery of numerical association rules in AViz is based on image-based mining algorithm, while, in CViz, the classification rules are learned in terms of a logical rule induction algorithm. We also demonstrate our experimental results with AViz and CViz on the census data sets. UCI data sets, and artificial data sets. (C) 2000 SPIE and IS&T. [S107-9909(00)01304-0].

Visual defects in a gray-level image are located through thresholding and morphological processing, and their geometric information is immediately reported. Three input feature sets are proposed and tested to find the best set to characterize five types of defects: lines, holes, stains, wears, and knots. Two multilayered perceptron models with one and two hidden layers are tested for the classification of defects. If multiple line defects are identified on a given image as a result of classification, a line combination test is conducted to check if they are parts of larger line defects. Experimental results on 140 defect samples show that two-layered perceptrons are better than three-layered perceptrons for this problem. The classification results of this neural network approach are compared with those of a decision tree approach. The comparison shows that the neural network classifier provides better classification accuracy despite longer training times.

J	Meng, MV; Carroll, PR				Meng, MV; Carroll, PR			When is pelvic lymph node dissection necessary before radical prostatectomy? A decision analysis	JOURNAL OF UROLOGY			English	Article						prostatic neoplasms; lymph node excision; prostatectomy; prostate; decision support techniques	FROZEN SECTION DETECTION; RETROPUBIC PROSTATECTOMY; PROSTATIC-CARCINOMA; EARLY COMPLICATIONS; GLEASON SCORE; CANCER; LYMPHADENECTOMY; METASTASES; ACCURACY; ADENOCARCINOMA	Purpose: In recent years the role of pelvic lymph node dissection before or at radical prostatectomy has been questioned. We compared the outcome of performing or omitting pelvic lymph node dissection in patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy by formal decision analysis. Materials and Methods: We created a decision tree for patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy that accounts for all possible branch points and outcomes. Outcome probabilities applied to the model were derived from published data. Utility values were determined for each outcome state by a panel of experts. Decision analysis was done using decision analysis computer software. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine which elements in the model were most important and to calculate threshold values. Results: Using probability data from the literature and our assigned outcome values, decision analysis initially favored omitting pelvic lymph node dissection. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the threshold values for the incidence of positive lymph nodes and the sensitivity of lymph node dissection and frozen section analysis at which outcomes were equivalent were 18% and 80%, respectively. Analysis was insensitive to the pelvic lymph node dissection complication rate. Conclusions: We performed formal decision analysis to determine the incidence of lymph node metastasis below which pelvic lymph node dissection is not warranted at radical retropubic prostatectomy. Our results suggest that lymph node dissection is unnecessary in the subset of patients in which the risk of lymph node involvement is less than 18%.

J	Zheng, ZJ; Webb, GI				Zheng, ZJ; Webb, GI			Lazy learning of Bayesian rules	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Bayesian classification; semi-naive Bayesian classification; decision trees; decision rules; lazy learning		The naive Bayesian classifier provides a simple and effective approach to classifier learning, but its attribute independence assumption is often violated in the real world. A number of approaches have sought to alleviate this problem. A Bayesian tree learning algorithm builds a decision tree, and generates a local naive Bayesian classifier at each leaf. The tests leading to a leaf can alleviate attribute inter-dependencies for the local naive Bayesian classifier. However, Bayesian tree learning still suffers from the small disjunct problem of tree learning. While inferred Bayesian trees demonstrate low average prediction error rates, there is reason to believe that error rates will be higher for those leaves with few training examples. This paper proposes the application of lazy learning techniques to Bayesian tree induction and presents the resulting lazy Bayesian rule learning algorithm, called LBR. This algorithm can be justified by a variant of Bayes theorem which supports a weaker conditional attribute independence assumption than is required by naive Bayes. For each test example, it builds a most appropriate rule with a local naive Bayesian classifier as its consequent. It is demonstrated that the computational requirements of LBR are reasonable in a wide cross-section of natural domains. Experiments with these domains show that, on average, this new algorithm obtains lower error rates significantly more often than the reverse in comparison to a naive Bayesian classifier, C4.5, a Bayesian tree learning algorithm, a constructive Bayesian classifier that eliminates attributes and constructs new attributes using Cartesian products of existing nominal attributes, and a lazy decision tree learning algorithm. It also outperforms, although the result is not statistically significant, a selective naive Bayesian classifier.

The authors examined how probability transformations from cumulative prospect theory might alter a decision analysis of a prophylactic therapy in AIDS, eliciting utilities from patients with HIV infection (n = 75) and calculating expected outcomes using an established Markov model. They next focused on transformations of three sets of probabilities: 1) the probabilities used in calculating standard-gamble utility scores; 2) the probabilities of being in discrete Markov states; 3) the probabilities of transitioning between Markov states. Results. The same prophylaxis strategy yielded the highest quality-adjusted survival under all transformations. For the average patient, prophylaxis appeared relatively less advantageous when standard-gamble utilities were transformed. Prophylaxis appeared relatively more advantageous when state probabilities were transformed and relatively less advantageous when transition probabilities were transformed. Transforming standard-gamble and transition probabilities simultaneously decreased the gain from prophylaxis by almost half. Sensitivity analysis indicated that even near-linear probability weighting transformations could substantially alter quality-adjusted survival estimates. Conclusion. The magnitude of benefit estimated in a decision-analytic model can change significantly after using cumulative prospect theory. Incorporating cumulative prospect theory into decision analysis can provide a form of sensitivity analysis and may help describe when people deviate from expected utility theory.

J	Quek, FKH				Quek, FKH			An algorithm for the rapid computation of boundaries of run-length encoded regions	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						run-length encoding; regions; region boundary; finite state machine; computer vision; graphics		A finite state machine-based algorithm for the rapid extraction of boundaries of run-length encoded regions is presented. The algorithm operates directly on the run data structure contained in run-length encoding, and yields boundaries in the form of four- or eight-connected point lists describing closed positively directed countours of four- or eight-connected regions. The algorithm differentiates between external and internal (boundaries of holes in the region) boundaries, and can handle multiple external and internal boundaries for each run-length encoded region. The four state finite state machine can be reduced to a two-state machine. A state transition occurs as the boundary traverses each run. The transition predicates call be implemented as a simple decision tree. Run-length encoding is a common image/region encoding techniques. This algorithm complements the existing operators which work directly on such region descriptors, making them more attractive as a representation for region manipulation.

J	Scheid, DC; Hamm, RM; Stevens, KW				Scheid, DC; Hamm, RM; Stevens, KW			Cost effectiveness of human immunodeficiency virus postexposure prophylaxis for healthcare workers	PHARMACOECONOMICS			English	Article							HIV-INFECTED BLOOD; OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE; CARE WORKERS; ZIDOVUDINE; CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS; THERAPY; MODELS; RISK	Objective: The United States Public Health Service (USPHS) published recommendations for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) of healthcare workers in May 1998. The aim of this study was to analyse the cost effectiveness of the USPHS PEP guidelines. Design and setting: This was a modelling study in the setting of the US healthcare system in 1998. The analysis was performed from the societal perspective; however, only HIV healthcare costs were considered and health-related losses of productivity were not included. Methods: a decision tree incorporating a Markov model was created for 4 PEP strategies: the current USPHS recommendations, triple drug therapy, zidovudine monotherapy or no prophylaxis. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis using a Monte Carlo simulation was performed. Confidence intervals (CIs) around cost-effectiveness estimates were estimated by a bootstrapping method. Results: The costs (in 1997 US dollars) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved by each strategy were as follows: monotherapy $US688 (95% CI: $US624 to $US750); USPHS recommendations $US5211 (95% CI: $US5126 to $US5293): and triple drug therapy $US8827 (95% CI: $US8715 to $US8940). The marginal cost per year of life saved was: USPHS recommendations $US81 987 (95% CI: $US80 437 to $US83 689); triple drug therapy $US970 451 (95% CI: $US924 786 to $US 1 014 429). Sensitivity testing showed that estimates of the probability of seroconversion for each category of exposure were most influential, but did not change the order of strategies in the baseline analysis. With the prolonged HIV stage durations and increased costs associated with recent innovations in HIV therapy, the marginal cost effectiveness of the USPHS PEP strategy was decreased to $US62 497/QALY saved. All 3 intervention strategies were cost effective compared with no postexposure prophylaxis. Conclusions: Current USPHS PEP recommendations are marginally cost effective compared with monotherapy, but the additional efficacy of triple drug therapy for all risk categories is rewarded by only a small reduction in HIV infections at great expense. For the foreseeable future, assuming innovations in therapy that employ expensive drug combinations earlier in the HIV disease course to extend life expectancy and the increasing prevalence of HIV drug resistance, our model supports the use of the USPHS PEP guidelines.

J	Peeters, E				Peeters, E			Treatment of epileptic seizures as medical emergencies: a prospective analysis of a decision tree for nonmedically trained staff	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						epilepsy; seizure; emergency; status epilepticus	DIAZEPAM; LORAZEPAM	The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefit of treating every epileptic seizure as an emergency and to propose a decision tree for use by nonmedical staff. Published literature on emergency medical treatment for seizures was reviewed. A detailed decision tree was developed for use by nonmedical staff. Its effectiveness was prospectively analysed over 16 months. Each seizure was logged, and its duration and severity were recorded. Type, dose, and time of antiepileptic treatment were noted. Results were compared with a 6-month retrospective review. Initiation of antiepileptic drug treatment 5 or 7 minutes after seizure onset was indicated in the tree. Rectal diazepam or lorazepam, or fast-dissolving lorazepam was used. Use of the decision tree resulted in decreased duration of seizures, which lasted up to 18 hours in the retrospective review compared with only 37 minutes in the prospective study. Using this tree, nonmedical staff can appropriately treat adults experiencing seizures. Duration, severity, and frequency of seizures decreased when every seizure was treated as a medical emergency. Implementation of a decision tree is recommended for establishments with patients prone to seizures. It can also be taught to caregivers and parents of patients with well-known epilepsy.

J	Marino, JB; Nogueiras, A; Paches-Leal, P; Bonafonte, A				Marino, JB; Nogueiras, A; Paches-Leal, P; Bonafonte, A			The demiphone: An efficient contextual subword unit for continuous speech recognition	SPEECH COMMUNICATION			English	Article						context-dependent phonetic units; coarticulation modeling; continuous speech recognition		In this paper, we introduce the demiphone as a context-dependent phonetic unit for continuous speech recognition. A phoneme is divided into two parts: a left demiphone that accounts for the left coarticulation and a right demiphone that copes with the right-hand side context. This unit discards the dependence between the effects of both side contexts, but it models the transition between phonemes as the triphone does. By concatenating a left demiphone and a right demiphone a triphone can be built, although the left and the right-context coarticulations are modeled independently. The main appeal of this unit stems from its reduced number (respect to the number of triphones) and its capability to model left and right contexts unseen together in the training material. Thus, the demiphone shares in a simple way the advantages of a smoothed parameter estimation with the ability of generalization. In the present work, the demiphone is motivated and experimentally supported. Furthermore, demiphones are compared with triphones smoothed and generalized by decision-tree state-tying, accepted as the most powerful tool for coarticulation modeling at the present state of the art. The main conclusion of our work is that the demiphone simplifies the recognition system and yields a better performance than the triphone, at least for small or moderate size databases. This result may be explained by the ability of the demiphone to provide an excellent trade-off between a detailed coarticulation modeling and a proper parameter estimation.

J	Sonnenberg, A				Sonnenberg, A			Special article: game theory to analyse management options in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease	ALIMENTARY PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX; COST; GUIDELINES; DIAGNOSIS; THERAPY	This study aims to demonstrate the applicability of linear programming to threshold analysis, using, as an example, patients with new onset of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The choice amongst competing management options is modelled as a decision tree, using threshold analysis, as well as an m x n matrix on an Excel spreadsheet. The different options of medical management correspond to the m rows, whilst the different disease states correspond to the n columns of the matrix. Each number at the intersection of a row and a column represents the outcome associated with that particular combination of management and disease state. The threshold values are calculated by the built-in functions for linear programming of Excel using its Solver tool. Varying the cost estimates in the sensitivity analysis translates into solving a set of different matrices. Threshold analysis provides a formalism to phrase problems of medical decision analysis in a concise fashion.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a historical cohort study of women delivered of live-born singleton neonates in 1995 through 1997 (22,157). The frequency of cesarean delivery was 17%; 78 variables were used for analysis. Decision tree rule-based methods and logistic regression models were each applied to the same 50% of the sample to develop the predictive training models and these models were tested on the remaining 50%. RESULTS: Decision tree receiver operating characteristic curve areas were as follows: nulliparous, 0.82; parous, 0.93. Logistic receiver operating characteristic curve areas were as follows: nulliparous, 0.86; parous, 0.93. Decision tree methods and logistic regression methods used similar predictive variables; however, logistic methods required more variables and yielded less intelligible models. Among the 6 decision tree building methods tested, the strict minimum message length criterion yielded decision trees that were small yet accurate. Risk factor variables were identified in 676 nulliparous cesarean deliveries (69%) and 419 parous cesarean deliveries (47.6%). CONCLUSION: Decision tree models can be used to predict cesarean delivery. Models built with strict minimum message length decision trees have the following attributes: Their performance is comparable to that of logistic regression; they are small enough to be intelligible to physicians; they reveal causal dependencies among variables not detected by logistic regression; they can handle missing values more easily than can logistic methods; they predict cesarean deliveries that lack a categorized risk factor variable.

Atrophic cervical epithelium of postmenopausal women may mimic high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2-3) in Papanicolaou-stained cervical smears (Pap smears). Women with such an "atypical" Pap smear need a repeated Pap smear after a course of estrogens before a definite diagnosis can be made. The aim of this study was to determine whether measurement of proliferative activity in Pap smears of postmenopausal patients that were difficult to interpret is a reliable test for differentiating between cervical atrophy and high-grade GIN. Methods. Pap smears obtained before and after estrogen treatment of 30 postmenopausal women with an atypical Pap smear were restained with the monoclonal antibody MIB1 to visualize proliferating cells. The proliferative activity index (PAI) was subsequently measured in order to explore the feasibility of a recently proposed PAI-based diagnostic decision tree to reduce the number of estrogen courses and follow-up Pap smears in postmenopausal women. Results. The PAT-based test to discriminate between cervical atrophy and high-grade CIN resulted in 100 and 96% correct diagnoses in women with high-grade CIN and cervical atrophy, respectively. Only 2 of the 30 women would have needed a repeated Pap smear after estrogen treatment for definite diagnosis if the PAI-based diagnostic decision had been used. Conclusions. Measurement of PAI in MIB1 restained Pap smears is a simple, reliable, safe, and probably also cost-effective method to obtain a substantial reduction of diagnostic estrogen courses and subsequent Pap smears in postmenopausal women with an atypical Pap smear.

J	Krishna, K; Thathachar, MAL; Ramakrishnan, KR				Krishna, K; Thathachar, MAL; Ramakrishnan, KR			Voronoi networks and their probability of misclassification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						neural networks; pattern recognition; statistical learning theory	BIAS	Nearest neighbor classifiers that use all the training samples for classification require large memory and demand large online testing computation. To reduce the memory requirements and the computation cost, many algorithms have been developed that perform nearest neighbor classification using only a small number of representative samples obtained from the training set. We call the classification model underlying all these algorithms as Voronoi networks (Vnets), because these algorithms discretize the feature space into Voronoi regions and assign the samples in each region to a class. In this paper we analyze the generalization capabilities of these networks by bounding the generalization error. The class of problems that can be "efficiently" solved by Vnets is characterized by the extent to which the set of points on the decision boundaries fill the feature space, thus quantifying how efficiently a problem can be solved using Vnets. We show that Vnets asymptotically converge to the Bayes classifier with arbitrarily high probability provided the number of representative samples grow slower than the square root of the number of training samples and also give the optimal growth rate of the number of representative samples. We redo the analysis for decision tree (DT) classifiers and compare them with Vnets. The bias/variance dilemma and the curse of dimensionality with respect to Vnets and DTs are also discussed.

The conceptual design stage consists of the following steps: deciding on the location of pressure relief devices, selecting the general type of pressure relief device for each identified location, i.e. safety valve and/or bursting disc (rupture disc), or other relief device, and selecting the special features for the chosen device type. Some regulations, codes and standards, and a decision tree for the selection of a relief device have been described in the literature. This paper presents four decision trees that have been developed for the different steps in the conceptual design stage. Only positive pressure in pressure vessels is considered here.

A decision tree was constructed with probability estimates based on data from an open-label clinical trial assessing the economic and human impacts of sumatriptan and usual therapy on nursing personnel. Direct medical care costs including costs for drug, physician, and emergency room visits were considered. Benefits were estimated using the human capital approach based on the national average of weekly earnings and productivity loss estimated from a migraine clinical trial. The net benefits of sumatriptan and usual therapy for the treatment of a single migraine attack were estimated to be $50 and $20, respectively. The annual incremental net benefit of sumatriptan over usual therapy was estimated to be $114-540/patient. The price difference was offset by benefits of sumatriptan in reducing use of health care resources and productivity loss.

Actions are taken during very degraded installation operations by teams of experts in the French framework of Crisis Organization (ONC). After describing the background of the framework of the Level 2 PSA, the French specific Crisis Organization and the characteristics of human actions in the Accident Progression Event Tree, this paper describes the method developed to introduce in PSA the Human and Organizational Reliability Analysis in Accident Management (HORAAM). This method is based on the Decision Tree method and has gone through a number of steps in its development. The first one was the observation of crisis center exercises, in order to identify the main influence factors (IFs) which affect human and organizational reliability. These Ifs were used as headings in the Decision Tree method. Expert judgment was used in order to verify the Ifs, to rank them, and to estimate the value of the aggregated factors to simplify the quantification of the tree. A tool based on Mathematica was developed to increase the flexibility and the efficiency of the study. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Idiopathic: VT, incessant VT, frequently recurring, hemodynamically stable VT, and VT based on bundle branch reentry, are candidates for radiofrequency catheter ablation. Patients with high-risk ventricular tachyarrhythmias should receive ICDs as initial therapy. Two studies, the Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillator trial (AVID) and the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study (CIDS) have tried to approach the problem of these high-risk ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Although at 3 years, the ICD in AVID demonstrated a significant relative risk reduction over amiodarone of 31.5%, CIDS could not duplicate this finding. At 3 years, the relative risk reduction conferred by the ICD over amiodarone in CIDS was only 13.7%. A careful analysis of both studies suggests that CIDS was insufficiently powered to demonstrate statistically significant benefits similar to those shown by AVID, and furthermore, seemed to include an undetermined number of low-risk VT patients. The problem in the CIDS trial in this regard was the recruitment of patients in whom the inclusion criteria were met by the arrhythmias induced during the electrophysiology stimulation study, but which did not exist in real life. In addition CIDS included 14% of patients with (1) undocumented syncope and inducible monomorphic sustained VT; or (2) long runs of spontaneous nonsustained VT. Under these circumstances, the therapeutic implications of AVID remain unchallenged. (C) 2000 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.

In this paper, generalized linear models (GLM) are implemented in a Geographical Information System to mimic the spatial distribution of alpine and subalpine species habitat and diversity in the study area of Belalp (Aletsch region, Wallis, Swiss Alps). Quantitative predictors used to quantify environmental requirements of species are: annual mean temperature, slope angle, topographic position, solar radiation, snow cover indices and the three spectral bands of a color infrared aerial photograph, as well as disjunctive classes of qualitative substrate-related predictors. Presence-absence logistic GLM are adjusted for 63 species. Percent ground cover measured on an ordinal scale is additionally modeled using a special case of GLM for 26 species with significant variation of abundance in the field. Both ordinal abundance and presence/absence at each spatial location are successfully modeled for some species, as shown by quantitative evaluation using an independent data set. Finally, species richness (SR) is modeled by (i) using a Poisson GLM and (ii) summing up single species predictions by presence/absence models. Successful models are finally used to mimic potential impact of climatic change on plant distribution and diversity. Results from these scenarios suggest (i) an overall trend toward a reduction of suitable habitat for alpine species and (ii) two different responses for the distribution of SR, namely: (a) a serious shift of the optimal SR elevation belt upward in elevation or (b) the SR optimal belt shifting only slightly upward in elevation, accompanied by a parallel spatial spread out of high SR patches at, these elevations. Limitations of both species and diversity models are discussed and some suggestions for future research are proposed.

Three different graphs are defined to capture the geometric properties of the data-set. The graphs G(P) and G(N) capture the intra-class properties of the set of positive points P and the set of negative points N, respectively, and the graph G(P, N) captures the inter-class properties between P and N. We derive rules from these graphs by means of graph partitioning. Our method tends to give fewer rules than that obtained by decision-tree based methods. The complexity of our algorithm is O(M-3), where M = \P\ + \N\. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However, magnetic resonance characteristics of some gynaecological tumours have been reported past several years. On the basis of the recent literature, we have made a decision tree for differential diagnosis of solid gynaecological tumours, in which there are some important divergences. Bilateral disease and invasive growth are malignant signs in most cases. Specific findings for different tumour types include: fibrovascular septa in dysgermonimas; preserving ovarian follicles in round cell tumours; pseudolobular patterns in young patients in sclerosing stromal tumours; and extremely hypointense masses on T2WI in Brenner tumours, Distinguishing between sex-cord stromal tumours, Brenner tumours and metastatic tumours may be hard, however, especially in middle age, because they all tend to show well-demarcated, hypointense masses on T2WI. Disproportionately clear zonal anatomy of the uterus, enlarged uterus and thickened endometrium, which are indirect findings of oestrogen-producing tumours, are useful diagnostic findings in children and postmenopausals.

The first requires the decision maker to follow through on plans to the end, the second requires the decision maker to focus solely on future events and final consequences given the current state of events, and the third is the conjunction of the first 2. Five experiments were reported to test these principles using different subject populations, different procedures for estimating consistency, and different factors for manipulating the attractiveness of the gamble at the final stage of the tree. The main findings were that strategic and dynamic consistency principles were violated at rates that exceeded choice inconsistency.

In contrast, risk management articles and books describe how decision trees can be used to evaluate specific risk management strategies. In this paper we describe a series of steps that should be a routine part of every decision tree analysis. They are designed to assess the expected value of developing a risk management strategy with regard to different aspects of uncertainty. The method is intended to trigger a focused brainstorming session to search for specific strategies to manage targeted risks. The procedure adds structure to the value-enhancing dimension of decision analysis that creates new strategies with less risk and higher expected values. The material presented here can easily be incorporated into even an overview of decision analysis in a survey class of operational research.

Literature data on methods of VT prophylaxis: are not consistent with regard to safety and efficacy, and a recent evidence-based report could not conclude that any method was superior to any other or to no prophylaxis. Because no study exists on the cost-effectiveness (C-E) of the different methods of prophylaxis, data from the evidence-based report were used to design a C-E analysis, This analysis will assist in the design of future randomized trials with adequate power to shaw significant outcome differences. Methods: A decision-tree model was designed on the basis of outcomes from the evidence-based report or relevant literature. We then calculated the cost of prevention of VT by one of the most commonly used methods-low-dose heparin (LDH), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), or sequential compression devices (SCDs)-using different probabilities of incidence of VT. Finally, we adjusted the cost for expected years of life after the episode of VT to calculate the cost per life-year saved by preventing VT. Results: We produced two tables that can be used to calculate the cost per life-year saved for any patient according to his or her age and the method of prophylaxis used. VT prophylaxis becomes less cost-effective as age progresses, because of decreased life-expectancy. With a widely accepted cost limit of $50,000 per life-year saved to indicate cost-effective treatment, LDH is more cost-effective than LMWH or SCDs, Conclusion: Our C-E model can help future investigators plan VT-related research with appropriate sample sizes to evaluate cost effective methods of prophylaxis, LMWH and SCDs must demonstrate substantial improvements in measured outcomes to be more cost-effective than LDH. C-E must be incorporated as a primary outcome in future studies comparing different methods of VT prophylaxis.

J	Gama, J; Brazdil, P				Gama, J; Brazdil, P			Cascade generalization	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						multiple models; constructive induction; combining classifiers; merging classifiers	CLASSIFIER	Using multiple classifiers for increasing learning accuracy is an active research area. In this paper we present two related methods for merging classifiers. The first method, Cascade Generalization, couples classifiers loosely. It belongs to the family of stacking algorithms. The basic idea of Cascade Generalization is to use sequentially the set of classifiers, at each step performing an extension of the original data by the insertion of new attributes. The new attributes are derived from the probability class distribution given by a base classifier. This constructive step extends the representational language for the high level classifiers, relaxing their bias. The second method exploits tight coupling of classifiers, by applying Cascade Generalization locally. At each iteration of a divide and conquer algorithm, a reconstruction of the instance space occurs by the addition of new attributes. Each new attribute represents the probability that an example belongs to a class given by a base classifier. We have implemented three Local Generalization Algorithms. The first merges a linear discriminant with a decision tree, the second merges a naive Bayes with a decision tree, and the third merges a linear discriminant and a naive Bayes with a decision tree. All the algorithms show an increase of performance, when compared with the corresponding single models. Cascade also outperforms other methods for combining classifiers, like Stacked Generalization, and competes well against Boosting at statistically significant confidence levels.

J	Mannan, MS; Kilpatrick, DL				Mannan, MS; Kilpatrick, DL			The pros and cons of shelter-in-place	PROCESS SAFETY PROGRESS			English	Article								Recently shelter-in-place has received a lot of attention regarding its effectiveness as an emergency response measure. While proponents feel that it is an effective measure, opponents are equally confident that shelter-in-place itself could represent a threat and be the cause of injuries, fatalities, and general loss of comfort. This paper provides an overview of the current knowledge on shelter-in-place procedures for effective shelter-in-place and factors that should be taken into account in recommending shelter-in-place. The authors argue that shelter-in-place should not be the only, alternative considered by emergency response planners. However, at the minimum, shelter-in-place should be considered as a high-level element in the hierarchy of emergency, response options available to emergency, response planners, emergency responders, and incident commanders. Within this paper are summaries cataloging the effectiveness of shelter-in-place. It demonstrates the circumstances in which shelter-in-place can be a viable response measure. Also included are the initial steps towards development of a decision tree that can be used to evaluate the many options that safety managers are faced with. While all of these protective methods are viable, one method may be preferred over another in certain circumstances.

J	DeFries, RS; Chan, JCW				DeFries, RS; Chan, JCW			Multiple criteria for evaluating machine learning algorithms for land cover classification from satellite data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							REMOTELY-SENSED DATA; CLASSIFIERS; TREES	Operational monitoring of land cover from satellite data will require automated procedures for analyzing large volumes of data. We propose multiple criteria for assessing algorithms for this task. In addition to standard classification accuracy measures, we propose criteria to account for computational resources requires by the algorithms, stability of the algorithms, and robustness to noise in the training data. We also propose that classification accuracy take account, through estimation of misclassification costs, of unequal consequences to the user depending on which cover types are confused. In this article, we apply these criteria to three variants of decision tree classifiers, a standard decision tree implemented in C5.0 and two techniques recently proposed in the machine learning literature known as "bagging" and "boosting." Each of these algorithms are applied to two data sets, a global land cover classification from 8 km AVHRR data and a Landsat Thematic Mapper scene in Peru. Results indicate comparable accuracy of the three variants of the decision tree algorithms on the two data sets, with boosting providing marginally higher accuracies. The bagging and boosting algorithms, however, are both substantially more stable and more robust to noise in the training data compared with the standard C5.0 decision tree. The bagging algorithm is most costly in terms of computational resources while the standard decision tree is least costly. The results illustrate that the choice of the most suitable algorithm requires consideration of a suite of criteria in additions to the traditional accuracy measures and that there are likely to be trade-offs between algorithm performance and required computational resources.

This study uses decision trees, Bayes' Theorem, and map quality evaluation procedures to assess the economic value and economic efficiency of soil surveys. To develop this methodology, a case study is used that considers three different scenarios in which the level of information regarding soil changes. The three scenarios are: (i) site-specific soil information is unavailable, (ii) perfect site-specific soil information is available (not realistic), and (iii) imperfect site-specific soil information is available. The calculated economic value of this hypothetical soil survey was US$ 17.14 ha(-1) year(-1), which is higher than the estimated soil survey cost of US$ 2.09 ha(-1). This simple comparison indicates that the soil survey is cost effective and that its costs would be paid off with the gain from the first year of its application. The combination of the calculated economic efficiency (55%) with the physical quality of the map (total percent correct in the map was 80%) allowed a better understanding of the actual value of the soil survey. The use of this method provided a means of calculating analytically a more complex and realistic value of soil surveys.

J	Kobler, A; Adamic, M				Kobler, A; Adamic, M			Identifying brown bear habitat by a combined GIS and machine learning method	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						brown bear; habitat; machine learning; GIS; Slovenia	GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION-SYSTEM; POPULATION; REGRESSION	In this paper we attempt to identify brown bear (Ursus arctos) habitat in south-western part of Slovenia, a country lying on the north-western-most edge of the continuous Dinaric-Eastern Alps brown bear population. The knowledge base (in the form of a decision tree) for the expert system for identifying the suitable habitat, was induced by automated machine learning from recorded bear sightings, and then linked to the GIS thematic layers for subsequent habitat/non-habitat classification of the entire study area. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier was 87% (KHAT 73%). The decision tree mostly agreed with the existing domain knowledge. For the study area the main factors considered by the expert system to be important for brown bear habitat were the percentage of forest (positive), proximity to settlements (negative) and elevation above see (positive), however the decision tree did not account for habitat patch size. After filtering out habitat patches smaller than 5000 ha in GIS, the accuracy increased to 89% (KHAT 77%). Whereas 88% of the habitat was within forests, only 33% of all forests were considered suitable as habitat. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The important role of such image retrieval support will be greatly accentuated in digital radiology practice. Radiologists' knowledge of patient prior image retrievals is rooted in their interpretation and application of the pertinent underlying medical/radiological knowledge as well as in their clinical training and experiences. At the same time, this knowledge may vary with individual practice preferences and styles, and may dynamically evolve over time. The complexity and dynamics suggest that patient image retrievals are a promising area for artificial intelligence-based automated learning techniques. Automated learning of patient image retrieval knowledge can provide continuous knowledge repository update support in an image retrieval knowledge-based system. However, the implementation of the learning techniques needs to address several challenges that include missing and noisy data, as well as multiple decision outcomes. Two techniques based on salient automated learning paradigms, neural network and symbolic learning, are investigated. Specifically, we describe the design or extension of each learning technique to address the unique characteristics of patient image retrieval knowledge and compare the resulting learning performances. The results show that the knowledge derived from the automated learning methods can achieve effective image retrievals that are comparable to those based on a knowledge-engineer-driven approach.

Such materials are subject to high stresses as an active airframe member. The usual "Maintenance access Hatch" utilised in traditional metal based construction techniques does-not exist, therefore the maintenance philosophy of composite airframes needs a more modernistic approach. Composite Access panels / Engine panels, tend to, be large, expensive and life limited for removal and replacement. These factors drive the need for reliable. on condition, online, maintenance practices for all regular maintenance. The Eurofighter 2000 specification required a suite of on line systems including an on line oil debris monitoring system. This system was to provide quantitative information of any oil borne metallic debris in the Engine lubrication system for each of the two engines, (EJ200), an also a discrete output for the Secondary power system drive, (APU), and two airframe mounted accessory drive gearboxes, (AMAD). Two fundamentally different technology solutions were proposed and accepted for these two diverse applications. The application of the two different technology applications offered the appropriately optimised monitoring techniques for these diverse applications is rationaled in the paper The reasons for the selection will be discussed in this paper as well as the applicability to this advanced Aircraft and future proposed weapon platforms. The paper describes the decision process and implementation of the two diverse technology options including the decision tree for final technology selection and implementation. Eaton Aerospace Engineered Sensors, Tedeco Products,wish to state that this paper is presented without disclosing, IPR, limits, exceedencies and Debris generation rates pertaining to the Eurofighter 2000 Aircraft.

The elaboration of this tool joined the same problems which are posed in the community working on Knowledge Data Discovery KDD; with knowknowing the management of a large among of data and the extraction of knowledge. Initially we will introduce the need of making a learning system to schedule a workshop, then we describe the specificity of our system. We develop 3 phases of the process of KDD and we underline our contribution in the first 2 stages: The data warehousing and the filtering methods. We present a new criterion of data selection that one will put in perspective among the existing criteria. We elaborate an filtering algorithm which prepare the data at the step of data mining which uses the software C4/5 to extract knowledge in form of decision tree. Our work is in supervised machine learning and is applied to the case of flow shop of 4 machines, where the knowledge concernes the choice of the best heuristic in the workshop.

How,ever, it has one problem due to the fact that it does not efficiently use the training data for rarely seen triphones, which are a significant portion of all triphones in the training data. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called a two-stage decision tree building approach, to address this problem By making better clustering of rarely-seen triphones using first-stage decision trees, we make more efficient use of their limited training data so that their statistics can be robustly estimated. When they participate in the second-stage (also the final) decision tree building, the trees will be better constructed and hence better acoustic models and system performance will be obtained. Experimental results on the Wall Street Journal 5K task show, that our approach is superior to the traditional approach.

There are two kinds of features that can be obtained from MR images. The low-level features such as the size, color, texture, and contour can be directly acquired from images, and the high-level features such as existence of certain object, spatial relations between different parts can only be obtained through the interpretation of segmented images. In the proposed system, the decision tree learning with low-level and high-level features are performed separately In classifying an image, the low-level features are used to recognize each segment, and then the high-level features are synthesized and used for high-level decision tree. The learning and classification process can be more efficient by separating them into two levels.

We employ an inductive learning process for producing decision trees like the C4.5 proposed by Quinlan. Several rules for job assignment are obtained from decision trees those are constructed by training cases. In the case generation method employed in the previous system, there seems to be a problem, that is, several obtained rules are not available for assigning jobs since there are no job combinations that satisfy antecedent conditions of the rules. We modify the case generation method to obtain more available rules. Computer simulations show that the modified method is effective in problems with one of the following objectives: minimizing the makespan, minimizing the total flowtime, and minimizing the total tardiness. In the previous system, only typical rules with good consequent parts had been used for job assignment. In order to utilize rules with typical bad consequent parts, we transform the antecedent parts of bad rules to try to get good rules. Computer simulations show that some bad rules can be converted to good rules.

Neural network have proven themselves to be more efficient classifier than the other techniques. The efficiencies and purities achieved with the optimized neural network are in average 1 to 7% higher than those obtained with the other methods.

The aim of the study was to generate a tool for rehabilitation physicians, orthotists and physical therapists to have a quick, reliable and unambiguous assessment of patient needs and wants and to translate those into a proper and effective KAFO selection. This resulted in the Ambroise KAFO decision-tree based on the persons somatic condition, activity level and participation wishes and thus follows the ICIDH-2 classification protocols. The Ambroise KAFO decision-tree has successfully been applied in over 500 cases. Further clinical validation is in progress.

Object Probes make use of both physical features and a manually formulated decision tree to classify objects in the scene. A conceptual graph is used to represent the association of the labels found in each labeled image. We develop a query formalism that translates the query elements into a graph structure. The query process can be seen as matching the query graph with those sub-graphs found in the database of images.

It allows taking advantage of the growing availability of geographically referenced data and their potential richness. This includes the spatial analysis of risk such as epidemic risk or traffic accident risk in the road network. This work deals with the method of decision tree for spatial data classification. This method differs from conventional decision trees by taking account implicit spatial relationships in addition to other object attributes. Our approach consists in materializing those spatial relationships leading to treat them as normal attributes. Then, any conventional decision tree building method could be applied providing a spatial decision tree. Compared to existent approaches, this one is more flexible because no specific algorithm is imposed. Moreover, it considers the organization in several thematic layers that is characteristic of geographical data by distinguishing the intra theme and the inter theme relations (such as the road section contiguity or the proximity between road sections and schools). This method has been tested in the framework of traffic risk analysis.

The methodology is mainly based on the idea that a large case library can be transformed to a small case library together with a group of adaptation rules, which are generated by fuzzy decision trees. Firstly, an approach to learning feature weights automatically is used to evaluate the importance of different features in a given case-base. Secondly, clustering of cases will be carried out to identify different concepts in the case-base using the acquired feature knowledge. Thirdly, adaptation rules will be mined for each concept using fuzzy decision trees. Finally, a selection strategy based on the concepts of epsilon-coverage and epsilon-reachability is used to select representative cases. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated experimentally using two sets of testing data.

The model uses classification and regression trees (CART) techniques to generate the decision tree automatically. We collected 559 sentences from CCTV news program and built a corresponding speech corpus uttered by a professional male announcer. The prosodic boundaries were manually marked on the recorded speech, and word identification. part-of-speech tagging and syntactic analysis were also done on the text, A decision tree was then trained on 371 sentences (of approximately 50 min length). and tested on 188 sentences (of approximately 28 min length). Features for modeling prosody are proposed, and their effectiveness is measured by interpreting the resulting tree. We achieved a success rate of about 93%.

Usually a learning curve can be fitted by interpolating or extrapolating some points on it with a specified model. The obtained learning curve can then be used to predict the maximum achievable learning accuracy or to estimate the amount of data needed to achieve an expected learning accuracy, both of which will be especially meaningful to data mining on large data sets. Although some models have been proposed to model learning curves, most of them do not test their applicability to large data sets. In this paper, we focus on this issue. We empirically compare six potentially useful models by fitting learning curves of two typical classification algorithms-C4.5 (decision tree) and LOG (logistic discrimination) on eight large UCI benchmark data sets. By using all available data for learning, we fit a full-length learning curve; by using a small portion of the data, we fit a part-length learning curve. The models are then compared in terms of two performances: (1) how well they fit a full-length learning curve, and (2) how well a fitted part-length learning curve can predict learning accuracy at the full length. Experimental results show that the power law (y = a - b (*) x(-c)) is the best among the six models in both the performances for the two algorithms and all the data sets. These results support the applicability of learning curves to data mining.

J	Subramanian, V; Buck, KKS; Block, DE				Subramanian, V; Buck, KKS; Block, DE			Use of decision tree analysis for determination of critical enological and viticultural processing parameters in historical databases	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ENOLOGY AND VITICULTURE			English	Article						decision tree analysis; historical databases; Partial Least Squares		A method for optimizing wine quality or characteristics based on historical enological and viticultural data is being developed. The first step in this method is a database analysis and classification step where the most critical inputs to the process are determined. To identify critical processing inputs in large databases, we explored the use of decision tree analysis in conjunction with information theory for data classification. The success of this method lies in its ability to treat "categorical" variables (for example, vineyard, clone), which are typical of archived viticultural and enological data, as well as "continuous" variables (for example, temperature, sugar concentration). We have demonstrated that decision trees identify important variables using an enological database for which statistical analysis was previously completed. Results from both decision tree analysis and statistical analysis agree well. Both find the same subset of winemaking inputs in this database to be significant in classifying outputs such as tartaric acid concentration, total phenolic concentration, glycerol concentration, and malolactic fermentation duration. Decision tree analysis has also been tested successfully on an actual viticultural database from a winery to predict the effect of viticultural practices on wine quality, reducing a database of twenty inputs to six inputs that had a significant effect on a measure of wine quality. Partial Least Squares analysis has been explored as an alternative classification approach for databases containing only continuous variables, yielding comparable results:to decision tree analysis. The final method developed will provide wineries with a straightforward means to identify their most important enological and viticultural practices and ensure production of a wine with the desired qualities.

J	Tarter, J				Tarter, J			The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI)	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS			English	Review						exobiology; astrobiology; bioastronomy; optical SETI; life in the universe	EXTRA-SOLAR PLANETS; EARLY MARS; LIFE; EARTH; SIGNALS; PERSPECTIVES; RADIATION; ALH84001; SYSTEM; STARS	The search for evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence is placed in the broader astronomical context of the search for extrasolar planets and biomarkers of primitive life elsewhere in the universe. A decision tree of possible search strategies is presented as well as a brief history of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) projects since 1960. The characteristics of 14 SETI projects currently operating on telescopes are discussed and compared using one of many possible figures of merit. Plans for SETI searches in the immediate and more distant future are outlined. Plans for success, the significance of null results, and some opinions on deliberate transmission of signals (as well as listening) are also included. SETI results to date are negative, but in reality, not much searching has yet been done.

S	Jung, F		Tescher, AG		Jung, F			Detecting new buildings from aerial stereo pairs at different dates	APPLICATIONS OF DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING XXIV	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Applications of Digital Image Processing XXIV	JUL 31-AUG 03, 2001	SAN DIEGO, CA	SPIE				The aim of this application is to detect changes in an aerial scene by comparing stereo pairs taken at intervals of several years in order to update a database. The result is a set of image locations that have a high likelihood to contain changes. Each location will be submitted to a human operator who will either validate the given change and update the database or reject it. We are mainly interested in changes occuring for a specific class of objects : buildings. To isolate new construction, we provide an algorithm that works in two steps. First, during a focusing phase, we aim to eliminate a large part of the scene without losing any actual changes. This is achieved with a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) comparison between the two different dates. Then, in the second phase, we classify regions of interest (ROI). Each ROI is described by four images : a stereo pair of the focusing area at the first date and a stereo pair of the focusing area at the second date. To decide whether or not the ROI contains a change., we classify each of the four images as "building" or "non-building". The building vs non-building classifier is a combination of several decision trees induced by learning. Each node of a decision tree is identified with a graph of features which is more likely to describe buildings than background. Finally, the classification results at the two different dates are compared.

OncoDoc is a decision support system designed to provide best therapeutic recommendations for breast cancer patients. Developed as a browsing tool of a knowledge base structured as a decision tree, OncoDoc allows physicians to monitor the contextual instanciation of patient characteristics to build the best formal equivalent of an actual patient. Used as a computer-based eligibility screening system, depending on whether instanciated patient parameters are matched against guideline knowledge or available clinical trial protocols, it provides either evidence-based therapeutic options or relevant patient-specific clinical trials. Implemented at the Institut Gustave Roussy and routinely used at the point of care, it enhanced physician awareness of open trials and increased of 17% patient enrollment onto clinical trials. However, the analysis of the reasons for non-accrual of potentially eligible patients showed that physicians' psychological reluctance to refer patients to clinical trials, measured during the experiment at 25%, may not be resolved by the simple dissemination of personnalized clinical trial information.

When the recognition grammar is dynamic and obtained directly from written text, the language associated with each grammar item has to be identified using that text. Many methods proposed in the literature require fairly large amounts of text, which may not always be available. This paper describes a text-based language identification system developed for the identification of the language of short words, e.g., proper names, Two different approaches are compared. The n-gram method commonly used in the literature is first reviewed and further enhanced. We also propose a simple method for language identification that is based on decision trees. The methods are first evaluated in a text-based language identification task. Both methods are also tested as preprocessors for a multilingual speech recognition task, where the language of each text item has to be determined, in order to choose the correct text-to-pronunciation mapping. The experimental results show that the proposed methods perform very well, and merit further development.

Our proof works by improving a probabilistic argument in that paper, which also improves a graph packing lemma proved there. By a result of Groger [G92] our complexity lower bound carries over from bipartite to general monotone n-vertex. graph properties. Graph packing being a well-studied subject in its own right, our improved packing lemma and the probabilistic technique used to prove it, may be of independent interest.

Cooperating with the texture information extracted from the region of interest (ROI) image, a decision tree model generated from the training data in a top-down, general-to-specific direction with 24 co-variance texture features is used to classify the tumors as benign or malignant. In the experiments, accuracy rates for a experienced physician and the proposed CADx are 86.67% (78/90) and 95.50% (86/90), respectively.

This program is here presented and discussed in details. It is based on a decision tree it-ell defined, with pre and/or per gravidic serological screening with several different tests, completed, if necessary, by ultrasounds examinations of the fetus, biomolecular tests (PCR) oil amniotic fluid, and by clinical, biological, and radiological surveillance of neo-nates. The purpose of this prevention programm is to : 11 identify nonimmune Young women and limit their contamination risk during pregnancy by appropriate counseling on hygiene and diet; 21 screen and treat per gravidic toxoplasmosis as early as possible so as to prevent or limit transmission to the fetus and its consequences. 3 / in utero diagnose and treat infestation of the fetus; 4/diagnose and treat asymptomatic Congenital toxoplasmosis in neonates, to prevent risks of reactivation and late complications, especially ocular. Stich a prevention program has a cost validated by the prevalence of acquired toxoplasmosis in adults in France (over 50 % of the population) and by the yearly incidence of congenital toxoplasmosis (at least 0.1 % of births according to the best hypothesis). These 6 to 700 congenital toxoplasmosis cases per year may be compared to the 6 to 7 000 per gravidic seroconversions which could lead to fetal contamination if no preventive measures are taken. Nevertheless, as it is often the case in the field of prevention, it is very difficult to statistically assess the efficacy of this program ei-en though several arguments show that it allows to eliminate the most serious toxoplasmosis, sources of serious handicaps at birth, and to limit the frequency of late complications (especially retino-choroiditis) of asymptomatic infections in neonates. The position of European countries varies as to prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis. Some countries (Austria, Belgium) haw national prevention programs similar to the French one, whereas others haw set zip only limited programs or set lip no systematic prevention. These differences may be accounted for by the different frequencies of toxoplasmic risk. It seems mandatory to forget all dogmatism and not to stick to a strictly statistical approach for a disease with not only, medical but also social and human consequences.

After a nice-looking tree is defined, three operators are provided. In this method, a well-formed tree is drawn firstly, and then those operators are used to modify the position of nodes in the procedure of navigating a tree. A well-formed and compact tree can be acquired by using this algorithms, whose structure is clear and complexity is nearly linear. At the same time, the outline of how to visualize a tree is listed. Decision-trees can be well visualized by using it in our Data Mining system.

The methodology is mainly based on the idea that a large case library can be transformed to a small case library together with a group of adaptation rules, which take the form of fuzzy rules generated by the rough set technique. In paper [11, we have proposed a methodology for case base maintenance which used a fuzzy decision tree induction to discover the adaptation rules; in this paper, we focus on using a heuristic algorithm, i.e., a fuzzy-rough algorithm [2] in the process of simplifying fuzzy rules. This heuristic, regarded as a new fuzzy learning algorithm, has many significant advantages, such as rapid speed of training and matching, generating a family of fuzzy rules which is approximately simplest. By applying such a fuzzy-rough learning algorithm to the adaptation mining phase, the complexity of case base maintenance is reduced, and the adaptation knowledge is more compact and effective. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated experimentally using two sets of testing data, and we also compare the maintenance results of using fuzzy ID3, in [1], and the fuzzy-rough approach, as in this paper.

Outcome prediction at presentation is important in triage and management decisions as well as appropriate resource utilization. We performed a decision tree analysis combining clinical and CT scan features to predict poor and hopeless outcome at initial presentation in patients with lobar hemorrhage. Methods: We analyzed 81 patients with spontaneous lobar hemorrhage presenting within 48 hours of initial neurologic symptoms. In the first analysis, poor outcome was defined as Glasgow outcome score (GOS) of 1 (death), 2 (vegetative state) or 3 (dependence) at discharge. A second analysis was based on worst possible outcome (GOS 1-2). Binary recursive partitioning was fitted in a model, and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results: Lobes involved were temporal (36%), parietal (33%), frontal (25%) and occipital (6%). Seventy-three percent of patients presented less than 17 h after initial ictus. The probability of poor outcome was 97% (Cl 85-100%) in patients with hemorrhage greater than 40 cm(3). In the subset of patients with a volume less than 40 cm(3), time interval from ictus to presentation (< 17 h) together with a Glasgow coma score (GCS) less than or equal to 13 predicted poor outcome. Eighty-five percent (Cl 42-99%) of those presenting early with GCS less than or equal to 13 had a poor outcome. In the second analysis, all patients with GCS less than or equal to 12 and septum pellucidum shift >6 mm had GOS of 1 or 2 (Cl 72-100%). Conclusion: Poor outcome in patients with lobar hemorrhage is associated with a hemorrhage size of more than 40 cm(3), GCS less than or equal to 13, but also dependent on time interval between ictus and presentation. This is consistent with prior studies demonstrating deterioration from enlargement may occur when patients present early on. Stupor and septum pellucidum shift greater than 6 mm on CT scan at presentation predict a hopeless outcome in conservatively treated patients. Ninety-one percent of patients were treated medically, thus these outcomes are largely a reflection of the natural history of spontaneous lobar hemorrhage.

Design: A cost-minimisation analysis was performed through a decision tree, assuming the National Health System perspective. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events (GIAEs) in patients with OA treated with nimesulide or diclofenac. Results: Three studies were included in the meta-analysis, which included a sample size of 484 patients in total. The incidence of GIAEs is higher in patients treated with diclofenac than in those treated with nimesulide. Nimesulide is cost-saving in all three countries: treatment costs are reduced by Eurodollars (EUR) 1.5 per case in France, EUR2 in Italy and EUR3.6 in Spain. Final results are not sensitive to variation of incidence rates of gastric and intestinal events and to changes in the resource consumption: nimesulide always remains cost-saving. Conclusions: This is the first economic analysis carried out in three different countries on original epidemiological data comparing nimesulide and diclofenac directly. Projecting our results to the estimated OA prevalence in the entire population of the three countries, the expected savings to the NHS would vary from a minimum of EUR 17 500 000 in France to a maximum of EUR30 000 000 in Spain. It can be stated that these findings can provide support for clinicians and policy-makers for the adoption of this cost-saving treatment strategy in patients with OA.

These characteristics are obtained, however, at the significant cost of data and expert knowledge. It is often the case that a troubleshooting flow diagram, the most popular way of representing troubleshooting procedures, is already available for the system and can be used as a starting point for design of the Bayesian network. It turns out that conversion of the flow diagram into a Bayesian network is very similar to conversion into a diagnostic case base. We compare the case base and Bayesian network obtained by conversion with the original flow diagram, from the point of view of their diagnostic performance. We also describe a procedure for cost and time efficient enhancement of the original case base and Bayesian network. We discuss the sequencing algorithms necessary to use case bases and Bayesian networks in troubleshooting, with particular attention to decision tree and Value of Information based sequencing. We have used our design procedure in development of several complex diagnostic systems for troubleshooting of satellites, vehicles, and test equipment.

However, clinical prediction has not been reliable in spite of multiple assessment parameters such as symptom indices and flow rates. In this study, Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are used to train computers to predict the surgical outcome in BPH patients treated by TURP or VLAP. Our aim is to investigate whether Al can reproduce the clinical outcome of known cases and assist the urologist in predicting surgical outcomes. Four different Al algorithms are used. In particular, we use three feed-forward methods, i.e. Shepard's k-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayesian and ID3 decision tree, and one back-propagation Neural Network method. The programming was done in LISP, C++ and a relational database. In particular, 48 patients with known procedures and outcomes were used as training data. The data contained up to 11 questions (e.g. age, procedure, Qmax, AUA baseline score, PVR) with global assessment as outcome. The data was selected by a famous urologist. After loading and training the computer algorithms, the algorithms were tested using observed and unobserved examples to predict the outcome of the procedure. As a second part of the study the AI prediction was compared with the Urologist's prediction. We show that all four AI algorithms predicted known instances with an accuracy of 99%. There was little measurable differences between feed-forward only and back-propagation algorithms. Unobserved instances returned plausible outcomes. Finally experimental results are presented to show the power, versatility and robustness of the proposed AI techniques for predicting some surgical outcomes and therefore for improving patient outcome by better pre-treatment patient selection. We show that the techniques are robust to errors in the learning data set and provide more reliable information than arithmetic means or p-values. We also propose a prospective study, which is necessary to establish the clinical role of the proposed AI techniques based and its significant role in predicting surgical outcomes.

J	Lee, S; Oh, YH				Lee, S; Oh, YH			Tree-based modeling of intonation	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Article							TEXT-TO-SPEECH; SEGMENTAL DURATION; ENGLISH; RULES	This study describes tree-based intonation modeling for text-to-speech systems. The procedure for generating intonation consists of two phases: assigning tonal labels and predicting fundamental frequency contours, which are done by using tree-structured predictors. The decision tree assigns tonal labels to the syllables, and 10 sampled pitch values per syllable are predicted by a vector-regression tree. Additionally, we apply a bootstrap aggregating technique to improve the performance of the trees and create a born again tree as a representer of the multiple tree predictor. We collected 500 Korean sentences and their corresponding speech corpus, trained trees on 300 sentences, and tested them on 200 sentences. The overall misclassification rates of the born again trees were about 37% for boundary tone prediction and about 19% for non-boundary tone prediction. In the experiment on fundamental frequency contour prediction, we compared the tree-based modeling and linear regression methods with objective and subjective measures. The correlation coefficient for the observed pitch values and those predicted by the born again tree was 0.812, while a linear regression method yielded 0.805. In the subjective test, native Korean subjects clearly preferred the intonation generated by the born again vector-regression tree to that by the linear regression method. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

This paper shows that such multiple abstraction levels of data can cause undesirable effects in decision tree classification. After explaining that equalizing abstraction levels by force cannot provide satisfactory solutions of this problem, it presents a method to utilize the data as it is. The proposed method accommodates the generalization/specialization relationship between data values in both of the construction and the class assignment phases of decision tree classification. The experimental results show that the proposed method reduces classification error rates significantly when multiple abstraction levels of data are involved.

Neuroradiologists' experience plays a critical role during the process due to the lack of knowledge about the relationships between influential factors and types of tumor. In order to improve the diagnosis accuracy without incurring the troubles in learning experience from domain experts, we ask help from data mining. Multi-layer perceptron network (MLP), decision tree, and rules induction are its common techniques. They are adopted to extract useful diagnostic patterns directly from MRI records of brain glioma patients. Testing accuracy got from 10-fold cross-validation test reveals that MLP outperforms the others, and rules induction is better than ID3. However, during the test, none of these algorithms can guarantee its accuracy always above 80%, which is required by possible users. To make things worse, overspecialization or over-fitting hurts these techniques to various extents. A vote scheme is implemented to solve these problems. Its testing result is satisfactory. When put into practice, the scheme correctly diagnoses all 6 new cases with surgical confirmation. The work proves that, with the help of data mining techniques, it is viable to acquire diagnostic patterns directly from brain glioma cases. A vote scheme based on different data mining techniques is helpful to alleviate over-fitting and improve prediction accuracy.

The Decision Tree C4.5 is reviewed with the Rough Set Theory. An enhanced window application is developed to facilitate the pre-processing filtering by introducing the feature (attribute) transformations, which allows users to input formulas and create new attributes. Also, the application produces three varieties of data set with delaying, averaging, and summation. The results prove the improvement of preprocessing by applying feature (attribute) transformations on Decision Tree C4.5. Moreover, the comparison between Decision Tree C4.5 and Rough Set Theory is based on the clarity, automation, accuracy, dimensionality, raw data, and speed, which is supported by the rules sets generated by both algorithms on three different sets of data.

The data base structure is assumed to consist of a single dependent variable and an unspecified number of independent variables (if the data base contains more than one dependent variable, a separate model is built for each dependent variable). Given a set of values for the independent variables, the fuzzy logic model estimates the value of the dependent variable, and the error in the estimated value. The algorithm re-organizes the data records into a multi-dimensional partition tree. The tree is binary (teach node is partitioned into exactly two disjoint nodes) and unbalanced (the two child nodes do not have the same number of members). The partitioning algorithm is greedy: each node is partitioned independently, and at each node the algorithm searches to find the independent variable and partition threshold that best accounts for variance in the dependent variable. Partitioning stops when the variance in the dependent variable at a node is less than some user-specified threshold. Fuzzy logic rules are constructed from the leaf nodes. The algorithm compresses the data base into a set of fuzzy logic rules. The set of fuzzy logic rules is a model of the information in the data base. We conducted "meta-analysis" of the relationships between the independent and dependent variables by studying how the independent variables are used in the fuzzy logic model, i.e., the number of rules that use each independent variable and the number of data records in the training data to which those rules apply. In the trial study, we applied the fuzzy logic model induction system to the multi-sensor SPIE Knowledge Discovery Challenge database on the unbalance in a rotating shaft. The data base structure has seven dependent variables and seventeen independent variables. The independent variables represent readings made by sensors at four different locations. We studied the contribution of data from the different sensors towards explaining the variance in several of the dependent variables. We assess model quality in terms of the number of rules, the root-mean-squared estimation error over the training data, and the number of spurious rules. We analyze spurious rules by introducing an artificial pseudo-random independent variable and conducting repeated trials with different seeds.

In this chapter, we describe our experiences in applying data mining to a problem in astronomy, namely, the identification of radio-emitting galaxies with a bent-double morphology. Until recently, astronomers associated with the FIRST (Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm) survey identified these galaxies through a visual inspection of images. While this manual approach has been very subjective and tedious, it is also becoming increasingly infeasible as the survey has grown in size. Upon completion, FIRST will include almost a million galaxies, making the use of semi-automated analysis methods necessary. We describe the FIRST data set and the problem of identifying bent-double galaxies. We discuss our solution approach, focusing on the challenges we face in the application of data mining to a scientific data set. We explain why, in contrast with most commercial data mining applications, data preprocessing requires a considerable effort in scientific applications. Using decision tree classifiers, we describe the work we are doing in the detection of bent-double galaxies. Our results indicate that data mining techniques, steered by proper domain knowledge, can greatly enhance the manual exploration of massive data sets.

In this regard, we have been exploring ways of modifying machine learning techniques so that the resulting predictive models likewise reflect the empirical characteristics of observed data. Following the principles of robust estimation, our methodology involves first examining the data to identify an appropriate family of statistical distributions for modeling the data, and then incorporating the corresponding maximum-likelihood estimation procedures into a decision tree algorithm. We have applied this methodology to insurance risk modeling and have obtained tree-based models superior to those obtained using conventional classification and regression tree algorithms.

In the past few years, extensive research was done in the database community on learning rules using exhaustive search under the name of association rule mining. The objective there is to find all rules in data that satisfy the user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence. Although the whole set of rules may not be used directly for accurate classification, effective and efficient classifiers have been built using the rules. This paper aims to improve such an exhaustive search based classification system CBA (Classification Based on Associations). The main strength of this system is that it is able to use the most accurate rules for classification. However, it also has weaknesses. This paper proposes two new techniques to deal with these weaknesses. This results in remarkably accurate classifiers. Experiments on a set of 34 benchmark datasets show that on average the new techniques reduce the error of CBA by 17% and is superior to CBA on 26 of the 34 datasets. They reduce the error of the decision tree classifier C4.5 by 19%, and improve performance on 29 datasets. Similar good results are also achieved against the existing classification systems, RIPPER, LB and a Naive-Bayes classifier.

In this work, we analysed a 30 months record of runoff and sediment yield from an experimental station in Benidorm, SE Spain, comprising a total of 104 rainfall events. We adopted a decision-tree approach to identify the environmental variables, basically rainfall characteristics, which were the most informative to predict the production of runoff or sediment and, for these variables, to determine thresholds for different levels of production. A set of 11 rainfall parameters, most of them highly correlated, were simultaneously presented to the C4.5 software tool. Using the variable AI30, which combines the information of height and intensity, 98% of the cases were correctly classified as productive or non-productive for runoff, with an estimate of 5% for the expected error. For the production of sediments, the Idnetic energy of the rainfall and the storm duration were incorporated into the prediction vector, giving a 1% of misclassifications and an expected error of 6%. For a subset of cases, the length of the dry period and the antecedent soil moisture were also considered, but no improvement was detected. We also considered the level of production, which was automatically classified as low, medium or high, and obtained decision trees of higher order with higher error rates. The usefulness and drawbacks of the methods for the problems in erosion research considered in this work are discussed.

Designing such an organization, however, is a complicated problem. Traditionally, this design is mainly done by hand. To what extent this can be automated is a challenging problem. Recently, there have been investigations on how to reorganize an existing web site based on some criteria. But none of them has addressed the problem of organizing a web site, automatically from scratch. In this paper, we attempt to tackle this problem by restricting the domain to online catalog organization. We model an online catalog organization as a decision tree structure and propose a metric, based on the popularity of products and the relative importance of product attribute values, to evaluate the quality of a catalog organization. The problem is then formulated as a decision tree construction problem. Although traditional decision tree algorithms, such as C4.5, can be used to generate online catalog organization, the catalog constructed is generally not good based on our metric. An efficient greedy algorithm (GENCAT) is thus developed and the experimental results show that GENCAT produces better catalog organizations based on our metric.

Automation of this process is desirable but development of reliable predictive models with good performance to support this task in operational basis presents many difficulties. In this paper we present and discuss the NEMO prototype that has been built in order to support short-term prediction of NO, maximum concentration levels in Athens, Greece. NEMO is based on a case-based reasoning approach combining heuristic and statistical techniques. The process of development of the system, its architecture and its performance, are described in this paper. NEMO performance is compared with that of a back propagating neural network and a decision tree. The overall performance of NEMO makes it a good candidate to support air pollution experts in operational conditions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

An accurately estimated classification model for several severity types of RTA as a function of related factors provides crucial information for the prevention of potential accidents. Here, three data-mining techniques (neural network, logistic regression, decision tree) are used to select a set of influential factors and to build up classification models for accident severity. The three approaches are then compared in terms of classification accuracy. The finding is that accuracy does not differ significantly for each model and that the protective device is the most important factor in the accident severity variation.

This study was aimed at classifying asthmatic subjects using a statistical decision rule that minimised the misclassification rate with respect to the clinicians' diagnosis. The rule was defined by a combination of predictors that are easily observed in epidemiological studies (asthma-like questions, physiological tests) without necessarily including the clinical opinion of expert physicians. From pooled data on 1103 subjects at the three Italian centres of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) a post-consensus clinicians' diagnosis of asthma was obtained, and seven predictors were selected from among 18 potential candidates (specificity ranged from 64 to 99%, but sensitivity ranged from 22 to 62%). This data set was processed with tree-structured classifier techniques (the Classification And Regression Trees, CART), classical discriminant analysis (Fisher's Linear Discriminant Function, LDF), and the neural network method (Multi-Layer Perceptron, MLP model). The results suggest that modifications of the 'classification tree' provide a more useful decision rule, sensitive (93%) and specific (85%), than either LDF or MLP. The decision tree is readily interpretable from a clinical perspective and uses five out of the seven predictors (in descending hierarchical order: ever had asthma, current asthma, shortness of breath, atopy and wheezing and breathless). The findings seem to indicate a considerable success with respect to previous epidemiological studies and await repetition in other ECHRS populations.

Identifying the changes that can remedy process deficiencies is not an easy task. Moreover, considerable risk is associated with implementing the proposed changes, since inadequate process design may cause a significant financial loss. In this paper, we investigate the potential of simulation for analyzing and improving software maintenance processes. We present a simple, decision tree based model suitable for software maintenance process simulation. The purpose of the model is to evaluate alternative process strategies and designs from customer perspective. We apply the model to investigate deficiencies of the real software maintenance process and present a simulation experiment that examines an actual process design. Finally, we discuss the usability of simulation modeling for comparing and evaluating alternative process strategies in a real software process environment.

Decision tree building methods usually have problems because of the nature of the tree to split the learning samples to more subsets. If the classification for such a subset is not possible it's better to put off the decision on classification to some other classifier. This leads to introduction of a null classification which simply means that no classification is possible in this step. This approach is sensible with evolutionary methods as they can handle a number of trees simultaneously. In the process of construction we have to address the problem if a classification is sensible, Performance of the proposed model has been tested on several datasets and presented results on one such dataset show its potential.

In digital remote sensing third order image characteristics are considered a nuisance, while potentially useful spatial information has been usually ignored, due to lack of methodology and computational limitations. However few researchers have under-taken integration of spatial and spectral information for image classification: variogram-derived texture has been recently proved to increase the accuracy. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of variogram-derived texture measures applied to classification of high ground resolution imagery. The study was conducted using ADAR images acquired over the Santa Monica Mountains, dominated by chaparral vegetation. Textural parameters were derived from a moving geographic window (of a size determined by the range), as opposed to the commonly applied geometric window of a fixed size. Binary decision tree was used to assess the potential of texture derived from variograms, cross variograms and pseudo-cross variograms, to discriminate between land cover classes. Finally, images were classified using the most significant texture measures and the accuracy was compared with the accuracy of standard per-pixel classification. Overall classification accuracy increased by as much as 15%. Accuracy of homogeneous classes did not change, while significant increase was reported for highly textured classes. Further methods of improving accuracy using variogram-derived texture were discussed.

Attributes of geology, slope, aspect, morphology, curvature and vegetation were determined for the study area at a 5 m pixel resolution within a GIs environment. A decision tree analysis was employed to gather attribute values from landslides mapped following the 25-28(th) January 1974 rainfall event and to use this data as training for the prediction of further areas of potential instability. Application of a decision tree analysis creates rulesets of the most "informative" attributes that define areas of landslide potential as well as attributes that define areas of little landslide potential. The rulesets were then imported back into a GIs environment where they were located spatially. Field checking indicates that the predictions for further areas of potential landslide activity within this region are intuitively sound. It is envisaged that this research will prove beneficial to managers and land use planners involved in regional assessments.

This expert system or resource manager is made up of four trees, the isolated platform tree, the multi-platform tree, the fuzzy parameter selection tree and the fuzzy strategy tree. The isolated platform tree provides a fuzzy decision tree that allows an individual platform to respond to a threat. The multi-platform tree allows a group of platforms to respond to a threat in a collaborative fashion. The fuzzy parameter selection tree is designed to make optimal selections of root concept parameters. Finally, the strategy tree is a fuzzy tree that an agent uses to try to predict the behavior of an enemy.

After presenting this novel approach, we describe an example application that investigates the stability of a class library interface, as we move form version to version of the library, using structural metrics as stability indicators. We conducted a study on different versions of a commercial C++ class library using both a standard binary tree approach and our fuzzy logic approach; the obtained results are very promising when comparing the No methods.

By Successive State Splitting (SSS) algorithm, the Hi en Markov Network (HM-Net), which is an efficient representation of phoneme-context-dependent HAIM, can be generated automatically. SSS is a powerful technique to design topologies of tied-state HMMs, but it doesn't treat unknown contexts in the training phoneme contexts environments adequately. 117 addition it has some problem in the procedure of the contextual domain. 117 this paper, we adopt a new state-clustering algorithm of SSS, called Phonetic Decision Tree-based SSS (PDT-SSS), which includes contexts splits based on the Korean phonological rides. This method combines advantages of both the decision tree clustering and SSS, and can generate highly accurate HM-Nets that can express any contexts. Through the Korean phoneme and word recognition experiments, we proved that the new state-clustering algorithm produce better phoneme and word recognition accuracy than the conventional HMMs.	Yeungnam Univ, Dept Info & Com Engn, Kyungsan, South Korea	Oh, SJ (reprint author), Yeungnam Univ, Dept Info & Com Engn, Kyungsan, South Korea.

A population of trees is evolved by employing the genetic operators and every individual is evaluated by using a fitness function based on the J-measure. The method is able to deal with large data sets since it uses a parallel implementation of genetic programming through the grid model and an out of core technique for those data sets that do not fit in main memory. Preliminary experiments on data sets from the UCI machine learning repository give good classification outcomes and asses the scalability of the method.

While halting urbanization is not possible, identifying and anticipating the location, size and growth rate of urbanized areas is an important component to understanding, adapting to, and mitigating many aspects of global change. The main objective of this research is to improve understanding of the methodological, scale and validation requirements for mapping urban land cover from coarse resolution remotely sensed MODIS one kilometer data. Defining the extent of urban land is crucial, since knowledge of the size and spatial distribution of cities is important for regional and global environmental modeling as well as resource management and economic development planning. This research relies on the use of a supervised decision tree classifier, a nonparametric algorithm that has been shown to be effective for classifying noisy and incomplete data sets. A technique called boosting improves classification accuracy and provides a means to correct major sources of error using available prior information from the DMSP-OLS radiance calibrated nighttime Lights data set. Results for North America indicate that the incorporation of DMSP-OLS data successfully improves urban classification results. Traditional as well as new measures of accuracy assessment demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology for creating accurate maps of cities over large areas.

An ordered tree-shellable Function is a positive Boolean function such that the number of prime implicants equals the number of paths from the root node to a 1-node in its ordered binary decision tree representation. We show that given an OBDD, it is: possible to check within polynomial time if the function is ordered tree-shellable with respect to the variable ordering of the OBDD.

Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE, Neural Networks Council			PERCEPTION; MOTION	In this paper we have developed two ensembles of neural network classifiers in order to recognize actors' gender from their biological movements. One is the ensemble of modular MLPs (experts), the other is the ensemble of modular MLPs and an inductive decision tree which combines the output of experts. The human movement database consists of 13 males' and 13 females' movements, and contains 10 repetitions of knocking, waving and lifting movements both in neutral and angry style. Features have been extracted with 4 different representations such as the 2D and 3D velocities and positions, recorded from 6 point lights attached on body. We have compared the results of ensembles to the regular classifiers such as MLP decision tree, self-organizing map and support vector machine. Furthermore, the discriminability and efficiency have been calculated for the comparison with the human performance that has been obtained with the same experiment. Our experimental results indicate that the ensemble models are superior to the conventional classifiers and human participants.

Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE, Neural Networks Council				Decision tree pruning is useful in improving the generalization performance of decision trees. As opposed to explicit pruning in which nodes are removed from fully constructed decision trees, implicit pruning uses a stopping criteria to label a node as a leaf node when splitting it further would not result in acceptable improvement in performance. The stopping criteria is often also called the pre-pruning criteria and is typically based on the pattern instances available at node (i.e. local information), We propose a new criteria for pre-pruning based on a novel classifiability measure. The proposed criteria not only considers the number of pattern instances of different classes at a node (node purity) but also the spatial distribution of these instances to estimate the effect of further splitting the node. The algorithm and some experimental results are presented in this paper.

Rule-extraction algorithms are used for both interpreting neural networks and mining the relationship between input and output variables in data. This paper describes a new rule extraction algorithm that extracts rules that contain both continuous (real-valued) and discrete literals. This algorithm decomposes a neural network using decision trees and obtains production rules by merging the rules extracted from each tree.

Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE, Neural Networks Council				Neural networks have been widely applied to various tasks, such as handwritten character recognition, autonomous robot driving, determining the consensus base in DNA sequences. In this paper, we describe the use of backpropagation neural networks for pruning decision trees. Decision tree pruning is indispensable for making the overfitting trees more accurate in classifying unseen data. In decision trees, the overfitting can occur when the size of the tree is too large compared to the number of training data. Many methods for decision tree pruning have been proposed, and all of them remove some nodes from the tree to reduce its size. However, some removed nodes may have a significance level or some contribution in classifying new data. Therefore, instead of absolutely removing nodes, our proposed method employs a backpropagation neural network to give weights to nodes according to their significance. Experimental results on twenty domains demonstrate that our method outperforms error-based pruning.

Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE, Neural Networks Council				Decision tree induction is well suited for applications requiring simple, explicit and intuitive classification structure. Typically, decision tree induction is based on a top-down greedy algorithm that makes locally optimal decisions at each node. Due to the greedy and local nature of decision tree induction algorithms, it is possible that a decision is made at a node which while maximizing the number of correct classifications at the node leaves a complex distribution of incorrectly classified instances requiring a large number of additional child nodes for classification. Due to the deteriorating generalization performance with increasing size and depth of the tree, construction of decision trees of small size and depth is a fundamental to widespread realization of the many benefits of decision tree based classification. In this paper we present a decision tree induction method based on a novel classifiability measure. The proposed algorithm makes a decision at a node based on the number of correctly classified instances at the node as well as the classifiability of the incorrectly classified instances. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm using a biomedical dataset in which optical images of human infant skin, coupled with localized noninvasive biophysical measurement of epidermal skin barrier properties are used to evaluate the health of the skin.

These classification techniques are applied to antenatal fetal risk assessment problem and the performances, the computational complexities and the importance of each technique in terms of diagnostic clues are observed. The task is to investigate the doppler ultrasound measurements of umbilical artery (UA) to relate the health conditions of fetuses using discriminant functions such as linear discriminant functions (LDF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), decision trees (C4.5, CART) and neural trees. We use the following UA blood flow velocity waveforms: pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI) and systolic/diastolic ratio (S/D) in terms of weeks (week index: WI as a normalized value) to decide if there is any hypoxia suspicion. It is observed that the performances of MLP and CART are better but C4.5 defines understandable diagnostic clues. On the other hand, the time complexity of LDF and C4.5 are becomes favorable. Experiments support that C4.5, MLP, CART and neural trees are favorable medical aids to phycisians during intensive surveilance of fetuses. With the limited number of indices, we obtain a specificity and sensitivity of 100% and 93% with these decision techniques.

The system is based on a novel method combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with hierarchical multi-scale theory and Discrete Hidden Markov Models (DHMM). We use a hierarchical decision tree based on multi-scale theory. Firstly we convolve all members of the training data with a Gaussian kernel, which blurs differences between images and reduces their separation in feature space. This reduces the number of eigenvectors needed to describe the data. A principal component space is computed from the convolved data. We divide the data in this space into two clusters using the k-means algorithm. Then the level of blurring is reduced and PCA is applied to each of the clusters separately. A new principal component space is formed from each cluster. Each of these spaces is then divided into two and the process is repeated. We thus produce a binary tree of principal component spaces where each level of the tree represents a different degree of blurring. The search time is then proportional to the depth of the tree, which makes it possible to search hundreds of gestures in real time. The output of the decision tree is then input into DHMM to recognise temporal information.

B	Asaithambi, A; Valev, V		Smari, WW		Asaithambi, A; Valev, V			A decision-tree approach to the discovery of empirical regularities	INFORMATION REUSE AND INTEGRATION			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration	NOV 27-29, 2001	LAS VEGAS, NV	Int Soc Comp & Their Applicat				One of the standard problems of data mining is the discovery of empirical regularities in large amounts of data. In pattern recognition terminology, empirical regularities are known by the name Non-Reducible Descriptors (NRDs), especially when Boolean variables are used in pattern descriptions. In this paper, a decision-tree model for the construction of an empirical regularity or an NRD is presented. A computational procedure for the construction of all empirical regularities (or NRDs) for a given pattern is developed using this model. The procedure is illustrated with an application to the pattern recognition problem of recognizing Arabic numerals. Finally, an analysis of the computational complexity of the procedure is also presented.

In this context, the mapping problem poses the challenge of defining the elements of these models and to link them into an appropriate way that reflects design options. The task-dialog and task-presentation mapping problem investigates to what extent a dialog model and a presentation model can be derived from a task model and subsequently linked from it. Some preliminary results for solving this type of mapping problem at a high level of abstraction are provided and exemplified on some particular model representations. A task model for a single-user interactive application is formed with the ConcurTaskTrees notation. From the definition of its operators, a set of systematic rules for simultaneously deriving and linking elements for both dialog and presentation models are presented. These rules are organized into a decision tree presenting designers with design alternatives. To depict the models' elements that can be derived and linked from these rules, the Windows Transition graphical notation is exploited.

J	Duntsch, I; Gediga, G				Duntsch, I; Gediga, G			Roughian: Rough information analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							SETS	Rough set data analysis (RSDA), introduced by Pawlak,(1) has become a much researched method of knowledge discovery with over 1200 publications to date.(2) One feature which distinguishes RSDA from other data analysis methods is that, in its original form, it gathers all its information from the given data, and does not make external model assumptions as all statistical and most machine learning methods (including decision tree procedures) do. The price which needs to be paid for the parsimony of this approach, however, is that some statistical backup is required, for example, to deal with random influences to which the observed data may be subjected. In supplementing RSDA by such meta-procedures care has to be taken that the same non-invasive principles are applied. In a sequence df papers and conference contributions, we have developed the components of a non-invasive method of data analysis, which is based on the RSDA principle, but is not restricted to "classical" RSDA applications. In this article, we present for the first time in a unified way the foundation and tools of such rough information analysis. (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The object representation scheme is based on the polygonal approximations of object contours. C4.5 is used to learn each of the binary-class tree classifiers which are used to predict the class of each segment of an object. A new decision combination method is used to determine the class of an object based on class probability distribution of each segment of the object on each of the binary-class trees. The proposed object classification approach is invariant to translation, rotation, and scale changes of objects. On applying this approach to a hand tool image database in the situation of image retrieval, tile experimental results show that the retrieval performance is significantly better than the results obtained by previous studies.

This paper proposes a method of sensor space segmentation for visual attention control that enables mobile robots to realize efficient observation. The efficiency is considered from a viewpoint of not geometrical reconstruction but unique action selection based on information criterion regardless of localization uncertainty. The method builds a decision tree based on the information criterion while taking the time needed for observation into account, and attention control is done by following the tree. The tree is rebuilt by introducing contextual information for more efficient attention control. The method is applied to a four legged robot that tries to shoot a ball into the goal. Discussion on the visual attention control in the method is given and the future issues are shown.

We have taken personnel data from our university's computing and network services department and have manually tagged 984 records as "good" or "bad". Of these, 558 were "good" and 420 were "bad." At this point, we began the quest to find good features for a predictive model. We used ten percent of the pre-classified data for training and ninety percent for testing. To build the model, we used a simple implementation of a C4.5 decision tree, and achieved an average accuracy rate of 97.8%. We note that all of the data we used included solely character fields, so, for now, our approach must be limited to character data.

The first classifier employs the decision-theoretic approach and the second classifier is a neural network structure. Key features are extracted using a zero crossing sampler. A novel decision tree is proposed and optimum threshold values are found for the decision theoretic approach. For the neural network, the optimum structure is found to be the smallest structure to give 100% overall success rate. The performance of the both classifiers has been evaluated by simulating bandlimited FSK4 and FSK8 signals corrupted by Gaussian noise. It is shown that the neural network outperforms the decision-theoretic approach particularly for SNR < 10dB.

J	Rahimi, M; Dessouky, M				Rahimi, M; Dessouky, M			A hierarchical task model for dispatching in computer-assisted demand-responsive paratransit operation	ITS JOURNAL			English	Article						paratransit service; computer automation; dispatch operation; task analysis; decision tree; dispatch training; human-computer interaction		This research was conducted to organize and model a comprehensive set of paratransit dispatching task activity in a computer-assisted control room. The dispatching task involves continuous monitoring and interaction with archived and real-time data using a typical dispatch software. Extensive field observations and video recordings of dispatch operations were conducted. Then, a skeleton decision model of the dispatchers activities was generated and later validated with an expert dispatcher. Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) was used to further refine this model into a comprehensive HTA decision hierarchy (decision tree). To capture the complexity of multi-dispatcher operation, we extended this model to a simultaneous operation of two collaborative dispatchers in the same control room-a van dispatcher and a lead dispatcher. The results of this analysis showed that HTA could be used to model such an activity with a high degree of Fidelity.

Finding appropriate categories and manually assigning them to existing documents is very laborious. This paper shows a simple procedure for automatic extraction of atomic sense types (semantic categories) from documents based on rough sets. The atomic sense types are nodes of a sense type decision tree, which represents a taxonomy.

J	Elomaa, T; Kaariainen, M				Elomaa, T; Kaariainen, M			An analysis of reduced error pruning	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							DECISION TREES	Top-down induction of decision trees has been observed to suffer from the inadequate functioning of the pruning phase. In particular, it is known that the size of the resulting tree grows linearly with the sample size, even though the accuracy of the tree does not improve. Reduced Error Pruning is an algorithm that has been used as a representative technique in attempts to explain the problems of decision tree learning. In this paper we present analyses of Reduced Error Pruning in three different settings. First we study the basic algorithmic properties of the method, properties that hold independent of the input decision tree and pruning examples. Then we examine a situation that intuitively should lead to the subtree under consideration to be replaced by a leaf node, one in which the class label and attribute values of the pruning examples are independent of each other. This analysis is conducted under two different assumptions. The general analysis shows that the pruning probability of a node fitting pure noise is bounded by a function that decreases exponentially as the size of the tree grows. In a specific analysis we assume that the examples are distributed uniformly to the tree. This assumption lets us approximate the number of subtrees that are pruned because they do not receive any pruning examples. This paper clarifies the different variants of the Reduced Error Pruning algorithm, brings new insight to its algorithmic properties, analyses the algorithm with less imposed assumptions than before, and includes the previously overlooked empty subtrees to the analysis.

These data sometimes include the data with a different distribution pattern or with different numbers of animals in each group. The tree-type algorithm has long been used commonly to promptly analyze the difference between the control group and dosage groups. In Japan, the decision tree has been used since 1982 with several modifications of the initial procedure. Recently, the method has been revised to have a high power. The changes have been made in two directions; one is a sophisticated method and the other is a simplified method. In this paper, the historical transition of the decision tree is described and the future of the decision tree forecasted.

J	Hunter, A				Hunter, A			A default logic based framework for context-dependent reasoning with lexical knowledge	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						knowledge representation; lexical knowledge; non-monotonic logic; default logic; reasoning under uncertainty	LANGUAGE; REPRESENTATION	Lexical knowledge is increasingly important in information systems-for example in indexing documents using keywords, or disambiguating words in a query to an information retrieval system, or a natural language interface. However, it is a difficult kind of knowledge to represent and reason with. Existing approaches to formalizing lexical knowledge have used languages with limited expressibility, such as those based on inheritance hierarchies, and in particular, they have not adequately addressed the context-dependent nature of lexical knowledge. Here we present a framework, based on default logic, called the dex framework, for capturing context-dependent reasoning with lexical knowledge. Default logic is a first-order logic offering a more expressive formalisation than inheritance hierarchies: (1) First-order formulae capturing lexical knowledge about words can be inferred; (2) Preferences over formulae can be based on specificity, reasoning about exceptions, or explicit priorities; (3) Information about contexts can be reasoned with as first-order formulae formulae; and (4) Information about contexts can be derived as default inferences. In the dex framework, a word for which lexical knowledge is sought is called a query word. The context for a query word is derived from further words, such as words in the same sentence as the query word. These further words are used with a form of decision tree called a context classification tree to identify which contexts hold for the query word. We show how we can use these contexts in default logic to identify lexical knowledge about the query word such as synonyms, antonyms, specializations, meronyms, and more sophisticated first-order semantic knowledge. We also show how we can use a standard machine learning algorithm to generate context classification trees.

The paper bases the proposed classification not on people's intentions but upon objective evidence of maintainers' activities ascertainable from observation of activities and artifacts, and/or a before and after comparison of the software documentation, The classification includes taking into account in a semi-hierarchical manner evidence of the change or lack thereof in: (1) the software, (2) the documentation, (3) the properties of the software, and (4) the customer-experienced functionality: A comparison is made with other classifications and typologies. The paper provides a classified list of maintenance activities and a condensed decision tree as a summary guide to the proposed evidence-based classification of the types of software evolution and software maintenance.

Amer Med Informat Assoc			SYSTEM	Computerized Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) improve quality of care by assisting physicians in their decision making. A number of problems emerges since patients with close characteristics are given contradictory recommendations. In this article, we propose to use fuzzy logic to modelize uncertainty due to the use of thresholds in CPGs. A fuzzy classification procedure has been developed that provides for each message of the CPG, a strength of recommendation that rates the appropriateness of the recommendation for the patient under consideration. This work is done in the context of a CPG for the diagnosis and the management of hypertension, published in 1997 by the French agency ANAES. A population of 82 patients with mild to moderate hypertension was selected and the results of the classification system were compared to whose given by a classical decision tree. Observed agreement is 86.6% and the variability of recommendations for patients with close characteristics is reduced.

Amer Med Informat Assoc			INTENSIVE-CARE UNIT; ALARMS	As many as 86% of intensive care unit (ICU) alarms are false. Multiple signal integration of temporal monitor data by decision tree induction may improve artifact detection. We explore the effect of data granularity on model-building by comparing models made from 1-second versus 1-minute data. Models developed from 1-minute data remained effective when tested on 1-second data. Model development using 1-minute data means that more hours of ICU monitoring (including more artifacts) can be processed in less time. Compression of temporal data by arithmetic mean, therefore, can be an effective method for decreasing knowledge discovery processing time without compromising learning.

In the description of the decision tree by normal genetic programming, the division conditions by the attribute are connected with AND operator, and the tree evaluates effectiveness as a rule, However, if the description of the function node is modified, a more flexible rule is sure to be able to be generated. In this paper, we show that the description of a more flexible decision tree is possible by the addition of the OR function and NOT function to the function node group.

In contrary to the common decision tree the vector decision tree can make more than just one suggestion per input sample. It has the functionality of many separate decision trees acting on a same set of training data and answering different questions. Vector decision tree is therefore simple in its form, is easy to use and analyse and can express some relationships between decisions not visible before. To explore and test the possibilities of this concept we developed a software tool - DecRain - for building vector decision trees using the ideas of evolutionary computing. Generated vector decision trees showed good results in comparison to classical decision trees. The concept of vector decision trees can be effectively used in any decision making process especially as computerised consulting systems. In the present paper we will present the application of vector decision trees in consulting about the style, cost range, colour etc. of young people which can be used in planing the clothing design and production.

The method is useful especially in case of a multi-class problem or a noisy domain where unseen data are often not covered by the rules. Our method employs the Backpropagation Neural Network for the approximation. To build the network, we propose a technique for generating features from the rules to be used as inputs to the network. Our method has been evaluated on four domains of first-order learning problems. The experimental results show improvements of our method over the use of the original rules. We also applied our method to approximate match of propositional rules converted from an unpruned decision tree. In this case, our method can be thought of as soft-pruning of the decision tree. The results on multi-class learning domains in the UCI repository of machine learning databases show that our method performs better than standard C4.5's pruned and unpruned trees.

It is intended to discover the relevant knowledge for picture analysis and diagnosis from the database of image descriptions. Knowledge engineering methods are used to obtain a list of attributes for symbolic image descriptions. An expert describes images according to this list, and stores descriptions in the database. Digital image processing can be applied to improve imaging of specific image features or to get expert-independent feature evaluation. Decision tree induction is used to team the expert knowledge, presented in the form of image descriptions in the database. Constructed decision tree presents effective models of decision-making, which can be learned to support image classification by the expert. A tool for data mining and image processing is presented. The developed tool and methodology have been tested in the task of early differential diagnosis of pulmonary nodules in lung tomograms and was effective for preclinical diagnosis of peripheral lung cancer, so that we applied the developed methodology of data mining in other medical tasks such as lymph node diagnosis in MRI and investigation of breast MRI.

Diatoms are unicellular algae found in water and other places wherever there is humidity and enough light for photo synthesis. The proposed automatic identification scheme follows a decision tree based classification approach. In this paper two different ensemble learning methods are evaluated and results are compared with those of single decision trees. As test sets two different diatom image databases are used. For each image in the databases general features like symmetry, geometric properties, moment invariants, and Fourier descriptors as well as diatom specific features like striae density and direction are computed.

When computing k instances of a Boolean function f, Beigel and Hirst (STOC '98) showed that [log(2)k] + 1 help bits axe necessary to reduce the complexity of f, for any function f, and exhibit the functions for which [log(2)k] + 1 help bits reduce the complexity. Their functions must satisfy the condition that their. complexity is greater than or equal to k - 1. In this paper, we show new functions satisfying the above conditions whose complexity axe only 2rootk. We also investigate the help bit problem when we are only allowed to use decision trees of depth 1. Moreover, we exhibit the close relationship between the help bit problem and the complexity for circuits with a majority gate at the top.

Three different problems were identified, computability (e.g. determinism of the eCPG), logic (e.g. ambiguities when combining Booleans operators) and external validity (i.e. stability of decision for variations around thresholds and proportion of subjects classified in the various terminal nodes). The last problem concerned documentation of evidence: the level of evidence was associated only with the terminal decision node and not with the pathway through the decision tree. We concluded that computerisation of guidelines is not possible without expertise or authors advices. To improve computability it is necessary to provide authors with a framework that checks ambiguities, and logical errors.

Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines have been developed to disseminate state-of-the-art information concerning treatment strategy but these guidelines are poorly used in routine practice. The ASTI project aims to design a guideline-based ordering system to enable general practitioners to avoid prescription errors and to improve compliance with best therapeutic practices. The "critic mode" operates as a background process and corrects the physician's prescription on the basis of automatically triggered elementary rules that account for isolated guideline recommendations. The "guided mode" directs the physician to the best treatment by browsing a comprehensive guideline knowledge base represented as a decision tree. A first prototype, applied to hypertension, is currently under development.	DSI AP HP, Serv Informat Med, Paris, France	Seroussi, B (reprint author), DSI AP HP, Serv Informat Med, Paris, France.

In contrary to the common decision tree the vector decision tree can make more than just one suggestion per input sample. It has the functionality of many separate decision trees acting on a same set of training data and answering different questions. Vector decision tree is therefore simple in its form, is easy to use and analyse and can express some relationships between decisions not visible before. To explore and test the possibilities of this concept we developed a software tool - DecRain - for building vector decision trees using the ideas of evolutionary computing. Generated vector decision trees showed good results in comparison to classical decision trees. The concept of vector decision trees can be safely and effectively used in any decision making process.

This paper concentrates on the problem of separating acute appendicitis, which is a special problem of acute abdominal pain from other diseases that cause acute abdominal pain by use of an decision tree approach. Early and accurate diagnosing of acute appendicitis is still a difficult and challenging problem in everyday clinical routine. An important factor in the error rate is poor discrimination between acute appendicitis and other diseases that cause acute abdominal pain. This error rate is still high, despite considerable improvements in history-taking and clinical examination, computer-aided decision-support and special investigation, such as ultrasound We investigated three different large databases with cases of acute abdominal pain to complete this task as successful as possible. The results show that the size of the database does not necessary directly influence the success of the decision tree built on it. Surprisingly we got the best results from the decision trees built on the smallest and the biggest database, where the database with medium size (relative to the other two) was not so successful. Despite that we were able to produce decision tree classifiers that A-ere capable of producing correct decisions on test data sets with accuracy up to 84%, sensitivity to acute appendicitis up to 90%, and specificity up to 80% on the same test.

Predicting the outcome of seriously ill patients is a challenging problem for clinicians. Methods: One alternative to clinical trials is to analyse existing patient data in an attempt to predict the. several outcomes, and to suggest therapies. In this paper we use decision tree techniques to predict the outcome of head injury patients. The work is based on patient data from the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary which contains both background (demographic) data and temporal (Physiological) data. Results. The focus of this paper is the discussion of The anomalous cases in the decision trees with the domain experts (the clinicians). Conclusions: These analyses led to the detection of several situations where both the data analysis and patient data collection should be enhanced, which in turn should lead to improved patient care.

The organic inputs in many tropical farming systems such as crop residues, manures, and natural fallows are currently of low quality and insufficient quantity to maintain soil fertility hence there is need to find alternative or supplementary sources of nutrients. Knowledge gained over the past decade on the role of organic resource quality in influencing soil nutrient availability patterns (Synchrony Principle) and SOM maintenance (SOM Principle) provides a strong scientific basis on which to develop management tools. This scientific information must be linked with farmer knowledge and circumstances to provide a realistic approach to soil fertility and SOM management in the tropics. A decision tree has been developed for testing hypotheses about the resource quality parameters that affect nitrogen release patterns and rates. The decision tree is linked to an Organic Resource Database (ORD) with detailed information on the resource quality of agroforestry trees and leguminous cover crops providing a systematic means of selecting organic resources for soil fertility management. The decision tree has also been translated into a practical field guide for use with farmers in evaluating organic materials. The longer-term effects of organic inputs on SOM might also be addressed through the decision tree and database. It is generally believed that materials good for short-term soil fertility will not build or maintain SOM; if true then it is difficult to imagine practical means of maintaining SOM in the African context where short-term fertility issues will take precedence over longer-term maintenance of SOM.

New rapid flu tests (R-FT) should increase the number of influenza-positive patients who receive NI appropriately. Objective: The objective is to estimate the economic effects of implementing RFT and NI among healthy working adults, considering varying proportions of influenza infections among patients with influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods By the means of a decision tree, the number of flu days averted and societal costs were compared for three strategies: RFT with a conditional NI prescription, systematic NI prescription, and no NI. Results: During flu epidemics, systematic NI prescription provided the best health outcome (0.4 flu days averted) and minimized societal costs (reduced by US$41.20 per person, in 1999 dollars, from the US$280.80 associated with no NI). RFT with conditional NI averted 0.32 flu days and saved US$33.10 per person. When the proportion of influenza-positive patients exceeded 56%, the systematic NI strategy was dominant, regardless of any other variations. For lower proportions, RFT with conditional NI could be preferred depending on RFT characteristics (sensitivity exceeding 94% with 80% specificity or RFT cost lesser than US$6.60). Conclusions: Systematic NI prescription without RFT for unvaccinated healthy working adults consulting within 2 days of the onset of ILI symptoms was a dominant strategy during flu epidemics.

It is not only suitable for images with single objects, but also for images containing multiple and partially occluded objects. In this approach, contours of objects are used to distinguish different classes of objects in images. We decompose all the contours in an image into segments, and compute features from the segments. The C4.5 decision-tree learning algorithm is used to classify each segment in the images. Each image is represented in a k-dimensional space. where k is the number of classes of objects in all the images. Each dimension represents information about one of the classes. The class information about each class can be obtained through either summing up the number of segments that belong to the class, or summing up the probabilities that each segment belongs to the class. Euclidean distance between images in the k-dimensional space is adopted to compute similarities between images based on either class predictions of segments or probabilities of segment classes. Experimental results show that this approach is effective.

J	Perner, P; Zscherpel, U; Jacobsen, C				Perner, P; Zscherpel, U; Jacobsen, C			A comparison between neural networks and decision trees based on data from industrial radiographic testing	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						machine learning; decision tree induction; neural networks; performance analysis; radiographic testing; pipe inspection		In this paper, we are empirically comparing the performance of neural nets and decision trees based on a data set for the detection of defects in welding seams. This data set was created by image feature extraction procedures working on digitized X-ray films. We introduce a framework for distinguishing classification methods. We found that more detailed analysis of the error rate is necessary in order to judge the performance of the learning and classification method. However, the error rate cannot be the only criterion for comparing between the different learning methods. This is a more complex selection process that involves more criteria that we are describing in this paper. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Concomitant GPA therapies considered include one of the following: proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) plus NSAIDs, histamine H-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) plus NSAIDs, misoprostol plus NSAIDs, and a single tablet formulation of diclofenac/misoprostol. Design: The study employs a decision-tree framework to establish probabilities of upper gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events occurring over a 6-month time frame. Celecoxib clinical trial data are used to establish probabilities of upper GI events for celecoxib and NSAIDs, and published literature is used to predict upper GI events for the other concomitant therapies. Upper GI adverse events included in the decision-tree are as follows: GI discomfort, symptomatic ulcer, serious GI complications (with and without death), and anaemia with occult bleeding. Main outcome measures and results: Clinical probabilities indicate celecoxib has significant tolerability and safety advantages compared with nonselective NSAIDs. Celecoxib also reduces the risk of GI adverse events to a similar or superior degree when compared with reductions observed with NSAIDs with concomitant GPAs. Conclusion: Use of celecoxib is expected to significantly reduce the economic costs of GI toxicity and its associated morbidity.

Design: The analysis was retrospective and based on a decision tree. Effectiveness data were obtained from 19 published clinical trials. Direct costs were quantified per patient from the time the decision was made to administer the antibacterial to the end of the first course of treatment or the end of a subsequent course of treatment, if required. The primary end-point was the cost per successfully treated patient. The cost per life saved was also analysed. Various follow-up times were taken into account. Perspective: German National Health Insurance funds. Study population: 1744 patients with intra-abdominal infection. Interventions: Tazobactam/piperacillin (total daily dosage of 13.5 g/day) and imipenem/cilastatin (total daily dosage of 1.5 to 4 g/day). The mean duration of treatment varied from 5.5 to 8.2 days for tazobactam/piperacillin and 5 to 9.4 days for imipenem/cilastatin. Main outcome measure and results: Compared with imipenem/cilastatin, treatment with tazobactam/piperacillin was more effective and the overall treatment costs were lower. In the base-case analysis, the cost-efficacy ratio (cost per successfully treated patient) was 7881 German deutschmarks (DM) for tazobactam/piperacillin and DM11 390 for imipenem/cilastatin. The incremental cost-efficacy ratio (per life saved) varied between -DM72 567 and -DM350 738 for tazobactam/piperacillin. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the results were robust against various assumptions on cost parameters, clinical outcomes and length of treatment. All costs reflect 1998 values; $US1 = DM1.85. Conclusions: This study suggests that compared with imipenem/cilastatin, tazobactam/piperacillin is more cost efficacious in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections and that it offers a cost advantage through fewer relapses and lower daily therapeutic costs.

J	Levin, LA; Bergqvist, D				Levin, LA; Bergqvist, D			Cost effectiveness of desirudin compared with a low molecular weight heparin in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis after total hip replacement surgery	PHARMACOECONOMICS			English	Article							VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM; RECOMBINANT HIRUDIN; ORTHOPEDIC-SURGERY; PROPHYLAXIS; COMPLICATIONS; METAANALYSIS	Objectives: This prospective pharmacoeconomic study analyses and discusses the cost effectiveness (expressed as cost per life-year gained) of desirudin in comparison with a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), enoxaparin, as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in total hip replacement. Methods: The cost effectiveness was analysed on the basis of results from a clinical trial that compared the recombinant hirudin, desirudin, with the LMWH, enoxaparin. The trial results regarding the incidence of DVT are included together with epidemiological data in a decision tree, simulating long term cost effectiveness of patients undergoing elective hip replacement. The model includes Markov processes simulating patients up to the age of 85 years, including the costs of DVT-related long term complications. Results: The average total thrombosis-related cost per patient under prophylactic therapy with enoxaparin is 7022 Swedish kronor (SEK) compared with SEK7497 when using desirudin (1998 values). The total costs with desirudin are 7% higher. Prophylaxis with desirudin in those patients undergoing elective hip replacement surgery adds, on average, 7 days of life per patient when compared with treatment using enoxaparin. This is equivalent to 1.91 additional years of life per 100 patients treated. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of prophylaxis with desirudin in patients undergoing elective hip replacement surgery is SEK24 864 per life-year gained in comparison with enoxaparin. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that prophylactic therapy with desirudin is a cost-effective approach for the prevention of DVT in patients undergoing total hip replacement.

Although we could learn classification rules inductively by means of decision tree generation, we wonder whether it; is consistent with our utilization or not. In this investigation we discuss how to obtain assessment of learning results by verifying belief. Our idea is based on Decision Tree with Hierarchy to class and attributes; to each attribute we assume taxonomy on the domain in addition to class hierarchy. Then, given a firm belief (such as regulation and top executive policy), we check whether the trees.

We introduce a set of word-based statistical features which measure semantic coherence and can be used to enhance any language application where coherent sentences need to be generated or recognized. We train a decision tree using the constructed feature set to automatically classify sentences as coherent or not. We find that our combination of boosted decision trees and coherence features achieves an accuracy of 80% when distinguishing trigram-generated sentences (non-coherent) from those in the Broadcast News dataset (coherent).

ToBI is, a multi-tier representation system based on linguistic knowledge to transcribe events in an utterance. The TTS system which adopts ToBI as an intermediate representation is known to exhibit higher flexibility, modularity and domain/task portability compared with the direct prosody generation TTS systems. However, the cost of corpus preparation is very expensive for practical-level performance because the TbBI labeled corpus has been manually constructed by many prosody experts and normally requires large amount of data for statistical prosody modeling. Contrary to previous ToBI-based systems, this paper proposes a new method which transcribes the K-ToBI labels completely automatically in Korean speech. We developed automatic corpus-based K-TOBI labeling tools and prediction methods based on several lexico-syntactic linguistic features for decision-tree induction. We demonstrated the performance of F0 generation from automatically predicted K-ToBI labels, and confirmed that the performance is reasonably comparable with state-of-the-art direct prosody generation methods and previous TOBI-based methods.

Using DTs, we can extract comprehensible decision rules, and make decisions based only on useful features. The drawback is that, once a DT is designed, there is no free parameter for further development. On the contrary, a neural network (NN) is adaptable or learnable, but the number of free parameters is usually too large to be determined efficiently. To have the advantages of both approaches, it is important to combine them together. Among many ways for combining NNs and DTs, this paper introduces a neural network tree (NNTree). An NNTree is a decision tree with each node being an expert neural network (ENN). The overall tree structure can be designed by following the same procedure as used in designing a conventional DT. Each node (an ENN) can be designed using genetic algorithms (GAs). Thus, the NNTree also provides a way for integrating DT, NN and GA. Through experiments with a digit recognition problem we show that NNTrees are more efficient than traditional DTs in the sense that higher recognition rate can be achieved with less nodes. Further more, if the fitness function for each node is defined properly, better generalization ability can also be achieved.

These methods are: Binary decomposition, in which the problem is decomposed into a set of binary problems and standard genetic programming methods are applied; Static range selection, where the set of real values returned by a genetic program is divided into class boundaries using arbitrarily chosen division points; Dynamic range selection in which a subset of training examples are used to determine where, over the set of reals, class boundaries lie; Class enumeration which constructs programs similar in syntactic structure to a decision tree; and evidence accumulation which allows separate branches of the program to add to the certainty of any given class. Results showed that the dynamic range selection method was well suited to the task of multi-class classification and was capable of producing classifiers more accurate than the other methods tried when comparable training times were allowed. Accuracy of the generated classifiers was comparable to alternative approaches over several datasets.

However, scalability and efficiency are significant concerns in the implementation. We propose an innovative evolutionary computation approach, combining statistical sampling, genetic algorithm, and decision tree, to develop intelligent decision trees that alleviates some of these problems. Computational results show that our approach can obtain significantly better decision tree at lower sampling levels than does standard decision tree algorithm.

In general, classification based on decision tree or neural network and prediction based on regression model are used widely. But they are not usually satisfied with the need of practical problem. Decision tree is usually applied for predicting the class label of data objects and regression model is often applied in the course of linear problem. A prognostic model algorithm based on n_rank transfer probability restricted by minimum confidence is introduced in this paper. In addition, how to implement algorithm is introduced by using the system of choosing course on network.

In our method, first characteristics of EEG, EOG and EMG are compared with characteristic features of alpha waves, delta waves, sleep spindles, K-complexes and REMs. Then, several parameters that are necessary for sleep stage scoring are extracted. We transform these extracted parameters into a few discrete variables using canonical discriminant analysis and the discretization method based on a random walk, and then a committee that consists of several small decision trees is formed from a small number of training instances. Furthermore final sleep stages are decided by a majority decision of the committee. Our method was applied to the digitized PSG chart data, provided by the Japan Society of Sleep Research and we carried out an evaluation experiment. The experiment indicated that our method can quickly execute learning and classification and precisely score sleep stages.

Symbolic and numeric data will define the need for new data analysis techniques and tools for knowledge discovery. Three popular algorithms for data mining which includes Bayesian Network (BN), C4.5 in Decision Tree (DT), and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPN) were evaluated in this paper. Two classes of dataset are used as testing data. The first dataset, Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology, is used to check whether the breast tumor is malignant. The second dataset, Tongue Diagnosis Image, is used to check whether upper GI is disorder. The result shows that BN had a good presentation in diagnosis ability. By using BN showed the accuracy about 94.6% in diagnosing breast tumor and 85.5% in upper GI disorder. The C4.5 learning algorithms in DT was able to explain diagnosis knowledge and rules. Its accuracy was 94.4% to diagnosis breast tumor, but it was just only 63.9% in upper GI disorder. The best performance among these three algorithms is BPN and its accuracy is 96.0% in diagnosing breast tumor and 91.6% in diagnosing upper GI disorder, respectively.

The advent of Precision Farming generates databases which, because of their size and complexity, are not efficiently analyzed by traditional methods. The present work aims to test if Data Mining routines are capable to determine the behavior of the yield of a crop as a function of physical-chemical soil properties, in order to allow correction of low yield. Databases were used as object of work, where yield is the meta-attribute and the physical-chemical soil properties are the predictive attributes, obtained through data acquisition on field, in areas of 400 m2. The meta-attribute was obtained by way of a yield map generated by precision agriculture equipment. The data set, with 2388 records were mined using the Decision Tree technique and all values were discerned into two levels. As result, rules were generated-finite sets of pairs attribute-value-describing models relating yield and physical-chemical soil properties. The confidence of rules was evaluated automatically, making possible the selection of the most qualified ones. By the analysis of the rules by human experts, it was determined that is possible to use the models to determine the behavior of the yield of a crop as a function of physical-chemical soil properties. The developed tool is still without processing acceleration techniques and without techniques of refinement of quality of discovery knowledge, what recalls expectations that the results can be quite improved.

While recommendations take the weed spectrum, time of year, soil clay content and organic matter into consideration, certain herbicides are prone to cause phytotoxic effects on some cane varieties, With an increase in available information and a high demand for utilising this information in the industry, the need has emerged to combine results into a single manageable reference system and to streamline information transfer to assist growers with herbicide decisions. The aim of this work was to develop an information management system that could be maintained by weed specialists and provide technology transfer for decision support. A comparison between decision tree systems and ranking systems is made. Computer tools used in this exercise range from simple spreadsheets, a relational database, custom written front-end software and HTML pages. The system standardises record keeping for experimental results, related insights and observations. This improves sustainability and uniformity in weed research programmes. The system considers more factors than included in a previously developed manual field guide and therefore provides more comprehensive advice under complex scenarios. The user-friendly interface streamlines the interaction with growers and enables better herbicide management. The system is an improvement over the previous annual herbicide guide booklet and is anticipated to expand in the future.

Recent research has shown that classification performance can be significantly improved by voting predictions of multiple, independently produced decision trees. This paper describes an algorithm, OB1, that produces a weighted sum over many possible models. Model weights are determined by the prior probability of the model, as well as the performance of the model during training. We describe an implementation of OB1 that includes all possible decision trees as well as naive Bayesian models within a single option tree. Constructing all possible decision trees is very expensive? growing exponentially in the number of attributes. However it is possible to use the internal structure of the option tree to avoid recomputing values. In addition, the current implementation allows the option tree to be depth bounded. OB1 is compared with a number of other decision tree and instance based learning algorithms using a selection of data sets from the UCI repository and a maximum option tree depth of three attributes. Both information gain and percentage correct are used for the comparison. For the information gain measure OB1 performs significantly better than the other algorithms. When using percentage correct OB1 is significantly better than all the algorithms except naive Bayes and boosted C5.0(1), which perform slightly worse than OB1.

The advantage is that in problem-solving applications of the induced decision tree, the relevance of a selected attribute can be explained in strategic terms. However, as we show in this paper, Strategist's policy of always giving priority to confirming the likeliest outcome class in the current subset of the data set can sometimes lead to the selection of attributes of limited discriminating power. We present a new version of Strategist in which a tactical approach to the selection of a target outcome class reduces its susceptibility to this problem. A new data set for the classification of Roman numbers as correct or incorrect provides a case study of strategic induction in which we examine the algorithm's behaviour with and without this refinement. The new algorithm tends to produce smaller decision trees than its predecessor and is shown to be comparable in accuracy to ID3 on certain data sets.

The key step in the process of inferring decision trees is finding the right criteria for splitting the training set into smaller and smaller subsets so that, ideally, all elements of a subset finally belong to one class. These split criteria can be defined in different ways (e.g. minimizing impurity of a subset, or minimizing entropy in a subset), and therefore they emphasize different properties of the inferred tree, such as size or classification accuracy. In this paper we analyze if the split functions introduced in a statistical and machine learning context are also well suited for a KDD context. We selected two well known split functions, namely Gini Index (CART) and Information Gain (C4.5) and introduced our own family of split functions and tested them on 9,000 data sets of different sizes (from 200 to 20, 000 tuples). The tests have shown that the two popular functions are very sensitive to the variation of the training set sizes and therefore the quality of the inferred trees is highly dependent on the training set size. At the same time however, we were able to show that the simplest members of the introduced family of split functions behave in a very predictable way and, furthermore, the created trees were superior to the trees inferred using the Gini Index or the Information Gain based on our evaluation criteria.

J	Martin, D; Chapman, M				Martin, D; Chapman, M			Prediction of the allergenicity of a molecule	REVUE FRANCAISE D ALLERGOLOGIE ET D IMMUNOLOGIE CLINIQUE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IXth Parisian Meeting of Allergy	JAN 10-12, 2001	PARIS, FRANCE				FOODS	This presentation addresses the question as to whether it is possible to predict whether proteins will become allergens. The molecular properties of inhaled allergens and food allergens are now well known and detailed analysis of their structures have not revealed common structural features or specific motifs that are associated with induction of IgE responses. Rather, allergen dose, route of exposure and aerodynamic properties appear to be key properties that promote IgE responses in genetically predisposed individuals. These include repeated exposure to low doses of allergen (1-10 mug/year) without adjuvant on airborne particles of 10-40 CI diameter. Food allergens tend to be heat stable and pH resistant proteins that account for a high percentage of the total protein in foods such a milk, egg, peanut, fish and soybeans. Predictions of allergenicity have particular relevance to the food biotechnology industry, where proteins that would not normally be part of the food supply are being introduced in genetically modified foods. Decision tree based approaches have been developed to assess whether genetically modified foods have the potential to become allergenic. Using structural information and exposure assessments, it is possible to make rational predictions about the potential allergenicity of protein molecules.

For this reason, we must try to determine the conditions required to evaluate the quality of interventional neuroradiology, its operators, its practice, its advances, its teaching, and to maintain this quality. It is probably vital to the freedom of our future therapeutic decisions that we contribute effectively to this discussion before the standard is forced upon us by an exclusively economical or administrative logic. On the other hand, any advance can only be turned into progress if it is diffused and applied. There is no doubt that several levels of quality are acceptable, thus the best approach will be to took for and identify the minimum standard for quality or the limits of non-quality, We shall refrain from suggesting that the level of excellence at a given moment should be imposed upon all operators and constitute the standard level of practice. Practice is based on knowledge and competence. The most skilled surgical act cannot guarantee safe medical treatment if it is not supported by sufficient knowledge about the diseases and their symptoms. Mastership of the decision process requires a thorough vision of the therapeutic decision tree involved. Quality is a composition of global view and detailed analysis to allow a fuzzy gestion of the performance. Regardless of the plan chosen, openmindedness should be kept to allow adaptation, correction or interruption of. a given therapeutic process in view of unpredicted pieces of information. Such input is a predictable possibility that should be explained to the patient prior to starting the procedure. Dealing with human beings, the attitude along with the technical management will be of paramount importance in the overall quality assessment.

Numerous decision trees were constructed to examine relationships between oculomotor test parameters and lesion sites in a data set containing cases with operated cerebello-pontifie angle tumour, operated hemangioblastoma, infarction of cerebello-brainstem and Meniere's disease, and control subjects. The aim was to find useful parameter combinations with discriminatory power. Decision trees constructed using both pursuit eye movements and saccadic eye movements yielded the best classification results. This is reasonable: oculomotor test results vary according to the site of the lesion and so the performance ability of subjects has to be taken into account in the classification. The decision tree program was able to generate classification models from the oculomotor data set. Generated decision trees were intelligible and can be utilized in physicians' research work.

The sharing of information measured by local sensors via communication links across the battlegroup should allow for optimal or near optimal decisions. A fuzzy logic expert system has been developed that automatically allocates electronic attack (EA) resources in real-time. Genetic algorithm based optimization is conducted to determine the form of the membership functions for the fuzzy root concepts. The resource manager is made up of four trees, the isolated platform tree, the multi-platform tree, the fuzzy parameter selection tree and the fuzzy strategy tree. The isolated platform tree provides a fuzzy decision tree that allows an individual platform to respond to a threat. The multi-platform tree allows a group of platforms to respond to a threat in a collaborative fashion. The fizzy parameter selection tree is designed to make optimal selections of root concept parameters. The strategy tree is a fuzzy tree that an agent uses to try to predict the behavior of an enemy. Finally, an example is provided that shows how the resource manager uses its subtrees to deliver high quality responses for many demanding scenarios.

We added two new,features to the feature vector from one previously published method [1]. We assumed different independence relationship in two zone sets. We used an optimized binary, decision tree to estimate the maximum zone content class probability in one set while used Viterbi algorithm to find the optimal solution for a zone sequence in the other set. The training, pruning and testing data set,for the algorithm include 1,600 images drawn from the UWCDROM III document image database. The classifier is able to classify each given scientific and technical document zone into one of the nine classes, 2 text classes (of font size 4 - 18pt and font size 19 - 32 pt), math, table, halftone, map/drawing, ruling, logo, and others. Compared with our previous work [2], it raised the accuracy rate to 98.52% from 97.53% and reduced the mean false alarm rate to 0.53% front 1.26%.

In this approach, contours of objects are used to distinguish different classes of objects in images. We decompose all the contours in an image into segments and compute features from the segments. The C4.5 decision-tree learning algorithm is used to classify each segment in the images. Each image is represented in a k-dimensional space, where X is the number of classes of objects in all the images. Each dimension represents information about one of tire classes. Euclidean distance between images in the k-dimensional sl,ace is adopted to compute similarities between images based on probabilities of segment classes. Experimental results show that this approach is effective.

The key issue in the router performance is the IP routing lookup mechanism based on the longest prefix matching scheme. Earlier works on fast IPv4 routing table lookup are based on Content Addressable Memory (CAM), memory lookups and the CPU caching. These schemes depend on the memory access technology which limits their performance. Besides, these address lookup schemes designed for the IPv4 32-bit address mostly are not extensible to adapt to the forthcoming IPv6 where the IP address is 128 bits long. The paper presents a Binary Decision Diagrams based optimized combinational logic for an efficient implementation of fast address lookup scheme in reconfigurable hardware. The experimental results show that, for the 32-bit IP address large MAE-east routing table, the number of redundant nodes is more than 99.99% in constructing the binary decision tree. With the binary encoding of the output part, an additional 36% reduction is obtained in the number of effective nodes. Besides the performance of the scheme, routing table update and the scalability to IPv6 issues are discussed.

Optimal decision strategies for decision trees are commonly determined by a backward induction analysis that demands adherence to three fundamental consistency principles: dynamic, consequential, and strategic. Previous research (Busemeyer et al. 2000, J. Exp. Psychol. Gen. 129, 530) found that decision-makers tend to exhibit violations of dynamic and strategic consistency at rates significantly higher than choice inconsistency across various levels of potential reward. The current research extends these findings under new conditions; specifically, it explores the extent to which these principles are violated as a function of the planning horizon length of the decision tree. Results from two experiments suggest that dynamic inconsistency increases as tree length increases; these results are explained within a dynamic approach-avoidance framework.

We examine whether people will shift from the chosen transport mode to other alternatives if costs of the chosen mode would be increased. A decision tree was designed using Golden section method to represent cost increases. We interviewed 335 travelers who would travel to Guangzhou form Hong Kong by train in the end of September 2000. They were asked to state whether they would continue to take train if costs by train would be increased by certain amounts. The data collected is considered as failure time data that include interval censoring and right censoring. Survival analysis is applied to model the data. First, we use nonparametric method for finding out the tendency of behavior change in response to train cost increases. Then, we explore what other transport modes will be chosen if they decide not to take train anymore. Finally, we construct a parametric model to establish the relationship between the train cost increasing and explanatory variables including income, education and occupation, etc. The modeling results reveal that the major factors that influence peoples behavioral responses to cost changes are whether return to Hong Kong on the same day and traveling frequency, etc.	[Wang, Donggen] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Geog, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China		dgwang@hkbu.edu.hk					GOODWIN PB, 1990, DEV DYNAMIC ACTIVITY; HENSHER DA, 1994, TRANSPORT REV, V14, P63, DOI 10.1080/01441649408716866; KITAMURA R, 1990, TRANSPORT RES A-POL, V24, P401, DOI 10.1016/0191-2607(90)90032-2; KITAMURA R, 2000, HDB TRANSPORT MODELL, P113	4	0	0	HONG KONG UNIVERSITY SCIENCE &TECHNOLOGY	KOWLOON	CLEAR WATER BAY, KOWLOON, HONG KONG		978-962-442-198-9				2001							398	407				10	Transportation	Transportation	BIP62	WOS:000261697000045

The goal of such an interview is to determine sets of items that match implicit requirements. Decision trees structure the interview process by defining which question follows a given answer. One problem related to decision trees is that changes in the selling strategy or product mix require complex tree restructuring efforts. In this paper we present a framework that represents the selling strategy as a set of parameters, reflecting the preferences of sellers and buyers. This representation of the strategy can be used to generate optimized decision trees in an iterative process, which exploits information about historical buyer behavior. Furthermore, the framework also supports advanced optimization strategies such as dynamic parameter adaptation and exit risk minimization.

The system separates the images in two semantic classes: photographs and graphics. Photographs are images that show natural scenes, such as people, faces, flowers, animals, landscapes, and cities. Graphics are logos, drawings, icons, maps, and backgrounds, frequently generated by computer. To do this classification we used metrics based on difference that exist between the two images types. These metrics return a numerical value that drive to one of the two classes. To realize the classification we used a supervised technique based on the knowledge that generates rules. This technique is the ID3 method that induces a decision tree and allows to classify the images.

The approach is based on the induction of more than one C4.5-type decision tree from the same training sample where each decision tree represents a different view of the same domain resulting in a network of decision tree models. The utilization of multiple decision trees has been shown to lead to an improved performance by combining multiple perspectives of the same domain thus increasing the information content whereas, in comparison, a single decision tree can only represent one restricted view of the domain. One predominant weakness in creating a single tree is the generation of sharp decision boundaries at every node within the tree, which results in small changes in attribute values giving radically different classifications. This problem becomes more apparent with the generation of multiple trees. This paper presents a novel approach of overcoming this weakness through the use of Fuzzy Decision Forests. The approach is based upon the induction of multiple fuzzy decision trees from one training sample, where each tree will represent a different view of the data domain. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to select a series of high performance membership functions, which are then applied to branches within all decision trees in the forest. The GA will in addition optimise a pre-selected fuzzy inference technique, which will assign a degree of strength to the conjunction and disjunction of membership grades within the tree. Considerable improvements in classification accuracy over original single C4.5 (crisp) trees have been obtained using two reil-world data sets.

The main principle of this approach is to automatically generates a hierarchical organization of the knowledge coupled with local choice of the best feature subspace. To improve the representation, a double level of modeling is used. Firstly a pre-classification level searches fuzzy decision regions to operate a natural discrimination between classes. The second level refines the previous one, doing an intrinsic fuzzy modeling of the classes represented in the fuzzy regions. Moreover, the best feature subspace is determined locally by a genetic algorithm for each partitioning. Finally, to have an understandable and "transparent" representation, the fuzzy decision tree is formalized as a fuzzy inference system which is easily modifiable and can be optimized a posteriori. First experimental results conducted on classical benchmarks and on a handwritten digits database show the capacity of the hybrid learning approach to provide reliable and compact classification system.

We used the Decision Tree-based Successive State Splitting (DT-SSS) algorithm, which splits the state of contexts based on phonetic knowledge. The SSS algorithm proposed by Sagayama is a powerful technique, which designed topologies of tied-state HMMs automatically, but it doesn't generate unknown contexts adequately. In addition it has some problem in the contextual splits procedure. In this paper, the speaker independent Korean isolated word and sentence recognition experiments are carried out. In word recognition experiments, this method shows an average of 6.3% higher word recognition accuracy than the conventional HMMs. And in sentence recognition experiments, it shows an average of 90.9% recognition accuracy.

This method makes it possible to handle mixture Gaussian HMMs in decision tree based state tying algorithm, and provides higher recognition performance compared to the conventional HMM training procedure using decision tree based state tying on single Gaussian HMMs. This method also reduces the steps of HMM training procedure because the mixture incrementing process is not necessary. We applied this method to training of telephone speech triphones, and evaluated its effect on Japanese phonetically balanced sentence tasks. Our method achieved a 1 to 2 point improvement in phoneme accuracy and a 67% reduction in training time.

It is concerned with the prediction of the values of some attribute in a database based on other attributes. To tackle this problem, most of the existing data mining algorithms adopt either a decision tree based approach or an approach that requires users to provide some user-specified thresholds to guide the search for interesting rules. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the use of an objective interestingness measure to distinguish interesting rules front uninteresting ones. Using linguistic terms to represent the revealed regularities and exceptions, this approach is especially useful when the discovered rules are presented to human experts for examination because of the affinity with the human knowledge representation. The use of fuzzy technique allows the prediction of attribute values to be associated with degree of membership. Our approach is, therefore, able to deal with the cases that an object can belong to more than one class. For example, a person can suffer front cold and fever to certain extent at the same time. Furthermore, our approach is more resilient to noise and missing data values because of the use of fuzzy technique. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we tested it using several real-life databases. The experimental results show that it can be very effective at data mining tasks. In fact, when compared to popular data mining algorithms, our approach can be better able to uncover useful rules hidden in databases.

Previous approaches to this problem typically either (1) discretize the continuous predictor values prior to learning or (2) apply a dynamic method that considers all possible split points for each potential split. In this paper we describe a number of alternative approaches that generate a small number of candidate split points dynamically with little overhead. We argue that these approaches are preferable to pre-discretization, and provide experimental evidence that they yield probabilistic decision trees with the same prediction accuracy as the traditional dynamic approach. Furthermore, because the time to grow a decision tree is proportional to the number of split points evaluated, our approach is significantly faster than the traditional dynamic approach.

In the context of classification problems, algorithms that generate multivariate trees are able to explore multiple representation languages by using decision tests based on a combination of attributes. The same applies to model trees algorithms, in regression domains, but using linear models at leaf nodes. In this paper we study where to use combinations of attributes in decision tree learning, We present an algorithm for multivariate tree learning that combines a univariate decision tree with a discriminant function by means of constructive induction. This algorithm is able to use decision nodes with multivariate tests, and leaf nodes that predict a class using a discriminant function. Multivariate decision nodes are built when growing the tree, while junctional leaves are built when pruning the tree. Functional trees can be seen as a generalization of multivariate trees. Our algorithm was compared against to its components and two simplified versions using 30 benchmark datasets. The experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm has clear advantages with respect to the generalization ability and model sizes at statistically significant confidence levels.

Unlike previous work this paper investigates the discrimination and robustness of the sensor's classifications when presented with common office objects with complex geometries. The feature extraction process uses a novel perturbed L-2 method which allows a physical interpretation of the features. The robustness of the classifications indicate that. given a suitably enlarged set of training objects, the approach would be suitable for use within office environments.

It is designed to work inside the control center with phasor measurement units (PMUs) providing the synchronized real-time measurements. Classification type decision tree (DT) models are utilized to predict voltage security status. Fast and direct measurement from PMUs combined with decision trees quickly assesses voltage security, leaving more time for corrective or preventive actions. Two attributes are considered in the decision tree models: generator vars and angular difference. Both are observed to be good indicators of voltage security status. The paper focuses on the angle difference attributes because bus voltage angle is directly measured by the PMUs. A stressed power system is characterized by widening angular separation of bus voltage angles as it moves towards voltage insecurity. DTs exploit the complex non-linear relationship between voltage security status and generator vars/angular difference in terms hierarchical rules extracted from a large number of off-line loadflow simulations. Several DT models were analyzed using the existing PMUs, and in the future when additional PMUs are incrementally installed. A PMU placement technique is discussed to determine the critical locations of new PMUs. The voltage security monitoring system was tested on a 360-bus subsystem inside AEP.

Establishing the spatio-temporal correspondence is a problem with combinatorial complexity in the number of objects and views. In addition vision based tracking suffers from the ambiguities introduced by occlusion, clutter and irregular 3D motion. In this paper we present a discrete relaxation algorithm for reducing the intrinsic combinatorial complexity by, pruning the decision tree based on unreliable prior information from independent 2D-tracking for each view. The algorithm improves the reliability of spatio-temporal correspondence by simultaneous optimisation over multiple views in the case where 2D-tracking in one or more views is ambiguous. Application to the 3D reconstruction of human movement, based on tracking of skin-coloured regions in three views, demonstrates considerable improvement in reliability and performance. Results demonstrate that the optimisation over multiple views gives correct 3D reconstruction and object labeling in the presence of incorrect 2D-tracking whilst maintaining real-time performance.

B	Kim, HY			IEEE; IEEE	Kim, HY			Fast and accurate binary halftone image resolution increasing by decision-tree learning	2001 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON IMAGE PROCESSING, VOL II, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2001)	OCT 07-10, 2001	THESSALONIKI, GREECE	IEEE Signal Processing Soc, IEEE				Digital halftone is the technique used to convert gray-scale images into binary ones, simulating gray shades by scattering appropriately black and white pixels. Sometimes, there arises the necessity of increasing the resolution of a halftone image. Some recent,works have proposed a number of learning-based techniques to zoom binary images. However, they cannot consider a large neighborhood to decide the colors of the resolution-increased pixels, because their running time skyrockets with the growth of the window and the sample images sizes. The use of large window and samples are required to accurately zoom halflone images. This paper presents a new technique to zoom quickly and precisely images generated by any locally-decided halflone algorithm. It is based on the decision-tree learning and it is very fast. even using it large window or large samples. The zoomed images obtained by this technique are incredibly sharp and accurate.

Converting the knowledge represented explicitly in rewrite rules into a more efficient format is difficult. We take an indirect route, learning an efficient decision tree representation from data and tapping information contained in existing rewrite rules, which increases performance compared to learning exclusively from a pronunciation lexicon.

NE recognition plays an essential role in information extraction systems and question answering systems. It is well known that hand-crafted systems with a large set of heuristic rules are difficult to maintain, and corpus-based statistical approaches are expected to be more robust and require less human intervention. Several statistical approaches have been reported in the literature. In a recent Japanese NE workshop, a maximum entropy (ME) system outperformed decision tree systems and most hand-crafted systems. Here, we propose an alternative method based on a simple rule generator and decision tree learning. Our experiments show that its performance is comparable to the ME approach. We also found that it can be trained more efficiently with a large set of training data and that it improves readability.

The association rule discovery method is also analysed. The paper describes a data mining application in large databases of engineering student records. The authors' goal has been to discover knowledge that is useful in improving the quality of engineering graduates. The knowledge discovered can be used for assisting the development of new curricula and the improvement of existing curricula, and provides an important and valuable option against the traditional administration approach based on experience and assumption. The methods shown in this paper can also assist students in selecting the appropriate major according to their profile through the utilisation of a decision tree. In this paper, the authors present the steps made to reach these goals and discuss the problems encountered to extract new and useful knowledge during the discovery process.

As the voltage of devices falls, signal integrity issues assume an ever-greater role in the design decision tree. Furthermore, mechanical and thermal challenges often further complicate the designs, for they are moving to finer array sizes and yet increasing wattage. Finally, the semiconductors do not exist as entities unto themselves. They place design and fabrication constraints on the next level of packaging; typically a printed circuit board, already overcrowded and under extreme price pressure. This paper presents an innovative socketable package design that addresses the need for highly integrated packages that offer superior electrical performance at competitive cost. In particular, it is argued that, through careful design of the power and signal distribution through the package, high-density packaging with GHz bandwidth electrical performance is within reach.

In many instances, the success of the application is highly dependent on the ability to quantify the prediction uncertainty and the availability of a good training set. Bayesian neural networks provide a promising tool in this area. In this paper, we propose to incorporate an improved data selection strategy for Bayesian networks, The improved strategy includes the use of decision tree for the removal of less relevant input variables and the use of Bayesian error bar for pattern selection. The new training set is used to train the Bayesian networks. The case study from an onshore oilfield data set from west China shows that the proposed system gives significant improvement in a blind test and produces more reliable and accurate predictions.

Many researches have documented the effects of mobile phase on enantioselectivity for a given family of samples but today no comprehensive study aimed at identifying the-associations between the structural features present on solute and appropriate mobile phase conditions has yet been proposed. In this review of mobile phases used on Chiralcel OD, we try to go far beyond a simple enumeration of eluting conditions and an effort is made to explore the utility of data mining tools for assessing the knowledge contained in CHIRBASE database. We have extracted from CHIRBASE the chemical features of 2363 chiral compounds separated on Chiralcel OD and their corresponding mobile phases. This data set was submitted to data mining programs for molecular pattern recognition and mobile phase predictions for new cases. Some substructural characteristics of solutes were related to the efficient use of some specific mobile phases. For example, the application of CH3CN/salt buffer at pH 6-7 was found convenient for reversed-phase separation of compounds bearing a tertiary amine functional group. Futhermore, a cluster analysis allowed the arrangement of the mobile phases according to similarity found in molecular patterns of solutes. A decision tree, which may lead to a more rational choice of the mobile phase under reversed-phase conditions, is also proposed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.All rights reserved.

Case-by-case models designed for individual patients facing complex trade-offs in their medical care often help individual clinical decision making, but are expensive and time consuming. On the other hand, generic models addressing broad clinical questions that can be adapted from one patient to another, can often make valid projections about specific outcomes, such as life expectancy. quality-adjusted life expectancy, and cost-effectiveness issues, and represent a useful approach to clinical decision making.

Customers have become one of the most important considerations to new companies being built. Accordingly, customer retention is a very important topic. In this paper, we present a mixed-initiative synthesized learning approach for better understanding of customers and the provision of clues for improving customer relationships based on different sources of web customer data. The approach is a combination of hierarchical automatic labeling SOM, decision tree, cross-class analysis, and human tacit experience. The objective of this approach is to hierarchically segment data sources into clusters, automatically label the features of the clusters, discover the characteristics of normal, defected and possibly defected clusters of customers, and provide clues for gaining customer retention.

J	Lobo, OO; Numano, M				Lobo, OO; Numano, M			Suitable domains for using ordered attribute trees to impute missing values	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						machine learning; incomplete data; decision trees; mutual information analysis; ordered attribute trees method	ASSOCIATION RULES	Using decision trees to fill the missing values in data has been shown experimentally to be useful in some domains. However, this is not the general case. In other domains, using decision trees for imputing missing attribute values does not outperform other methods. Trying to identify the reasons behind the success or failure of the various methods for filling missing values on different domains can be useful for deciding the technique to be used when learning concepts from a new domain with missing values. This paper presents a technique by which to approach to previous goal and presents the results of applying the technique on predicting the success or failure of a method that uses decision trees to fill the missing values in an ordered manner. Results are encouraging because the obtained decision tree is simple and it can even provide hints for further improvement on the use of decision trees to impute missing attribute values.

We extend the approach of classical induction of a classifier by building a decision tree, and its generalization for regression problems by CART, to build a fuzzy model. It is defined by a collection of fuzzy regions fixed in the input domain of the function. To obtain fuzzy regions of the input domain, we have defined a new method (FCMD) to get a fuzzy partition of a fuzzy set, which generalizes the classical Bezdeck's method FCM.

J	Chapman, WW; Fizman, M; Chapman, BE; Huag, PJ				Chapman, WW; Fizman, M; Chapman, BE; Huag, PJ			A comparison of classification algorithms to automatically identify chest X-ray reports that support pneumonia	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Editorial Material							NATURAL-LANGUAGE; CLINICAL-DATA; SYSTEM	We compared the performance of expert-crafted rules, a Bayesian network, and a decision tree at automatically identifying chest X-ray reports that support acute bacterial pneumonia. We randomly selected 292 chest X-ray reports, 75 (25%) of which were from patients with a hospital discharge diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia. The reports were encoded by our natural language processor and then manually corrected for mistakes. The encoded observations were analyzed by three expert systems to determine whether the reports supported pneumonia. The reference standard for radiologic support of pneumonia was the majority vote of three physicians. We compared (a) the performance of thr expert systems against each other and ib) the performance of the expert systems against that of four physicians who were not part of the gold standard. Output from the expert systems and the physicians a as transformed so that comparisons could be made with both binary and probabilistic output. Metrics of comparison For binary output were sensitivity (sens), precision (prec). and specificity (spec). The metric of comparison for probabilistic output was the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. We used McNemar's test to determine statistical significance for binary output and univariate z-tests for probabilistic output. Measures of performance of the expert systems for binary (probabilistic) output were as follows: Rules-sens. 0.92; prec, 0.80; spec, 0.86 (A(z), 0.960); Bayesian network-sens, 0.90; prec, 0.72; spec, 0.78 (A(z), 0.945); decision tree-sens, 0.86; prec. 0.85; spec, 0.91 (A(z), 0.940). Comparisons of the expert systems against each other using binary output showed a significant difference between the rules and the Bayesian network and between the decision tree and the Bayesian network. Comparisons of expert systems using probabilistic output showed no significant differences. Comparisons of binary output against physicians showed differences between the Bayesian network and two physicians. Comparisons of probabilistic output against physicians showed a difference between the decision tree and one physician. The expert systems performed similarly for the probabilistic output but differed in measures of sensitivity, precision, and specificity produced by the binary output. All three expert systems performed similarly to physicians. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

J	Shutler, PME				Shutler, PME			An improved branching rule for the symmetric travelling salesman problem	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						travelling salesman; branch-and-bound; l-tree relaxation	TREES	This paper presents an improvement to an existing branch and bound algorithm for solving the symmetric travelling salesman problem. The lower bound used is the standard one obtained from the sequence of minimal spanning 1-trees computed via subgradient optimization, but the branching rule is new. Rather than selecting for inclusion or exclusion those edges which violate the tour constraints in the final I-tree of the sequence, we consider edges which are present in roughly half of the final few 1-trees. This results in a decision tree whose number of nodes grows by powers of two rather than three, hence significantly reducing the total number of decision nodes required to solve the problem.

To alleviate the problem of obtaining enough training data, simulated training data were generated from single-date images. A one-pass classification with four machine learning algorithms, namely, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), Decision Tree Classifiers (DTC), and the Maximum-Likelihood Classifier (MLC), were tested. Recognition rates, ease of use, and degree of automation of the four algorithms were assessed. The results showed that the incorporation of cross-combined simulated training data enhanced the detection of nature of change. Compared to conventional post-classification comparison methods, LVQ and ore did better in terms of overall accuracy In terms of average accuracy of the change classes, LVQ was the best performer. DTC was the easiest to use and the most robust in training. MLP procedures were the most difficult to replicate.

We briefly outline some of the techniques, which have been discussed in the literature, and we consider two, which have been reported as being useful in practice. The first of these, the decision tree approach, has been around for a long time whereas the second, Option Pricing Theory, has only become of interest in the last decade. We report the outcomes of an examination of alternative techniques for assessing projects in the portfolio of the UK chemicals division of a diversified multinational company. Under the conditions of limited data availability commonly found in companies, Option Pricing Theory was found to be a useful aid in assessment of projects in the division's portfolio when combined with a Monte Carlo method and decision trees. Not surprisingly, we conclude that more attention needs to be paid to documentation of projects and that data availability is a significant issue which needs to be addressed.

The criteria of formation can be expressed by a group of inequalities with two kinds of atomic parameters Z(i)(number of valence electrons in the atom of constituent element) and R-i/R-j (ratio of the atomic radius of constituent element i and j) as independent variables. The data of 2238 known ternary alloy systems were used to extract the empirical rules governing the formation of ternary intermetallic compounds, and the facts of ternary compound formation of other 1334 alloy systems were used as samples to test the reliability of the empirical criteria found. The rate of correctness of prediction was found to be nearly 95 %. An expert system for ternary intermetallic compound formation was built and some prediction results of the expert system were confirmed.

J	Bazell, D; Aha, DW				Bazell, D; Aha, DW			Ensembles of classifiers for morphological galaxy classification	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies : fundamental parameters; methods : data analysis; methods : numerical	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS; DECISION TREES	We compare the use of three algorithms for performing automated morphological galaxy classification using a sample of 800 galaxies. Classifiers are created using a single training set as well as bootstrap replicates of the training set, producing an ensemble of classifiers. We use a Naive Bayes classifier, a neural network trained with backpropagation, and a decision-tree induction algorithm with pruning. Previous work in the field has emphasized backpropagation networks and decision trees. The Naive Bayes classifier is easy to understand and implement and often works remarkably well on real-world data. For each of these algorithms, we examine the classification accuracy of individual classifiers using 10-fold cross validation and of ensembles of classifiers trained using 25 bootstrap data sets and tested on the same cross-validation test sets. Our results show that (1) the neural network produced the best individual classifiers (lowest classification error) for the majority of cases, (2) the ensemble approach significantly reduced the classification error for the neural network and the decision-tree classifiers but not for the Naive Bayes classifier, (3) the ensemble approach worked better for decision trees (typical error reduction of 12%-23%) than for the neural network (typical error reduction of 7%-12%), and (4) the relative improvement when using ensembles decreases as the number of output classes increases. While more extensive comparisons are needed (e.g., a variety of data and classifiers), our work is the first demonstration that the ensemble approach can significantly increase the performance of certain automated classification methods when applied to the domain of morphological galaxy classification.

Summary Background Data There is no consensus on a management algorithm for CRC. However, when recurrence is suspected, CT is generally used for further evaluation and staging of disease. Methods The authors used decision trees based on theoretical models to assess the cost-effectiveness of a CT + FDG PET strategy for the diagnosis and management of recurrent CRC compared with a CT-alone strategy. These theoretical models focus on patients with hepatic recurrence who are potentially curable through surgical hepatic resection. The population entering the decision trees consisted of patients with CRC who had undergone surgical resection of their primary CRG and who were suspected of having recurrence based on elevated revels of carcinoembryonic antigen. Results The CT + FDG PET strategy was found to be cost-effective for managing patients with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels who were candidates for hepatic resection. The CT + FDG PET strategy was higher in mean cost by $429 per patient but resulted in an increase in the mean life expectancy of 9.527 days per patient. Conclusions These results show, through rigorous decision tree analysis, the potential cost-effectiveness of FDG. PET in the management of recurrent CRC. The decision trees can be used to model various features of the management of recurrent CRC, including the cost-effectiveness of other newly emerging technologies.

This paper studies personalized recommendation techniques that suggest products or services to the customers of Internet storefronts based on their demographics or past purchasing behavior. The underlining theories of recommendation techniques are statistics, data mining, artificial intelligence, and rule-based matching. In the rule-based approach to personalized recommendation, marketing rules For personalization are usually obtained from marketing experts and used to perform inferencing based on customer data. However, it is difficult to extract marketing rules from marketing experts, and to validate and maintain the constructed knowledge base. This paper proposes a marketing rule-extraction technique For personalized recommendation on Internet storefronts using machine learning techniques, and especially decision-tree induction techniques. Using tree induction techniques, data-mining tools can generate marketing rules that match customer demographics to product categories. The extracted rules provide personalized advertisement selection when a customer visits an Internet store. An experiment is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with preference scoring and random selection.

Four strategies fur the initial management of achalasia were compared using the following decision model: (1) laparoscopic Heller myotomy and partial fundoplication; (2) pneumatic dilatation; (3) botulinum toxin injection; and (4) thoracoscopic Heller myotomy. Probabilities of clinical events and utilities of health states were estimated using review of the medical literature and patient interviews. A recursive decision tree (Markov model) was used to simulate all the important outcomes of each initial treatment option, allowing for complications, relapses over time, and transitions between strategies when appropriate. After 10 years, laparoscopic Heller myotomy with partial fundoplication was associated with the longest quality-adjusted survival (quality-adjusted life years [QALY] = 7.41). The difference between this strategy and either pneumatic dilatation or botulinum toxin injection was small. Thoracoscopic Heller myotomy was associated with the poorest quality-adjusted survival (QALY = 7.15). Pneumatic dilatation was the favored strategy when the effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery at relieving dysphagia was less than 89.7%, the operative mortality risk was greater than 0.7%, or the probability of reflux after pneumatic dilatation was less than 19%. In a decision model, laparoscopic Heller myotomy with partial fundoplication is at least as effective as endoscopic approaches for managing achalasia symptoms. However, the differences are small enough that patient preferences and local expertise should be taken into consideration when tailoring a treatment plan for an individual patient.

We propose an algorithm to remove irrelevant conditions of rules in the process of converting the decision tree to rules according to the semantics of the decision tree. Since our algorithm depends only on the semantics of the decision tree, our algorithm can be integrated into any existing tree-construction algorithm with negligible increase in computational cost concerning that of constructing the decision tree. Moreover, as a side effect, the resultant rules are less likely to suffer from missing branches problem.

J	Allwein, EL; Schapire, RE; Singer, Y				Allwein, EL; Schapire, RE; Singer, Y			Reducing multiclass to binary: A unifying approach for margin classifiers	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION; NETWORKS	We present a unifying framework for studying the solution of multiclass categorization problems by reducing them to multiple binary problems that are then solved using a margin-based binary learning algorithm. The proposed framework unifies some of the most popular approaches in which each class is compared against all others, or in which all pairs of classes are compared to each other, or in which output codes with error-correcting properties are used. We propose a general method for combining the classifiers generated on the binary problems, and we prove a general empirical multiclass loss bound given the empirical loss of the individual binary learning algorithms. The scheme and the corresponding bounds apply to many popular classification learning algorithms including support-vector machines, AdaBoost, regression, logistic regression and decision-tree algorithms. We also give a multiclass generalization error analysis for general output codes with AdaBoost as the binary learner. Experimental results with SVM and AdaBoost show that our scheme provides a viable alternative to the most commonly used multiclass algorithms.

J	Goil, S; Choudhary, A				Goil, S; Choudhary, A			PARSIMONY: An infrastructure for parallel multidimensional analysis and data mining	JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING			English	Article								Multidimensional analysis and online analytical processing (OLAP) operations require summary information on multidimensional data sets. Most common are aggregate operations along one or more dimensions of numerical data values. Simultaneous calculation of multidimensional aggregates are provided by the Data Cube operator, used to calculate and store summary information on a number of dimensions. This is computed only partially if the number of dimensions is large. Query processing for these applications requires different views of data to gain insight and for effective decision support. Queries may either be answered from a materialized cube in the data cube or calculated on the fly. The multidimensionality of the underlying problem can be represented both in relational and in multidimensional databases, the latter being a better fit when query performance is the criteria for judgment. Relational databases are scalable in size for OLAP and multidimensional analysis and efforts are on to make their performance acceptable. On the other hand multidimensional databases have proven to provide good performance for such queries, although they are not very scalable. In this article we address (1) scalability in multidimensional systems for OLAP and multidimensional analysis and (2) integration of data mining with the OLAP framework. We describe our system PARSIMONY, parallel and scalable infrastructure for multidimensional online analytical processing, used for both OLAP and data mining. Sparsity of data sets is handled by using chunks to store data either as a dense block using multidimensional arrays or as sparse representation using a bit encoded sparse structure. Chunks provide a multidimensional index structure for efficient dimension oriented data accesses much the same as multidimensional arrays do. Operations within chunks and between chunks are a combination of relational and multidimensional operations depending on whether the chunk is sparse or dense. Further, we develop parallel algorithms for data mining on the multidimensional cube structure for attribute-oriented association rules and decision-tree-based classification. These lake advantage of the data organization provided by the multidimensional data model. Performance results for high dimensional data sets on a distributed memory parallel machine (IBM SP-2) show good speedup and scalability. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

J	Bradford, JP; Fortes, JAB				Bradford, JP; Fortes, JAB			Characterization and parallelization of decision-tree induction	JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING			English	Article						program characterization; parallelization; memory hierarchy; data mining; decision-tree induction		This paper examines the performance and memory-access behavior of the C4.5 decision-tree induction program, a representative example of data mining applications, for both uniprocessor and parallel implementations. The goals of this paper are to characterize C4.5, in particular its memory hierarchy usage, and to decrease the run-time of C4.5 via algorithmic improvement and parallelization. Performance is studied via RSIM, an execution driven simulator, for three uniprocessor models that exploit instruction level parallelism to varying degrees. This paper makes the following four contributions. The first contribution is presenting a complete characterization of the C4.5 decision-tree induction program. The results show that with the exception of the input data set, the working set fits into an 8-Kbyte data cache; the instruction working set also fits into an 8-Kbyte instruction cache. For data sets larger than the L2 cache, performance is limited by accesses to main memory. The results further establish that four-way issue can provide up to a factor of two performance improvement over single-issue for larger L2 caches; for smaller L2 caches, out-of-order dispatch provides a large performance improvement over in-order dispatch. The second contribution made by this paper is examining the effect on the memory hierarchy of changing the layout of the input dataset in memory, showing again that the performance is limited by memory accesses. One proposed data layout decreases the dynamic instruction count by up to 24%, but usually results in lower performance due to worse cache behavior. Another proposed data layout does not improve the dynamic instruction count over the original layout, but has better cache behavior and decreases the run-time by up to a factor of two. Third, this paper presents the first decision-tree induction program parallelized for a ccNUMA architecture. A method for splitting the decision tree hash table is discussed that allows the hash table to be updated and accessed simultaneously without the use of locks. The performance of the parallel version is compared to the original version of C4.5 and a uniprocessor version of C4.5 using the best data layout found. Speedup curves from a six-processor Sun E4000 SMP system show a speedup on the induction step of 3.99, and simulation results show that the performance is mostly unaffected by increasing the remote memory access time until it is over a factor of ten greater than the local memory access time. Last, this paper characterizes the parallelized decision-tree induction program. Compared to the uniprocessor version, the parallel version exerts significantly less pressure on the memory hierarchy, with the exception of having a much larger first level data working set.

J	Bradford, JP; Brodley, CE				Bradford, JP; Brodley, CE			The effect of instance-space partition on significance	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						classification; comparative studies; statistical tests of significance; cross validation		This paper demonstrates experimentally that concluding which induction algorithm is more accurate based on the results from one partition of the instances into the cross-validation folds may lead to statistically erroneous conclusions. Comparing two decision tree induction and one naive-bayes induction algorithms, we find situations in which one algorithm is judged more accurate at the p = 0.05 level with one partition of the training instances but the other algorithm is judged more accurate at the p = 0.05 level with an alternate partition. We recommend a new significance procedure that involves performing cross-validation using multiple instance-space partitions. Significance is determined by applying the paired Student t-test separately to the results from each cross-validation partition, averaging their values, and converting this averaged value into a significance value.

CASI multispectral image data were collected at wavelengths of 510, 590, 660, and 730 nm. Ancillary information consisted of valley gradient and str sam width. Valley gradient was derived from elevation data contained in a 1:50,000-scale digital map sheet. Stream width was extracted from the image data. Separate image classifications were carried out for substrate type and channel pattern using a hierarchical decision tree algorithm. The final overall classification accuracies were 73.76 and 64.47 percent, respectively. Substrate type and channel pattern were combined to create composite maps of spawning habitat suitability. The resulting stratification of salmon spawning habitats corresponds well with the findings of earlier investigations.

The discussion offers explanations for application of the decision tree approach in identifying rate-deter mining steps in the toxicity of chemicals. Having done so allows for reasonably accurate predictions of cancer incidence (bladder, liver, heart, histiocyte) using Haber's Product under isoeffective conditions and the equation c x t = k x E for isodosic and isotemporal responses.

J	Kumar, AS; Majumder, KL				Kumar, AS; Majumder, KL			Information fusion in tree classifiers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							NEURAL NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION	The classification performance of a decision-tree classifier is strongly influenced by the classification strategy employed at each decision node and the presence of noise. In this study, multispectral data classification was attempted with maximum likelihood and backpropagation neural networks, as well as their combination. Three methods of fusing their information were studied in detail. The motivation for the information fusion was to enhance the interpretation of a particular pixel under study with the classifier that has a minimum uncertainty in assigning the pixel to one of desired classes. The classification performance with the fusion methods was found to be better than that of the individual classifiers.

There is, however? no universal and reliable test system for the evaluation of the allergenic potency of food products. The best known allergy assessment proposal is the careful stepwise process using the IFBC/ILSI decision tree. Unfortunately, the described tests are not always conclusive, especially if the gene source coding for the protein has no history of dietary use and/or an unknown history in terms of allergenicity. The further testing warranted should in particular be focused on the prediction of the sensitizing potential of the novel protein. for which animal models al e considered to be needed. In this paper the results are summarized of a promising food allergy model developed in Brown Norway (BN) rats. The results demonstrate that BN rats can be sensitized orally to the various allergenic food proteins tested, resulting in significant antigen-specific IgE responses, without the use of adjuvants. Upon oral challenge of previously sensitized animals. local and systemic immune-mediated effects, such as increased gastrointestinal permeability and decreased breathing frequency and blood pressure, could also be observed.

However, despite the proliferation of implemented clinical practice guidelines as decision support systems providing an easy access to patient-centered information, there is still little evidence of high physician compliance to guidelines recommendations, Apart from physicians' psychological reluctance, the incompleteness of guideline knowledge and the impreciseness of the terms used, another reason may be that, although suited to average patients, clinical practice guideline recommendations are not a substitute for the physician-controlled clinical judgement that should be applied to each actual individual patient. Therefore, computer-based approaches based on the automation of context-free operationalization of guideline knowledge, although providing uniform optimal strategies to problem-focused care delivery, may generate inappropriate inferences for a specific patient that the physician does not follow in practice. Rather than providing automated decision support, ONcoDoc allows the clinician to control the operationalization of guideline knowledge through his hypertextual reading of a knowledge base encoded as a decision tree. In this way, he has the opportunity to interpret the information provided in the context of his patient, therefore, controlling his categorization to the closest matching formal patient. Experimented in life-size ONcoDoc demonstrated good appropriation of the system by physicians with significantly high scores of compliance. We successfully tested the implemented strategy and the knowledge base in a second medical institution, giving then a noticeable example of reuse and sharing of encoded guideline knowledge across institutions.

J	Scarth, P; Phinn, SR; McAlpine, C				Scarth, P; Phinn, SR; McAlpine, C			Integrating high and moderate spatial resolution image data to estimate forest age structure	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE; EUCALYPT FORESTS; CANOPY; VEGETATION; MODEL; WOODLANDS; STANDS	The collection of spatial information to quantify changes to the state and condition of the environment is a fundamental component of conservation or sustainable utilization of tropical and subtropical forests, Age is an important structural attribute of old-growth forests influencing biological diversity in Australia eucalypt forests. Aerial photograph interpretation has traditionally been used for mapping the age and structure of forest stands. However this method is subjective and is not able to accurately capture fine to landscape scale variation necessary for ecological studies. Identification and mapping of fine to landscape scale vegetative structural attributes will allow the compilation of information associated with Montreal Process indicators lb and ld, which seek to determine linkages between age structure and the diversity and abundance of forest fauna populations. This project integrated measurements of structural attributes derived from a canopy-height elevation model with results from a geometrical-optical/spectral mixture analysis model to map forest age structure at a landscape scale. The availability of multiple-scale data allows the transfer of high-resolution attributes to landscape scale monitoring. Multispectral image data were obtained from a DMSV (Digital Multi-Spectral Video) sensor over St Mary's State Forest in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Local scene variance levels for different forest tapes calculated from the DMSV data were used to optimize the tree density and canopy size output in a geometric-optical model applied to a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TU) data set. Airborne laser scanner data obtained over the project area were used to calibrate a digital filter to extract tree heights from a digital elevation model that was derived from scanned colour stereopairs. The modelled estimates of tree height, crown size, and tree density were used to produce a decision-tree classification of forest successional stage at a landscape scale. The results obtained (72% accuracy), were limited in validation, but demonstrate potential for using the multi-scale methodology to provide spatial information for forestry policy objectives (ie., monitoring forest age structure).

Based on this algorithm, we propose a method in speaker adaptation of covariance. It is different from the traditional algorithms, which mainly focus on the adaptation of mean vector of state observation probability density. A binary decision tree is constructed offline with the similarity measure and the adaptation procedure is data-driven. It can be shown from the experiments that we can get a significant further improvement over the mean vectors adaptation.

They should be designed in such a way as to achieve as early, risk-free, unproblematic, and economic a transition as possible from preclinical to clinical trials in medicinal products development. For this purpose the legitimate interests of subjects, patients, manufacturers (sponsors), and the scientific community as well as regulatory and competent authorities must be harmonized so as to achieve a course of action that is medicinally, ethically (also with respect to animal testing), and legally justified. The development of a new medicinal product is generally marked by a number of preclinical and clinical investigations; their sequential order with regard to contents and logic, the testing duration needed on an individual basis, and chronological overlaps when carrying out these studies are all to be determined As every new active substance is a separate entity investigations and testing strategies must be designed individually The principle of flowcharts described in this text facilitates the development of a testing strategy adapted to a certain medicinal product by using decision-tree methods.

Its supervision cannot be performed on the sole knowledge of analytical redundancy relations : a normal functioning stale of the motor and a speed-sensor failure slate cannot be distinguished from a behavioral analytical model. A solution is proposed using two inductive learning techniques based on decision-tree formalism: C4.5 which is a milestone in top-down induction of decision trees, and BUST which is a solution for the functional separability problem of decision trees.

J	Wang, XZ; Yeung, DS; Tsang, ECC				Wang, XZ; Yeung, DS; Tsang, ECC			A comparative study on heuristic algorithms for generating fuzzy decision trees	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						approximate reasoning; fuzzy decision trees; fuzzy rules; heuristic algorithms; learning; learning from fuzzy examples	SETS; ENTROPY; RULES	Fuzzy decision tree induction is an important way of learning from examples with fuzzy representation. Since the construction of optimal fuzzy decision tree is NP-hard, the research on heuristic algorithms is necessary. Ln this paper, three heuristic algorithms for generating fuzzy decision trees are analyzed and compared. One of them is proposed by the authors. The comparisons are two fold. One is the analytic comparison based on expanded attribute selection and reasoning mechanism; the other is the experimental comparison based on the size of generated trees and learning accuracy. The purpose of this study is to explore comparative strengths and weaknesses of the three heuristics and to show some useful guidelines on how to choose an appropriate heuristic for a particular problem.

J	Loch, CH; Bode-Greuel, K				Loch, CH; Bode-Greuel, K			Evaluating growth options as sources of value for pharmaceutical research projects	R & D MANAGEMENT			English	Article							RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; DECISION-ANALYSIS; PRICING THEORY	The financial value of research projects is difficult to assess because they are highly uncertain. Often, the result is either an overly conservative approach to strategic innovation, based on net present value analyses, or an overly aggressive approach based on optimistic qualitative portfolios. R&D project evaluation requires recognizing threats as well as opportunities from uncertain events, and incorporating flexibility in managerial action in response to them. Real options pricing analysis is a widely discussed tool for evaluating such managerial flexibility. The limitation of options pricing lies in its requirement for complete financial markets, in which a replicating asset can be found that reproduces (or, at least, is correlated with) the project's payoffs in all possible states of the world. However, the major risks of research projects are typically project specific and cannot be replicated in external markets. In this situation, a decision tree is a better tool to represent managerial options during execution of the project, and to evaluate its value. A decision tree is equivalent to options pricing for risks that can be priced in the financial markets (if trading of securities is explicitly included), and moreover, it can incorporate risks and flexibility that are not traded in financial markets. Using decision trees, we demonstrate a quantitative evaluation of compound growth options from research at BestPharma, a large international pharmaceutical company. A growth option is a future opportunity that may arise from a current R&D investment. The growth option may not be related to the primary purpose of the R&D project, or not even be directly foreseeable. Kester (1984) has argued that growth options may account for a large part of project value. BestPharma faced the problem of choosing among several strategic research initiatives. They developed a decision tree representation of the projects, which helped to provide transparency about project value and strategic options. Most importantly, carefully thinking through the tree helped to identify growth options, represented by additional branches in the tree, and to quantify that they represented major sources of value.

J	Pariza, MW; Johnson, EA				Pariza, MW; Johnson, EA			Evaluating the safety of microbial enzyme preparations used in food processing: Update for a new century	REGULATORY TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							MOUSE LYMPHOMA-CELLS; BACILLUS-LICHENIFORMIS; DIRECTED EVOLUTION; TRICHODERMA-REESEI; MUTAGENICITY; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION; MUTATIONS; AFLATOXIN; DIVERSITY	Microbial enzymes used in food processing are typically sold as enzyme preparations that contain not only a desired enzyme activity but also other metabolites of the production strain, as well as added materials such as preservatives and stabilizers. The added materials must be food grade and meet applicable regulatory standards. The purpose of this report is to present guidelines that can be used to evaluate the safety of the metabolites of the production strain that are also present in the enzyme preparation, including of course, but not limited to, the desired enzyme activity itself. This discussion builds on previously published decision tree mechanisms and includes consideration of new genetic modification technologies, for example, modifying the primary structure of enzymes to enhance specific properties that are commercially useful. The safety of the production strain remains the primary consideration in evaluating enzyme safety, in particular, the toxigenic potential of the production strain. Thoroughly characterized nonpathogenic, nontoxigenic microbial strains, particularly those with a history of safe use in food enzyme manufacture, are logical candidates for generating a safe strain lineage, through which improved strains may be derived via genetic modification by using either traditional/classical or rDNA strain improvement strategies. The elements needed to establish a safe strain lineage include thoroughly characterizing the host organism, determining the safety of all new DNA that has been introduced into the host organism, and ensuring that the procedure(s) that have been used to modify the host organism are appropriate for food use. Enzyme function may be changed by intentionally altering the amino acid sequence (e.g., protein engineering). It may be asked if such modifications might also affect the safety of an otherwise safe enzyme. We consider this question in light of what is known about the natural variation in enzyme structure and function and conclude that it is unlikely that changes which improve upon desired enzyme function will result in the creation of a toxic protein. It is prudent to assess such very small theoretical risks by conducting limited toxicological tests on engineered enzymes. The centerpiece of this report is a decision tree mechanism that updates previous enzyme safety evaluation mechanisms to accommodate advances in enzymology. We have concluded that separate mutagenicity testing is not needed if this decision tree is used to evaluate enzyme safety. Under the criteria of the decision tree, no new food enzyme can enter the market without critical evaluation of its safety. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

J	Denison, DGT				Denison, DGT			Boosting with Bayesian stumps	STATISTICS AND COMPUTING			English	Article						Bayes' theorem; boosting; classification	ALGORITHM	Boosting is a new, powerful method for classification. It is an iterative procedure which successively classifies a weighted version of the sample, and then reweights this sample dependent on how successful the classification was. In this paper we review some of the commonly used methods for performing boosting and show how they can be fit into a Bayesian setup at each iteration of the algorithm. We demonstrate how this formulation gives rise to a new splitting criterion when using a domain-partitioning classification method such as a decision tree. Further we can improve the predictive performance of simple decision trees, known as stumps, by using a posterior weighted average of them to classify at each step of the algorithm, rather than just a single stump. The main advantage of this approach is to reduce the number of boosting iterations required to produce a good classifier with only a minimal increase in the computational complexity of the algorithm.

METHODS: Medical files of outpatients in the United Kingdom were investigated using an automated database. Two acetaminophen groups (3 g and 4 g) were compared with regard to demographic variables, treatments, associated diseases and occurrence of hepatorenal adverse events. Variables collected from the files for selected patients were also analyzed using the decision tree method to identify the specific variables best explaining the occurrence of hepatorenal adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 1.5 million medical files were investigated. Of the 7781 patients identified with paracetamol prescriptions for chronic rheumatoid disorders, 1868 (24 %) were treated with 3 g / day and 5913 (76 %) with 4 g / day. The mean overall duration of paracetamol exposure was 277 and 201 days respectively No difference between the two acetaminophen groups was found with the numbers of patients with hepatorenal adverse events potentially related to acetaminophen intake (0.86 %: group 3 g versus 0.68 % group 4 g). Using the decision tree method, daily dosage of paracetamoi (3 g or 4 g) was never identified as a discriminating variable capable of explaining the occurrence of hepatorenal adverse events. CONCLUSION: When risk factors are taken into account, such as concomitant chronic diseases, both daily dosages of paracetamoi (3 g and 4 g) have a comparable hepatorenal safety profiles in rheumatology, even in elderly patients.

J	Shiu, SCK; Yeung, DS; Sun, CH; Wang, XZ				Shiu, SCK; Yeung, DS; Sun, CH; Wang, XZ			Transferring case knowledge to adaptation knowledge: An approach for case-base maintenance	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						case-base maintenance; knowledge containers; fuzzy decision trees	FUZZY	In this article we propose a case-base maintenance methodology based on the idea of transferring knowledge between knowledge containers in a case-based reasoning (CBR) system. A machine-learning technique, fuzzy decision-tree induction, is used to transform the case knowledge to adaptation knowledge. By learning the more sophisticated fuzzy adaptation knowledge, many of the redundant cases can be removed. This approach is particularly useful when the case base consists of a large number of redundant cases and the retrieval efficiency becomes a real concern of the user. The method of maintaining a case base from scratch, as proposed in this article, consists of four steps. First, an approach to learning feature weights automatically is used to evaluate the importance of different features in a given case base. Second, clustering of cases is carried out to identify different concepts in the case base using the acquired feature-weights knowledge. Third, adaptation rules are mined for each concept using fuzzy decision trees. Fourth, a selection strategy based on the concepts of case coverage and reachability is used to select representative cases. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach as well as to examine the relationship between compactness and performance of a CBR system, experimental testing is carried out using the Traveling and the Rice Taste data sets. The results show that the testing case bases can be reduced by 36 and 39 percent, respectively, if we complement the remaining cases by the adaptation rules discovered using our approach. The overall accuracies of the two smaller case bases are 94 and 90 percent, respectively, of the originals.

Such a plant will serve small isolated communities in remote areas devoid of water resources. A specially customized code was built to simulate the operation of the installation in order to allow appropriate choice of components specifications. Site meteorological data were used to enhance prediction capabilities. The code continuously updates the instantaneous water lever of the reservoir as well as the current state of charge of the accumulators. Depending on these two variables, a logical decision tree is built to decide whether the cumulated wind and solar energy production can satisfy the load of the plant or additional energy must be provided from the accumulators or an auxiliary diesel engine generator. The process control system for such an installation must allow for operation in isolated areas where qualified maintenance personnel are scarce or remote. These are special considerations regarding the design philosophy in order to reach a state as close as possible to a maintenance-free system. In view of this consideration, several layers of back-up were built into the system such as a diesel generator (whose use is to be kept to a minimum). Also, the system has been designed to operate at about a 33% service factor. Two-day battery storage autonomy has also been provided. The desalination plant uses reverse osmosis technology. The plant has a maximum product capacity of 9 m(3)/d in view of future needs, even though it is designed to currently produce only 3 m(3)/d. The inlet water is to be provided fi om on-site brackish water wells. The local water quality is approximately 3500-5000 ppm corresponding to brackish water. The system has been designed based on the premise that the average on-site wind velocity is about 4-5 m/s and an insolation level of about 5-5.5 kWh/m(2)/d. The expected life-span of the plant is about 15 years. The system was successfully erected and has been continuously operated producing 3 m(3)/d. Experimental measurements are now in progress, and a comparison to theoretical predictions is presented. The time schedule for the whole project consisted of 6-8 months, including many changes required during construction.

In the context of a game of a chance, namely Yahtzee(C), we identified strategies deployed by expert human reasoners and developed a decision tree for agent development. This paper describes the computer implementation of the Yahtzee game as well as the software agent. It also presents a comparison of the performance of humans versus an automated agent. Results indicate that, in this context, the software agent embodies human expertise at a high level of fidelity.

In this study, we examined what and how cognitive types affect problem-solving and analyzed the theoretical development of the relationship between human cognition and the use of intelligent machines in the domain of maintenance. The implementation of the knowledge acquisition (KA) presented the development process of the maintenance protocol which derived from using ICAM DEFinition0 (IDEF0) and Data Flow Diagram (DFD). From the maintenance process modeling, the formal representation of what the user does with the resulting interface can be defined. The knowledge base of the system is represented by a fault decision tree diagram, and is incorporated to communicate between the maintainers and the computer. Furthermore, we also evaluated and compared the effectiveness of expert system interface with the traditional maintenance handbook. As a case study, a fault recovery expert system for the Maintenance Department of the diesel engine bus system of Taipei City has been developed. Findings of the study have important implications in expert system interface design, including the specific features of changeability, traceability, plenitude, and qualitative description in this maintenance area.

J	Stankovic, RS				Stankovic, RS			Non-Abelian groups in optimization of decision diagrams representations of discrete functions	FORMAL METHODS IN SYSTEM DESIGN			English	Article						discrete functions; decision diagrams; non-Abelian groups; Fourier transform		This paper is devoted to the reduction of decision diagram (DD) representations of discrete functions by using the non-Abelian groups and Fourier DDs on these groups. The number of levels in a DD can be reduced through decomposition of the domain group of the represented function into large subgroups. That approach however increases the number of nodes per levels which may decrease the global reduction possibilities in the DD. At the same time, the nodes with a considerable number of outgoing edges an required. In applications, the complexity, thus the prise, of a node is proportional to the number of outgoing edges. From an inspection of optimization methods fur DDs representations, it follows that a solution of this problem can hardly be found with DDs on Abelian groups. Therefore. we are proposing the use of Fourier DDs on finite non-Abelian groups. In that way, the matrix-valued decision diagrams are introduced, since in Fourier DDs on non-Abelian groups some of constant nodes are matrices. Three DDs permit two-steps optimization. First we determine the optimal structure of the corresponding decision tree by the reduction of which a DD is derived. The optimization is done with respect to the combination of the number of nodes and levels we may require depending on the application intended. Then, we do the optimization of the representations of matrix-valued constant nodes by ordinary DDs of smaller size. In that way, the complex-valued and integer-valued Fourier DDs are derived depending on the chosen group representations for these applications where the matrix-valued Fourier DDs may not be allowed. With thus derived Fourier DDs, the reduction of both number of levels and non-terminal nodes map be achieved. Efficiency of representations with the Fourier DDs on non-Abelian groups is illustrated by the example of DDs representations of n-bit multipliers.

Recently developed algorithm for subgraph isomorphism detection take advantage of prior knowledge of a database of models to improve the speed of on-line matching. This paper presents a new algorithm based on similar principles to solve the largest common subgraph problem. The new algorithm significantly reduces the computational complexity of detection of the LCSG between a known database of models, and a query given on-line. (C) 2001 Pattern Recognition Society.

Among these 97, the decision analysis indicated that 59 (61%; 95% confidence interval, 50%-71%) would prefer anticoagulation treatment, considerably fewer than those who would be recommended treatment according to guidelines. There was whose decision analysis indicated a preference for anticoagulation, 17 (45%) were being prescribed warfarin; on the other hand, 28 (47%) of 59 patients were not being prescribed warfarin, although the results of their decision analysis suggested they wanted to be. circle Conclusions In the context of shared decision making, individualized decision analysis is valuable in a sizable proportion of elderly patients with atrial fibrillation. Taking account of patients' preferences would lead to fewer prescriptions for warfarin man under published recommendations. Decision analysis as a shared decision-making tool should be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.

In this article, we consider an optimization problem with an optimistic criterion on a fuzzy system. By making use of minimization-maximization expectation in a fuzzy environment, we derive a recursive equation for the fuzzy decision process through invariant imbedding approach. By illustrating a three-state, two-decision and two-stage model, we give an optimal solution through dynamic programming. The optimal solution is also verified by the method of multistage fuzzy decision tree-table. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Naor, M; Ruah, S				Naor, M; Ruah, S			On the decisional complexity of problems over the reals	INFORMATION AND COMPUTATION			English	Article							LOWER BOUNDS; TREES; CONSTRUCTIONS	We consider the role of randomness for the decisional complexity in algebraic decision (or computation) trees, i.e., the number of comparisons ignoring all other computation. Recently Ting and Yao showed that the problem of finding the maximum of n elements has decisional complexity O(log(2) n) (1994, Inform. Process. Lett. 49, 39-43). In contrast, Rabin showed in 1972 an Omega (n) bound for the deterministic case (1972, J. Comput. System Sci., 6, 639-650). We point out that their technique is applicable to several problems for which corresponding Omega (n) lower bounds hold. We show that in general the randomized decisional complexity is logarithmic in the size of the decision tree. We then turn to the question of the number of random bits needed to obtain the Ting and Yao result. We provide a deterministic O(k log n) algorithm for finding the elements which are larger than a given element, given a bound k on the number of these elements.

This system employed wildlife managers expertise and knowledge, and standardized decision-making procedures for management. A 'top down' technique was used to divide the task of deer management decision-making process into four subtasks: (1) deer population evaluation, (2) deer habitat evaluation, (3) social carrying capacity evaluation, and (4) environmental evaluation. Each subtask was represented by a decision tree, developed and tested separately. The 'top-down' technique offers the flexibility to include more information when available. DeerKBS is an effective communication tool for presenting the decision-making process to stakeholders, and an educational tool to help users understandthe complexity of the management decision-making process.

The objective of this work is to specify age of the observation of the first signs by parents, age at initial paedopsychiatric consultation, age at the initial acceptance of care and the analyse factor wich influence those ages.

J	Williamson, DA; Thaw, JM; Varnado-Sullivan, PJ				Williamson, DA; Thaw, JM; Varnado-Sullivan, PJ			Cost-effectiveness analysis of a hospital-based cognitive-behavioral treatment program for eating disorders	BEHAVIOR THERAPY			English	Article							HEALTH-CARE; BULIMIA-NERVOSA; THERAPY; DEPRESSION; PSYCHOLOGY; SYMPTOMS; WEIGHT	This outcomes-management study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a hospital-based cognitive-behavioral treatment program for eating disorders. The study found that by using a systematic, decision-tree approach to treatment, patients with severe eating disorders could be treated effectively by initiating treatment in a partial day hospital program, with less cost than when treatment was initiated at an inpatient level of care. The average cost saving of this approach was $9,645 per case. The rate of recovery for the entire sample was 63% at 12-month follow-up and did not differ as a function of initial level of care. Patients who were treated with a shorter duration of illness and at an older age of onset had the best response to treatment. A longer duration of illness was associated with higher levels of eating disorder symptoms and higher levels of depression, which suggests that the early intervention may be more effective because treatment can begin at a lower level of psychopathology.

J	Oliveira, SG; Liporace, FS; Araujo, OQF; Queiroz, EM				Oliveira, SG; Liporace, FS; Araujo, OQF; Queiroz, EM			The importance of control considerations for heat exchanger network synthesis: A case study	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						control; heat exchanger network; cost optimization	DESIGN	Cost optimization in the synthesis decision tree often leads to a reduced degree of freedom which degrades the process's ability to reject disturbances as a consequence of low controllability. In fact, Heat Exchanger Networks (HENs) obtained by traditional synthesis procedures that ignore controllability aspects must be evaluated in this context a posteriori. The aim of this work was to develop a procedure that includes RGA and SVD measures of controllability, which are solely based on steady state information, thereby freeing the synthesis procedure of the cumbersome dynamic analysis. When a structure is defined during a traditional HEN synthesis procedure, a degree of freedom analysis is approached as a simulation problem. Next, an optimization is performed, since new variables are usually added to increase the degree of freedom of the HEN in order to render it controllable. A key point in the proposed procedure is the inference of controllability based on the proposed controllability measures, which also provide a control scheme by pairing controlled and manipulated variables during the process design. A HEN reported in the literature is used to illustrate the proposed procedure. The steady state simulator Aspen Plus and the dynamic simulator Aspen Dynamics (Aspentech, Inc.) were employed.

As the main problem in molecular biology is the analysis of the data instead of the data acquisition, part of the study of computational biology is to extract all kinds of meaningful information from the sequences. Computer-assisted methods have become very important in analyzing biosequence data. However, most of the current computer-assisted methods are limited to Ending motifs. Genes can be regulated in many ways, including combinations of regulatory elements. This research is aimed at developing a new integrated system for genome-wide gene expression analysis. This research begins with a new motif-finding method, using a new objective function combining multiple well defined components and an improved stochastic iterative sampling strategy. Combinatorial motif analysis is accomplished by constructive induction that analyzes potential motif combinations. We then apply standard inductive learning algorithms to generate hypotheses for different gene behaviors. A genome-wide gene expression analysis demonstrated the value of this novel integrated system. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Dong, M; Kothari, R				Dong, M; Kothari, R			Look-ahead based fuzzy decision tree induction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						decision tree; classification; fuzzy ID3; fuzzy systems; gain ratio		Decision tree induction is typically based on a top-do,vn greedy algorithm that makes locally optimal decisions at each node. Due to the greedy and local nature of the decisions made at each node, there is considerable possibility of instances at the node being split along branches such that instances along some or all of the branches require a large number of additional nodes for classification. In this paper, we present a computationally efficient say of incorporating look-ahead into fuzzy decision tree induction. Our algorithm is based on establishing the decision at each internal node by jointly optimizing the node splitting criterion (information gain or gain ratio) and the classifiability of instances along each branch of the node. Simulations results confirm that the use of the proposed look-ahead method leads to smaller decision trees and as a consequence better test performance.

J	Kim, H; Loh, WY				Kim, H; Loh, WY			Classification trees with unbiased multiway splits	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						decision tree; linear discriminant analysis; missing value; selection bias	DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; INDUCTION	Two univariate split methods and one linear combination split method are proposed for the construction of classification trees with multiway splits. Examples are given where the trees are more compact and hence easier to interpret than binary trees. A major strength of the univariate split methods is that they have negligible bias in variable selection, both when the variables differ in the number of splits they offer and when they differ in the number of missing values. This is an advantage because inferences from the tree structures can be adversely affected by selection bias. The new methods are shown to be highly competitive in terms of computational speed and classification accuracy of future observations.

Strategy for evaluating hazardous and nonhazardous filth	REGULATORY TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Review							MUSCA-DOMESTICA DIPTERA; GERMAN-COCKROACH ORTHOPTERA; ESCHERICHIA-COLI O157-H7; INNER-CITY CHILDREN; HELICOBACTER-PYLORI; HOUSE-DUST; SALMONELLA-ENTERITIDIS; PERIPLANETA-AMERICANA; PUBLIC-HEALTH; FOREIGN-BODY	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) uses regulatory action criteria for filth and extraneous materials to evaluate adulteration of food products. The criteria are organized into three categories: health hazards, indicators of insanitation, and natural or unavoidable defects. The health hazard category includes criteria for physical, chemical, and microbiological hazards associated with filth and extraneous materials. The health hazard category encompasses criteria for HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) hazards and HACCP contributing factors. The indicators of insanitation category includes criteria for visibly objectionable contaminants, contamination from commensal pests, and other types of contamination that are associated with insanitary conditions in food processing and storage facilities. The natural or unavoidable category includes criteria for harmless, naturally occurring defects and contaminants. A decision tree is presented for the sequential application of regulatory action criteria for filth and extraneous materials associated with each category and with each type of filth or extraneous material in the three categories. This final report of a series in the development of a transparent science base for a revised FDA regulatory policy in the area of filth and extraneous materials in food includes a comprehensive list of the references that form the science base for the FDA regulatory policy.

J	Courtney, DM; Sasser, HC; Pincus, CL; Kline, JA				Courtney, DM; Sasser, HC; Pincus, CL; Kline, JA			Pulseless electrical activity with witnessed arrest as a predictor of sudden death from massive pulmonary embolism in outpatients	RESUSCITATION			English	Article						pulmonary embolism; sudden death; thrombolysis; pulseless electrical activity; cardiac arrest; autopsy	HOSPITAL CARDIAC-ARREST; CARDIOPULMONARY-RESUSCITATION; THROMBOLYTIC THERAPY; SURVIVAL; UROKINASE; EMERGENCY; ALTEPLASE; INFUSION; SYMPTOMS; SYSTEM	Background: the objective was to determine clinical characteristics that can quickly distinguish sudden death from massive pulmonary embolism (MPE) from other causes of sudden death. Methods and results: all medical examiner reports from Charlotte, NC from 1992 to 1999 (n = 4926) were hand-searched for cases of sudden death which met the inclusion criteria: non-traumatic death, age 18-65 years, transported to an emergency department (ED), and autopsy performed. Supplemental data from ED and prehospital records were retrieved to complete documentation. Data were analyzed by univariate odds ratios (OR) followed by chi-square (chi (2)) recursive partitioning for decision tree construction. Three hundred eighty four cases met inclusion criteria; MPE was the second most frequent cause of cardiac arrest in this cohort (37/384, 9.6%). The mean age of subjects with MPE (40.2 +/- 11.1 years) was significantly lower compared with non-PE subjects (46.5 +/- 9.9 years). Pulseless electrical activity was observed as the initial arrest rhythm (primary PEA) in 52/384 (13.5%) subjects. Out of 52 subjects with primary PEA, 28 (53%) died from MPE. Odds ratio data indicated significant association of MPE with female gender, arrest witnessed by medical providers, presence of primary PEA, and return of spontaneous circulation. The most accurate decision rule to recognize MPE consisted of witnessed arrest + primary PEA. This rule generated sensitivity = 67.6% and specificity = 94.5% and yielded a posttest probability of MPE of 57%. Conclusions: outpatients with witnessed cardiac arrest and primary PEA carry a high probability of MPE. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Weber, J				Weber, J			Plebologic diagnostic. Phlebography in the lower extremities	ZENTRALBLATT FUR CHIRURGIE			German	Article						ascending leg phlebography; varicography; ball technique; Valsalva's manoeuver; phleboscopy; quality standards	QUALITY ASSURANCE	Phlebography should be weighed up against the current sonographic techniques (Doppler and Duplex) applied for visualization of venous disorders along the lower extremity veins, following a decision tree considering completeness and quality of documentation wanted, invasivness and clinical consequences expected in the individual case. Ascending leg phlebography, incorporating Valsalva's manoeuvre, means the up-to-date standard technique, offering morphologic and functional information. Varicography and additional phlebographic techniques are considered to be additive, solving special problems, having not been visualized by the standard phlebography before. Combined phlebography and peripheral blood pressure measurements may improve the output of functional informations within one session. Quality standards of phlebography have to include standardized technique of phlebography, of documentation and interpretation, dealing with the special aspects of varicose syndrome, acute thrombosis and the postthrombotic syndrome.

J	Muegge, I; Heald, SL; Brittelli, D				Muegge, I; Heald, SL; Brittelli, D			Simple selection criteria for drug-like chemical matter	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							COMBINATORIAL LIBRARIES; DESIGNING COMBINATORIAL; DISCOVERY; DATABASES; DIVERSITY; IDENTIFICATION; TECHNOLOGIES; PREDICTION; CHEMISTRY; MOLECULES	A simple pharmacophore point filter has been developed that discriminates between drug-like and nondrug-like chemical matter. It is based on the observation that nondrugs are often underfunctionalized. Therefore, a minimum count of well-defined pharmacophore points is required to pass the filter. The application of the filter results in 66-69% of subsets of the MDDR database to be classified as drug-like. Furthermore, 61-68% of subsets of the CMC database are classified as drug-like. In contrast, only 36% of the ACD are found to be drug-like. While these results are not quite as good as those obtained with recently described neural net approaches, the method used here has clear advantages. In contrast to a neural net approach and also in contrast to decision tree methods described recently, the pharmacophore filter has been developed by using "chemical wisdom" that is unbiased from fitting the structural content of specific drug databases to prediction models. Similar to decision tree methods, the pharmacophore point filter provides a detailed structural reason for the classification of each molecule as drug or nondrug. The pharmacophore point filter results are compared to neural net filter results. A statistically significant overlap between compounds recognized as drug-like validates both approaches. The pharmacophore point filter complements neural net approaches as well as property profiling approaches used as drug-likeness filters in compound library analysis and design.

Patients and Methods: A total of 510 consecutively recruited patients in first chronic phase Ph1+ CML and pretreatment bone marrow biopsy specimens were entered onto this multicenter observational trial to evaluate the effect of bone marrow histopathology. According to generally accepted criteria, patients with any signs of accelerated disease were excluded. Treatment modalities included administration of interferon alfa-2b (IFN) and chemotherapy with hydroxyurea (HU) or busulfan. Immunohistochemical and morphometric techniques were applied to identify marrow cells and to quantify fiber density. Patients were separated into learning and validation samples, and classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was performed to establish a prognostic decision tree. Results: CART analysis of the validation sample (123 patients with HU therapy) revealed the amount of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, myelofibrosis, and splenomegaly as the most important prognostic features. Three risk profiles with significantly different survival patterns were established, with median survival times ranging from 33 to 108 months (two-sided log-rank test, P = .0001). The new score was confirmed by application to the learning sample with IFN therapy (two-sided log-rank test, P = .0002). Furthermore, risk status defined by the new score was significantly correlated with the occurrence of blast transformation. Conclusion: Our data strongly implicate that prognostic classification of chronic-phase Ph1+ CML can be significantly improved by the inclusion of morphologic parameters. The variables of the presented scoring system may be easily assessed by routinely processed aspirates and bone marrow trephines. J Clin Oncol 19:2994-3009.

J	Takimoto, E; Maruoka, A; Vovk, V				Takimoto, E; Maruoka, A; Vovk, V			Predicting nearly as well as the best pruning of a decision tree through dynamic programming scheme	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Workshop on Algorithmic Learning Theory	OCT 06-08, 1997	SENDAI, JAPAN	Japanese Soc Artificial Intelligence, Tohoku Univ		on-line prediction; pruning; decision tree; expert model; aggregating algorithm	EXPERT ADVICE; ALGORITHM	Helmbold and Schapire gave an on-line prediction algorithm that, when given an unpruned decision tree, produces predictions not much worse than the predictions made by the best pruning of the given decision tree. In this paper, we give two new on-line algorithms. The first algorithm is based on the observation that finding the best pruning can be efficiently solved by a dynamic programming in the "batch" setting where all the data to be predicted are given in advance. This algorithm works well for a wide class of Loss functions, whereas the one given by Helmbold and Schapire is only described for the absolute loss function. Moreover, the algorithm given in this paper is so simple and general that it could be applied to many other on-line optimization problems solved by dynamic programming. We also explore the second algorithm that is competitive not only with the best pruning but also with the best prediction values which are associated with nodes in the decision tree. In this setting, a greatly simplified algorithm is given for the absolute loss function. It can be easily generalized to the case where, instead of using decision trees, data are classified in some arbitrarily fixed manner. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Study Design: A decision-tree model of 1 year. Patients and Methods: Average wholesale prices were used to estimate drug costs. A fixed drug budget of $558,910, sufficient to treat 100 patients with IFN-alpha, was assumed. Clinical data were taken from randomized controlled trials. The outcome measures used were hepatitis B "e" antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion rates and rates of progression to cirrhosis. Results: The analysis showed that given the fixed drug budget, 353 patients could be treated with lamivudine, resulting in an expected 62 HBeAg seroconversions, with 6 patients progressing to cirrhosis. Given the same drug budget, 100 patients could be;treated with IFN-alpha, leaving 253 patients untreated. This treatment scenario would result in an expected 32 HBeAg seroconversions, with 28 patients progressing to cirrhosis. Compared with no treatment, the costs per additional HBeAg seroconversion obtained were $12,703 for lamivudine and $39,922 for IFN-alpha. In addition, each case of cirrhosis avoided through lamivudine treatment resulted in significant annual cost savings. Lamivudine therapy also provided additional clinical benefits leg, normalization of alanine transaminase levels, reduction in hepatitis' B virus DNA levels, improvement in liver histology) to patients who do not seroconvert. Conclusion: From the perspective of a third-party payer with a fixed drug budget, lamivudine is a more cost-effective therapy than IFN-alpha for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.

Sixty-nine patients (mean age 48.1 years, SD = 14.1) fulfilling the International Headache Society criteria for tension-type headache were randomly assigned to verum or placebo condition. No significant differences between placebo and verum with respect to visual analogue scale and frequency of headache attacks could be observed immediately, 6 weeks and 5 months after the end of treatment. There was a significant but weak improvement in quality of life parameters (clinical global impressions, Nottingham Health Profile) after verum treatment. In decision tree analyses, the changes in clinical global impressions and headache frequency depended significantly on primary headache frequency with a limit value of 24.5 days headache per month. High values in the von Zerssen Depression Score resulted in high mean visual analogue scale values.

In 823 patients, 1676 anatomic cohesive silicone gel implants have been used in this series. To date this is the world's largest experience from one center. The concept of using these types of implants is very different from other augmentation techniques and many considerations in the preoperative assessment have to be respected for optimal results. A "decision tree" has been constructed to aid the surgeon to choose the right type of implant. In this article, advantages and disadvantages, indications, contraindications, preoperative measurements and considerations, surgical technique, postoperative management, and results are presented.

J	Olaleye, D; Tardiff, BE				Olaleye, D; Tardiff, BE			Practical issues in and applications of clinical data mining	DRUG INFORMATION JOURNAL			English	Article						data mining; decision tree; clinical data repository; enterprise miner; clinical trials; two-stage model		Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies accumulate large volumes of data throughout the drug development life cycle-from discovery through marketing. Many organizations consolidate these data assets in central repositories to facilitate access and compilation for New Drug Application (NDA) submissions and other efforts. These clinical data repositories represent a potential gold mine of knowledge that may be further exploited for competitive business advantage. Clinical data mining solutions empower companies to extract previously unrealized information about their molecular compounds, product portfolio, clinical studies, and customers from data repositories. These companies must determine how to apply clinical data mining tools to get to the most useful information and, once knowledge is extracted, how to apply it for best business advantage. This paper provides an overview of the clinical data mining process and a framework for implementing a clinical data mining solution. The process begins with the data mining goal or objective and a database to be mined, followed by the application of data mining strategies to generate one or more models, and concluding with deployment of model results to relevant business areas. The process is illustrated in this paper through a case study using pooled studies from Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. Data mining should be a team effort of quantitative analysts (eg, statisticians), domain experts (eg, clinicians, scientists, drug discoverers), business users (eg, marketing and regulatory department), and information technologists, and must be thoroughly supported by upper levels of management and throughout the organization.

J	Puuronen, S; Tsymbal, A				Puuronen, S; Tsymbal, A			Local feature selection with dynamic integration of classifiers	FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems (ISMIS)	OCT 11-14, 2000	CHARLOTTE, NC			feature selection; ensemble of classifiers; dynamic integration; data mining; machine learning	ALGORITHMS	Multidimensional data is often feature space heterogeneous so that individual features have unequal importance in different sub areas of the feature space. This motivates to search for a technique that provides a strategic splitting of the instance space being able to identify the best subset of features for each instance to be classified. Our technique applies the wrapper approach where a classification algorithm is used as an evaluation function to differentiate between different feature subsets. In order to make the feature selection local, we apply the recent technique for dynamic integration of classifiers. This allows to determine which classifier and which feature subset should be used for each new instance. Decision trees are used to help to restrict the number of feature combinations analyzed. For each new instance we consider only those feature combinations that include the features present in the path taken by the new instance in the decision tree built on the whole feature set. We evaluate our technique on data sets from the UCI machine learning repository. In our experiments, we use the C4.5 algorithm as the learning algorithm for base classifiers and for the decision trees that guide the local feature selection. The experiments show some advantages of the local feature selection with dynamic integration of classifiers in comparison with the selection of one feature subset for the whole space.

The process of drop testing, interpreting results, and implementing design improvements is knowledge-intensive and time-consuming, and requires a great many decisions and judgments on the part of the human designer. To decrease design cycles and, thereby, the time to market for new products, it is important to have a method for quickly and efficiently analyzing drop test results, predicting the effects of design changes, and determining the best design parameters. Recent advances in data mining have provided techniques for automatically discovering underlying knowledge from large amounts of experimental data. In this paper, an intelligent data mining system named decision tree expert (DTE) is presented and applied to drop testing analysis. The rule induction method in DTE is based on the C4.5 algorithm. In our preliminary experiments, concise and accurate conceptual design rules were successfully generated from drop test data after incorporation of domain knowledge from human experts. The data mining approach is a flexible one that can be applied to a number of complex design and manufacturing processes to reduce costs and improve productivity.

When cancerous masses are embedded in and camouflaged by varying densities of parenchymal tissue structures, they are very difficult to be visually detected on mammograms. This paper presents an algorithm that combines several artificial intelligent techniques with the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for detection of masses in mammograms. The AI techniques include fractal dimension analysis, multiresolution markov random field, dogs-and-rabbits algorithm, and others. The fractal dimension analysis serves as a preprocessor to determine the approximate locations of the regions suspicious for cancer in the mammogram, The dogs-and-rabbits clustering algorithm is used to initiate the segmentation at the LL subband of a three-level DWT decomposition of the mammogram. A tree-type classification strategy is applied at the end to determine whether a given region is suspicious for cancer. We have verified the algorithm with 322 mammograms in the Mammographic Image Analysis Society Database. The verification results show that the proposed algorithm has a sensitivity of 97.3% and the number of false positive per image is 3.92.

The results of these studies provide answers to several questions concerning which properties are critical to intrusion detection, First, our studies show that the frequency property of multiple audit event types in a sequence of events is necessary for intrusion detection, A single audit event at a given time is not sufficient for intrusion detection, Second, the ordering property of multiple audit events provides additional advantage to the frequency property for intrusion detection, However, unless the scalability problem of complex data models taking into account the ordering property of activity data is solved, intrusion detection techniques based on the frequency property provide a viable solution that produces good intrusion detection performance with low computational overhead.

Specifically, this study validated the predictive power of data mining algorithms by comparing the performance of logistic regression and two decision tree algorithms, CHIAD (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection) and C5.0 (a variant of C4.5) using the test set of 4588 beneficiaries and the training set of 13,689 beneficiaries. Contrary to the previous study, the CHIAD algorithm performed better than the logistic regression in predicting hypertension, and C5.0 had the lowest predictive power. In addition, the CHIAD algorithm and the association rule also provided the segment-specific information for the risk factors and target group that may be used in a policy analysis for hypertension management.

We show that the exponential quantum speed-up obtained for partial functions (i.e., problems involving a promise on the input) by Deutsch and Jozsa, Simon, and Shor cannot be obtained for any total function: if a quantum algorithm computes some total Boolean function f with small error probability using T black-box queries, then there is a classical deterministic algorithm that computes f exactly with O(T(6)) queries. We also give asymptotically tight characterizations of T for all symmetric f in the exact, zero-error, and bounded-error settings. Finally, we give new precise bounds for AND, OR, and PARITY. Our results are a quantum extension of the so-called polynomial method, which has been successfully applied in classical complexity theory, and also a quantum extension of results by Nisan about a polynomial relationship between randomized and deterministic decision tree complexity.

Application to Spanish clinkers	MATERIALES DE CONSTRUCCION			Spanish	Article								The qualitative identification to determine the origin (i.e. manufacturing factory) of Spanish clinkers is described. The classification of clinkers produced in different factories can be based on their trace element content. Approximately fifteen clinker sorts are analysed, collected from 11 spanish cement factories to determine their Mg, Sr, Ba, Mn, Ti, Zr, Zn and V content. An expert system formulated by a binary decision tree is designed based on the collected data. The performance of the obtained classifier was measured by ten fold cross validation. The results show that the proposed method is useful to identify an easy-to-use expert system that is able to determine the origin of the clinker based on its trace element content.

J	Wang, W; Jones, P; Partridge, D				Wang, W; Jones, P; Partridge, D			A comparative study of feature-salience ranking techniques	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							FEEDFORWARD NEURAL-NETWORK; INPUTS	We assess the relative merits of a number of techniques designed to determine the relative salience of the elements of a feature set with respect to their ability to predict a category outcome-for example, which features of a character contribute most to accurate character recognition. A number of different neural-net-based techniques have been proposed (by us and others) in addition to a standard statistical technique, and we add a technique based on inductively generated decision trees. The salience of the features that compose a proposed set is an important problem to solve efficiently and effectively, not only for neural computing technology but also in order to provide a sound basis for any attempt to design an optimal computational system. The focus of this study is the efficiency and the effectiveness with which high-salience subsets of features can be identified in the context of ill-understood and potentially noisy real-world data. Our two simple approaches, weight clamping using a neural network and feature ranking using a decision tree, generally provide a good, consistent ordering of features. In addition, linear correlation often works well.

We compared costs, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of administering RSVIG to no treatment in different pediatric populations, including those at risk of developing RSV-bronchiolitis and those at risk of developing any respiratory illness-related hospitalization. We observed that if only infants at high risk of severe RSV infections received treatment with RSVIG, a calculated cost saving of about $27,000 per hospitalization prevented were realized. If the Food and Drug: Administration (FDA)-approved indications for RSVIG were followed, the cost to prevent one hospitalization due fo RSV bronchiolitis would be over $53,000. If the aim, however, was to prevent all respiratory ill ness-related hospitalizations for this broader population, a much lower cost ($4,000) to prevent one hospitalization would result. In this situation, cost neutrality was possible, with a therapy cost of $2,843 compared to the actual average therapy cost of $4,444, Sensitivity analysis showed that the model was relatively insensitive to all variables, with the exceptions of costs related to RSVIG and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. We conclude that RSVIG resulted in cost savings if therapy were reserved for the infants who are at highest risk for developing severe RSV infections, RSVIG is not cost-effective for preventing RSV bronchiolitis when used according to the FDA-approved indications. Education that emphasizes frequent hand-washing, avoidance of passive smoking, and lessening exposure to sick children remains the least expensive prevention tool. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In this research, habitat suitability models derived from Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) imagery for 1975 and Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery for 1997 were developed to represent the landscape for the study area in a past (1975) and more recent condition (1997). A Hybrid Decision Tree (HDT) Classifier was used to combine maximum likelihood decision rules, a brightness differencing technique, and a spatial/contextual rule base. Verified by field samples and aerial photographs, the accuracy of the resulting habitat unit maps was determined to be 91.8% overall in the 1997 TM classification and 89.5% overall in the 1975 MSS classification. Based on a comparative analysis of selected spatial landscape metrics calculated for each time period, changes in the composition and spatial configuration of early winter habitat were quantified. Overall, the amount of suitable winter habitat available in 1997 represented a decrease of approximately 832.88 ha (8.53%) from 1975 levels. In the observed disturbance pattern, early winter habitat patches in 1997 were smaller and more uniform in size than in 1975. as suggested by decreases in mean patch size and patch size coefficient of variation indices. Spatial pattern analysis results indicated a reduction in geometric complexity, interior core area, and mean proximity between 1975 and 1997, while patch density and edge density had increased over time. The interpretation of changes in landscape structure are consistent with those reported in the literature for other regions, and indicate that fragmentation of early winter caribou habitat has occurred in the study area.

A tree-shellable function is a positive Boolean function such that the number of prime implicants equals the number of paths from the root node to a I-node in its binary decision tree representation. A tree-shellable function is easy to dualize and good for a kind of reliability computation. We show their basic properties and clarify the relations between several shellable functions, i.e. shellable, tree-shellable, ordered tree-shellable, aligned and lexico-exchange functions. We also discuss on tree-shellable quadratic functions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Greenfield, S				Greenfield, S			Oil debris monitoring for the Eurofighter 2000 aircraft	INSIGHT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Condition Montioring	JUN 25-27, 2001	OXFORD, UNITED KINGDOM		ST CATHERINES COLL			Modern combat aircraft are generally constructed of composite, non-metallic, materials. Such materials are subject to high stresses as an active airframe member. The usual 'maintenance access hatch' utilised in traditional metal-based construction techniques does not exist, therefore the maintenance philosophy of composite airframes needs a more modernistic approach. Composite access panels/engine panels, tend to be large, expensive and life-limited for removal and replacement. These factors drive the need for reliable on-condition, on-line maintenance practices for all regular maintenance. The Eurofighter 2000 specification required a suite of on-line systems including an on-line oil debris monitoring system. This system was to provide quantitative information of any oil-borne metallic debris in the engine lubrication system for each of the two engines (EJ200), and also a discrete output for the secondary power system drive (APU), and two airframe-mounted accessory drive gearboxes (AMAD). Two fundamentally different technology solutions were proposed and accepted for these two diverse applications. The application of these two different technology applications offered the appropriately optimised monitoring techniques for the applications. The reasons for the selection will be discussed in this paper, as well as the applicability to this advanced aircraft and future proposed weapon platforms. The paper describes the decision process and implementation of the two diverse technology options including the decision tree for final technology selection and implementation.

METHODS: A decision tree was used to assess the cost and the expected quality-adjusted years of life (QALY) after treatment with either low-molecular-weight heparin or warfarin, based on pooled data from six published trials. Preferences were elicited with a modified time trade-off method in a sample of patients attending an anticoagulation clinic. RESULTS: Compared with warfarin, low-molecular-weight heparin significantly decreased the rate of minor bleeding (odds ratio [OR] = 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.14 to 0.43) but not recurrent deep vein thromboses (OR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.43 to 1.35). Patients' preference for warfarin (0.988, on a 0 to I scale) was lower than that for low-molecular-weight heparin (0.992), but the difference was not statistically significant. A Monte Carlo analysis estimated that low-molecular-weight heparin saved an average of 13 quality-adjusted days compared with warfarin, at a cost of $6,583 per QALY (95% CI: $5,525 to $7,625) based on costs in Italy and $28,231 per QALY (93% CI: $20,872 to $36,773) based on costs in the United States. When we included rebound recurrences after interruption of therapy, which were more common with low-molecular-weight heparin, treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin cost $53,166 per QALY in Italy and $177,166 per QALY in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: Low-molecular-weight heparin might be a cost-effective drug for secondary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, especially in patients at high risk of recurrence and where the drug's cost is lower. The apparent increase in recurrence after interruption of therapy needs to be investigated more thoroughly before low-molecular-weight heparin can be recommended routinely.

In general, different people seem to have different ways of conception and thus can have different concepts even on the same thing. When people try to communicate their concepts with words, such difference in the meaning and usage can lead to misunderstanding in communication, which can hinder their collaboration. In our approach each granule of knowledge in classification from users is structured into a decision tree so that difference in the usage of words can be discovered as difference in the structure of decision trees. By treating each granule of classification knowledge (i.e., decision tree) as an individual in Genetic Algorithm (GA), evolution is carried out with respect to both classification efficiency of each individual and diversity as a population so that the granule for classification is gradually evolved with diverse structure. Experiments were carried out on motor diagnosis cases with artificially encoded difference in the usage of words and the result shows the effectiveness of the proposed evolutionary approach.

J	Wani, MA				Wani, MA			SAFARI: A structured approach for automatic rule induction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						machine learning; pattern classification; rule induction; system identification	ALGORITHM; GENERATION	This paper describes a new algorithm for obtaining rules automatically from training examples. The algorithm is applicable to examples involving both objects with discrete and continuous-valued attributes. The paper explains a new quantization procedure for continuous-valued attributes and shows how appropriate ranges of values of various attributes are obtained. The algorithm uses a decision-tree-based approach for obtaining rules, but unlike other tree-based algorithms such as ID3, it allows more than one attribute at a node which greatly improves its performance. The ability of the algorithm to obtain a measure of partial match further enhances its generalization characteristic. The algorithm produces the same rules irrespective of the order of presentation of training examples. The algorithm has been demonstrated on classification problems. The results have compared favorably with those obtained by existing inductive learning algorithms.

J	Bonner, G				Bonner, G			Decision making for health care professionals: use of decision trees within the community mental health setting	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article						decision making; decision trees; community mental health; multidisciplinary approaches; dual diagnosis; case study; collaboration	SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS; DUAL DIAGNOSIS; PSYCHIATRY; DEPRESSION; ILLNESS; MISUSE; ABUSE; ILL	Aim of the paper. To examine the application of the decision tree approach to collaborative clinical decision-making in mental health care in the United Kingdom (UK). Background. While this approach to decision-making has been examined in the acute care setting, there is little published evidence of its use in clinical decision-making within the mental health setting. The complexities of dual diagnosis (schizophrenia and substance misuse in this case example) and the varied viewpoints of different professionals often hamper the decision-making process. This paper highlights how the approach was used successfully as a multiprofessional collaborative approach to decision-making in the context of British community mental health care. Design. A selective review of the relevant literature and a case study application of the decision tree framework. Conclusions. The process of applying the decision tree framework to clinical decision-making in mental health practice can be time consuming and client inclusion within the process is not always appropriate. The approach offers a method of assigning numerical values to support complex multiprofessional decision-making as well as considering underpinning literature to inform the final decision. Use of the decision tree offers a common framework that can assist professionals to examine the options available to them in depth, while considering the complex variables that influence decision-making in collaborative mental health practice. Use of the decision tree warrants further consideration in mental health care in terms of practice and education.

Three approaches have been used to address the potential for development of a metachronous hernia: (1) observation and repair of a contralateral hernia only if it later becomes apparent, (2) routine contralateral groin exploration, and (3) laparoscopy to evaluate the contralateral groin for a potential hernia. The purpose of this study was to use decision analysis to determine which approach resulted in the lowest morbidity, mortality, and cost. Methods: A decision tree was constructed for the management of metachronous hernias that accounted for the occurrence of both nonincarcerated and incarcerated metachronous hernias. Baseline values were estimated from recent reports in the literature. Total charges for each approach were obtained from available hospital records and were used to estimate cost. Results: Observation was favored over laparoscopy and laparoscopy over routine exploration with respect to preventing spermatic cord injury and preserving future fertility. Although a second operation may be required when observation is used, this approach was associated with only a small increase in anesthesia-related complications (1 in 17,847), cardiac arrests (1 in 62,500), and death (1 in 312,500). Although observation was the favored approach with respect to cost, laparoscopy was less expensive when the expected incidence of metachronous hernias was high. Conclusions: Observation is the preferred approach to metachronous hernias because it results in the lowest incidence of injury and cost for most patients and is associated with a minimal increase in anesthesia-related morbidity and mortality. Laparoscopy may be advantageous for patients at high risk for development of a contralateral hernia. As a strategy for preventing metachronous hernias without consideration for injury or cost, routine exploration should be limited to situations in which laparoscopy cannot be performed because of small patient size or a preference for spinal anesthesia.

To develop a data-derived model for predicting serious bacterial infection (SBI) among febrile infants <3 months old. Methods. All infants <less than or equal to>90 days old with a temperature greater than or equal to 38.0 degrees C seen in an urban emergency department (ED) were retrospectively identified. SBI was defined as a positive culture of urine, blood, or cerebrospinal fluid. Tree-structured analysis via recursive partitioning was used to develop the model. SBI or No-SBI was the dichotomous outcome variable, and age, temperature, urinalysis (UA), white blood cell (WBC) count, absolute neutrophil count, and cerebrospinal fluid WBC were entered as potential predictors. The model was tested by V-fold cross-validation. Results. Of 5279 febrile infants studied, SBI was diagnosed in 373 patients (7%): 316 urinary tract infections (UTIs), 17 meningitis, and 59 bacteremia (8 with meningitis, 11 with UTIs). The model sequentially used 4 clinical parameters to define high-risk patients: positive UA, WBC count greater than or equal to 20 000/mm(3) or less than or equal to 4100/mm(3), temperature greater than or equal to 39.6 degreesC, and age <13 days. The sensitivity of the model for SBI is 82% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 78%-86%) and the negative predictive value is 98.3% (95% CI: 97.8%-98.7%). The negative predictive value for bacteremia or meningitis is 99.6% (95% CI: 99.4%-99.8%). The relative risk between high- and low-risk groups is 12.1 (95% CI: 9.3-15.6). Sixty-six SBI patients (18%) were misclassified into the lower risk group: 51 UTIs, 14 with bacteremia, and 1 with meningitis. Conclusions. Decision-tree analysis using common clinical variables can reasonably predict febrile infants at high- risk for SBI. Sequential use of UA, WBC count, temperature, and age can identify infants who are at high risk of SBI with a relative risk of 12.1 compared with lower-risk infants.

To determine the sensitivity of the cost effectiveness analysis to variation in the probability of developing sequelae. Methods: A decision tree was constructed to evaluate health effects of the programme, such as averted sequelae, of chlamydial infection. Cost effectiveness from a societal perspective was estimated for screening by means of a ligase chain reaction on mailed, home obtained urine specimens, in a population with a C trachomatis test prevalence of 2.9%. An extensive sensitivity analysis was performed for the probability of sequelae, the percentage of preventable pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and the discount rate. Results: The estimated net cost of curing one woman, aged 15-40 years, of a C trachomatis infection is US$1210. To prevent one major outcome (PID, tubal factor infertility ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, or neonatal pneumonia), 479 women would have to be screened. The net cost of preventing one major outcome is $15 800. Changing the probability of PID after chlamydial infection from 5% to 25% decreases the net cost per major outcome averted from $28 300 to $6380, a reduction of 78%. Results were less sensitive to variations in estimates for other sequelae. The breakeven prevalence of the programme ranges from 6.4% for the scenario with all probabilities for complications set at the maximum value to a prevalence of 100% for probabilities set at the minimum value. Conclusions: Systematic screening of all women aged 15-40 years for asymptomatic C trachomatis infections is not cost effective. Although the results of the analyses are sensitive to variation in the assumptions, the costs exceed the benefits, even in the most optimistic scenario.

As a consequence our research focuses on the question of how to port large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) systems in a fast and efficient way. More specifically we want to estimate acoustic models for a new target language using speech data from varied source languages, but only limited data from the target language. For this purpose, we introduce different methods for multilingual acoustic model combination and a polyphone decision tree specialization procedure. Recognition results using language-dependent, independent and language-adaptive acoustic models are presented and discussed in the framework of our GlobalPhone project which investigates LVCSR systems in 15 languages.

Commonly used algorithms, such as the WHO criteria, do not meet the specific requirements for causality assessment of suspected virus transmission. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A special algorithm, based on nucleic acid amplification and gene sequencing technology, effectiveness of validated virus-inactivation methods, empirical data concerning the safety record of the product, and information on batch-related infection clusters, was developed. The algorithm is focused on laboratory test results or otherwise standardized data, with few clinical data being required. To facilitate practical application, the algorithm has been converted into a graphical decision tree. RESULTS: The feasibility of the algorithm is shown by causality assessment of sample cases. Three cases are presented with the details of each case used in the 12-question checklist. The answers provided by the checklist led to the causality classification. CONCLUSION: The algorithm is a tool for evaluating reports of suspected virus transmission in a standardized manner.

To comprehensively evaluate clinical predictors of spontaneous acute urinary retention (AUR) across pooled data of placebo-treated patients from clinical trials conducted in men with lower urinary tract symptoms and clinically diagnosed benign prostatic hyperplasia. Methods. Data from the place bo-treatment groups of several prospective, randomized clinical trials conducted in the United States (n = 3040), Scandinavia, Canada, and worldwide (n = 2295) were combined in the analyses. More than 110 variables were considered individually and in combination as predictors of AUR using logistic regression analysis and classification and regression tree methods with a split-sample approach to cross-validation. Results. The different methods of analysis identified consistent potential predictors of episodes of AUR. When prostate volume was included in the analyses, it was selected as the initial variable discriminating men with and without subsequent AUR. Omitting prostate volume because of its availability in only a subset of men, a logistic model including serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), urinating more than every 2 hours, symptom problem index, maximum urinary flow rate, and hesitancy of urination had good predictive properties (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.742 +/- 0.047), as did a model with PSA (AUC = 0.716 +/- 0.045). A classification and regression decision tree with the same variables predicted AUR (AUC = 0.74, sensitivity = 72%, specificity = 67%) as well as did a tree with PSA alone (AUC = 0.70, sensitivity = 75%, specificity = 64%). Conclusions. Prostate volume and serum PSA are strong predictors of AUR in placebo-treated men with lower urinary tract symptoms and clinically diagnosed benign prostatic hyperplasia who were screened for prostate cancer. From more than 110 variables, logistic models and decision trees with PSA alone were comparable to expanded models that included PSA, urinary frequency and hesitancy, flow rate parameters, and symptom problem index, and to a scoring algorithm.

J	Akbaryan, F; Bishnoi, PR				Akbaryan, F; Bishnoi, PR			Fault diagnosis of single-variate systems using a wavelet-based pattern recognition technique	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							EASTMAN CHALLENGE PROCESS; NEURAL NETWORKS; REPRESENTATION; INDUCTION; KNOWLEDGE; TRENDS; MODELS; PLANT	A pattern recognition-based methodology is presented for fault diagnosis of a single-variate and dynamic system. A group of wavelet coordinates discriminating the classes of events most efficiently among other wavelet coordinates are determined according to the linear discriminant basis (LDB) method and a principal component analysis (PCA) technique. The proposed feature extractor couples the LDB method with the double wavelet packet tree in order to determine the best configuration of pattern windows causing the most discrimination among classes. The lifting scheme-based wavelet filters are used so that the required computation time is reduced significantly without degrading the robustness of the method. To reduce the size of the feature space, the wavelet coordinates are projected into a new low-dimensional space, by using a PCA technique, where minimum correlation exists among the new space variables. The tuning of some parameters, which affect the performance of the approach, is also discussed. The feature classifier is a binary decision tree that employs a soft-thresholding scheme for recognition of a noisy input pattern. The performance of the proposed technique is examined by a classification benchmark problem, and the faults classification problems for the Tennessee Eastman process. It is observed that the proposed pattern recognition methodology succeeds satisfactorily to classify the noisy input pattern into the known classes of events.

The purpose of this study was to validate a new in vitro test of virulence based on a plaque-forming assay (PFA) using a HT-29 cell monolayer with 118 Listeria strains. The use of HT-29 cells in 96-well tissue culture plates allowed the testing of 30 strains per day and providing results in 24 h. In addition, statistical analyses demonstrated the reproducibility and repeatability of the PFA. No quantitative relationship was observed between the virulence of the strains and the hemolytic titer or the cytotoxic effects on HT-29 cells. In contrast, good agreement was observed between virulence assessed after subcutaneous (SC) infection and virulence obtained by PFA. Three groups of L. monocytogenes strains (avirulent, hypovirulent and fully virulent) were established by comparison of the clinical origin of the strains, the number of immunocompetent contaminated mice and the numbers of Listeria strains recovered in the spleen after SC infection. With one exception, i.e. a clinical case of L. seeligeri (sensitivity 0.98), the PFA successfully detected the virulent strains only (specificity 1). Decision-tree algorithms performed by SAS and S-Plus demonstrated that this tissue culture assay discriminated between the avirulent and hypovirulent strains and the virulent strains.

J	Chau, KW; Chen, W				Chau, KW; Chen, W			An example of expert system on numerical modelling system in coastal processes	ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE			English	Article						coastal water process; expert system; knowledge base; numerical modelling; object-oriented programming technique; production rule	FLOW	With the advent of artificial intelligence technology as well as the widespread popularity of desktop microcomputers in recent years, integration of this new technology with the traditional numerical modelling system becomes a current trend in order to solve various engineering problems. It renders a more intelligent and user-friendly system on the problem domain. In this paper, a knowledge-based expert system on numerical modelling system for coastal water processes is delineated. Expert system application, as a key branch of artificial intelligence technology, is integrated with traditional numerical modelling for simulating flow and water quality phenomenon in coastal waters. The knowledge bases are classified into five major types, namely, a variety of models, relations between various model parameters and real physical conditions, feasible options of model parameters, question base as a user-interface directing the user to depict the actual physical conditions, and the rules of inference deducing the feasible choice of model and its parameters. A hybrid expert system shell, Visual Rule Studio, is employed as an ActiveX Designer under Microsoft Visual Basic environment because it combines the advantages of both production rules and object-oriented programming technology. Both forward chaining and backward chaining are used collectively during the inference process, which is mainly driven by premises and conditions with the highest factors of confidence. The inference engine will drive the decision tree to explore the most probable option of numerical model and parameters matching the real problem specifications. It is shown that the application and integration of the knowledge-based expert system technology into numerical modelling for coastal processes can provide substantial assistance to novice users for selection of numerical model as well as parameters.

J	Perner, P				Perner, P			Improving the accuracy of decision tree induction by feature preselection	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							FEATURE-SELECTION	Selecting the right set of features for classification is one of the most important problems in designing a good classifier. Decision tree induction algorithms such as C4.5 have incorporated in their learning phase an automatic feature selection strategy, while some other statistical classification algorithms require the feature subset to be selected in a preprocessing phase. It is well known that correlated and irrelevant features may degrade the performance of the C4.5 algorithm. In our study, we evaluated the influence of feature preselection on the prediction accuracy of C4.5 using a real-world data set. We observed that accuracy of the C4.5 classifier could be improved with an appropriate feature preselection phase for the learning algorithm. Beyond that, the number of features used for classification can be reduced, which is important for image interpretation tasks since feature calculation is a time-consuming process.

J	Song, A; Ciesielski, V; Rogers, P				Song, A; Ciesielski, V; Rogers, P			Vision system development by machine learning: Mashing assessment in brewing	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							ALGORITHMS; SELECTION	This article describes the development of a machine vision application for automatic process assessment by image analysis and machine learning. The system is required to differentiate between the various stages of a mashing process and determine the termination point. A large number of histograms, Haralick and Gabor features (835) were extracted from 275 training images. Three feature selection algorithms-wrapper, consistency filter, and correlation filter-were then applied to the training data, resulting in feature sets of size 29, 15, and 11, respectively. A number of decision tree, rule induction, and nearest neighbor classification algorithms were then applied to the reduced data set. For discriminating seven stages of the mashing process, the highest accuracy obtained was 71.6%. For the binary problem of differentiating the finished state from all of the other states the accuracy was 92.0%. This accuracy is good enough for deployment. The results indicate that using a large library of features and machine-learning methods for removing redundant features can significantly reduce development times for vision systems by eliminating the time-consuming manual search for the best discriminating features.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dose and its interaction with known prognostic variables, including pretreatment prostate specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score (GS), and T classification, on patients with nonmetastatic prostate carcinoma treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) alone using recursive partitioning analysis. METHODS. Between November 1987 and November 1997, 939 patients with nonmetastatic prostate carcinoma were treated with 3DCRT alone at Fox Chase Cancer Center. Biochemical no evidence of disease (bNED) control was defined using the American Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology Consensus definition. Recursive partitioning analysis was used to identify subgroups with similar risks of bNED failure. Prognostic factors used in the model included pretreatment PSA, GS, T classification, and radiation dose. The median follow-up was 47 months (range, 2-133 months). RESULTS. Twelve terminal nodes of the decision tree were merged to form four prognostic groups with similar bNED control rates. The 5-year actuarial rates of bNED control rates for Groups I, II, III, and IV were 84%, 41%, 16%, and 67%, respectively (P < 0.0001). Increasing the dose to greater than 7235 centigray (cGy) improved bNED control rates for patients with PSA levels of 10-19.9 ng/mL and T1/2a classification disease. Increasing the dose to greater than 7629 cGy improved bNED control rates for patients with T2b/3 classification disease with PSA levels less than 20 ng/mL. Patients with PSA levels greater than or equal to 20 ng/mL need high-dose 3DCRT. For those patients with GS 2-6 and T1/2a classification disease, treatment with greater than 7400 cGy resulted in 67% bNED control rate versus 16% at 5 years for treatment with less than 7400 cGy. High radiation dose (> 7700 cGy) improved bNED control rate from 16% to 41% for patients with high-risk disease (PSA 20 ng/mL and GS 7-10) at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS, The authors showed that with recursive partitioning techniques radiation dose continues to be an important predictor of bNED control rate and that a radiation dose response for patients with clinically localized prostate carcinoma exists. Patients with one or more prognostic feature (PSA > 10 ng/mL, classification T2b/T3, GS 7-10, or the presence of perineural invasion) achieve similar rates of bNED control compared with those patients with lower volume disease when radiation dose is increased.

One approach for disaggregation revolves around the de-convolution of the soil-landscape paradigm elaborated during a soil survey. The descriptions of soil ma units and block diagrams in a soil survey report detail soil-landscape relationships or soil toposequences that can be used to disaggregate map units into component landscape elements. Toposequences can be visualised on a computer by combining soil maps with digital elevation data. Expert knowledge or statistics can be used to implement the disaggregation. Use of a restructuring element and k-means clustering are illustrated. Another approach to disaggregation uses training areas to develop rules to extrapolate detailed mapping into other, larger areas where detailed mapping is unavailable. A two-level decision tree example is presented. At one level, the decision tree method is used to capture mapping rules from the training area; at another level, it is used to define the domain over which those rules can be extrapolated.

J	Muchoney, D; Williamson, J				Muchoney, D; Williamson, J			A Gaussian adaptive resonance theory neural network classification algorithm applied to supervised land cover mapping using multitemporal vegetation index data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							AVHRR DATA SET; MULTIDIMENSIONAL MAPS; COMPOSITE IMAGES; CLASSIFIERS; MODELS; PARAMETERIZATION; IMPLEMENTATION; NOAA/AVHRR; AMERICA; SYSTEM	Neural network classifiers have been shown to provide supervised classification results that significantly improve on traditional classification algorithms such as the Bayesian (maximum likelihood [ML]) classifier. While the predominant neural network architecture has been the feedforward multilayer perceptron known as backpropagation, Adaptive resonance theory (ART) neural networks offer advantages to the classification of optical remote sensing data for vegetation and land cover mapping. A significant advantage is that it does not require prior specification of the neural net structure, creating as many internal nodes as are needed to represent the calibration (training) data. The Gaussian ARTMAP classification algorithm bases the probability that input training samples belong to specific classes on the parameters of its Gaussian distributions: the means, standard deviations, and a priori probabilities. The performance of the Gaussian ARTMAP classification algorithm in terms of classification accuracy using independent validation data indicated was over 70% accurate when applied to an annual series of monthly 1-km advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. The accuracies were comparable to those of fuzzy ARTMAP and a univariate decision tree, and significantly higher than a Bayesian classification algorithm. Algorithm testing is based on calibration and validation data developed and applied to Central America to map the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) land cover classification system. Thus, it provides a realistic test of the algorithms for operational classification of a regional remote sensing and site dataset.

We propose a new method that applies the classical optimization technique, dynamic programming, to a decision-tree pruning procedure. We show that the proposed method generates a sequence of pruned trees that are optimal with respect to tree size. The dynamic-programming-based pruning (DPP) algorithm is then compared with cost-complexity pruning (CCP) in an experimental study. The results of our study indicate that DPP performs better than CCP in terms of classification accuracy.

In our experiments we tested various methods for building univariate decision trees in order to find the best induction strategy. On a hard real world problem of the Orthopaedic fracture data with 2637 cases, described by 23 attributes and a decision with three possible values, we built decision trees with four classical approaches, one hybrid approach where we combined neural networks and decision trees, and with an evolutionary approach. The results show that ail approaches had problems with either accuracy, sensitivity, or decision tree size. The comparison shows that the best compromise in hard real world problem decision trees building is the evolutionary approach. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

PPT has significant morbidity and can be predicted prenatally by the presence of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody. Our objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of screening pregnant women for the TPO antibody versus the current strategy of no screening test or an alternative strategy of a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test 6 weeks postpartum. We performed cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision tree model that accounted for cases of PPT detected, medical outcomes of screening, and costs of screening and care. Hypothetical cohorts of 1000 pregnant women with uncomplicated pregnancies and 1000 pregnant women with IDDM were used to determine direct medical costs, quality-adjusted life years, and cases of PPT detected. The cost of testing 1000 pregnant women for TSH at the 6 week postpartum visit was $75,000, with an effectiveness of 995.2 quality-adjusted life years resulting in a cost-effectiveness ratio of $48,000 per quality-adjusted life year. Checking a TPO antibody was more effective (995.5 quality-adjusted life years) but also more expensive ($93,000). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the TPO antibody strategy was $60,000 per quality-adjusted life year. Results were most sensitive to changes in the test characteristics, incidence of disease, and percentage of women with PPT who were symptomatic. A separate analysis for women with IDDM resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $13,000 per quality-adjusted life year for the TSH strategy and $32,000 per quality-adjusted life year for the TPO strategy.

J	Murphy, CK				Murphy, CK			Identifying diagnostic errors with induced decision trees	MEDICAL DECISION MAKING			English	Article						induced decision trees; artificial neural networks; breast cancer; computer-assisted diagnosis	NEURAL NETWORKS; EXPERT SYSTEMS; BREAST	Objective. The purpose of this article is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of induced decision trees with that of pruned neural networks and to improve the accuracy and interpretation of breast cancer diagnosis from readings of thin-needle aspirate by identifying cases likely to be misclassified by induced decision rules. Method. Using an online database consisting of 699 cases of suspected breast cancer and their corresponding readings of fine-needle aspirate, decision trees were induced from half of the cases, randomly selected. Accuracy was determined for the remaining cases in successive partitions. The pattern of errors in the multiple decision trees was examined, A smaller data set was created with 2 classes: (2) correctly classified and (2)misclassified by a decision tree, rather than the original benign and malignant classes. From this data set, decision trees that describe the misclassified cases were induced. Results. Larger, less severely pruned decision trees were more accurate in breast cancer diagnosis for both training and test data. The accuracy of the induced decision trees exceeded that reported for the smaller pruned neural networks. Combining classifications from 2 trees was effective in identifying malignancies missed by a single tree. Induced decision trees were able to identify patterns associated with misclassified cases, but the identification of errors inductively did not improve the overall error rate. Conclusion. In this application, a model that is too compact identifies fewer cases of the minority class, malignancy. New methods that combine models and examine classification errors can improve diagnosis by identifying more malignancies and by describing ambiguous cases.

J	Estes, AC; Frangopol, DM				Estes, AC; Frangopol, DM			Minimum expected cost-oriented optimal maintenance planning for deteriorating structures: application to concrete bridge decks	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						deteriorating structures; cost-based optimal maintenance; inspection/repair planning; probability; updating		Civil engineering structures are designed to serve the public and often must perform safely for decades. No matter how well they are designed, all civil engineering structures will deteriorate over time and lifetime maintenance expenses represent a substantial portion of the total lifetime cost of most structures. It is difficult to make a reliable prediction of this cost when the future is unknown and structural deterioration and behavior are assumed from a mathematical model or previous experience. An optimal maintenance program is the key to making appropriate decisions at the right time to minimize cost and maintain an appropriate level of safety. This study proposes a probabilistic framework for optimizing the timing and the type of maintenance over the expected useful life of a deteriorating structure. A decision tree analysis is used to develop an optimum lifetime maintenance plan which is updated as inspections occur and more data is available. An estimate which predicts cost and behavior over many years must be refined and reoptimized as new information becomes available. This methodology is illustrated using a half-cell potential test to evaluate a deteriorating concrete bridge deck. The study includes the expected life of the structure, the expected damage level of the structure, costs of inspection and specific repairs, interest rates, the capability of the test equipment to detect a flaw, and the management approach of the owner towards making repairs.

J	Akbaryan, F; Bishnoi, PR				Akbaryan, F; Bishnoi, PR			Fault diagnosis of multivariate systems using pattern recognition and multisensor data analysis technique	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						fault diagnosis; pattern recognition; multisensor data analysis	EASTMAN CHALLENGE PROCESS; NEURAL NETWORKS; REPRESENTATION; CLASSIFICATION; INDUCTION; KNOWLEDGE; TRENDS; MODELS; PLANT	A pattern recognition-based methodology is proposed for fault diagnosis of multivariate and dynamic systems. Noisy input patterns, belonging to a class of event(s), are first scaled to unit variance and zero mean. This step, termed as a harmonizing step, reduces magnitude difference amongst patterns belonging to a class of event(s). Existence of low frequency segments, such as ramp-type trends, in a pattern hampers the efficacy of the harmonizing step. In this work, a digital band-pass filter is designed to eliminate the ramp-type segments and decrease noise intensity. Then, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique is applied in order to describe the information space by a Set Of Uncorrelated and fictitious data sources. A wavelet-based methodology is employed for each new sensor to extract pattern features. A binary decision tree is used to classify the extracted features. The outputs of each decision tree are: (1) the a posteriori probabilities that an unlabeled input pattern belongs to different classes of events; and (2) the probability confidence limits that input pattern may be classified to any of known classes. As the last step, any of two consensus theory-based techniques or evidence theory are utilized to combine the outputs of the decision trees and find the best classes of events describing system behavior. The performance of the proposed technique is examined by diagnosis of simulated faulty behavior for the Tennessee Eastman Process. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Niimi, A; Tazaki, E				Niimi, A; Tazaki, E			Combined method of genetic programming and association rule algorithm	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								Genetic programming (GP) usually has a wide search space and a high flexibility. Therefore, GP may search for global optimum solution. But, in general, GPs learning speed is not so fast. An apriori algorithm is one of association rule algorithms. It can be applied to a large database. But it is difficult to define its parameters without experience. We propose a rule generation technique from a database using GP combined with an association rule algorithm. It takes rules generated by the association rule algorithm as initial individual of GP. The learning speed of GP is improved by the combined algorithm. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we apply it to the decision tree construction problem from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine-learning repository, and rule disco very problem from the occurrence of the hypertension database. We compare the results of the proposed method with prior ones.

J	Chau, KW; Chen, W				Chau, KW; Chen, W			A fifth generation numerical modelling system in coastal zone	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING			English	Article							EXPERT-SYSTEM	Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) technology is gradually integrated into the numerical modelling system to make the system more intelligent and more user-friendly. The characteristics of the fifth generation numerical modelling are connected with Al applications. The expert system technology as a widely applied Al technology is integrated into our modelling system for coastal water processes with traditional numerical computational tools and the data and graphical pre-processing and post-processing techniques. Five kinds of knowledge bases are built in the system to describe the existing expertise knowledge about model parameters, relations between parameters and physical conditions, various possible selections for parameters and rules of inference. The inference engine is designed to be driven by the confidence of correctness, and the rule base is built with the factor of confidence to link the various relations. The decision tree is designed to drive the inference engine to explore the route of selection procedure of modeling. The decision tree depends on the real problem specifications and can be modified during the dialogue between the system and the user. The forward chaining and backward chaining inference techniques are mixed together in the system to help matching the parameters in the model and the possible selections with sufficiently high confidence. The expert system technology is successfully integrated into the system to provide help for model parameter selection or model selection, and to make the numerical model system more accessible for non-expert users.

J	Major, RL; Ragsdale, CT				Major, RL; Ragsdale, CT			Aggregating expert predictions in a networked environment	COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article						distributed processing; discriminant analysis; two-group classification	NEURAL NETWORKS	This paper describes an approach for combining the classifications or predictions of n local experts into a single composite prediction. We describe a Java-based application that allows a user to Select UP to n prediction experts that provide information for assigning an object to one of two predetermined groups. An advantage of this type of application is that it is capable of interacting with the Internet in a relatively seamless way. We examine the accuracy and robustness of our technique by comparing the classification accuracy of our technique,, a maximum entropy-based aggregation technique, and four classification methods on a real-world, two-group data-set concerned with bank failure prediction. The classificaiton methods studied in this work include Quinlan's C4.5 decision-tree classifier, logistic regression, mahalanobis distance measures, and a neural network classifier. Our model includes a fundamental component (i.e., a transaction manager) that helps improve the general performance of applications that perform network-based classification. This component is found to provide reliable and secure connections along with ways to direct traffic across the Internet. Our results suggest three major contributions: (1) a transaction manager increases the flexibility of a network-based classifier since it is capable of transacting with one or more specific types of prediction expert(s) over the Internet; (2) our approach tends to be more accurate than the individual classification methods we examined; and, (3) our approach can outperform a recently introduced statistically based aggregation technique.

J	Wang, ML				Wang, ML			A flexible knowledge discovery system using genetic programming and logic grammars	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						knowledge discovery in databases; genetic programming; logic grammars; fuzzy Petri nets		As the computing world moves from the information age into the knowledge-based age, it is beneficial to induce knowledge from the information superhighway formed from the Internet and intranet. The knowledge acquired can be expressed in different knowledge representations such as computer programs, first-order logical relations, or fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs). In this paper, we present a flexible knowledge discovery system called generic genetic programming (GGP) that applies genetic programming (GP) and logic grammars to learn knowledge in various knowledge representation formalisms. An experiment is performed to demonstrate that GGP can discover knowledge represented in FPNs that support fuzzy and approximate reasoning. To evaluate the performance of GGP in producing good FPNs, the classification accuracy of the FPN induced by GGP and that of the decision tree generated by C4.5 are compared. Moreover, the performance of GGP in inducing logic programs from noisy examples is evaluated. A detailed comparison to FOIL, a system that induces logic programs, has been conducted. These experiments demonstrate that GGP is a promising alternative to other knowledge discovery systems and sometimes is superior for handling noisy and inexact data. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Son, NH				Son, NH			On efficient handling of continuous attributes in large data bases	FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE			English	Article							DISCRETIZATION	Some data mining techniques, like discretization of continuous attributes or decision tree induction, are based on searching for an optimal partition of data with respect to some optimization criteria. We investigate the problem of searching for optimal binary partition of continuous attribute domain in case of large data sets stored in relational data bases (RDB). The critical for time complexity of algorithms solving this problem is the number of I/O database operations necessary to construct such partitions. In our approach the basic operators are defined by queries on the number of objects characterized by means of real value intervals of continuous attributes. We assume the answer time for such queries does not depend on the interval length. The straightforward approach to the optimal partition selection (with respect to a given measure) requires O(N) basic queries, where N is the number of preassumed partition parts in the searching space. We show properties of the basic optimization measures making possible to reduce the size of searching space. Moreover, we prove that using only O(log N) simple queries, one can construct a partition very close to optimal.

The three major steps are rule extraction, gradient descent tuning of the rule-base, and performance-based pruning of the rule-base. Pruning removes all rules which cannot meet a certain level of performance. To test our scheme, we have used the DT generated by RID3, an ID3-type classifier for real data. In this process, we made some improvements of RID3 to get a tree with less redundancy and hence a smaller rule-base. The rule-base is tested on several data sets and is found to demonstrate an excellent performance. Results obtained by the proposed scheme are consistently better than C4.5 across several data sets.

These include root preparation to remove toxins and altered cementum, space creation by the graft or membrane barrier for migration of progenitor cells, stabilization and flap coverage of the graft, and use of a membrane barrier or enamel matrix derivative (EMD). This article reviews the literature supporting this concept and presents a clinical decision tree to determine when to use EMD alone or with autogenous grafts and membrane barriers in the treatment of defects of varying morphologies.

Routine methods of feed preparation, storage and delivery to patients were studied and a flow chart was initially made. After identifying hazards, an HACCP team was assembled, a flow chart was modified and critical control points were defined using a decision tree. Control measures for each step of the process and its monitoring and corrective measures to be applied were also defined. In addition, feed samples were analysed for microbiological quality and feed storage temperatures were also recorded, before and after the implementation of the HACCP system. When the control measures were applied and monitored, the hazard was reduced. Bacterial counts in feed were reduced from 10(5) cfu mL(-1) to < 10(1) cfu mL(-1). The results show that contamination of enteral feed may be reduced or eliminated if a systematic approach such as HACCP is applied effectively.

J	Beltran, CM; Belmonte, AC				Beltran, CM; Belmonte, AC			Irrigated crop area estimation using Landsat TM imagery in La Mancha, Spain	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							CONFUSION MATRICES; COVER	A methodology for supervised classification to identify irrigated crops with Landsat TM imagery in a semiarid zone (La Mancha, Spain) is presented. The discrimination procedure is based on the different crop spectral responses through time according to their phenological evolution. Our multitemporal supervised classification includes maximum-likelihood algorithms, decision-tree criteria, and context classifiers. We have applied the procedure to two sets of scenes obtained for the growing seasons of 1996 and 1997, respectively. The resulting classification accuracy was 93.1 percent for 1996 and 90.21 percent for 1997. We have estimated the areas occupied by each crop class by means of intersecting the nw-derived land-use roster map and the digital rural cadastre vector map in a geographic information system. We have assessed the accuracy of the crop area estimation from the classified image by comparing these areas with those calculated from the digital rural cadastre. A median filter applied to the final classification improves the agreement of the estimated crop areas with the cadastre data. Additional post-classification methods to correct crop areas did not bring any significant further improvements. Therefore, we conclude that the context classifier is a useful and sufficient tool to improve surface quantification.

To gain this understanding, resource professionals need efficient and cost-effective data collection methods that can operate over vast and isolated landscapes. We compared three Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)/Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) methods of fire detection and mapping for a case study in northern Ontario, Canada, of the 1992, 1993, and 1995 fire seasons. Fire mapping accuracy was assessed by the spatial coincidence between mapped fires and ground-truthed information using a decision-tree approach and by testing the hypothesis that various calculated accuracy components were equal within an ANOVA design. Ground-truthed fire sizes and shapes were correlated with the AVHRR/NDVI-mapped areas; however, light cloud contamination increased false detection of fires due to NDVI suppression. The multiple threshold technique of change detection provided better estimates of fire areas than did single threshold methods. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Pedrycz, W; Sosnowski, ZA				Pedrycz, W; Sosnowski, ZA			The design of decision trees in the framework of granular data and their application to software quality models	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						decision trees; fuzzy sets; context-based clustering; software engineering; software measures; software quality	FUZZY	In this study, we discuss the role of fuzzy sets regarded as a comprehensive algorithmic vehicle supporting the design of decision trees. Fuzzy sets help convert continuous attributes into discrete landmarks-fuzzy sets are afterwards exploited as the basic constructs in the optimization of a decision tree. The concept of fuzzy granulation realized via context-based clustering is aimed at the quantization (discretization) process. In contrast to so-called fuzzy decision trees, we enhance the development methodology of binary (Boolean) decision trees rather than generalizing them to the form of fuzzy constructs. Afterwards we solve the problem of quantifying complexity of software systems in the framework of decision trees. The advantages of this approach to quantitative software engineering are discussed in detail. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the design methodology and provide a better insight into the algorithmic details as well as limitations of the decision trees approach.

In a linear multivariate decision tree, each decision node divides the input space into two with a hyperplane. In a nonlinear multivariate tree, a multilayer perceptron at each node divides the input space arbitrarily, at the expense of increased complexity and higher risk of overfitting. We propose omnivariate trees where the decision node may be univariate, linear, or nonlinear depending on the outcome of comparative statistical tests on accuracy thus matching automatically the complexity of the node with the subproblem defined by the data reaching that node. Such an architecture frees the designer from choosing the appropriate node type, doing model selection automatically at each node. Our simulation results indicate that such a decision tree induction method generalizes better than trees with the same types of nodes everywhere and induces small trees.

This so-called belief decision tree is a new classification method adapted to uncertain data. We will be concerned with the construction of the belief decision tree from a training set where the knowledge about the instances' classes is represented by belief functions, and its use for the classification of new instances where the knowledge about the attributes' values is represented by belief functions.

Methods: A decision tree for the initial management of a child older than age 6 months, presenting with idiopathic thrombocytopenia, without blasts on the peripheral smear was construe ted. The three strategies are: 1) initial BMA in all patients; 2) initial BMA only in patients at high risk; and 3) empiric therapy for all patients without initial BMA. High-risk criteria include any of: platelet count >50 x 10(9)/L; hemoglobin <100g/L (age younger than 12 months) or <110g/L (age older than 12 months); white blood cell count <5 x 10(9)/L (younger than 6 years) or <4 x 10(9)/L (older than 6 years); or absolute neutrophil count <1.5 x 10(9)/L (younger than 6 years) or <2 x 10(9)/L (older than 6 years). The results are expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), a measure that estimates the overall life expectancy in years for patients receiving a particular treatment strategy, corrected for the patient's quality of life. Results: The base case results are: 1) BMA all = 69.649 QALYs; 2) high-risk BMA = 69.652 QALYs; and 3) empiric therapy = 69.644 QALYs. These results indicate a three-way toss-up because there is less than a 4-day quality-adjusted difference (0.01) between strategies. Conclusion: This study indicates that the initial BMA does not significantly change the overall QALYs of a child presenting with thrombocytopenia and, consequently, is not mandatory in every patient before starting steroids.

The use of expected value decision analysis offers an explicit, consistent, and structured means to assist the clinician in determining which stabilization technique to utilize. Decision analysis reveals that the surgical technique that is favored for a given patient depends on the value that the patient assigns to various potential outcomes following surgery, the perioperative morbidity of each of the two procedures, and the surgeon's probability of success with either technique.

Thin sections of mineral samples are photographed digitally using a computer-controlled rotating polarizer stage on a petrographic microscope. A suite of image processing functions is applied to the images. Filtered image data for identified mineral grains is then selected for use as training data for a genetic programming system, which automatically synthesizes computer programs that identify these grains. The evolved programs use a decision-tree structure that compares the mineral image values with one other, resulting in a thresholding analysis of the multi-dimensional colour and textural space of the mineral images.

To estimate the episodic costs of surgical treatments for breast cancer. METHODS. The surgical treatment period as the 6 weeks following diagnosis is defined. Using a sample of 205 women aged 65 and older and their Medicare claim files, the cost of treatment is estimated and the progression from first to subsequent surgical procedures during the 6-week interval is demonstrated with a decision tree. Two equations are then estimated: the probability of mastectomy versus breast conserving surgery (BCS) as first surgery using Probit regression and the log of total charges using a generalized linear regression model. RESULTS. It was found that only stage predicts the probability of mastectomy versus BCS and that 54% of women receiving BCS undergo a second surgery. Once all treatments in the initial surgical period are accounted, the difference between the adjusted cost of mastectomy alone and BCS followed by a second surgery was not statistically significant. Only a successful first BCS is statistically significantly (P < 0.05) less costly than a mastectomy alone ($4,955 vs. $9,049). CONCLUSIONS. By defining a 6-week surgical treatment episode it is shown that BCS followed by subsequent surgeries is the more costly option for initial treatment. Given the high prevalence of second surgeries, previous work may have underestimated the costs of surgical interventions for breast cancer.

J	Reuveni, H; Schweitzer, E; Tarasiuk, A				Reuveni, H; Schweitzer, E; Tarasiuk, A			A cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative at-home or in-laboratory technologies for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome	MEDICAL DECISION MAKING			English	Article						sleep apnea; polysomnography; unattended sleep monitoring; cost analysis	BREATHING DISORDERS; DEVICE	Background, Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common disorder that affects 2% to 9% of the population, Health care policymakers have noted increased referrals for sleep studies. Objective. In this article, the authors conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to determine the optimal technology for the diagnosis of OSAS using polysomnography (PSG) or partial sleep monitoring (PSM). Design. The target population was a hypothetical cohort of patients suspected of having OSAS. A 2-level decision tree was formulated that reflects all possible steps of OSAS diagnosis and therapy. The method represents a comprehensive strategy to determine which of the 2 systems-PSG or PSM-has cost advantages. The financial and operational aspects of OSAS diagnosis and therapy were analyzed. A sensitivity analysis was performed over all uncertain parameters (i.e., diagnostic agreement, data loss, and referral to therapy). Results. Unattended at-home sleep monitoring was the most expensive method. The combination of 1:2 PSG and attended PSM strategy was the optimal strategy width respect to financing and operations. Compared to the PSG-only strategy this combination may lead to a 10% reduction of the annual expenditure. Conclusion. This study provides proof of concept (under a wide range of sensitivity assumptions) that the cost of sleep study techniques can be modeled. It rejects the assumption that at home portable sleep monitoring is cost advantageous. The combination of PSG and attended PSM OSAS is the most cost-effective approach to sleep evaluation.

This paper presents the application of an ID3 algorithm in knowledge acquisition for the tolerance design of injection-molded parts. The overall structure of a knowledge-based system for tolerance design is briefly illustrated. After a classification of factors that influence tolerance has been made, some key attributes for collecting knowledge cases are studied through fuzzy representation and processing. The detailed procedure of utilizing an ID3 algorithm for tolerance-related knowledge acquisition is introduced, including calculating the information gain measure (entropy) and generating the final decision tree. The method can be easily applied to other engineering areas and the result has great value in practice. The advantages and disadvantages of this method are discussed in Section 5.

J	Andersson, M				Andersson, M			Relatedness and the evolution of conspecific brood parasitism	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						host-parasite relatedness; inclusive fitness; female philopatry; kin discrimination; cooperative breeding; decision-tree model	INTRASPECIFIC NEST PARASITISM; VISCOUS POPULATIONS; BUCEPHALA-CLANGULA; BIRDS; PATTERNS; DUCKS; COSTS; HOST; AMALGAMATION; CONSEQUENCES	In conspecific brood parasitism (CBP), a parasitic female takes advantage of the parental care performed by a host female by laying eggs in the nest of the host. The host female raises the offspring of the parasitic female as well as her own. In species where local females are related, direct costs for the host might be more than compensated for by gains in inclusive fitness through increased reproduction of a related parasite, but the role of relatedness in CBP is debated. This inclusive-fitness model of parasitism, structured as a game between host and parasite, suggests that both females can gain inclusive fitness and that host-parasite relatedness can therefore facilitate the evolution of CBP. Crucial assumptions are that there is kin discrimination and a potential for host resistance to parasitism by unrelated females but close relatives are accepted. The cost of parasitism in terms of reduced clutch size or offspring survival for the host must not be large; otherwise, parasitism will reduce her inclusive fitness. Therefore, if these costs are high, it does not benefit a host to accept a parasite, even if the parasite is closely related. The secondary female may still have higher fitness from parasitism, but if the costs are high, she should parasitize an unrelated host, not a relative. This requires that the reduction in parasite success that a host can cause by resistance is not too large; otherwise, it will be better for the secondary female to parasitize an accepting related host or to nest solitarily. For these reasons, host-parasite relatedness is most likely to occur in animals where costs of being parasitized are low and host resistance can markedly reduce the success of an unrelated parasite. When costs are higher, parasitism of unrelated hosts may be better, and if host resistance strongly reduces parasite success, solitary breeding is preferable. In some cases, CBP is directly advantageous for the host, and it may sometimes evolve in close connection with cooperative breeding, which is also considered in the model.

The map is needed as part of a larger ecosystem assessment to help determine if bear movement and habitat use patterns are affected by changing landscape conditions and human activities. An Integrated Decision Tree Approach (IDTA) was developed that incorporated unsupervised (K-means) clustering, empirically-derived DEM- and GIS-based decision rules (proximity; slopes, etc.), and maximum likelihood supervised classification of forest and vegetation classes based on field sampling. This approach was based on an earlier finding, using a 1998 Landsat image in this area, that different classifiers performed at different levels of success in various classes. The map produced with the IDTA method was determined to be approximately 80% accurate (kappa = 0.783) using 494 randomly sampled points unambiguously identified on available digital orthophotography.

In a benchmark test, the SVM is compared to several machine learning techniques currently used in the field. The classification task involves predicting the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by pyrimidines, using data obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. Three artificial neural networks, a radial basis function network, and a C5.0 decision tree are all outperformed by the SVM. The SVM is significantly better than all of these, bar a manually capacity-controlled neural network, which takes considerably longer to train. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

High variance means that, for a given problem and sample size, the resulting tree is strongly dependent on the random nature of the particular sample used for training. Consequently, these algorithms tend to be suboptimal in terms of accuracy and interpretability. This paper analyses this problem in depth and proposes a new method, relying on threshold softening, able to significantly improve the bias/variance tradeoff of decision trees. The algorithm is validated on a number of benchmark problems and its relationship with fuzzy decision tree induction is discussed. This sheds some light on the success of fuzzy decision tree induction and improves our understanding of machine learning, in general.

The viability of the yew population is described based on the results of an analysis of the current environmental state and a characterization of the ecological parameters of the English yew population. The most significant risk factors include man-induced damage (tree cuttings), deer (browsing, bark-peeling), tree competition and other environmental effects such as disease or fungi. Within the risk analysis, the viability effects of the conservation strategies are determined through a qualitative assessment of the probability of a decrease of the yew population along with various environmental scenarios. A strategy combining silvicultural measurements to increase growth of the yew crowns and measures to increase public awareness seems to be the most effective. The probability of survival increases by 75-95% using this strategy as compared to the mere inclusion in a natural forest reserve. The conservational use of population viability analysis techniques within the formal process of population viabilty risk management is discussed.

J	Sivanandam, SN; Shanmugam, A; Sumathi, S; Usha, K				Sivanandam, SN; Shanmugam, A; Sumathi, S; Usha, K			Development of soft computing models for data mining	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND MATERIALS SCIENCES			English	Article							DECISION TREES; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	The increasing amount and complexity of today's data available in science, business, industry and many other areas creates an urgent need to accelerate discovery of knowledge in large databases. Such data cart provide a rich resource for knowledge discovery and decision support, To understand, analyze and eventually use this data, a multidisciplinary approach called data mining has been proposed. Technically, data mining is the process of finding correlation or patterns among dozens of fields in large relational databases. Pattern classification is one particular category of data mining, which enables the discovery of knowledge from very large databases (VLDB). In this paper, mining the database through pattern classification has been done by utilizing two important mining tools called K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm and Decision trees. The K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) is the popularly used conventional statistical approach for data mining. K-NN is a technique that classifies each record in a data set based on a combination of the classes of K-records most similar to it in a historical data set. The fuzzy version of K-NN, crisp and fuzzy versions of nearest prototype classifiers have also been proposed. Decision tree is one of the best machine learning approaches for data mining. A decision tree is a predictive model that as its name implies, can be viewed as a tree. Briefly, decision trees are tree shaped structures that represent sets of decisions. These decisions generate rules for classification of a data set. Classification and Regression Tree (CART), ID3 are the two decision tree methods used in this paper. The classification rules have been extracted in the form of IF THEN rules. The performance analysis of K-NN methods and tree-based classifiers has been done. The proposed methods have been tested on three applications such as land sat imagery, letter image recognition and optical recognition of hand written digits data. The simulation algorithms have been implemented using C++ under UNIX platform.

Review of the literature and consultation with scientists in the field of microbiology, epidemiology, poultry pathology, chemistry, and meat inspection served to generate an inventory of GDACs, and a decision tree containing algorithms was developed to identify GDACs potentially representing a health hazard to consumers. Through the use of the decision tree, GDACs were classified into different categories with regard to the risk they represent to humans. A number of GDACs were identified as being of potential concern from a food safety perspective, namely Erysipelas, fowl cholera, Campylobacteriosis, clostridial diseases, hepatitis/enteritis associated with Helicobacter, Listeriosis; Salmonella infections (nontyphoid infections, Salmonella arizonae, pullorum disease, and fowl typhoid), Staphylococcosis, and Toxoplasmosis. Further characterization-i.e., hazard characterization, exposure assessment, and risk characterization-is required to quantify or better characterize the probability that products derived from affected carcasses may affect the consumer as well as the resulting consequences. Risk assessment is a dynamic process. Results presented in this paper are based on available information and expert opinion. As new information is obtained, the inventory of GDACs and their classification may be modified.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			Real options and probabilistic economics: Bridging the gap	JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2001 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition	SEP 30-OCT 03, 2001	NEW OLEANS, LOUISIANA	Soc Petr Engineers				Three approaches to economic evaluations that are widely discussed in the literature are decision trees, Monte Carlo simulation, and real options. It has been shown that incorporating decision-tree logic into a Monte Carlo simulation adds insight to the evaluation and can provide an even more realistic asset valuation by incorporating management decision making. While probabilistic economics (either decision trees or Monte Carlo simulations) and real options di significantly in the type and amount of input data, as well as the format and applicability of output, they both have the capability to capture some value of active decision making by management. This paper attempts to bridge the gap between the two approaches, at least conceptually.									0	0	0	SOC PETROLEUM ENG	RICHARDSON	222 PALISADES CREEK DR,, RICHARDSON, TX 75080 USA	0149-2136		J PETROL TECHNOL	J.

We have developed an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict biochemical failure that may benefit clinicians and patients choosing among the definitive treatment options for CAP. Materials and Methods: Clinical and pathologic data from 196 patients who had undergone RP at one institution between 1988 and 1999 were utilized. Twenty-one records were deleted because of missing outcome, Gleason sum, PSA, or clinical stage data. The variables from the 175 remaining records were analyzed for input variable selection using principal component analysis, decision tree analysis, and stepped logistic regression. The selected variables were age, PSA, primary and secondary Gleason grade, and Gleason sum. The records were randomized and split into three bootstrap training and validation sets of 140 records (80%) and 35 records (20%), respectively. Results: Forty-four percent of the patients suffered biochemical failure. The average duration of follow up was 2.5 years (range 0-11.5 years). Forty-two percent of the patients had pathologic evidence of non-organ-confined disease. The average area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for the validation sets was 0.75 +/- 0.07. The ANN with the highest area under the ROC curve (0.80) was used for prediction and had a sensitivity of 0.74, a specificity of 0.78, a positive predictive value of 0.71, and a negative predictive value of 0.81. Conclusion: These results suggest,that ANN models can predict PSA failure using readily available preoperative variables. Such predictive models may offer assistance to patients and physicians deciding on definitive therapy for CaP.
