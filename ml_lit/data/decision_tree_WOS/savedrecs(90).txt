The GD measure is based on Information Theory and allows to detect the interdependence between attributes. This measure is based on a quadratic form of the Mantaras distance and a matrix called Transinformation Matrix. In order to test the quality of the proposed measure, it is compared with other two feature selection methods, namely Mantaras distance and Relief algorithms. The comparison is done over 19 datasets along with three different induction algorithms.

An example of such a technique is optimal multisplitting of numerical attributes. Its efficiency is hit hard even by a single troublesome attribute in the domain. Analysis shows that there is a direct connection between the ratio of the numbers of boundary points and training examples and the maximum goodness score of a numerical attribute. Class distribution information from preprocessing can be applied to obtain tighter bounds for an attribute's relevance in class prediction. These analytical bounds, however, are too loose for practical purposes. We experiment with heuristic methods which postpone the evaluation of attributes that have a high number of boundary points. The results show that substantial time savings can be obtained in the most critical data sets without having to give up on the accuracy of the resulting classifier.

Specifically, we assess the requirements for interfacing tools to client-server database systems in view of the architecture of those systems and of "knowledge discovery processes". We introduce the concept of a query frontier of an exploratory process, and propose a strategy based on optimizing the current query frontier rather than individual knowledge discovery algorithms. This approach has the advantage of enhanced genericity and interoperability. We demonstrate a small set of query primitives, and show how one example tool, the well-known decision tree induction algorithm C4.5, can be rewritten to function in this environment.

In this paper we present an external method for this problem to improve performances of completion and especially declarativity and interactions with the user. Such qualities will allow to use it for the data cleaning step of the KDD1 process[6]. The core of this method, called MVC (Missing Values Completion), is the RAR(2) algorithm that we have proposed in [14]. This algorithm extends the concept of association rules[1] for databases with multiple missing values. It allows MVC to be an efficient preprocessing method: in our experiments with the c4.5[12] decision tree program, MVC has permitted to divide, up to two, the error rate in classification, independently of a significant gain of declarativity.

Our approach consists of an Agglomerative Clustering algorithm based on Information Divergence (ACID) to automatically design and robustly estimate Hierarchies of Neural Networks (HNN) for arbitrarily large sets of context-dependent decision tree clustered HMM states. We argue that a hierarchical approach is crucial in applying locally discriminative connectionist models to the typically very large state spaces observed in LVCSR systems. We evaluate the ACID/HNN framework on the Switchboard conversational telephone speech corpus. Furthermore, we focus on the benefits of the proposed connectionist acoustic model, namely exploiting the hierarchical structure for speaker adaptation and decoding speed-up algorithms.

In this paper, we will describe two applications of the senonic decision tree in (1) dynamically downsizing a speech recognition system for small platforms and in (2) sharing the Gaussian covariances of continuous density HMMs (CHMMs). We experimented how to balance different parameters that can offer the best trade off between recognition accuracy and system size. The dynamically downsized system, without retraining, performed even better than the regular Baum-Welch [1] trained system. The shared covariance model provided as good a performance as the unshared full model and thus gave us the freedom to increase the number of Gaussian means to increase the accuracy of the model. Combining the downsizing and covariance sharing algorithms, a total of 8% error reduction was achieved over the Baum-Welch trained system with approximately the same parameter size.

These phonetic questions are in fact phonetic categories such as vowels, plosives or fricatives. The assumption behind this is that context phonemes which belong to the same phonetic class have a similar influence on the pronunciation of a phoneme. For a new phoneme set, which has to be used e.g. when switching to a different corpus, a phonetic expert is needed to define proper phonetic questions. In this paper a new method is presented which automatically defines good phonetic questions for a phoneme set. This method uses the intermediate clusters from a phoneme clustering algorithm which are reduced to an appropriate number afterwards. Recognition results on the Wall Street Journal data for within-word and across-word phoneme models show competitive performance of the automatically generated questions with our best handcrafted question set.

We have assumed the silent state as a subset of the unvoiced class, except when both speakers are silent We have chosen a binary tree decision structure. Our feature set is a projection of a 37 dimensional feature vector onto a single dimension applied at each branch of the decision tree, using the Fisher linear discriminant We have produced co-channel speech from the TIMIT database which is used for training and testing. Preliminary results, at signal to interference ratio of 0 dB, have produced classification accuracy of 82.6%, 73.45%, and 68.24% on male/female, male/male and female/female mixtures respectively.

The algorithm first locates several feature points on the background skeleton of the digit image. Possible segmentation paths are then constructed by matching these feature points. With geometric property measures, these segmentation paths are ranked using fuzzy rules generated from a decision-tree approach. Finally, the top ranked segmentation paths are tested one by one by an optimized nearest neighbor classifier until one of these candidates is accepted based on an acceptance criterion. Experimental results on NIST special database 3 show that our approach can achieve a correct classification rate of 92.4% with only 4.7% of digit strings rejected, which compares favorably with the other techniques tested.

Based on all available track and sector data, a reasoning system determines a priority for each one of the possible tasks that need to be executed in each decision cycle through an inference process similar to that which would perform a human operator. This methodology allows to integrate high-level information in the decision process, not only numerical, considering its uncertainty and possibly being subjective. The formal method elected to represent the variables involved in this decision process is the theory of possibility and fuzzy sets, since it offers a unified framework to represent uncertainty knowledge. In this sense, to obtain the priority for each task the reasoning process relies on a decision tree whose nodes are linguistic variables that represent the intermediate concepts used by a human operator to define the task priority. The evaluation of this reasoning system has allowed to demonstrate the validity of this approximation to cope with the task management problem, since it has been able to infer environmental situations similar to those interpretations given by human operators. Results demonstrate how the importance of the tasks, measured through their time variable priority, allows the manager to adapt sensor operation to changing situations.

Here, we consider a decision tree construction. Tests are performed on a ViewCache generated from the relational operations on the base level tables. Branches are made for the values of the test to form subsets of the ViewCache. The leaves are labeled with the class names. Quinlan's ID3 algorithm for a proper selection of attributes at a particular level of the decision tree calculates the information gain for all such attributes and considers the one with the maximal gain. This requires multiple View materializations at a single level. So optimal View materialization is a concerning factor. When we are considering a parallel data server, the number of records in a ViewCache, may be skewed to a processor/s and the materialization at any tree-level/s will not exploit efficient parallelism. In this paper, we have developed a technique for normal distribution of "data packets" from an overloaded processor to its neighbouring processors at run-time. This normal distribution is implemented as a replication technique for small fractions of records and ViewCache partitions. At run-time, based on mutual agreements, task load can be shared between processors, to minimize the overall cost of materialization. We have given a bipartite graph representation of a ViewCache and posed the problem of optimal View Materialization as a problem of optimal traversal through the edges of the graph. Data packets for replication are well chosen subgraphs. This leads to a run-time solution for load balancing.

An investigation of the comprehensibility of the discovered patterns may benefit IS research as well. This paper attempts to identify some of the issues that such inquiry may face. Related findings and conclusions of four case studies focusing on applications of decision tree induction methods, are described. A discussion based on these studies suggests, among the rest, that. (1) The problem of comprehensibility is complicated by a complex context due to a diversity of problem-domain attributes, user and task characteristics, algorithmic methods, and concurrency of user goals. (2) Solutions to problems of discovered patterns that are not easy to interpret and validate may involve integration of available information technologies, and utilization of multiple information types and sources. (3) An investigation of comprehensibility issues may benefit from the adoption of multiple definitions in relation to this concept.

This measure is defined between an attribute set and a class and corresponds to a generalization of the Mantaras distance that allows to detect the interdependencies between attributes. In the same way, the proposed measure allows to order the attributes by importance in the definition of the concept. This measure does not exhibit a noticeable bias in favor of attributes with many values. The quality of the selected attributes using the GD measure is tested by means of different comparisons with other two attribute selection methods over 19 datasets.

Some algorithms can be slowed or their performance adversely affected by too much data-some of which may be irrelevant or redundant to the learning task. Feature subset selection, then, is a method for enhancing the performance of learning algorithms, reducing the hypothesis search space, and. in some cases, reducing the storage requirement. This paper describes a feature subset selector that uses a correlation based heuristic to determine the "goodness" of feature subsets, and evaluates its effectiveness with three common ML algorithms: a decision tree inducer (C4.5), a naive Bayes classifier, and an instance based learner (IB1). Experiments using a number of standard data sets drawn from real and artificial domains me presented. Feature subset selection gave significant improvement for all three algorithms; C4.5 generated smaller decision trees.

This paper describes a level-of-care decision-support tool and tests its reliability and concurrent validity. Methods: Panels of clinical managers and administrators of mental health centers developed a decision-support tool with eight levels of care and a computerized decision-tree algorithm for level-of-care placement. A random sample of 1,034 adults from one county mental health system were assessed by their case managers using a package that included variables in the eight-level model, but not the algorithm itself. Other variables were included to assess the tool's concurrent validity. Results: Level-of-care placements based on the decision-support tool showed strong interrater reliability. Concurrent validity was demonstrated by significant relationships in the expected direction between level of care and psychiatric hospitalizations, arrests, residential moves, homeless periods, residential independence, lack of work activity, medication noncompliance, and functioning as measured by the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale. Conclusions: Preliminary empirical evidence indicates that the level-of-care decision-support tool is reliable and valid. It could be further refined by incorporating the impact of social supports, collateral services, current mental health services, and motivation for services.

When this water comes from subterranean reservoirs (aquifers), the evaluation of extracted volumes is very complex using the traditional methods. The exploitation of subterranean waters in Spain has become, in some cases, an environmental problem since it has affected highly valuable wetlands and river flows by depressing the water table levels. In this work, we introduce a methodology based on Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques that allows to evaluate the extracted water volumes for irrigation, with high accuracy levels and relatively low economic costs. The developed system is based on the elaboration of crop maps that are obtained from the analysis of multitemporal Landsat TM images. The used procedure is a supervised classification of images that combines maximum likelihood algorithms and decision-tree criterions. The resulting data are integrated in a GIS and crossed with the values of water volumes needed per crop. The obtained output allows quantifying not only the spatial distribution of the water consumption, but also its evolution through time.

While decision trees give, in many cases, lower accuracy compared to feedforward neural networks, the latter show black-box behaviour, long training times, and difficulty to incorporate available knowledge. We propose to use an incrementally-generated recurrent fuzzy neural network which has the following advantages over feedforward neural network approach: ability to incorporate existing domain knowledge as well as to establish relationships from scratch, and shorter training time. The recurrent structure of the proposed method is able to account for temporal data changes in contrast to both both feedforward neural network and decision tree approaches. It can be viewed as a gray box which incorporates best features of both symbolic and numerical methods.

Data mining derives effective patterns and rules from a large amount of data to support the decision making process. Although various approaches have been attempted in some research fields, we focused on the visual data mining support system from the viewpoint of harnessing the perceptual and cognitive capabilities of the human user. In visual data mining support, defining the visualization model is important to obtain effective patterns. The main point of the definition is how to find useful data attributes as the visualization target. This paper proposes a visual data mining support system based on two key concepts: automatic target attribute selection method using a decision tree or correlation coefficient matrix and automatic scene definition generating methods. Application examples are presented and evaluated.

In this paper, we consider a range of criteria which may be applied to determine if some data should be segmented into two or regions. We develop a information theoretic criterion (MML) for the segmentation of univariate data with Gaussian errors. We perform simulations comparing segmentation methods (MML, AIC, MDL and BIG) and conclude that the MML criterion is the preferred criterion. We then apply the segmentation method to financial time series data.

It can be used to build decision trees as well as production rules. Production rules are a very common formalism for representing and using knowledge in many real-world domains. C4.5 generates production rules from raw trees. It has been shown that the set of production rules is usually both simpler and more accurate than the decision tree from which the ruleset was formed. This research shows that generating production rules from pruned trees usually results in significantly simpler rulesets than generating rules from raw trees. This reduction in complexity is achieved without reducing prediction accuracies. Furthermore, the new approach uses significantly less induction time than the latter. This paper uses experiments in a wide variety of natural domains to illustrate these points. It also shows that the new method scales up better than the old one in terms of ruleset size, the number of rules, and learning time when the training set size increases. This is an important characteristic for learning algorithms used for data mining.

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) initially encouraged us down this path to provide an optional software upgrade for its Rocky Rover. The USU system was based on a unique combination of fuzzy logic and a decision tree behavioral technique, and this system provided the Rocky Rover the option of venturing independently beyond the observance of the base station. Shortcomings in the data collection prompted a redesign that included more sophisticated line tracing and filtering methods to locate and track the actual laser lines. The signal to noise ratio problems combined with platform changes lead to the choice of a commercial range finder. The design challenge then became one of system integration including the meeting of real time constraints on the current processor platform, and obstacle characterization and avoidance.

Published data were used to simulate the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the cohort, the consecutive clinical outcomes and the associated costs, Five vaccination scenarios were assessed and compared to the baseline, defined as the high-risk group strategy without prenatal screening. These were: 1. systematic prenatal screening and vaccination of newborns at risk; 2. universal vaccination of infants; 3. universal vaccination of schoolchildren; 4. universal vaccination of infants and schoolchildren; 5. universal vaccination of infants schoolchildren and adolescents, Results are presented using a 3% annual discounting rare. Systematic prenatal screening reduced the number of chronic infections by 11% and prevented 6 deaths per year. The cost per year of life saved was estimated to be 23 350 CHF. The four universal vaccination scenarios had a much larger impact on the number of chronic infections and deaths prevented (reduction of 68-78%). Costs per year of life saved for universal vaccination ranged from 8820 CHF (infant strategy) to 12380 CHF (schoolchildren strategy). However; the vaccination of schoolchildren would be as cost-effective as the vaccination of infants using alternative assumptions (a lower compliance far infants compared to schoolchildren or the need for a booster later in life for infants). The benefit-cost ratio ranged from 1.2 (systematic prenatal screening and vaccination of newborns at risk) to 2.9 (vaccination of infants). Universal vaccination against hepatitis B is more cost-effective than the current selective vaccination strategy of newborns.

In a decision tree, each internal node corresponds to a decision on an attribute and each outgoing branch corresponds to a possible value of this attribute. The ordering of attributes in the levels of a decision tree will affect the efficiency of the classification process, and should be determined in accordance with the relevance of these attributes to the target class. We consider in this paper two different measurements for the relevance of attributes to the target class, i.e., inference power and information gain. These two measurements, though both being related to the relevance to the group identity, can in fact lead to different branching decisions. It is noted that, depending on the stage of tree branching, these two measurements should be judiciously employed so as to maximize the effects they are designed for. The inference power and the information gain of multiple attributes are also evaluated in this paper.

This type of technique generates several classifiers to form a committee by repeated application of a single base learning algorithm. The committee members vote to decide the final classification. Boosting and Bagging create different classifiers by modifying the distribution of the training set. SASC (Stochastic Attribute Selection Committees) uses an alternative approach to generating classifier committees by stochastic manipulation of the set of attributes considered at each node during tree induction, but keeping the distribution of the training set unchanged. In this paper, we propose a method for improving the performance of Boosting. This technique combines Boosting and SASC. It builds classifier committees by manipulating both the distribution of the training set and the set of attributes available during induction. In the synergy, SASC effectively increases the model diversity of Boosting. Experiments with a representative collection of natural domains show that, on, average, the combined technique outperforms either Boosting or SASC alone in terms of reducing the error rate of decision tree learning.

Methods that classify unknown cases using multiple classifiers (e.g. Bagging, Boosting) have been actively studied in recent years. Since these methods classify a case by taking majority voting over the classifiers, the reasons behind the decision cannot be described in a logical form. Moreover, a large number of classifiers is needed to significantly improve the accuracy. This greatly increases the amount of time and space needed in classification. To solve these problems, a method for learning a single decision tree that approximates the majority voting classifiers is proposed in this paper. The proposed method generates if-then rules from each classifier, and then learn a single decision tree from these rules. Experimental results show that the decision trees by our method are considerably compact and have similar accuracy compared to Bagging. Moreover, the proposed method is 8 to 24 times faster than Bagging in classification.

The goal is to develop a simple set of rules which can be used as heuristics in place of the optimization procedure for future cases. This methodology has been applied to two distinct problems: a selection problem formulated as a multi-bin knapsack problem, and a cutting-stock problem. In the selection problem, both learning methods were correct in over 85% of the cases examined. Since a random selection procedure would only correctly classify 58% of the cases, it can be concluded that learning is occurring. On the other hand, both learning algorithms accurately classify only about 80% of the patterns examined in the cutting-stock problem. Since it is possible to correctly classify approximately 81% of the patterns by simply rejecting every pattern, learning does not appear to be occurring in this problem. This paper provides a description of the two problems as well as the results of the learning on each problem.

Nisan, SIAM J. Comp., 20(6):999-1007, 1991). Motivated by a question if randomization can significantly speed up a nondeterministic computation via a boolean decision tree, we address structural properties of Arthur-Merlin games in this model and prove some lower bounds. We consider two ceases of interest, the first when the length of communication between the players is limited and the second if it is not. While in the first case we can carry over the relations between the corresponding Turing complexity classes, in the second case we observe in contrast with Turing complexity that a arte round Merlin-Arthur protocol is as powerful as a general interactive proof system and in particular, can simulate a one-round Arthur-Merlin protocol. Moreover, we show that sometimes a Merlin-Arthur protocol can be more efficient than an Arthur-Merlin protocol, and than a Merlin-Arthur protocol with limited communication. This is the case fos a boolean function whose set of zeroes is a code with high minimum distance and a natural uniformity condition. Such functions provide an example when the Merlin-Arthur complexity is 1 with one-sided error epsilon is an element of (2/3, I), but at the same tine the nondeterministic decision tree complexity is Omega(n). The latter should be contrasted with another fact we prove. Namely, if a function has Merlin-Arthur complexity I with one-sided error probability epsilon is an element of (0, 2/3], then its nondeterministic complexity is troubled by a constant.

The PI indicates that the whole investigated watershed belongs to 3 productivity classes; average, poor, and extremely poor. The application of the model for a ten-year period shows that the calibration parameter a varied from 0.2 to 6.2 and that the predicted average gross erosion within the watershed is about 17 t.ha(-1).yr(-1). The scattering of the output data of the GAMES model using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) resulted in six groups of soil erosion being identified. Results obtained from the DTA approach show that 47% of the entire watershed is likely to suit reforestation and relatively intensive agriculture, 41% is suitable for grazing land, grazing forestry land and field cropping land when agricultural conditions are more appropriate. The remaining area (12%) is suitable for microcatchments.

Companded digital signals are extracted from a 1.544 Mbps T1 digital trunk and then classified into either silence or twelve other active categories including speech, four classes of data modem, three classes of fax, random binary data, fax signalling, ringback signal, and dual tone multifrequency (DTMF) digits. The classifier first derives from the baseband signal in each channel the central second-order moment and the first ten lags of the autocorrelation sequence, all normalized with respect to average power. Avoiding demodulation and Fourier transform steps in the classification process permits linear and quadratic discriminant functions to be computed in real time for all 24 T1 channels. Classification accuracies are reported for statistically optimal linear discriminant functions over classification intervals ranging from 31.5 to 256.5 ms. Also given are the greater accuracies achievable using statistically optimal quadratic discriminant functions and an automatically trained decision tree known as an adaptive logic network (ALN).

J	Chiu, BC; Webb, GI				Chiu, BC; Webb, GI			Using decision trees for agent modeling: Improving prediction performance	USER MODELING AND USER-ADAPTED INTERACTION			English	Article						agent modeling; student modeling; inductive learning; decision tree	INTELLIGENT	A modeling system may be required to predict an agent's future actions under constraints of inadequate or contradictory relevant historical evidence. This can result in low prediction accuracy, or otherwise, low prediction rates, leaving a set of cases for which no predictions are made. A previous study that explored techniques for improving prediction rates in the context of modeling students' subtraction skills using Feature Based Modeling showed a tradeoff between prediction rate and predication accuracy. This paper presents research that aims to improve prediction rates without affecting prediction accuracy. The FBM-C4.5 agent modeling system was used in this research. However, the techniques explored are applicable to any Feature Based Modeling system, and the most effective technique developed is applicable to most agent modeling systems. The default FBM-C4.5 system models agents' competencies with a set of decision trees, trained on all historical data. Each tree predicts one particular aspect of the agent's action. Predictions from multiple trees are compared for consensus. FBM-C4.5 makes no prediction when predictions from different trees contradict one another. This strategy trades off reduced prediction rates for increased accuracy. To make predictions in the absence of consensus, three techniques have been evaluated. They include using voting, using a tree quality measure acid using a leaf quality measure. An alternative technique that merges multiple decision trees into a single tree provides an advantage of producing models that are more comprehensible. However, all of these techniques demonstrated the previous encountered trade-off between rate of prediction and accuracy of prediction, albeit less pronounced. It was hypothesized that models built on more current observations would outperform models built on earlier observations. Experimental results support this hypothesis. A Dual-model system, which takes this temporal factor into account, has been evaluated. This fifth approach achieved a significant improvement in prediction rate without significantly affecting prediction accuracy.

With the standard data sets that contain continuous varaiables the error of the tree is not significantly different from the more standard heuristic. In contrast, the meteorlogical phenomena have more trees that are more accurate. The heuristic also discovers interactions that would not be found at the first passes of the multiple pass approach. A plausible explanation for the differences between the meteorological and the standard sets are given.

ECG is the most frequently-used means of cardiac diagnosis. It is the cheapest and the most widely-available; it is also crucial for detecting rhythmic problems. In this paper we derive fuzzy rules for ECG classification from ID3-induced decision frees. The system of fuzzy rules is designed based on 106 ECG's, and it is evaluated using a validation set of 48 ECG's carefully selected by cardiologists. Using the same 106 ECG's for design and the same 48 EGGS for validation, an ID3-generated decision tree yields 73% correct classifications, and a neural network trained with the feed-forward cascade-correlation algorithm produces 85.4% correct classifications. On the other hand, the derived fuzzy rules, combined with an optimized defuzzification using the cascade correlation neural network, produces 100% correct classifications.

The method is based on a strategy which hypothesizes the intersection of the object with some selected image point, and searches for additional surface data at locations relative to that point, At each increment, the image is queried for the existence of surface data at a specific spatial location. and the set of possible object poses is further restricted. Eventually, either the object is identified and localized. or the initial hypothesis is refuted. The strategy is implemented in the discrete domain as a binary decision tree classifier. The tree leaf nodes represent individual voxel templates of the model, The internal tree modes represent the union of the templates of their descendant leaf nodes. The union of all leaf node templates is the complete template set of the model over its discrete pose space. Each internal node also references a single voxel which is the most common element of its child node templates, Traversing the tree is equivalent to efficiently matching the large set of templates at a selected image seed location, The process is approximately 3 orders of magnitude more efficient than brute-force template matching. Experimental results are presented in which objects are reliably recognized a and localized in 6 dimensions in less than GO seconds within noisy and significantly occluded range images.

The fuzzy ID3 has a mechanism to construct fuzzy rules. However, the fuzzy ID3 has a couple of problems, i.e., a lack of representation and an adjusting problem. In our fuzzy ID3, AND/OR operators are formulated using t-norm and t-conorm connectives with parameters and each parameter is adjusted using golden section method. By using golden section method, the proposed fuzzy ID3 gives accurate fuzzy rules. If t-conorm connective is selected as AND/OR operator in the adjusting stage, the decision tree has more flexible representation.

First, we show that ssPPC can produce degenerate partitions of X-u. Then, we propose two alternative approaches that fix this defect and guarantee non-degenerate classes.

One of the difficulties in using the current information retrieval systems is that it is hard for a user, especially a novice, to formulate a query effectively. Often they get overwhelmed by a large amount of information retrieved or get nothing; most users continue to reformulate queries until they get what they want or exhausted. One solution to this problem is to automate the process of query reformulation using the relevance feedback from the previous search. In this research, a Boolean query is viewed as a classifier and a decision tree classifier, ID3 is revised to act as a query in information retrieval (call it ID3-IR). The current emphasis in our experiments is to analyze the changes in the retrieval performance (measured by recall precision, and E) of the ID3-IR using a different number of relevant input documents. Based on the test set, MEDLARS, it is shown that an input set with more relevant documents achieves higher recall and lower precision. In overall performance analysis measured by E, an input set with more relevant documents is superior to one with less relevant documents after the second reformulation.

The learning rule of the decision tree technique is defined as a function of global information by employing a divide-and-conquer strategy. Learning rules with lower fitness values are replaced by new ones generated using GP techniques. The reciprocal connection between decision tree and GP emerges from the coordination of learning rules. Since: there is no constraint on initial network structure, a mon suitable network call be found for a given task. Further, the: fitness values are improved by using a hybrid GP technique which is a combined technique of GP and Back Propagation. The proposed method is applied to a medical diagnostic system and experimental results demonstrate that effective learning rule evolves.

Starting from the training data, a decision tree is generated using the classifier program C4.5[1]. The tree is then used to initialise the architecture of the neural network to a nearly optimum configuration. This initialised partially connected network is then trained using training data. The trained neural network is then implemented by fine-grain Xilinx XC6200 series FPGAs. This implementation requires fewer connections and can provide a very high speed classification for many realtime image recognition applications.

The robot perception is decomposed into a hierarchy of simpler virtual environments, termed worlds. Training examples generated from the robot's past rewarded experiences are exposed to ITI-2.8 in an incremental manner and on-line to evolve an array of Fuzzy Associative Memories (FAM), each representing a unique world. That is, generated FAMs, which are structurally nonlinear (in contrast to ordinary FAMs), are engineered on-line and from inception to store and access fuzzy control rule spaces representing different perceptions. Each decision tree is encoded In one FAM and is local to a certain perception. The fundamental strengths of the algorithm in building on-line FAMs, is its incremental nature and automatically generating fuzzy training vectors without human intervention. Fuzziness is integrated to provide suitable reasoning in the face of inherent uncertainty in the sensory input data and to merge conflicting behaviours to generate smooth trajectories. Global navigation is achieved by activating a hierarchy of local FAMs.	Loughborough Univ Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England	Hamzei, GHS (reprint author), Loughborough Univ Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.							0	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1062-922X	0-7803-4778-1	IEEE SYS MAN CYBERN			1998							2332	2337				6	Computer Science, Cybernetics	Computer Science	BL88E	WOS:000077033700407

A salient subset might depend upon the users interests. Clearly, browsing such a large data set to find interesting areas would be very time consuming. An intelligent agent which, for a given class of user, could provide hints on areas of the data that might interest the user would be very useful. Given large data sets having categories of salience far different user classes attached to the data in them, these labeled sets of data can be used to train a decision tree to label unseen data examples with a category of salience. The training set will be much larger than usual. This paper describes an approach to generating the rules for an agent from a large training set. A set of decision trees are built in parallel on tractable size training data sets which are a subset of the original data. Each learned decision tree will be reduced to a set of rules, conflicting rules resolved and the resultant rules merged into one set. Results from cross validation experiments on a data set suggest this approach may be effectively applied to large sets of data.

In this paper, a decision tree classifier is induced from data generated from simulation runs of a real-time distributed shop floor control system. The simulation evaluates the various possible states of the shop floor, using information about the existing machines, the expected waiting time in the queues, the number of jobs waiting in each queue, the throughput rate, cycle time, and the average earliness and tardiness. The decision tree classifier develops a description or model for each type of machine behavior, which can be used to select the best machine behavior with respect to the machine's goal.

This paper develops an algorithm to generate a learning fuzzy decision tree. This algorithm firstly collects enough training data for generating a practical decision tree. It then uses fuzzy statistics to calculate fuzzy sets for representing the training data in order to save computing memory and increase generation speed. Finally, this algorithm uses a sub-optimal criterion to learn a decision tree from the resultant fuzzy sets. The algorithm Is applied to a general-purpose tactile force sensing system. This system uses fuzzy logic to interpolate the force data. Then, the proposed algorithm is used to generate the desired decision tree from the tactile data. Based on the decision tree, the objects can be on-line recognized precisely.

Algorithms for building classification decision trees have a natural concurrency?, but are difficult to parallelize due to the inherent dynamic nature of the computation. In this paper; we present parallel formulations of classification decision tree learning algorithm based on induction. We describe Mio basic parallel formulations. One is based on Synchronous Tree Construction Approach and the other is based on Partitioned Tree Construction Approach. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using these methods and propose a hybrid method that employs the good features of these methods.

The problem,vith using color is that its representation is low level and hence its retrieval effectiveness is limited. This paper investigates techniques to improving the effectiveness of image retrieval based on colors. It examines the choice of suitable color space and color resolution. It describes two techniques for image retrieval with relevance feedback (RF). The first uses machine learning algorithms to extract significant color intervals and build the decision tree from the relevant image set to support effective RF. The second employs color coherent vector (CCV), in which the pseudo object information encoded in CCV is rued for RF Both techniques have been tested on a large image database containing over 12, 000 images. Tests were also performed to evaluate the effectiveness of retrieval at different color resolutions The results demonstrate that our RF techniques are effective and a medium color resolution of 176 colors performs the best.

In the former system, clutter rejection is performed operationally only through the use of pre-stored clutter. map. The latter one is presently testing a new approach that involves: high range resolution; a signal processor based oil a decision-tree classification system; the use of a dynamic, adaptive clutter map. To quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the algorithm, the hourly agreement between the "aloft" radar-derived precipitation measurements and those of a network of gauges has been evaluated. As expected, the postprocessing clutter elimination algorithm performs effectively for the first radar, weakly for the second one.

We also give asymptotically tight characterizations of T for all symmetric f in the exact, zero-error, and bounded-error settings. Finally, we give new precise bounds for AND, OR, and PARITY. Our results are a quantum extension of the so-called polynomial method, which has been successfully applied in classical complexity theory and also a quantum extension of results by Nisan about a polynomial relationship between randomized and deterministic decision tree complexity.

J	Sonnenberg, A; Inadomi, JM				Sonnenberg, A; Inadomi, JM			Review article: medical decision models of Helicobacter pylori therapy to prevent gastric cancer	ALIMENTARY PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th Roundtable Meeting on H Pylori and Gastric Cancer	FEB, 1997	PALM BEACH, FLORIDA	Glaxo Wellcome Res & Dev			CONVENIENT APPROXIMATION; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; LIFE EXPECTANCY; HEALTH; DEALE	The aim of the present article is to study the utility of Helicobacter pylori eradication programmes in decreasing the incidence of gastric cancer. Three types of decision models are employed to pursue this aim, i.e. decision tree, present value, and declining exponential approximation of life expectancy (DEALE). 1) A decision tree allows one to model the interaction of multiple variables in great detail and to calculate the marginal cost, as well as the marginal cost-benefit ratio, of a preventive strategy The cost of gastric cancer, the efficacy of H. pylori therapy in preventing cancer, and the cumulative probability of developing gastric cancer exert the Largest influence on the marginal cost of cancer prevention. The high cost of future gastric cancer and a high efficacy of therapy make screening for H. pylori and its eradication the preferred strategy. 2) The present value is an economic method to adjust future costs or benefits to their current value using a discount rate and the length of time between now and a given time point in the future. It accounts for the depreciation of money and all material values over time. During childhood, the present value of future gastric cancer is very low. Vaccination of children to prevent gastric cancer would need to be very inexpensive to be practicable. Cancer prevention becomes a feasible option, only if the time period between the preventive measures and the occurrence of gastric cancer can be made relatively short, 3)The DEALE provides a means to calculate the increase in life expectancy that would occur, if death from a particular disease became preventable. Life expectancy of the general population is hardly affected by gastric cancer. For life expectancy to increase appreciably by vaccination or antibiotic therapy directed against H. pylori infection, these interventions would need to be focused towards a sub-population with an a priori high risk for gastric cancer.

J	O'Connor, BP; Dyce, JA				O'Connor, BP; Dyce, JA			A test of models of personality disorder configuration	JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							AXIS-II; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; INVENTORY; SCALES; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSES; SAMPLE	In this study, the authors examined the degrees to which various models of personality disorder (PD) configuration are consistent with the primary data sets from clinical and community samples reported in the recent literature. Factor analyses were conducted on PD intercorrelation matrices, and the loading matrices were rotated to maximum possible fit with target matrices representing the PD configuration models. There was little support for the interpersonal circle or other circular orderings of PDs, or for T. Millon's (1990, 1996) biosocial learning theory. There was moderate support for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) dimensions, for C. R. Cloninger's (1987) tridimensional theory, and for S. Togersen and R. Alnaes's (1989) decision tree. There was consistent, stronger support for the 5-factor model (T. A. Widiger, T. J. Trull, J. F. Clarkin, C. Sanderson, & P. T. Costa, 1994) and for an empirically derived 7-factor model by C. R. Cloninger and D. M. Svrakic (1994). However, a focus on just 4 factors seems preferable and sufficient.

J	Read, NK; Ray, WH				Read, NK; Ray, WH			Application of nonlinear dynamic analysis in the identification and control of nonlinear systems .1. Simple dynamics	JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL			English	Article						nonlinear modelling and control; normal forms; CSTR	INPUT-OUTPUT LINEARIZATION; MODELS	Nonlinear processes abound in the chemical industry. Although linear controllers work for some of these systems, processes that contain highly nonlinear behaviour typically require a method that takes these nonlinearities into account. Thus, in the last few years there has been an emphasis on nonlinear control strategies such as (nonlinear) model predictive control and geometric control. These methods rely heavily upon the model used. Therefore, it is of great importance to have an adequate model for the nonlinear process, and this model must be identified from process data in many cases. In this work, it is shown through normal form theory that a common model structure can be found for nonlinear systems undergoing similar dynamical behaviour. This structure, in general, contains a low order polynomial vector field characteristic of the particular system. Parameters for this structure are found through a nonlinear least squares algorithm with data from the process of interest. Control is then based upon the derived model. As an example, the nonisothermal Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor with irreversible exothermic reaction (A --> B) is considered. The above strategy is used in two different operating regions - a region containing multiple steady states and one containing oscillations. In both these regions, a simple model is found and its parameters fit. Geometric controllers are designed based on these simple models, and the resulting control is shown to be very good. Because of the generality of the models derived from normal form theory, a simple identification and control scheme is presented for two-dimensional systems in the form of a decision tree. The scheme relies entirely on the user's observation of the system dynamics and is aimed at simple dynamics such as oscillations and multiple steady states. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Neural Syst: 5 203-27) we compared human quick-learning and generalization (quick modelling) with that of neural nets (feedforward architectures), symbolic algorithms (decision tree procedures), an pattern classifiers (truth-set descriptors). Those studies raised the question of the role of context in the nature and rapidity of human learning. Here we address that issue in the setting of the same basic experiment (Quinlan classification problem) used for the previous studies. A major implication of our findings is that humans overwhelmingly seek, create, or imagine context in order to provide meaning when presented with abstract or apparently incomplete or contradictory or otherwise untenable situations.

J	El-Sonbaty, Y; Ismail, MA				El-Sonbaty, Y; Ismail, MA			A new algorithm for subgraph optimal isomorphism	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						decision tree; direct transformation; subgraph isomorphism; graph decomposition; weighted bipartite graph	SYNTACTIC PATTERN-RECOGNITION; GRAPH ISOMORPHISM; DISTANCE MEASURE; RELAXATION	In this paper a new algorithm for subgraph isomorphism is proposed. The main idea of the new algorithm is to decompose the graphs to be matched into smaller subgraphs. The matching process is then done at the level of the decomposed subgraphs based on the concept of error-correcting transformations. The cost of matching two graphs is defined as the minimum of a weighted bipartite graph constructed from the decomposed subgraphs. The average computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is found to be O(N-4). The results of the application of the new algorithm show that the new technique is quite efficient and, in many respects, superior to similar existing techniques in the literature. Besides, it overcomes most of the problems encountered in using tree search algorithms. The new algorithm is also suitable for parallelprocessing implementation. (C) 1997 Pattern Recognition Society.

This type of problem arises in fault diagnosis, in the design of interactive expert systems, in reliability analysis of coherent systems, in discriminant analysis of test data, and in many other applications. We introduce a generic decision rule that specifies the next attribute to test at any location in a decision tree. Random searches and tabu searches are applied to determine the best specific form of the rule. The most successful heuristics that we developed are based on the tabu search paradigm. We present computational results for problems with a variety of characteristics and compare our heuristics to an exact dynamic programming algorithm.

In real life, successful soccer teams require many qualities, such as basic ball control skills, the ability to carry out strategies, and teamwork. We believe that simulating such behaviors is a significant challenge for computer science, artificial intelligence, and robotics technologies. It is to promote the development of such technologies, and to help define a new standard problem for research, that we have developed Soccer Server. We demonstrate the potential of Soccer Server by reporting an experiment that uses that system to compare the performance of a neural network architecture and a decision tree algorithm at learning the selection of soccer play plans. Other researchers using Soccer Server to investigate the nature of cooperative behavior in a multiagent environment will have the chance to assess their progress at RoboCup-97, an international competition of robotic soccer to be held in conjunction with IJCAI-97. Soccer Server has been chosen as the official server for the contest.

One model of the problem is: given a finite set of polygonal parts, use a set of "width" measurements taken by a parallel-jaw gripper to determine which part is present. We study the problem of computing efficient strategies ("grasp plans"), with the goal to minimize the number of measurements necessary in the worst case. We show that finding a minimum length grasp plan is Np-hard, and give a polynomial time approximation algorithm that is simple and produces a solution that is within a log factor from optimal.

J	Setiono, R; Liu, H				Setiono, R; Liu, H			Analysis of hidden representations by greedy clustering	CONNECTION SCIENCE			English	Article						backpropagation neural network; hidden representation; pruning; clustering; rule extraction	NEURAL NETWORKS; RULES	The hidden layer of backpropagation neural networks (NNs) holds the key to the networks' success in solving pattern classification problems. The units in the hidden layer encapsulate the network's internal representations of the outside world described by the input data. In this paper, the hidden representations of trained networks are investigated by means of a simple greedy clustering algorithm. This clustering algorithm is applied to networks that have been trained to solve well-known problems: the monks problems, the 5-bit parity problem and the contiguity problem. The results from applying the algorithm to problems with known concepts provide us with a better understanding of NN learning. These results also explain why NNs achieve higher predictive accuracy than that of decision-tree methods. The results of this study can be readily applied to rub extraction front NNs. Production rules are extracted for the parity and the monks problems, as well as for a benchmark data set: Pima Indian diabetes diagnosis. The extracted rules Jj om the Pima Indian diabetes data set compare favorably with rubs extracted from ARTMAP NNs in terms of predictive accuracy and simplicity.

J	Bespamyatnikh, SN				Bespamyatnikh, SN			An optimal algorithm for closest-pair maintenance	DISCRETE & COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY			English	Article							TREES	Given a set S of n points in k-dimensional space, and an L., metric, the dynamic closest-pair problem is defined as follows: find a closest pair of S after each update of S (the insertion or the deletion of a point). For fixed dimension k and fixed metric L-t, we give a data structure of size O(n) that maintains a closest pair of S in O (log n) time per insertion and deletion. The running time of the algorithm is optimal up to a constant factor because Omega(log n) is a lower bound, in an algebraic decision-tree model of computation, on the time complexity of any algorithm that maintains the closest pair (for k = 1). The algorithm is based on the fair-split tree. The constant factor in the update time is exponential in the dimension. We modify the fair-split tree to reduce it.

J	Gottschalk, KW; Colbert, JJ; Feicht, DL				Gottschalk, KW; Colbert, JJ; Feicht, DL			Tree mortality risk of oak due to gypsy moth	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST PATHOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IUFRO XX World Congress	AUG, 1995	TAMPERE, FINLAND	Int Union Forestry Res Org				We present prediction models for estimating tree mortality resulting from gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, defoliation in mixed oak, Quercus sp., forests. These models differ from previous work by including defoliation as a factor in the analysis. Defoliation intensity, initial tree crown condition (crown vigour), crown position, and species grouping classes were highly significant in categorical analysis of variance for mortality. Heavy defoliation Intensity was shown to have a strong, consistent influence in increasing the probability of tree mortality. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis, a binomial decision tree procedure, was used to develop prediction models of mortality risk for use by forest managers. The best decision tree had 65 groups that correctly classified 75% of the live trees and 76% of ihe dead trees. Models were run separately by defoliation class and provided correct classifications between 63 and 78% of the trees. Forest land managers can use these models to assign probabilities of death for moderate and heavy defoliation intensity levels and compare predicted mortality to mortality of undefoliated trees to determine how gypsy moth defoliation will affect their stands. The probabilities can be used to develop marking guides based on projected defoliation levels for implementing silvicultural treatments to minimize gypsy moth effects in forest stands prior to infestation.

Three kinds of features, stroke width means, stroke width variations, and aspect ratio, are first used to classify character typefaces as: Black, Li, Kai-Round, or Ming-Song. Each of the last two groups contains two typefaces. Vertical/horizontal stroke width ratios are used to distinguish between the Ming and Song typefaces and accumulative pixel ratio to distinguish between the Kai and Round typefaces. Six different typeface feature distributions measured from 5401 printed Chinese characters are considered, and a trapezoid-shaped membership function is constructed for each distribution. Based on these membership functions, we determine what typeface each input character belongs to using a two-level decision tree. To increase the identification rate, the typeface of a certain character is adjusted according to the typeface identification results of the front and the next characters. In the character recognition system, we use two statistical features: crossing counts and contour directional counts. We achieved an 89.87% typeface identification rate in our experiments, and a 95.60% character recognition rate.

We therefore characterised the in vitro proliferative influence on eight sarcoma cell lines of the platelet-derived growth factor, the insulin-like growth factor 1, triiodothyronine, the epidermal growth factor, the luteinising-hormone-releasing hormone, progesterone, gastrin and 17 beta-oestradiol. The influence of the different factors on the proliferation of sarcoma cell lines was measured by the colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide test. Two culture media were studied: (1) a nutritionally poor medium containing 2% of fetal calf serum and (2) a nutritionally rich one containing 5% or 10% FCS both with and without the addition of non-essential amino acids. The results were analysed either by conventional statistical analyses or by a classification method based on a decision-tree approach developed in Machine Learning. This latter method was also compared to other classifiers (such as logistic regression and k nearest neighbours) with respect to its accuracy of classification. Monovariate statistical analysis showed that each of the eight cell lines exhibited sensitivity to at least one factor, and each factor significantly modified the proliferation of five or six of the eight cell lines under study. Of these eight lines one of fibrosarcoma origin was the most "factor-sensitive". Decision-tree-related data analysis enabled the specific pattern of factor sensitivity to be characterised for the three histological types of cell line under study. The effects of hormone and growth factors are significantly influenced by the type of culture medium used. The method used appeared to be an accurate classifier for the kind of data analysed. Sarcoma proliferation can be modulated, at least in vitro, by various hormones and growth factors, and the proliferation of each histopathological type exhibited a distinct sensitivity to different hormone and/or growth-factors.

A decision tree-based state transition model (Markov chain approach) implemented to simulate a 5 year period of follow up was constructed. The H. pylori eradication strategy was found to be superior to the conventional maintenance strategy with regard to clinical effectiveness and other dimensions of a patient's outcome. Furthermore, in a long-term perspective, the eradication strategy was less costly than the maintenance strategy. Helicobacter pylori eradication should be recommended as the first choice treatment of H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer patients. The clinical implication of H. pylori eradication entails an improvement in clinical effectiveness and other dimensions of a patient's outcome and a significant reduction in the costs of duodenal ulcer treatment. The long-term total costs do not depend on the initial drug cost of an eradication regimen. Pursuing a high eradication rate of H. pylori is essential in improving the patient's outcome and the cost-effectiveness of treatment.

J	Schwabacher, M; Ellman, T; Hirsh, H				Schwabacher, M; Ellman, T; Hirsh, H			Learning to set up numerical optimizations of engineering designs	AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING			English	Article						case-based reasoning; decision tree induction; engineering design; numerical optimization; reformation		Gradient-based numerical optimization of complex engineering designs offers the promise of rapidly producing better designs. However, such methods generally assume that the objective function and constraint functions are continuous, smooth, and defined everywhere. Unfortunately, realistic simulators tend to violate these assumptions, making optimization unreliable. Several decisions that need to be made in setting up an optimization, such as the choice of a starting prototype and the choice of a formulation of the search space, can make a difference in the reliability of the optimization. Machine learning can improve gradient-based methods by making these choices based on the results of previous optimizations. This paper demonstrates this idea by using machine learning for four parts of the optimization setup problem: selecting a starting prototype from a database of prototypes, synthesizing a new starting prototype, predicting which design goals are achievable, and selecting a formulation of the search space. We use standard tree-induction algorithms (C4.5 and CART). We present results in two realistic engineering domains: racing yachts and supersonic aircraft. Our experimental results show that using inductive learning to make setup decisions improves both the speed and the reliability of design optimization.

Hormones studied included gastrin, epidermal growth factor, estradiol and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone. STUDY DESIGN: The growth patterns were assessed by means of computer-assisted microscope analysis of Feulgen-stained nuclei combined with the mathematical Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi paving techniques. This methodology enabled four variables characterizing the cell colony patterns to be computed. The information contributed by these variables was analyzed by means of discriminant analysis and the decision tree technique. RESULTS: Each phenotype (sensitivity level) exhibited distinct growth pattern (or cell colony level) characteristics in the case of each hormone and/or growth factor under study. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the gastrointestinal cell lines to a given hormone (or growth factor) appeared to be peculiar to the hormone (or growth factor). CONCLUSION: A direct relationship seens to exist between growth pattern and hormone sensitivity levels in gastrointestinal cancers, particularly colorectal.

COMPUTER NETWORKS AND ISDN SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International World Wide Web Conference	APR 14-18, 1998	BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA			search engines; machine learning	DECISION TREES	Search engines and indices were created to help people find information amongst the rapidly increasing number of World Wide Web (WWW) pages. The search engines automatically visit and index pages so that they can return good matches for their users' queries. The way that this indexing is done varies from engine to engine and the detail is usually secret although the strategy is sometimes made public in general terms. The search engines' aim is to return relevant pages quickly. On the other hand, the author of a Web page has a vested interest in it rating highly, for appropriate queries, on as many search engines as possible. Some authors have an interest in their page rating well for a great many types of query indeed - spamming has come to the Web. We treat modelling the workings of WWW search engines as an inductive inference problem. A training set of data is collected, being pages returned in response to typical, queries. Decision trees are used as the model class for the search engines' selection criteria although this is not to say that search engines actually contain decision trees. A machine learning program is used to infer a decision tree for each search engine, an information-theory criterion being used to direct the inference and to prevent over-fitting.

However the genuine application of HACCP principles can he difficult in the design of HACCP plans for raw food commodities. This is especially the case with fresh meat anal fresh meat products. In attempting to address these problems, the NZ MAF Regulatory Authority has developed a generic template for design of HACCP plans for slaughter and dressing of domestic livestock, and application of the template using sheep as art example is presented in this paper Establishment of food safety objectives for the particular segment of the food chain under consideration is important, and the hazard analysis step should individually consider the different components of the raw material (hide, head/offals/carcass, gastrointestinal tract) and their potential for microbiological contamination of the final product. Other fools which facilitate design and application of the HACCP,system are special consideration of prerequisite programmes, use of job descriptions,for slaughtermen, and a customized decision tree for identification of critical control points. Design and verification of the HACCP plan is enhanced by reference to microbiological 'targets' established according to a standardized national microbiological database aggregated from all licensed premises. In the absence of a human health microbiological risk assessment model for particular pathogens that may be present in meat and meat products, the food safety objectives of the HACCP plan will probably be associated with control of hazards rather than control of risks.

Methods and Materials: The Committee was composed of a multidisciplinary group of oncologists, and clinical scenarios were chosen to address most of the major treatment controversies in the combined modality treatment of rectal cancer. A literature search was then conducted and the major articles were identified, A modified Delphi technique was used to arrive at consensus. Serial surveys were conducted by distributing questionnaires to the Committee members to consolidate expert opinion. Voting was conducted using a scoring system and opinions were unified to the highest degree possible. Results: Consensus voting was performed for 4 clinical scenarios, Acceptability ratings for treatment were grouped into 3 broad categories: not acceptable, acceptable, and most acceptable. Based on the treatment options, a decision tree was developed that reflects the consensus of the committee. Conclusion: These options may help guide treatment decisions in rectal cancer.

J	Callahan, LA; Silver, E				Callahan, LA; Silver, E			Factors associated with the conditional release of persons acquitted by reason of insanity: A decision tree approach	LAW AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR			English	Article							COMMUNITY; DEFENSE	Most NGRI (not guilty by reason of insanity) acquittees are hospitalized for some period of time following acquittal which raises the question of when an individual can be safely released into the community. The conditional release (CR) of persons acquitted by reason of insanity, therefore, provokes the question of public safety. This study examines the CR systems in four states-Connecticut, Maryland, New York, and Ohio. A study sample of 529 persons acquitted as NGRI from 1985 to 1987 was followed up for at least five years to determine who is conditionally released. Following a description of the CR systems, findings suggestive of the role of dangerousness and diagnosis as predictors of CR are presented. Personal characteristics are also significant factors in predicting who will be released. The length of hospitalization for this population and other descriptive factors such as history of hospitalization arrests, substance abuse family violence, and living arrangements are also addressed.

J	Briggs, A; Sculpher, M				Briggs, A; Sculpher, M			An introduction to Markov modelling for economic evaluation	PHARMACOECONOMICS			English	Article							COST-EFFECTIVENESS; MANAGEMENT; DISEASE; CARE	Markov models are often employed to represent stochastic processes, that is, random processes that evolve over time. In a healthcare context, Markov models are particularly suited to modelling chronic disease. In this article, we describe the use of Markov models for economic evaluation of healthcare interventions. The intuitive way in which Markov models can handle both costs and outcomes make them a powerful tool for economic evaluation modelling. The time component of Markov models can offer advantages of standard decision tree models, particularly with respect to discounting. This paper gives a comprehensive description of Markov modelling for economic evaluation, including a discussion of the assumptions on which the type of model is based, most notably the memoryless quality of Markov models often termed the 'Markovian assumption'. A hypothetical example of a drug intervention to slow the progression of a chronic disease is employed to demonstrate the modelling technique and the possible methods of analysing Markov models are explored. Analysts should be aware of the limitations of Markov models, particularly the Markovian assumption, although the adept modeller will often find ways around this problem.

J	Douzdjian, V; Ferrara, D; Silvestri, G				Douzdjian, V; Ferrara, D; Silvestri, G			Treatment strategies for insulin-dependent diabetics with ESRD: A cost-effectiveness decision analysis model	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF KIDNEY DISEASES			English	Article						pancreas transplant; decision analysis; dialysis	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; STAGE RENAL-DISEASE; KIDNEY-TRANSPLANTATION; HEALTH-CARE; PANCREAS; RECIPIENTS	Clinical decision analysis has become an important tool for evaluating specific clinical scenarios and exploring public health policy issues. A decision analysis model that incorporates patient preferences regarding various outcomes, as well as cost, may be particularly informative in patients with type I diabetes and end stage renal disease (ESRD). Such a model that includes pancreas transplantation as a treatment choice has not been performed and is presented in this study. The decision tree consisted of a choice between four possible treatment strategies: dialysis, kidney-alone transplant from a cadaver (KA-CAD) or living donor (KA-LD), and simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant. The analysis was based on a 5-year model, and the measures of outcome used in the model were cost and cost adjusted for quality of life. The measure of preference for quality of life was obtained using the "Standard Reference Gamble" method in 17 SPK transplant recipients who underwent transplantation between January, 1992 and June, 1996 at our center. The measures for various outcome states (mean +/- 1 SD) were dialysis-free/insulin-free = 1, dialysis-free/insulin-dependent = 0.6 (0.4 to 0.8), dialysis-dependent/insulin-free = 0.5 (0.36 to 0.64), dialysis-dependent/insulin-dependent = 0.4 (0.21 to 0.59), and death = 0. The expected 5-year costs for each of the treatment strategies in the model were dialysis, $216,068; KA-CAD transplant, $214,678; KA-LD transplant, $210,872; and SPK transplant, $241,207. The expected cost per quality-adjusted year for each of the treatment strategies in the model were dialysis, $317,746; KA-CAD transplant, $156,042; KA-LD transplant, $123,923; and SPK transplant, $102,422. SPK transplantation remained the optimal strategy after varying survival probabilities, costs, and utilities over plausible ranges by means of one-way sensitivity analysis. In conclusion, according to the 5-year cost-utility model presented in this study, SPK transplantation is the most cost-effective treatment strategy for a patient with type I diabetes and ESRD. From a policy standpoint, looking at the cost alone of pancreas transplantation is deceiving. In these patients, who may view various outcome states differently, it would be important to take into account cost adjusted for quality of life when evaluating this procedure.

J	Bredensteiner, EJ; Bennett, KP				Bredensteiner, EJ; Bennett, KP			Feature minimization within decision trees	COMPUTATIONAL OPTIMIZATION AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						data mining; machine learning; feature minimization; decision trees; bilinear programming	NETWORKS	Decision trees for classification can be constructed using mathematical programming. Within decision tree algorithms, the feature minimization problem is to construct accurate decisions using as few features or attributes within each decision as possible. Feature minimization is an important aspect of data mining since it helps identify what attributes are important and helps produce accurate and interpretable decision trees. In feature minimization with bounded accuracy, we minimize the number of features using a given misclassification error tolerance. This problem can be formulated as a parametric bilinear program and is shown to be NP-complete. A parametric Frank-Wolfe method is used to solve the bilinear subproblems. The resulting minimization algorithm produces more compact, accurate, and interpretable trees. This procedure can be applied to many different error functions. Formulations and results for two error functions are given. One method, FM_RLP-P, dramatically reduced the number of features of one dataset from 147 to 2 while maintaining an 83.6% testing accuracy. Computational results compare favorably with the standard univariate decision tree method, C4.5, as well as with linear programming methods of tree construction.

Our design was a threshold analysis using a decision tree, The costs of medications were estimated from the average wholesale prices. The costs of diagnostic procedures were expressed as the sum of physician and facility costs. A decision tree was modeled to calculate the threshold probability of GERD, for which empirical therapy became the preferred management strategy. Bayes' formula was used to transform the sensitivity and specificity of various symptoms and the joint occurrence of multiple symptoms into disease probabilities. The decision in favor of empirical therapy is influenced by four factors: the probability of GERD, the duration or costs of GERD therapy, the costs of erroneous empirical therapy in patients with diagnosis other than GERD, and the costs of diagnostic procedures. In general, the expected benefit of saving the costs of a diagnostic procedure outweighs the costs of occasional erroneous empirical therapy. How ever, if surgical therapy is considered or antisecretory therapy is administered for a time period of 10 or more years, diagnostic confirmation of GERD should be sought. In the long run, the failure to differentiate between peptic ulcer and GERD results in the highest cost associated with erroneous empirical therapy. In patients with multiple characteristic symptoms of GERD, the diagnosis can be ascertained with sufficient confidence to warrant empirical therapy.

Aims-To identify pathological features that are discriminating for colorectal cancer (CRC) showing extensive MIN. Subjects-A prospective series of 303 patients with CRC and no family history of either familial adenomatous polyposis or hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer. Methods-DNA was extracted from fresh tissue samples and the presence of MIN was studied at nine loci that included TGF beta RII, IGFIIR, and BAX. The 61 cases showing RERs were compared with 63 RER negative cases with respect to a comprehensive set of clinical and pathological variables. Predictive utility of the variables was tested by decision tree analysis. Results-Twenty seven patients with CRC showed extensive RERs (three loci or more) (RER+) and 34 had limited RERs only (28 = one locus; 6 = two loci) (RER+/-), yielding a bimodal distribution. RER+ cancers differed from RER-and RER+/- cases. Tumour type (adenocarcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, and undifferentiated carcinoma) (p=0.001), tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (p=0.001), and anatomical site (p=0.001) were the most significant of the discriminating variables. Algorithms developed by decision tree analysis allowed cases to be assigned to RER+ versus RER-and +/- status with a global sensitivity of 81.5%, specificity of 96%, and overall accuracy of 93%. Conclusion-Pathological examination of CRC allows assignment of RER+ status; assignment is specific and relatively sensitive. Conversely RER-and RER+/- CRC are indistinguishable.

In a recent randomized trial, patients whose liver biopsies were performed with ultrasonography had a significant reduction in complications requiring hospitalization compared with patients without ultrasound-guided biopsies (0.5% vs. 2.2%, P < .05). Despite this, routine use of ultrasonography for liver biopsies has not been implemented because of controversies with respect to cost-effectiveness. The aim of our study was to analyze the relative cost-effectiveness of performing ultrasound-guided liver biopsies using decision analysis. A decision tree was constructed to compare a strategy of liver biopsy using ultrasonography with a strategy without ultrasonography. The major outcomes included were minor complications such as pain requiring analgesics and major complications, which require hospitalization. Costs included were direct medical costs from the payer's perspective. In our baseline model, the cost from complications per patient with and without ultrasonography was $62 and $129, respectively. The marginal effectiveness expressed as the number of major complications avoided was 1.2/100 liver biopsies, The incremental cost to avoid one major complication was $2,731. The model was most sensitive to the frequency of major complications and the additional cost of ultrasonography. Our decision analysis model suggests that ultrasound-guided liver biopsy is cost-effective. Future studies assessing the efficacy of image-guided liver biopsies should be conducted.

For this purpose, paraffin sections from 157 primary and metastatic colonic and ovarian carcinomas were immunostained. These cases were divided into a learning group of 46 colonic and 54 ovarian carcinomas and a test group of 29 colonic and 28 ovarian carcinomas, including all metastatic tumors, among which were five with unknown primary site at the time of testing. The sections were immunostained with antibodies against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cytokeratin 7 (CK7), cytokeratin 20 (CK20), CA 125, vimentin, and CA 19.9. Staining results were expressed as the product of staining intensity and percentage of positive tumor tells. Stepwise discriminant analysis was applied on the learning set to obtain a classification function for both tumors. The validity of the classification function was evaluated using the test set. There was considerable overlap in immunostaining for both tumor types, but colonic carcinomas were typically positive for CEA and CK20 and negative for CK7 and CA125. Ovarian carcinomas were typically positive for CK7 and CA125 and negative for CEA and CK20. Tn discriminant analysis, the best combination of markers appeared to be CK7 and CEA. Only one sample of the test group (2%) was misclassified. Taking learning and test groups together, 136 of the 157 samples (87%) were correctly classified with high posterior probability (PP > .8). However, from the 28 mucinous ovarian carcinomas, only 19 (68%) could correctly be classified with high PP. When excluding the nonmucinous ovarian carcinomas from the analysis, overall 87 of 103 (84.5%) of the samples were correctly classified (PP > .8) with a combination of CEA, CK7, and also vimentin. From the 28 mucinous ovarian carcinomas, only two (7%) were misclassified, and four could not be classified with sufficient certainty. In neither analysis did CK20, CA125, or CA19.9 emerge as discriminatory parameters. Based on the same data, an intuitive flow chart was constructed with which 129 of 157 cases could be classified (only one falsely) without further statistical analysis. The five metastases with an at first unknown primary could, according to the followup, all be classified correctly with high PP. Most ovarian carcinomas, including the mucinous ones, can be discriminated with high probability from colonic carcinomas using a panel of three antibodies directed against CEA, cytokeratin 7, and vimentin.

J	Bootman, JL				Bootman, JL			Cost-effectiveness of two new treatments for onychomycosis: An analysis of two comparative clinical trials	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY			English	Article								Background: Pharmacoeconomic analyses are becoming an increasingly integral component of the overall profile of new drugs, This is particularly true for terbinafine and itraconazole, because both agents have been shown to be clinically effective and relatively safe. Objective: This study examined the cost-effectiveness of terbinafine and itraconazole in two recent comparative clinical trials of these new agents for onychomycosis of the toenails. Methods: Data as reported in the two clinical trials were used as the basis for an analytic decision-tree model that included cost of drug, medical management of the disease and any adverse reactions, and clinical efficacy data into calculations that estimated the relative cost effectiveness ratio for each drug on the basis of cost per disease-free day. Results: The total cost of terbinafine therapy ranged from $697.55 to $699.11, and the total cost of itraconazole therapy ranged from $1216.40 to $1218.80. The expected cost per disease-free day of itraconazole was $2.05 and $2.37, in the Brautigam and De Backer trials, respectively; similar costs for terbinafine were $1.27 and $1.50. Relative to terbinafine, which was assigned a value of 1.0, the cost-effectiveness ratio of itraconazole was 1.62 and 1.58 in each trial, indicating a lower cost-effectiveness than terbinafine. Conclusion: Terbinafine is more cost-effective than itraconazole in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis.

J	Zheng, ZJ				Zheng, ZJ			Constructing conjunctions using systematic search on decision trees	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	FEB 22-23, 1997	SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE			knowledge discovery; machine learning; constructive induction		This paper investigates a dynamic path-based method for constructing conjunctions as new attributes for decision toe learning. It searches for conditions (attribute-value pairs) from paths to form new attributes. Compared with other hypothesis-driven new attribute construction methods, the new idea of this method is that it carries out a systematic search with pruning over each path of a tree to select conditions for generating a conjunction. Therefore, conditions for constructing new attributes are dynamically decided during the search. Empirically, evaluation in a set of artificial and real-world domains shows that the dynamic path-based method can improve the performance of selective decision tree learning in terms of both higher prediction accuracy and lower theory complexity. In addition, it shows some performance advantages over a fixed path-based method and a fixed rule-based method for learning decision trees. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Almond, S; O'Donnell, O				Almond, S; O'Donnell, O			Cost analysis of the treatment of schizophrenia in the UK - A comparison of olanzapine and haloperidol	PHARMACOECONOMICS			English	Article							RESISTANT SCHIZOPHRENIA; CLOZAPINE	A decision-tree simulation model is used to examine the costs associated with olanzapine versus haloperidol in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia in the UK. Parameter values and outcome scores were derived mainly from an international clinical trial. Resource consequences were examined on the basis of assumed service delivery and actual unit costs specific to the UK. While olanzapine is more expensive to prescribe than haloperidol, it generates savings by reducing utilisation of medical services. As a result, a comparison of the 2 drugs is approximately cost neutral. Model uncertainties are examined using extensive sensitivity analysis; in most scenarios, cost-neutral results are maintained. Olanzapine is more effective than haloperidol as measured by Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores and non-relapse rates. With such gains in effectiveness and near equivalence in terms of costs, olanzapine, in comparison with haloperidol, may represent a cost-effective treatment option.

J	Smith, KJ; Roberts, MS				Smith, KJ; Roberts, MS			Cost effectiveness of early treatment with oral aciclovir in adult chickenpox	PHARMACOECONOMICS			English	Article							VARICELLA-ZOSTER VIRUS; ACYCLOVIR TREATMENT; HEALTHY-CHILDREN; CONTROLLED TRIAL; COMPLICATIONS; ADOLESCENTS; INFECTION; THERAPY; VACCINE; AIDS	Treatment of adult chickenpox with aciclovir is controversial because of the relatively high cost of medication and small proven benefits of therapy. A decision-tree model was used to estimate the cost effectiveness of aciclovir, from third-party payer and societal perspectives: the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was calculated for aciclovir treatment of chickenpox compared with no antiviral therapy in immunocompetent adults who presented within 24 hours of the onset of chickenpox rash. Incremental costs for aciclovir compared with no antiviral treatment were $US42 900 per QALY gained, when viewed from a third-party payer perspective; however, results are sensitive to variation of clinical parameters. From a societal perspective, aciclovir therapy was cost saving compared with no antiviral treatment; aciclovir remained cost saving or cost effective (less than $US50 000 per QALY gained) when probabilities, quality-of-life utility values and costs were varied within clinically plausible ranges, and when other scenarios for chickenpox severity and aciclovir effectiveness were examined. From a societal perspective, oral aciclovir is cost effective, and perhaps cost saving, when given within 24 hours of rash onset in adult chickenpox. The argument for antiviral use may be less strong when viewed from the perspective of a third-party payer.

J	Bender, NK				Bender, NK			The stroke therapy research boom: Implications for the hospital formulary	PHARMACOTHERAPY			English	Article							ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE; CLINICAL-TRIALS; CARE; COST	Research into drug therapy for the acute treatment of ischemic stroke is now booming, and a number of promising drugs with very different mechanisms of action are at an advanced stage of development. Ideally, use of single agents or combinations of agents will result in favorable neurologic and functional outcomes for the majority of stroke patients. Given the current focus within our society on controlling health care costs, pharmacoeconomic tools will be important in determining which of these agents should achieve formulary acceptance. Cost-minimization analysis, cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, and cost-utility analysis are all likely to be valuable methodologies to aid in decision making. More complex situations may require the use of decision-tree analysis.

The prediction accuracy indicates whether these correlations are discerned. We present an approach to identify long-range relationships between sequence patterns and structural motifs by varying the granulation of the structure description. Since interaction among residues is a major determinant in protein folding, we consider contact environments formed by two triplets of three sequentially neighboring residues and described by vectors whose components express contact strengths on an atomic level. Through testing various classification schemes, including their resolution and optimizing parameters, discernible relationships between sequences and folds are explored. About ten structural contact states, together with information from noncontacting regions, could improve the accuracy of contact prediction. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Objective.-To estimate the economic impact of a national rotavirus immunization program in the United States. Design.-Cost-effectiveness was analyzed from the perspectives of the health care system and society. A decision tree used estimates of disease burden, costs, vaccine coverage, efficacy, and price obtained from published and unpublished sources. Intervention.-The proposed vaccine would be administered to infants at ages 2, 4, and 6 months as part of the routine schedule of childhood immunizations. Main Outcome Measures.-Total costs, outcomes prevented, and incremental cost-effectiveness. Results.-A routine, universal rotavirus immunization program would prevent 1.08 million cases of diarrhea, avoiding 34 000 hospitalizations, 95 000 emergency department visits, and 227 000 physician visits in the first 5 years of life. At $20 per dose, the program would cost $289 million and realize a net loss of $107 million to the health care system-$103 per case prevented. The program would provide a net savings of $296 million to society. Threshold analysis identified a break-even price per dose of $9 for the health care system and $51 for the societal perspective. Greater disease burden and greater vaccine efficacy and lower vaccine price increased cost-effectiveness. Conclusions.-A US rotavirus immunization program would be cost-effective from the perspectives of society and the health care system, although the cost of the immunization program would not be fully offset by the reduction in health care cost of rotavirus diarrhea unless the price fell to $9 per dose.

J	Sartoros, C; Salin, ED				Sartoros, C; Salin, ED			Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer warning diagnosis procedure using blank solution data	SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART B-ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY			English	Article						ICP-AES; signal-to-background ratio; RF power effects		Lines available while running a blank solution were used to monitor the analytical performance of an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) system in real time. Using H and Ar lines and their signal-to-background ratios (SBRs), simple rules in the form of a prediction table were developed by inspection of the data. These rules could be used for predicting changes in radio-frequency power, carrier gas flow rates, and sample introduction rate. The performance of the prediction table was good but not excellent. Another set of rules in the form of a decision tree was developed in an automated fashion using the C4.5 induction engine. The performance of the decision tree was superior to that of the prediction table, it appears that blank spectral information can be used to predict with over 90% accuracy when an ICP-AES is breaking down. However this is not as definitive at identifying the exact fault as some more exhaustive approaches involving the use of standard solutions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

EFFICACY; SURGERY; COST	Background. Pharmacoeconomics is becoming increasingly important in the health-care environment, but pharmacoeconomic studies are fraught with problems. Pharmacoeconomics can be applied to analysis of the benefits of pharmacologic hemostasis. Methods. This article reviews the available methods of pharmacoeconomic analysis and their inherent methodologic concerns. It reviews pharmacoeconomic studies of pharmacologic hemostasis, with particular focus on the Pediatric Reoperative Open Heart Surgery study. In this study, patients were randomized to receive either high-dose aprotinin, low-dose aprotinin, or placebo. Results were analyzed from the viewpoint of cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness calculated with use of a roll-back decision tree, and cost-effective ratios. Results. Cost-benefit analysis showed low-dose aprotinin to have a greater cost-benefit than high-dose aprotinin, cost-effectiveness analysis and analysis of cost-effective ratios showed high-dose aprotinin to be more cost-effective than low-dose aprotinin, and all analyses showed aprotinin to be preferable to placebo. Conclusions. Aprotinin in pediatric repeat open heart operations not only has a cost-benefit but is cost-effective as well. (C) 1998 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

J	Sedbrook, T				Sedbrook, T			Extracting generalized descriptions from a binary feedforward network	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							NEURAL NETWORKS; RULES; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; ALGORITHMS; KNOWLEDGE	This study develops a technique to extract generalized descriptions from the hidden layer weights of a binary feedforward network. We extend the Boolean-like training algorithm with recurrent connections and Gray coding to apply a process of logical resolution to discover functional dependencies in data sets. This training technique is applied to several domains, including two medical case bases concerning patients with suspected urinary tract and streptococcal pharyngitis infections. The resulting generalized descriptions are easy to understand and provide a way for physicians to further explore and validate the network's induction. Extracting symbolic patterns from a binary neural network's connections complements inductive decision tree approaches by explicitly identifying exemplars and exceptions and generalizing attribute patterns.

Consequently, diagnostic procedures and multidisciplinary treatments need to be tailored to the unique developmental, medical, nutritional, and psychological needs of children and adolescents with eating disorders. This paper reviews current research outlining the differences between child, adolescent, and adult eating disorders. Research is then reviewed concerning the effectiveness of hospitalization, partial hospitalization, individual dynamic therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, family therapy, and medication for treating anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and related eating disorders in children and adolescents.

This algorithm is an implementation of the top-down induction method where the tree is determined iteratively by adding those nodes and branches which maximize the information gain at each step. The tree was derived from a training set of 200 FNAB with known outcome using 10 defined features (from one observer) and patient age. The tree contained a total of seven nodes (six observable features and patient age) with eight endpoints (four benign, four malignant). The tree was applied to a test set of 400 further FNAB with observations from the training observer and produced a sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 93% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of a malignant result of 89%. Four trainee pathologists were given a training session on the observable features and then used the tree to determine outcome in a further 50 FNAB. The observers were blind to clinical details apart from age and the endpoints were coded with letters and not labelled benign or malignant. The results from these observers produced ranges of sensitivity 80-96%, specificity 64-92%, PPV 73-92% and K statistics (with known outcome) 0.6-0.8. Reported difficulties in using the tree included estimation of nuclear size. These results were worse than the performance of the observers on a further 50 cases without using the decision tree (sensitivity 80-100%, specificity 72-100%, PPV 78-100%, kappa 0.72-0.92). The original 50 case test set was rerandomized and the four trainee observers made all 10 defined observations on each specimen without using the decision tree; these observations were then used to derive decisions from the tree. The performance from this method was similar to that using selected features from the tree, suggesting that observation of all features together does not improve the reliability of each specific observation. The poor performance of this tree suggests that this methodology may be unsuitable for producing decision support aids for diagnostic or training purposes in this domain.

J	Eandi, M; Zara, GP				Eandi, M; Zara, GP			Economic impact of resistance in the community	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Article							STREPTOCOCCUS-PNEUMONIAE; ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE; ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE; PENICILLIN; INFLUENZAE; CHILDREN; EUROPE	Antimicrobial resistance is assumed to be an important health problem and an economic burden to society. However, the relationship between the emergence of in vitro microbiological resistance and its clinical and socioeconomic consequences has not yet been satisfactorily determined for either nosocomial or community-acquired infection. In the case of both nosocomial and community-acquired infection, previous exhaustive reviews of published and unpublished reports concluded that mortality, likelihood of hospitalization, and length of hospital stay were usually at least twice as great for patients infected with drug-resistant strains as for those infected with drug-susceptible strains of the same bacteria. However, evaluation of the economic impact of resistance is still problematic and the adverse economic and health effects of drug-resistant bacterial infections can only be roughly quantified. Decision analysis models, such as decision trees, can aid evaluation of the impact of resistance on health and economic outcomes from the perspective of a given decision maker. A model of cost analysis should be based on a knowledge of the incremental consumption of resources specifically dependent on the dynamics of antimicrobial resistance in a given clinical setting (e.g. home care or hospital care). In general, we can assume that the increased rate of isolation of resistant strains from community-acquired infections correlates positively with an increase in morbidity, mortality risk of hospitalization and the need for additional days in hospital and for more expensive and powerful antibiotics. We implemented and simulated a general decision-tree model to analyse the influence of antibiotic resistance on the economic outcomes of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections, from the perspective of both society and the health-care local organization (HCLO). This model allows simulation of the impact of different degrees of resistance on the direct costs of an antibiotic therapy as well as on the cost-effectiveness of antibiotics with different degrees of resistance.

Considering a "probe" to be an oracle that tells us whether or not a model is present at a given point, we study the problem of computing efficient strategies ("decision trees") for probing an image, with the goal to minimize the number of probes necessary (in the worst case) to determine which single model is present. We shaw that a inverted right perpendicular lg k inverted left perpendicular height binary decision tree always exists for k polygonal models (in fixed position), provided (1) they are non-degenerate (do not share boundaries) and (2) they share a common point of intersection. Further, we give an efficient algorithm for constructing such decision tress when the models are given as a set of polygons in the plane. We show that constructing a minimum height tree is NP-complete if either of the two assumptions is omitted. We provide an efficient greedy heuristic strategy and show that, in the general case, it yields a decision tree whose height is at most inverted right perpendicular lg k inverted left perpendicular times that of an optimal tree. Finally, we discuss some restricted cases whose special structure allows for improved results.

J	Sahraoui, Z; Catthoor, F; Six, P; De Man, H				Sahraoui, Z; Catthoor, F; Six, P; De Man, H			Techniques for reducing the number of decisions and backtracks in combinational test generation	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC TESTING-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						ATPG; supergate; prime-and-irredundant; BDD	TEST PATTERN GENERATION; ALGORITHM; CIRCUITS	Combinational test pattern generation (TPG) is basically a search in a finite state space. In general, the search is performed in a branch-and-bound fashion. The branch-and-bound search builds a decision tree using two basic operations: decision making and backtracking. The size of the decision tree, and hence the efficiency of the branch-and-bound search, is directly dependent on the number of decisions made. This paper proposes a set of novel techniques for reducing the number of decisions and the size of the decision space. These techniques work directly on the maximum number of potential ways of justifying a given logical assignment. This maximum number is reduced by exploiting the properties of prime-and-irredundant covers. These same properties are also used to reduce the number of backtracks by implying a maximum number of necessary assignments. The reduction of the number of decisions and the identification of a maximum of necessary assignments make the proposed TPG method highly efficient as demonstrated by experimental results. This paper also proposes a novel combination of prime-and-irredundant cover extraction and transitive closure computation for a more efficient TPG process.

The new Iearning algorithm also adopts a tree-pruning mechanism to avoid overfitting problems. The new algorithm decreases both the tree size and error rate, especially for complex classification problems. Furthermore, it is not necessary for users to lay out the structure of a tree net in advance; instead, the structure is automatically constructed in the tree-growing process. Finally, the results of experiments in diagnosing brain tumors and classifying sugar canes are described to compare the proposed algorithm with two other learning methods, the back-propagation learning algorithm and ASSISTANT, in terms of accuracy, knowledge complexity and learning speed. Experimental results show that the proposed learning algorithm can provide a good trade-off between accuracy, knowledge complexity and learning speed.

Methods: The WHO algorithm on urethral discharge with no microscopy available was evaluated. Patients presented with a complaint of urethral discharge and if discharge was confirmed the algorithm was applied. Treatment covered gonococcal and chlamydial infection (ciprofloxacin 500 mg single oral dose plus doxycycline 100 mg, twice daily orally for 7 days). The gold standard for validation was gonococcal culture and chlamydia antigen detection. Results: 140 male patients with a complaint of urethral discharge were enrolled; 119 had confirmed discharge and entered the decision tree: 107 were followed and 104 (97%) were clinically cured. Of the three patients with persistent discharge, one had a purulent urethral discharge, diagnosed as gonococcal urethritis and he was probably reinfected; two patients had a serous discharge and microbiological tests were negative. Overall, 106 out of 107 patients (99%) were microbiologically cured. Sensitivity of the algorithm is 100% and its positive predictive value (PPV) is 75% or 97% if validated against gold standard microbiological tests or Gram stain, respectively. Cost per patient is rupiah (Rp)5.894 ($US2.56) for the algorithm compared with Rp43.024 ($18.70) for full microbiological diagnosis. The cost estimate for an algorithm of urethral discharge with microscopy available is Rp6.432 ($2.80) Conclusion: The "symptom and sign" algorithm is fully adapted to the prevailing situation in primary healthcare settings, is acceptable to healthcare workers and patients (who are effectively treated at their first visit), is highly cost effective, is 100% sensitive (no false negatives, which is not the case with microbiological diagnosis), and has a high PPV, between 75% and 97%. It is an excellent patient management tool and a sound basis for partner notification so that it should have a major impact on STD/HIV control and prevention in both men and women.

For this purpose, we build language models for printable characters (letters), based on the Brown corpus. We consider two classes of models for the text generation process: the n-gram language model and various decision tree based language models. In the first part of the paper, we compare the most popular smoothing algorithms applied to the former. We conclude that the bottom-up deleted interpolation algorithm performs the best in the task of n-gram letter language model smoothing, significantly outperforming the back-off smoothing technique for large values of n. In the second part of the paper, we consider various decision tree development algorithms. Among them, a K-means clustering type algorithm for the design of the decision tree questions gives the best results. However, the n-gram language model outperforms the decision tree language models for letter language modeling. We believe that this is due to the predictive nature of letter strings, which seems to be naturally modeled by n-grams, (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Depending on the severity of the disease, annual outpatient costs range from $1400 to $6600 per patient, totaling $3.2 billion each year in the United States. Because the disease is persistent and progressive, patients receiving a diagnosis of psoriasis early in life can expect to require lifelong care, which translates into lifelong expense. Treatments include topical formulations, systemic therapies, phototherapies, and combination therapies. Of these, topical agents are the first-line treatments, including fluocinonide and other steroids, calcipotriene, and tazarotene, a once-daily retinoid. To establish the relative cost-effectiveness of these drugs (fluocinonide, calcipotriene, and tazarotene), we conducted a pharmacoeconomic study from the perspective of a third-party payer, using a decision-analytic model validated by clinical experts. Data were drawn from a metaanalysis of the contemporary medical literature. Clinical success, clearing, and relapse rates determined the probabilities for therapeutic outcomes and the number of anticipated disease-free days for each study comparator. Costs for physician visits, drug acquisition, laboratory testing, and adverse-events management were added to each branch of the decision tree and multiplied by the appropriate probabilities to establish the expected cost of treatment, stratified by the primary treatment choice. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as the total expected cost of achieving a disease-free day. Tazarotene 0.1% was 16.74% more cost-effective than tazarotene 0.05%, 85.46% more cost-effective than fluocinonide, and 143.75% more cost-effective than calcipotriene. The expected cost of achieving a disease-free day was $49.46 for tazarotene 0.1%, $57.74 for tazarotene 0.05%, $91.73 for fluocinonide, and $120.56 for calcipotriene.

J	Daniel, S; Le Leannec, F; Roux, C; Solaiman, B; Maillard, EP				Daniel, S; Le Leannec, F; Roux, C; Solaiman, B; Maillard, EP			Side-scan sonar image matching	IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						hypothetical reasoning; matching; sonar images; viewpoint invariance		This paper presents a method for the matching of underwater images acquired with acoustic sensors. As a final objective, the system aims at matching data from two-dimensional scenes. The proposed approach carries out a hypothetical reasoning based on objects, represented by shadows and echoes in the sonar images, and their available features. The problem of determining measures which are invariant to changes in sonar settings and noise characteristics is addressed by mapping robust features for sonar images to a qualitative representation. To cope with the viewpoint changing appearance, the method is based on the conservation of objects' relative position from one image to another. We attempt to match geometrical structures formed by the association of three objects. The hypothetical reasoning is conducted in a decision tree framework. A tree node is generated by two objects' association, each one belonging to a respective image. Hypotheses propagation consists of creating new nodes from neighboring associations. The matching solution is determined by the selection of the decision tree's longest branch. Thus, the association mechanism is a depth-first procedure. The proposed method has been applied to real high-resolution side-scab sonar images. The matching process has shown successful and promising results which have been further improved. In particular, the parceled shadows (during the segmentation procedure) problem has been tackled.

J	Wong, JSK; Nayar, R; Mikler, AR				Wong, JSK; Nayar, R; Mikler, AR			A framework for a World Wide Web-based Data Mining system	JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS			English	Article								The phenomenal growth of the World Wide Web (WWW) introduces new vistas for trade and commerce. In addition to overcoming the difficulties of distances, cultures and languages, the WWW provides another important business resource: information. Spurred on by the development of better data storage and retrieval techniques, companies are beginning to provide more information about themselves and their activities. This widespread information dissemination necessitates the development of tools which can process it, The application of machine learning algorithms to this vast quantity of data can yield useful information, which can be used for individual and corporate decision support. One example of many possible applications of Data Mining, the system described in this paper, deals with stock-market data available on certain Web-sites. It classifies these stocks as buy or sell using the decision tree technique. The user interaction is through a Web browser, which makes the Web-based nature of the data gathering and processing transparent to the user. A number of experiments are conducted to gauge the performance of the classification. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

J	Lin, JR; Chen, CF				Lin, JR; Chen, CF			Applying hashing search and fuzzy fault-tolerant algorithms for the fast recognition of multi-font printed Chinese characters	JOURNAL OF THE CHINESE INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERS			English	Article						Chinese character recognition; hashing search; graph-associative mapping; fuzzy fault-tolerant	DECISION TREE; MODEL	In this paper, we apply hashing search and fuzzy fault-tolerant recognition algorithms for multi-font printed Chinese character categories. Every Chinese character category is considered as a graph and represented by the graph description matrix which consists of the types of all its strokes and the spatial relations among strokes. A graph-associative memory is used to contain the pair (graph, content) for which f (graph) = content, where f is the associative mapping function and the content is the associative index of the graph. The associative map ping function f is designed to be a simple arithmetic function by using the hashing technique. Thus, the transformation is performed quickly by mapping the graph to its associative index. In consideration of practical situations where the input characters may be skewed or the thickness of them may be varied when they are acquired from an input device, an attributed relational graph is utilized to represent the Chinese character, and a fuzzy deformation model for the attributed relational graph is developed to construct a fault tolerant algorithm with N modular redundancy. The experimental results show that these techniques make the recognition work well.

More precisely, given a decision instance represented by a node in the decision tree, the network provides the degree of membership of each possible move to the fuzzy set "good move". These fuzzy values constitute the core of the probability of selecting the move out of the set of the children of the current node. This results in a natural way for driving the sharp discrete-state process running along the decision tree by means of incremental methods on the continuous-valued parameters of the neural network. The bulk of the learning problem consists in stating useful links between the local decisions about the next move and the global decisions about the suitability of the final solution. The peculiarity of the learning task is that the network has to deal explicitly with the twofold charge of lighting up the best solution and generating the move sequence that leads to that solution. We tested various options for the learning procedure on the problem of disambiguating natural language sentences. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Linked to a computerized diagnostic algorithm, the MILP is able to establish diagnoses according to DSM-III-X, International Classification of Diseases-10th Edition (ICD-10), and DSM-IV criteria, as well as a range of other criteria relevant to consultation-liaison psychiatry. Interrater reliability was assessed with 54 joint interviews, in which the mean kappa for agreement of items was 0.83 and of diagnoses was 0.68, Comparative procedural validity was tested against DSM-III-R decision-tree diagnoses, ICD-10 checklist diagnoses, and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R interview diagnoses on another sample of 54 patients. Mean kappas for these comparisons were 0.61, 0.56, and 0.31, respectively. As predicted, the MILP more fully covered the spectrum of somatizing disorders, compared with the other methods for establishing diagnoses.

J	Bastian, O; Roder, M				Bastian, O; Roder, M			Assessment of landscape change by land evaluation of past and present situation	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						land evaluation; landscape functions; natural potentials; ecological assessment; landscape change		The analysis of only single landscape attributes, like land use pattern, landscape elements, habitat structures, species and biocoenoses at different times is not sufficient to grasp the character of landscape change, especially with regard to the functional aspects. For this, the approach of land evaluation with the help of landscape functions and natural potentials is much more suitable. The assessment of landscape functions is also a supposition to formulate ecological targets of landscape development, on the conditions of landscape changes which continuously increase. The investigation took place within two rural test areas in the hilly zone of Saxony (Germany). At least twice (as a rule in the thirties and the eighties) the following landscape functions were assessed: biotic productivity, resistance of soils to water erosion, water retention capacity, recharge and protection of ground water, and potential for recreation within nature. The special methodologies (including advantages and shortcomings) are described, the past and present situations in the test areas are characterized, and the tendencies of the development are outlined. Additionally, an approach (a decision tree) for the elaboration of landscape-ecological targets and measures is presented. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	McCombs, JS				McCombs, JS			Pharmacoeconomics: What is it and where is it going?	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HYPERTENSION			English	Article						pharmacoeconomics; clinical economics; quality-of-life; cost-effectiveness analysis; cost per quality-adjusted life-year	COST-EFFECTIVENESS; CARE	The use of economic analyses as they pertain to the practice of medicine has become increasingly commonplace. Driven by both changes to reimbursement incentives and the clinical practice of medicine, these analyses have the potential to answer many of the questions posed by the delivery of health care in a fiscally responsible era. As such, the health economist is faced with the increasingly important role of providing data and insights key to the deliberative process of comparing the costs and benefits of medical care. To this end, health economists rely on a number of tools in the practice of pharmacoeconomics. The most common tool is a cost-effectiveness analysis, which compares the clinical effects of alternative therapies (mortality, morbidity) to their net costs. A relatively new tool to the field of clinical economics, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year has the potential of becoming the gold standard in clinical economics for measuring clinical effects if further refinement to measurement technique is achieved. All of these tools have as their outcome the development of a medical decision model or decision tree. These decision trees have four components: disease outcome stales; the probability of transition between disease states; the costs, financial benefits, and effects incurred by patients in each outcome state; and risk groups. Data from a wide range of sources, including randomized clinical trials and retrospective analyses of data collected from clinical practice settings, are drawn upon in the development of decision trees. Although economists can help design these models and document the costs and effects of alternative therapies, it is physicians and consumers who will ultimately have to make the decisions that recognize that spending resources on one disease or risk group decreases the resources available to treat other diseases or risk groups.

J	Oates, A; Jackson, PR; Austin, CA; Channer, KS				Oates, A; Jackson, PR; Austin, CA; Channer, KS			A new regimen for starting warfarin therapy in out-patients	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						anticoagulation; atrial fibrillation; warfarin	ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION; RISK-FACTORS; ANTICOAGULATION; OUTPATIENTS; INTENSITY	Aims Oral anticoagulation is increasingly used in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation to prevent embolic phenomena. The use of anticoagulants in this population is prophylactic rather than therapeutic and so there is no urgency to establish anticoagulation within the des:red therapeutic range. The aim of the study was to develop an out-patient regimen for initiation of oral anticoagulation with warfarin which requires only weekly monitoring of the International Normalized Ratio (INR). Methods The study was undertaken in two phases. In the first phase, factors which predict the final maintenance dosage of warfarin were defined and used to build a decision tree and dosage algorithm. In the second study the algorithm was tested. Patients were given 2 mg warfarin daily for 2 weeks and the INR at this time was used to predict the maintenance dose. Patients then attended for weekly measurements of the INR until steady state had been reached. Dosage adjustments were not made unless the INR was >4.0 or <1.5 for 2 consecutive weeks. The accuracy of the prediction was measured by calculating the mean INR of weeks 6-8 and the number of patients in the target range 2.0-3.0 was determined. Results One hundred and seven consecutive out-patients (mean age 70 years range 64-86) completed the first study. The age, sex, height, weight, alcohol intake, number of cigarettes smoked, concomitant medication, clinical evidence of right heart failure,:liver failure, abnormalities in Liver enzyme estimations, baseline INR and INR after 2 weeks of 2 mg warfarin daily were used in a polytomous logistic regression analysis with stepwise inclusion of factors to determine which factors influenced the eventual maintenance dosage of warfarin. The INR after 2 weeks of 2 mg warfarin therapy predicted 70% of the variability of the maintenance dose. Of other factors only the sex of the patient had a large enough effect to be included in the prediction algorithm. One hundred and six patients (mean age 71 years range 50-85 years) completed the second study. Only one patient needed a dose adjustment in the first 2 weeks of warfarin 2 mg daily (INR 4.4). Overall, 60% patients were in the narrow target range (INK 2.0-3.0) at steady state. In five patients the INR was >4.0 at any visit after the second week and needed dosage adjustment. In four patients the IT JR was <1.5 at steady state. Conclusions We have developed a method of predicting the maintenance dose of warfarin in an elderly population based on the INR after 2 weeks of warfarin 2 mg daily, and the sex of the patient. This is a safe and convenient way of initiating warfarin therapy as an out-patient which requires only weekly INR checks.

Distinguishing chronic pancreatitis horn pancreatic adenocarcinomas is often difficult, and is based on routine brush cytological specimens provided during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Reactive epithelial changes in chronic pancreatitis may appear similar to those of a well-differentiated cancer. Brush cytology specimens were obtained during ERCP from 49 patients with diseases for which the differential diagnosis included chronic pancreatitis and/or pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Image cytometry was performed involving the assessment of between 200-400 Feulgen-stained nuclei per case; for each case, 40 quantitative cytometric variables were generated. Data analysis was performed using artificial intelligence methods of data classification that produced decision trees and production rule systems. Different classification models were produced for a subset of 34 patients, The best models were identified by the use of a sampling technique (leave-one-out), and were tested on the remaining 15 patients. These models were based on 5 of the 40 variables associated with a significant discriminatory function. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in the training data set of 34 patients during a leave-one-out process with an estimated sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 87%. Both sensitivity and specificity were 80% in the independent test set of 15 patients.

We ask whether inclusion of slate and frequency dependence will provide new insights when compared with game-free life-history theory. We model a simple biological scenario in which a prey animal must switch from a low-predation, low-growth habitat to a high-predation, high-growth habitat, To assess the importance of frequency dependence, we compare the results of four scenarios of increasing complexity: (1) no predation; (2) constant predation; (3) frequency-dependent predation (predation risk diluted at high prey density), and (4) frequency-dependent predation as in (3) but with predators allowed to respond adaptively to prey behaviour. State dependence is included in all scenarios through initial size, assumed to be environmental. A genetic algorithm is used to search for optimal solutions to the scenarios. We find substantially different results in the four different scenarios and suggest a decision tree by which biological systems could be tested to ascertain which scenario is most applicable.

J	Holmberg, H; Carlsson, P; Lofman, O; Varenhorst, E				Holmberg, H; Carlsson, P; Lofman, O; Varenhorst, E			Economic evaluation of screening for prostate cancer: a randomized population based programme during a 10-year period in Sweden	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						prostate cancer; screening; economic evaluation; decision model	CARCINOMA	Prostate cancer is a growing health problem representing considerable costs. Screening and early curative treatment may reduce morbidity and possibly prevent future escalating costs. However, population screening programmes are generally not well accepted at present due to uncerainty about whether screening for prostate cancer can result in reduced mortality. Evidence from large, randomized, controlled trials is still lacking. The objective of this study was to calculate clinical and economic consequences of general prostate cancer screening based on a limited screening trial in a Swedish community and a decision-tree model. A random selection of 1492 men (50-69 years) were invited to repeated screening in 1987, They have been examined every third year (four rounds). The other 7679 men in the population act as controls. The results show that the total incremental health care costs for prostate cacer will increase by 179 million SEK per year with screening compared to no-screening. The number of detected cases of localized cancer will increase by about 1000, which represents an additional cost of about 158 000 SEK per case. In conclusion, general screening for prostate cancer can be performed with a reasonable cost per detected localized cancer. Information on the long-term effect on life quality and cancer mortality is unknown. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ho, TK				Ho, TK			The random subspace method for constructing decision forests	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						pattern recognition; decision tree; decision forest; stochastic discrimination; decision combination; classifier combination; multiple-classifier system; bootstrapping	CLASSIFIERS; SYSTEMS; DESIGN	Much of previous attention on decision trees focuses on the splitting criteria and optimization of tree sizes. The dilemma between overfitting and achieving maximum accuracy is seldom resolved. A method to construct a decision tree based classifier is proposed that maintains highest accuracy on training data and improves on generalization accuracy as it grows in complexity. The classifier consists of multiple trees constructed systematically by pseudorandomly selecting subsets of components of the feature vector, that is, trees constructed in randomly chosen subspaces. The subspace method is compared to single-tree classifiers and other forest construction methods by experiments on publicly available datasets, where the method's superiority is demonstrated. We also discuss independence between trees in a forest and relate that to the combined classification accuracy.

Particularly, rule induction approaches constitute prominent machine learning methods that lead to avoid the disadvantages of the decision tree. The fuzzy incremental production rule (FIPR) based system is a rule induction system that generates imprecise and uncertain IF-THEN rules from data records. It allows the incremental maintenance of the knowledge base with a minimal overhead. The precision analysis with real world data sets, and the complexity analysis are used to compare this system with existing ones and to prove the usefulness of fuzzy knowledge representation.

MEDICINE AND SCIENCE IN SPORTS AND EXERCISE			English	Article						cardiorespiratory fitness; maximal oxygen uptake; physical performance; functional limitations; aged; disability	HEALTH; PERFORMANCE; DISABILITY; MACARTHUR; DECLINE; COMMUNITY; VALIDITY; FITNESS; SPLINES; ELDERS	Purpose: Few studies have examined the relationship between directly measured oxygen uptake ((V) over dot O-2) and self-reported physical function (PF). The purpose of this study was: 1) to examine the relationship between peak (V) over dot O-2 and PF and 2) to determine whether a threshold or cut point exists that distinguishes between individuals reporting required assistance in the performance of functional tasks (low PF) and those who report ability to perform tasks independently (high PF). Methods: Participants were 161 community-dwelling adults, ages 65-90, who had a baseline evaluation for a clinical trial that included measurement of peak (V) over dot O-2 and PF. PF consisted of a summary score combining scores from the Older Americans Resources and Services Multidimensional Functional Assessment Questionnaire, Nagi Disability Study, Rosow-Breslau Scale, Physical Function Scale of the Medical Outcomes Study, and the Falls Efficacy Scale. Decision tree, cubic spline, and logistic regression analyses explored these relationships with age, gender, education, race, body mass index, depression, and total number of chronic diseases included as important covariates. Results: Among all covariates examined, peak (V) over dot O-2 was most strongly associated with (P = 0.004) with PF. There was no threshold effect. Decision tree analyses indicated that 18.3 mL . kg(-1) . min(-1) was the optimal cut point distinguishing between low PF and high PF (P < 0.0001). Between-gender differences in PF(P = 0.002) were no longer significant when peak (V) over dot O-2 was included in the PF model (P = 0.17). Conclusions: These data indicate that individuals with a peak (V) over dot O-2 < 18 mL . k(-1) . min(-1) report significant difficulty in the performance of daily tasks and that differences in peak (V) over dot O-2 may explain, in part, why women report more impairment in PF.

Methods: A decision tree was developed. Selected variables based on assumptions were subjected to sensitivity analyses to make the model accurate and defensible. Results: Screening for chlamydial infections using the PCR test was shown to be cost-effective even in low-prevalence populations. Compared with a symptom-driven no-screening situation, a universal C trachomatis screening program using the PCR test would save money, in terms of direct cost, when the baseline prevalence of C trachomatis infection exceeds 3.9%. Conclusion: Cost analyses are still rare among trials that compare pharmacologic or procedural health care interventions. Socioeconomic studies linking secondary prevention of C trachomatis infection and infertility and adverse pregnancy outcome are needed to convince public health authorities of the need for and the benefit of such programs.

J	Benioff, P				Benioff, P			Quantum robots and environments	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							MECHANICAL AUTOMATA; COMPUTATION; COMPUTERS; NETWORKS; STATES; CANNOT	Quantum robots and their interactions with environments of quantum systems are described, and their study justified. A quantum robot is a mobile quantum system that includes an on-board quantum computer and needed ancillary systems. Quantum robots carry out tasks whose goals include specified changes in the state of the environment, or carrying out measurements on the environment. Each task is a sequence of alternating computation and action phases. Computation phase activites include determination of the action to be carried out in the next phase, and recording of information on neighborhood environmental system states. Action phase activities include motion of the quantum robot and changes in the neighborhood environment system states. Models of quantum robots and their interactions with environments are described using discrete space and time. A unitary step operator T that gives the single time step dynamics is associated with each task. T=T-a+T-c is a sum of action phase and computation phase step operators. Conditions that T-a and T-c should satisfy are given along with a description of the evolution as a sum over paths of completed phase input and output states. A simple example of a task-carrying out a measurement on a very simple environment-is analyzed in detail. A decision tree for the task is presented and discussed in terms of the sums over phase paths. It is seen that no definite times or durations are associated with the phase steps in the tree, and-that the tree describes the successive phase steps in each path in the sum over phase paths.

J	Kolodny, EH				Kolodny, EH			Mucolipidoses: Clinical and genetic aspects	REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA			Spanish	Article						I-cell disease; lysosomal enzymes; mucolipidosis; pseudoHurler polydystrophy; sialidosis; sialyloligosaccharides; skin biopsy	DISEASE	Introduction. The concept of the mucolipidoses developed as the result of encounters with patients whose clinical appearance suggested a mucopolysaccharidosis, i,e, coarse facies, short stature, skeletal dysplasia, joint contractures and lysosomal accumulations brit did not have an excess of mucopolysaccharides in their urine. Development. This clinical phenotype embraces the early onset forms of sialidosis (mucolipidosis I), as well as 1-cell disease (mucolipidosis II) and pseudoHurler polydystrophy (mucolipidosis III). Two disorders that were Inter added to the mucolipidoses, the Cherry-red Spot Myoclonus Epilepsy Syndrome (sialidosis type I) and mucolipidosis IV differ in that the facial appearance is normal and they do not have skeletal dysmorphism. Enzyme deficiencies have been identified iii mucolipidosis I, II and III. The basic molecular cause of mucolipidosis IV is not known but linkage analysis is underway to identify the chromosomal map position of the defective gene. Precise diagnosis of these autosomal recessively inherited diseases depends upon radiographic studies Sor skeletal dysplasias, analyses of urine for sialyloligosaccharides, morphologic studies of bone marrow and skirt biopsy specimens and enzymatic determinations of sialidase and UDP-N-acelylglucosamine: lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. Conclusions. Case descriptions from the author's experience ar e presented to illustrate the use of a decision tree employing these diagnostic modalities. The existence of naturally-occurring animal models for sialidase deficiency (SM/J mouse) and the phosphotransferase deficiency (mucolipidosis III cat) provide opportunities to develop new therapeutic approaches [REV NEUROL 1998, 27: 337-41].

Children aged 1-4 years are 5.03% of the whole population of the district. Complex injury attributes were analysed. Binary attributes were classified as input: age, gender, place of injury; and output: severity of injury. A new application of information entropy was introduced and applied to the classification of injury-causes attributes. The information entropy was calculated for the classification of input attributes according to the minimum information content. The decision procedure is given as a sequential procedure separating important from unimportant causes of injury at each decision level. Thus a decision tree with increasing entropy, i.e. decreasing determinism, was obtained showing that age (0.5347 N), place (0.6062 N) and gender (0.6105 N) are measurable attributes in child injury ascertainment in a descending pattern. It was shown that this method is, at the same time, an optimal way of using an attribute decision process of injury causes classification. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

We present an exact learning algorithm with a polynomial query complexity for the class of functions representable as f(x) = (n)Pi(i=1) A(i)(x(i)), where, for each 1 less than or equal to i less than or equal to n, A(i) is a mapping A(i): X --> Rmi x mi+1 and m(1) = m(n+1) = 1. We show that the above algorithm implies the following results: 1. Multivariate polynomials over a finite commutative ring with identity are learnable using equivalence and substitution queries. 2. Bounded degree multivariate polynomials over Z(n) can be interpolated using substitution queries. 3. The class of constant depth circuits that consist of bounded fan-in MOD gates, where the modulus are prime powers of some fixed prime, is learnable using equivalence and substitution queries. Our approach uses a decision tree representation for the hypothesis class which takes advantage of linear dependencies. This paper generalizes the learning algorithm for automata over fields given in [BBB+].

J	McCann, JT				McCann, JT			A conceptual framework for identifying various types of confessions	BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES & THE LAW			English	Article							INTERROGATIVE SUGGESTIBILITY; WRONGFUL CONVICTION; INNOCENT; SCALE	Considerable attention has been given to the psychology of confession evidence in recent years. While various factors have been used to define the types of confessions possible, most classification frameworks have focused on the various types of false confessions. An expanded framework is outlined using a decision-tree model in which confessions are defined according to a number of dimensions, including whether or not a confession is retracted, veracity or truthfulness, legal culpability of the suspect, voluntariness, and specific nature of the coercion that might produce a confession. A proposal is made for a new subtype of false confession, the coerced-reactive type, to supplement current theoretical approaches. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the implications of this conceptual model for providing consultation and expert testimony in cases involving disputed confessions.

We replicated and evaluated a fluorescence metaphase finder previously developed at the Medical Research Council (MRC), Human Genetics Unit (Scotland) and at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL; California), The MRC/LBL system seemed to detect nearly all of the metaphases on the test slides, but it presented an unacceptable number of false positives (about five false positives per one true positive). Furthermore, we determined that the system actually overcalled true detections by counting certain metaphase spreads twice (duplicates), Through modifications of the MRC/LBL system, we developed the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) system, which minimizes the detection of duplicates, incorporates new detection features, uses a binary decision tree (BDT) for classification, and provides functionalities to improve scanning accuracy and improve the post-detection review. To test the new system, DAPI-stained preparations of metaphase chromosomes from blood lymphocytes of four unrelated donors were placed on slides in drops ranging from 7 mm to 20 mm in diameter. Drops contained between 5 and 200 scorable metaphases each, The LLNL system achieved similar to 90% detection of non-duplicated metaphases as verified by an expert cytogeneticist, with typically less than one false positive per every one true positive detected.

In addition, accurate calculations of individual core actual losses is extremely difficult, since actual losses show a divergence up to +/-20%, in relation with the theoretical individual core losses. In this paper a decision tree (DT) method is presented, suitable for the prediction of individual core losses in wound core distribution transformers (T/Fs) at the early stages of the production process. For the creation of the learning and test set actual industrial measurements are used. Data comprise grain oriented steel electrical characteristics, and quality control measurements of cores production line. The resultant DT presents a success rate of 94 %. Based on this DT, rules comprising the most important parameters and their threshold values can be derived. These are used to improve the quality of individual cores by reducing their actual losses.

J	Sonnenberg, A				Sonnenberg, A			Economic constraints in the diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY & HEPATOLOGY			English	Article						Bayes' formula; decision analysis; diagnostic test; dyspepsia; health economics; Helicobacter pylori; peptic ulcer disease	HELICOBACTER-PYLORI; MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES; DYSPEPSIA; ENDOSCOPY	Background The discovery of Helicobacter pylori and its role in upper gastrointestinal disease has changed the outlook on diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease. Objectives To address the questions of what types of diagnostic tests and how many of each type are needed to diagnose among patients with dyspepsia as many ulcers as possible at least cost. Methods Bayes' formula and a decision tree were used to follow the outcomes of alternative test combinations for ulcer diagnosis. Results Assuming unlimited resources, only endoscopy of all subjects results in the correct diagnoses of all ulcers, but costs $5600 per diagnosis. Barium swallow followed by endoscopy is less expensive ($2980), but misses 5% of all ulcers. Serology for H. pylori followed by endoscopy or barium meal provides relatively high diagnostic yields (85 or 81% of all ulcers detected) at lower costs ($2900 or $1050 per ulcer diagnosis, respectively). In general, a higher number of ulcers is found at a lower cost if the cheap tests are used to screen patients before subjecting them to the more expensive tests. Conclusions The ideal work-up depends on the urgency of a correct diagnosis, the willingness to miss some ulcer diagnoses and the availability of resources. H. pylori serology followed by endoscopy or barium meal represents two cost-effective strategies. Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol 10:765-769 (C) 1998 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

J	Messmer, BT; Bunke, H				Messmer, BT; Bunke, H			Error-correcting graph isomorphism using decision trees	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						graph isomorphism; error correction; decision trees; graph matching	ALGORITHM	In this paper we present a fast algorithm for the computation of error-correcting graph isomorphisms. The new algorithm is an extension of a method for exact subgraph isomorphism detection from an input graph to a set of a priori known model graphs, which was previously developed by the authors. Similar to the original algorithm, the new method is based on the idea of creating a decision tree from the model graphs. This decision tree is compiled off-line in a preprocessing step. At run time, it is used to find all error-correcting graph isomorphisms from an input graph to any of the model graphs up to a certain degree of distortion. The main advantage of the new algorithm is that error-correcting graph isomorphism detection is guaranteed to require time that is only polynomial in terms of the size of the input graph. Furthermore, the time complexity is completely independent of the number of model graphs and the number of edges in each model graph. However, the size of the decision tree is exponential in the size of the model graphs and the degree of error. Nevertheless, practical experiments have indicated that the method can be applied to graphs containing up to 16 vertices.

Screening for precursors of cervical cancer with colposcopic examination for women with abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) smears identifies those with cervical dysplasia. Though the majority of mild dysplasias (CIN I) will regress, many are treated with cryotherapy. METHODS. We used decision analysis to compare immediate cryotherapy with expectant management (following with another Pap smear or colposcopy, with treatment reserved for progression or a duration of 2 years). The decision tree included the possibility of more invasive surgical procedures if the cryotherapy was ineffective or if the dysplasia progressed in extent of cervical involvement or in grade. Probabilities were derived from literature review and expert judgment. The analysis considered the disutility of the follow-up examinations, cryotherapy, and the more invasive procedures, using expert assessment. RESULTS. Using the baseline assumptions, expectant management led to a better outcome for most patients (57%), who recover with no procedure. However, more patients treated with expectant management required surgical procedures (loop electrosurgical excisional procedure, conization, or, rarely, hysterectomy) than did those treated with immediate cryotherapy. In the expected disutility analysis, expectant management was better than immediate cryotherapy. Sensitivity analysis showed that three factors had the potential to change the recommendation of the analysis: (1) the probability the dysplasia will regress, (2) the disutility of the process of expectant management, and (3) the disutility of invasive procedures compared with cryotherapy. CONCLUSIONS. The analysis indicated that expectant management is preferable to immediate cryotherapy for women with histologically proven mild cervical dysplasia, However, this conclusion depended on assumptions about three factors for which there is insufficient evidence in the literature. More research is needed.

J	Andres, BA				Andres, BA			Shoreline habitat use of black oystercatchers breeding in Prince William Sound, Alaska	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY			English	Article								To guide habitat acquisition for species negatively affected by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, I quantified habitat use of Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani) breeding in Prince William Sound, Alaska. I used local counts of breeding pairs and Sound-wide transect counts of individuals to determine shoreline features that explained variation in oystercatcher density. Density of pairs, and occurrence of individuals, was greater in areas dominated by shorelines of gradual slopes than in areas dominated by steep shorelines. Within areas dominated by steep, rocky shorelines, breeding density increased as the proportion of mixed sand and gravel beaches and as the number of rocks and small islands increased. Shoreline features that explained variation in local pair density were corroborated by data from Sound-wide surveys. I incorporated information from other studies to construct a general, qualitative decision-tree model that predicts that disturbance-free shorelines of gradual slopes should support the highest densities of breeding Black Oystercatchers. Qualitative and quantitative models should be tested to determine their applicability to shoreline habitat throughout the oystercatcher's range.

J	Mohaupt, SM; Sharma, KK				Mohaupt, SM; Sharma, KK			Forensic implications and medical-legal dilemmas of maternal versus fetal rights	JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES			English	Article						forensic science; maternal rights; fetal rights; medical dilemmas; legal dilemmas; decision tree		The purpose of this paper is to review the issue of fetal rights from primarily a legal perspective, with consideration of morals and professional ethics. The practice of medicine is fraught with numerous bioethical dilemmas. These dilemmas often leave the physician wondering if he has made the correct decision. A physician's morals and professional ethics may influence his or her decision in resolving bioethical dilemmas. The case example is a 34-year-old female with a 41-week intrauterine pregnancy. The mother was refusing induction of labor. Without the labor induction, the fetus may die. Despite this risk, the mother desired to pursue a vaginal delivery. The AMA's ethics state that a competent, pregnant mother's wishes should prevail and the court should not be involved unless there are unusual circumstances. The mother in the case example was competent and informed consent was provided. Case law does not specifically address the dilemma of the case example. However, there is case law regarding court-ordered cesarean sections which reveals different opinions. The difference in court opinion encompasses the relative degree of weight given to the fetus's right to be bent healthy and alive versus the mother's privacy rights. Some courts describe this ''balancing test," whereas others state that the mother's privacy rights prevail unless there are exceptional circumstances, which will be extremely rare. The fetus has acquired rights in other areas of the law. for example, abolishment of the intra-family immunity doctrine and the definition of murder in most states. In considering the legal arena of fetal versus maternal rights, a decision tree is presented to assist physicians in assessing cases of a pregnant mother refusing medical treatment. There is no precise demarcation in assessing fetal and maternal rights. The greater the degree of fetal viability, the greater degree of fetal rights. Consideration must also be given to the relative degree of invasiveness to the mother for the proposed procedure: the more invasive, the greater degree of maternal rights. Each case must be evaluated on an individual basis and the decision tree can assist a clinician with this process.

J	Clark, DE; El-Taha, M				Clark, DE; El-Taha, M			Generation of correlated logistic-normal random variates for medical decision trees	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						decision tree; probabilistic; Monte Carlo; correlation; logistic-normal	DISTRIBUTIONS	A Logistic-Normal random variable (Y) is obtained from a Normal random variable (X) by the relation Y = (e(X))/(1 + e(X)). In Monte-Carlo analysis of decision trees, Logistic-Normal random variates may be used to model the branching probabilities. In some cases, the probabilities to be modeled may not be independent, and a method for generating correlated Logistic-Normal random variates would be useful. A technique for generating correlated Normal random variates has been previously described. Using Taylor Series approximations and the algebraic definitions of variance and covariance, we describe methods for estimating the means, variances, and covariances of Normal random variates which, after translation using the above formula, will result in Logistic-Normal random variates having approximately the desired means, variances, and covariances. Multiple simulations of the method using the Mathematica computer algebra system show satisfactory agreement with the theoretical results.

J	Bruins, HH; Koole, R; Jolly, DE				Bruins, HH; Koole, R; Jolly, DE			Pretherapy dental decisions in patients with head and neck cancer - A proposed model for dental decision support	ORAL SURGERY ORAL MEDICINE ORAL PATHOLOGY ORAL RADIOLOGY AND ENDODONTICS			English	Article							RADIATION-THERAPY; PRIMER; OSTEORADIONECROSIS; DENTISTRY; CARIES; PREVALENCE; MANAGEMENT; MEDICINE; QUALITY; HEALTH	Objective. The proposed model was designed to function as a tool for the development and testing of evidence-based clinical guidelines for the pretherapy oral screening and dental management of patients with head and neck cancer. Study Design. Methods of clinical decision analysis were used to analyze the decision dilemma and construct a decision algorithm and decision tree. The robustness of the model was tested by means of a probabilistic sensitivity analysis with second-order Monte Carlo simulations (n = 10.000). Results. Clinical criteria for evaluating dental pathologic conditions and malignancy- and patient-related conditions were transformed in probability estimates. The tradeoffs between the benefits and drawbacks of the dental intervention were integrated into the model to identify the optimal option for dental intervention. The calculation process of "folding back and averaging out" the decision tree enabled the identification of the optimal options for dental intervention in four different pretherapy risk conditions. Conclusions. A priori testing of the proposed model with 95% confidence intervals suggests that it has a great potential for solving clinical dilemmas associated with pretherapy dental decision-making. In addition, it seems a useful tool for the development of evidence-based clinical guidelines. A posteriori clinical testing should further validate the model before its assimilation into clinical practice rakes place.

J	Chung, RC; Walters, MR; Greenfield, MLVH; Chernew, ME				Chung, RC; Walters, MR; Greenfield, MLVH; Chernew, ME			Endoscopic versus open carpal tunnel release: A cost-effectiveness analysis	PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY			English	Article							HEALTH; MEDICINE; POLICY	Endoscopic carpal tunnel release is a controversial procedure used in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. Although endoscopic carpal tunnel release is associated with less incisional pain and faster recovery time than the open carpal tunnel release, opponents of endoscopic carpal tunnel release suggest that its benefits are outweighed by its higher complication rates from median nerve transection and transient numbness of the fingers. Because of the huge economic and social impact of carpal tunnel syndrome in this country, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing endoscopic carpal tunnel release and open carpal tunnel release using guidelines established by the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine of the U.S. Public Health Service. A decision analytic model was used to measure differences in cost and effectiveness-expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)-between endoscopic carpal tunnel release and open carpal tunnel release. The societal perspective was chosen, and probabilities for various outcomes for the two procedures were obtained from published randomized-controlled trials. Cost data were derived from the Medicare Resource-Based Relative Value Units published in the Federal Register. QALYs were obtained from two groups of health care providers using a utility-assessment questionnaire. Using probabilities for various outcomes from the two published randomized-con trolled trials comparing endoscopic carpal tunnel release and open carpal tunnel release, we constructed a decision tree to derive both the cost and the QALYs for the two procedures. The incremental cost difference between endoscopic carpal, tunnel release and open carpal tunnel release was $46, using Medicare cost and probabilities of various outcomes derived from a study by Brown et al. in 1993. We calculated QALYs for five age groups-25, 35, 45, 55, 65-assuming a life expectancy of 75 years. The marginal effectiveness (QALY of endoscopic carpal tunnel release minus QALY of open carpal tunnel release) ranged from 0.235 QALY for the 25-year-old age group to 0.066 QALY for the 65-year-old age group, giving a cost-effectiveness ratio of $195/QALY and $693/QALY, respectively. When compared with other accepted medical interventions such as breast cancer screening ($4836/QALY) and exercise to prevent coronary heart disease ($13,508/QALY), endoscopic carpal tunnel release seems to be cost-effective. However, our sensitivity analysis indicated that the cost-effectiveness ratio was very sensitive to a major complication such as median nerve injury. For endoscopic carpal tunnel release to be a cost-effective procedure, the incidence of median nerve injury must be one percentage point less for endoscopic carpal tunnel release than for open carpal tunnel release. Based on the data from the randomized-controlled trials, endoscopic carpal tunnel release seems to be a cost-effective procedure; however, before it can be recommended, greater emphasis must be given to the training of surgeons in this new technique, so that major complications such as median nerve injuries can be avoided. In addition, future studies must better define the actual incidence of nerve injuries for both endoscopic carpal tunnel release and open carpal tunnel release in the community setting.

Seventy independent properties were stored in tabular format for each pedon. Heuristic knowledge (expert rules) was added to the decision trees to query a minimum data set, with 13 field description properties required to contain data for each soil horizon, 20 default values, and three estimated values from lookup tables. The prototype expert system was developed using an object-oriented expert system shell. Twenty-seven subsections were named in the rules to identify the Histosol, Spodosol, Andisol, and Oxisol soil orders. Sixty-seven objects, 70 independent properties, and 135 calculated properties were needed to define these subsections and their properties. The tested prototype quickly and correctly identified the diagnostic horizons, nonspatial differentiae, and the soil order, proving the feasibility of developing an expert system for Soil Taxonomy, using existing computer programs and programming methods. We recommend improvements in policy and procedure for recording field description data and development of the expert rules to add dynamic links to outside models and software and incorporate fuzzy logic; The project should be continued to improve the prototype interface and data output features and to complete an expert system to add the remaining soil orders for Soil Taxonomy.

J	Tengberg, A; Ellis-Jones, J; Kiome, R; Stocking, M				Tengberg, A; Ellis-Jones, J; Kiome, R; Stocking, M			Applying the concept of agrodiversity to indigenous soil and water conservation practices in eastern Kenya	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						agrodiversity; ISWC; semi-arid; land management; Kenya; Mbeere		Agrodiversity - the diversity of cropping systems, crop species and farm management practices has received increasing attention in recent years as a way of spreading risk and supporting food security in resource-poor farming systems. This paper discusses the dynamic aspects of indigenous soil and water conservation (ISWC) practices in a semi-arid part of Kenya. The objective is to show the range of sources of variability and diversity that prevail in this environment, the responses of farmers to this variability, and the way farmers' rationalise the heterogeneity of soil and water management practices. Methods used included participatory surveys and evaluations, on-farm monitoring, soil and rainfall data analyses, and questionnaire surveys. Sources of variability affecting cropping systems and land management practices included rainfall, soil fertility, farmer resource level and farm productivity. A decision-tree was developed to examine how biophysical and socio-economic variability affected farmers' choice of ISWC. Different ISWC structures dominated on sandy and stony soils, respectively. Low resource farmers tended to choose cheaper and less labour demanding techniques, and constructed smaller ISWC structures than better endowed farmers. The largest diversity of ISWC practices was found on newly-opened land with mixed soils. Moreover, on-farm productivity levels indicated that costly investments in SWC are unfeasible, as this would further increase the risk for negative returns to farming. The wider implications of the results are that SWC interventions in marginal areas should build on the existing agrodiversity and an understanding of the complex interactions between environmental and socio-economic factors that give rise to differences in farming systems and land management practices.

In this work, decision-tree approach to cell phenotype-based prognosis of CLL was adopted. The panel of 33 (32 different phenotypic features and serum concentration of sCD23) parameters was simultaneously presented to the C4.5 decision tree which extracted the most informative of them and subsequently performed classification of CLL patients against the modified Rai staging system. It has been shown that substantial correlation between the percentage of expression of the CD23 molecule on CD19(+) B-cells, the level of sCD23, the percentage of CD45RA(+), and the absolute number of CD4CD45RA(+)RO(+) T-cells and the clinical stages, exists. The prediction vector, composed of their concatenated values, was able to correctly associate 83% of the cases in the low-risk group (Rai stage 0), 100% of the cases in the intermediate-risk group (Rai stage I and II), and 89% of the cases in the high-risk group (Rai stage IB and IV) of CLL patients, Predictivity of this vector was 100%, 95%, and 89%, respectively, In conclusion, from the described analysis, it may be inferred that two processes play important roles in the progression rate of CLL: 1, deregulated function of the CD23 gene in a-cells accompanied by the appearance of its cleaved product sCD23 in the sera; and 2, functionally impaired and imbalanced CD4 T-cell subpopulations found in the peripheral blood of CLL patients, Am.

Only patients with haematological malignancies show sizable response rates after RIT. With solid tumours, intravenous administration of radiolabelled antibodies does not provide sufficient tumour targeting. However, intracompartmental administration may solve this problem, particularly if tumour reactive IgM is used. Clinical progress in RIT depends on understanding the important RIT variables: antigen, antibody, radioisotope, conjugation chemistry, activity escalation, fractionation and protein dose. These are reviewed and a new translational decision tree/flow diagram is presented that can limit analysis to the most important RIT variables for a particular disease. These variables may differ depending on the type and stage of cancer, but the guiding principles in RIT development remain the same: selectivity and accountability. The proper application of these principles leads to the definition of a new series of phase I, ii, III studies. These studies are more appropriate for the clinical exploration of RIT and place an emphasis on therapeutic ratio rather than toxicity.

The improved bioavailability with less inter- and intra-patient dosing variability coupled with the lack of requirement for IV CsA may provide a mechanism for cost savings when Neoral is used for induction immunosuppression. This retrospective case-control study compares the relative costs associated with Neoral induction without IV CsA versus induction with IV CsA followed by oral CsA in adult liver transplant recipients. Twenty consecutive patients receiving Neoral 12-15 mg/kg per d were compared to a control group of 21 patients receiving IV CsA followed by oral CsA for induction. Both groups received the same rapidly tapered dose of methyl-prednisilone. Health care resource utilization was assigned based on days in hospital and acute rejection episodes (ARE). Hospital per diem rates at specified care levels were used to assign costs associated with hospital stay, while a previously developed case-costing model was used to assign costs to episodes of acute rejection. All patients were followed for a 3-month period post-transplant. Although there was a trend towards shorter hospital stay in the Neoral group the majority of cost savings were achieved by reducing costs associated with episodes of acute rejection. There were seven and 19 episodes of ARE in the Neoral and IV CsA groups respectively (p < 0.05.) A separate cost effective assessment of the effect of reducing rejection by decision tree analysis demonstrated a cost reduction of $2162 per patient. The savings achieved with Neoral proved robust on sensitivity analysis. The change of practice to an induction immunosuppression regimen of Neoral without IV CsA has achieved a cost savings in adult river transplantation at our center.

J	Shaikh, MA				Shaikh, MA			A 'peak shaving' approach to project staff reallocation	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						lead time; peak shaving; staff allocation; decision tree; expected value		This paper presents an analytical model, which recomputes monthly staffing profile by truncating the original peak allocation and staffing the project before its actual start date. This staff leveling approach, which assumes the same completion date as the original one, has the benefit of avoiding delays resulting from small to no staff allocated at the scheduled start date. The approach uses the Lead Time concept from Inventory Theory to first compute the person-month value needed by the project under study at the scheduled start date. Next, it reduces ('shaves') the peak using an analytical equation from the original staffing allocation and adjusts the remaining person-month values by keeping the target date constant. The presented model was actually implemented in an industrial setting, but due data sensitivity, both the firm name and actual data are disguised. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Michie, D				Michie, D			Learning concepts from data	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article								Current data-mining practice employs relatively :low-level machine learning algorithms-statistical, neural-net, genetic, decision-tree, etc.-to trawl large data-sets for new classifiers. Usefulness of classifiers is then assessed according to accuracy in classifying new data, e.g. for stockmarket prediction or for assigning causes in medical diagnosis. User-transparency is often a secondary consideration. But in some applications the priorities are reversed. (1) In the "designer drug" industry, predictive classifiers are more valuable if they also provide chemists with new leads, while minimizing the frequency of the false positives. Screening fossil fuel emissions for hazardous components, on the other hand, requires minimization of false negatives. The high user-transparencies required in both cases are obtainable only with relational descriptions and rule languages, going beyond attribute-value representations. (2) In the simulator training of aircraft pilots, and of operators of other real-time devices, predictive control laws can provide a basis for machine-generated real-time advice to trainees. Study of human simulator-based control learning indicates a subgoal structure. It also suggests that both acquisition by the learner of new subgoals, and reorganization of perceived causal links among problem elements are involved in real-time skill learning. Design implications for automated coaches are worthy of consideration. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we will compare the performance of a well-known algorithm in machine learning (C4.5) with a recently proposed algorithm in the fuzzy set community (NEFCLASS). We will compare the algorithms both on the accuracy attained and on the size of the induced rule base. Additionally, we will investigate how the selected algorithms perform after they have been pre-processed by discretization and feature selection. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

A German proposal	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							BIOEQUIVALENCE ASSESSMENT; VIEW	The Bundesinstitut fur Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte (BfArM), the German drug regulation authority, issued guidelines for determining whether bioavailability/bioequivalence studies are required for certain drugs. This decision tree is based on pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and physicochemical criteria. Details of this decision tree were worked out by an expert panel, the Bioavailability Commission at the BfArM. The decision tree has been in use by German regulatory authorities for more than 10 years. In the meantime, its essentials were adopted by the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) and by the World Health Organization (WHO) for their "Guidelines on interchangeability of multisource pharmaceutical products." This article reviews the original decision tree of the BfArM and provides examples of drugs that have been assessed according to its rules. The current procedure of the German regulatory authorities for judging the necessity of bioavailability trials, which reflects the status quo of regulatory practice in Germany is also discussed.

J	Weng, JY; Chen, SY				Weng, JY; Chen, SY			Vision-guided navigation using SHOSLIF	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						autonomous navigation; sensorimotor control; neural regression; content-based retrieval; function fitting	MOBILE ROBOT; CLASSIFICATION; NETWORKS; NAVLAB	This paper presents an unconventional approach to vision-guided autonomous navigation. The system recalls information about scenes and navigational experience using content-based retrieval from a visual database. To achieve a high applicability to various road types, we do not impose a priori scene features, such as road edges, that the system must use, but rather, the system automatically derives features from images during supervised learning. To accomplish this, the system uses principle component analysis and linear discriminant analysis to automatically derive the most expressive features (MEF) for scene reconstruction or the most discriminating features (MDF) for scene classification. These features best describe or classify the population of the scenes and approximate complex decision regions using piecewise linear boundaries up to a desired accuracy. A new self-organizing scheme called recursive partition tree (RPT) is used for automatic construction of a vision-and-control database, which quickly prunes the data set in the content-based search and results in a low time complexity of O(log(n)) for retrieval from a database of size n. The system combines principle component and linear discriminant analysis networks with a decision tree network. It has been tested on a mobile robot, Rome, in an unknown indoor environment to learn scenes and the associated navigation experience. In the performing phase, the mobile robot navigates autonomously in similar environments, while allowing the presence of scene perturbations such as the presence of passersby.

J	Van Howe, RS				Van Howe, RS			Cost-effective treatment of phimosis	PEDIATRICS			English	Biographical-Item						phimosis; beta-methasone; preputial plasty; circumcision	SCLEROSUS-ET-ATROPHICUS; LICHEN-SCLEROSUS; COMPLETE CIRCUMCISION; BOYS; CHILDREN; FORESKIN; PREPUCE; PLASTY; RELIEF; PENIS	Objective. To determine the most cost-effective treatment for phimosis. Design. The costs of three treatment strategies for treating phimosis were evaluated using a decision-tree analysis. Three therapeutic approaches were considered: circumcision, preputial plasty (the use of plastic surgical techniques to enlarge the preputial opening without removing tissue), and topical therapy with steroids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatories. Published failure and complication rates were used to calculate the cost per case. Outcome Measures. Cost in dollars to treat each case of phimosis. Results. Topical steroid therapy was the most cost-effective strategy, costing between $758 and $800 per case. Preputial plasty cost between $2515 and $2580 per case. Circumcision cost between $3009 and $3241 per case. Conclusions. The most cost-effective management for treating phimosis is to initiate topical therapy. Daily external application from the tip of the foreskin to the glandis corona with betamethasone 0.05% cream for 4. to 6 weeks has been demonstrated to be very effective, resulting in a 75% savings compared with circumcision. Surgical intervention should not be considered until topical therapy has been given an adequate trial. When contemplating surgery, the lower morbidity, lower costs, and tissue preservation of preputial plasty may make it referable. URL: http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/102/4/e43.

The authors sought to determine which therapy was more cost-effective for inpatient and outpatient treatment of deep vein thrombosis. Methods: An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis based on a decision tree was performed for 4 treatment strategies for deep vein thrombosis. Rate of major hemorrhage while receiving heparin, rate of recurrence of venous thromboembolism 3 months after treatment and mortality rate 3 months after treatment were determined by meta-analysis. Costs for the UFH therapy were prospectively collected by a case-costing accounting system for 105 patients with deep vein thrombosis treated in fiscal year 1995/96. The costs for LMWH therapy were modelled, and cost-effectiveness was determined by decision analysis. Results: Meta-analysis revealed a mean difference in risk of hemorrhage of -1.1% (95% confidence interval [Cl] -2.4% to 0.3%), a mean difference in risk of recurrence of venous thromboembolism of -2.6% (95% Cl -4.5% to -0.7%) and a mean difference in risk of death of -1.9% (95% Cl -3.6% to -0.4%), all in favour of subcutaneous unmonitored administration of LMWH. The cost to treat one inpatient was $2993 for LMWH and $3048 for UFH. Even more would be saved if LMWH was delivered on an outpatient basis (cost of $1641 per patient). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that LMWH in any treatment setting is more cost effective than UFH. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of this conclusion. Interpretation: Treatment of deep vein thrombosis with LMWH is more cost effective than treatment with UFH in both inpatient and outpatient settings.

It combines a high-resolution, day or night, all-weather imaging capability with sensitivity to hydrologic and climatic snow and ice parameters. We use the spaceborne imaging radar-C/X-band synthetic aperture radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) to map snow and glacial ice on the rugged north slope of Mount Everest. From interferometrically derived digital elevation data, we compute the terrain calibration factor and cosine of the local illumination angle. We then process and terrain-correct radar data sets acquired on April 16, 1994. In addition to the spectral data, we include surface slope to improve discrimination among several surface types. These data sets are then used in a decision tree to generate an image classification. This method is successful in identifying and mapping scree/talus, dry snow, dry snow-covered glacier, wet snow-covered glacier, and rock-covered glacier, as corroborated by comparison with existing surface cover maps and other ancillary information. Application of the classification scheme to data acquired on October 7 of the same year yields accurate results for most surface types but underreports the extent of dry snow cover.

Although transfusion may decrease short-term mortality, the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission is considerable in Africa. We constructed a decision tree to weigh the short-term mortality benefit of transfusion against HIV infection risk. Probability estimates were derived from published studies. The base-case was a two-year-old child with a 13.5% mortality risk to be transfused with screened or unscreened blood (1% or 13% HIV contamination risk, respectively), with reduction of mortality to 5.5% by transfusion (odds ratio = 2.7), and a 2.4% risk of fatal transfusion complications. A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the influence of variation in these estimates. If a child developed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, survival was weighed as one-tenth of normal survival. For the base-case, we found that transfusion with screened blood provided a survival benefit of 5%. In contrast, transfusion with unscreened blood decreased survival by 2%. Patients with a mortality risk < 5% derived no benefit from a transfusion with screened blood. Other important factors for the benefit of transfusion were the effectiveness of transfusion in reducing mortality and the risk of blood contamination. A blood transfusion was clearly beneficial if the mortality risk was high and the risk of contamination was low. Our findings can be used as a basis for a clinical transfusion policy that limits transfusions to situations in which they are likely to be beneficial. This will in turn optimize child survival and prevent unnecessary exposure of low risk children to the transfusion risks.

Materials and Methods: A decision tree model was constructed to compare the cost-effectiveness of two clinical strategies. In the first strategy, patients receive ICU care until they were discharged, died, or had care withdrawn based on subjective clinical criteria. In the second strategy, patients remained in the ICU until they were either discharged, died, or had life-sustaining care withdrawn based on subjective criteria or if they were predicted to have a >90% risk of mortality after 48 hrs by a prognostic scoring system. Transition probabilities were based on a retrospective data analysis of 4,106 noncardiac ICU patients admitted to a tertiary surgical ICU over a 9-yr period. Cost estimates were based on daily Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS) scores from our database and using published data on the estimated production cost for a TISS point, The sensitivity (16.6%) and specificity (99.6%) of the mortality risk estimate at 48 hrs (using the >90% decision point) based on daily APACHE III scores were derived from published data. Results: In the base case analysis, we assumed that the sensitivity and specificity of the prognostic risk estimate are unchanged when exported to a new environment. Hot using a prognostic scoring system as the basis for withdrawing care resulted in a slightly higher survival rate (87.2% vs. 86.85%) at a cost-per-death prevented (CPDP) of $263,700. Since prognostic scoring systems have not been shown to retain the same predictive power when exported to new databases, we chose to explore the effect of varying the specificity of the scoring system on CPDP. Decreasing the specificity from .996 (baseline) to .98 causes the CPDP to drop to $53,300. Changing the specificity to .95 results in a CPDP prevented of $21,700. Using one-way sensitivity analysis, the CPDP is shown to be relatively insensitive to delaying the decision point from ICU day 3 to day 7. Sensitivity analysis also indicates that CPDP increases rapidly with hospital death rate. For a death rate of 30%, the CPDP increases to $768,600 (in the base case, the death rate is 12.8%); when the specificity is decreased to .95, the CPDP drops to $62,100. Conclusion: Unless daily mortality risk estimates based on APACHE III can be shown to retain the same level of predictive power in ICUs outside the development database, it is unlikely that the incremental cost-effectiveness gained by using them as the basis to withdraw care is sufficient to justify their use in this manner.

We developed models to evaluate potential shifts for 80 individual tree species in the eastern United States. First, environmental factors associated with current ranges of tree species were assessed using geographic information systems (GIS) in conjunction with regression tree analysis (RTA). The method was then extended to better understand the potential of species to survive and/or migrate under a changed climate. We collected, summarized, and analyzed data for climate, soils, land use, elevation, and species assemblages for >2100 counties east of the 100th meridian. Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) data for >100000 forested plots in the East provided the tree species range and abundance information for the trees. RTA was used to devise prediction rules from current species-environment relationships, which were then used to replicate the current distribution as well as predict the future potential distributions under two scenarios of climate change with twofold increases in the level of atmospheric CO2. Validation measures prove the utility of the RTA modeling approach for mapping current tree importance values across large areas, leading to increased confidence in the predictions of potential future species distributions. With our analysis of potential effects, we show that roughly 30 species could expand their range and/or weighted importance at least 10%, while an additional 30 species could decrease by at least 10%, following equilibrium after a changed climate. Depending on the global change scenario used, 4-9 species would potentially move out of the United States to the north. Nearly half of the species assessed (36 out of 80) showed the potential for the ecological optima to shift at least 100 km to the north, including seven that could move >250 km. Given these potential future distributions, actual species redistributions will be controlled by migration rates possible through fragmented landscapes.

J	Eisenberg, JNS; McKone, TE				Eisenberg, JNS; McKone, TE			Decision tree method for the classification of chemical pollutants: Incorporation of across-chemical variability and within-chemical uncertainty	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SOIL	We have developed a decision tree methodology for the classification of chemicals by estimates of potential human exposure. The steps involved in the construction of a decision tree are as follows. Monte Carte simulations are conducted by randomly sampling chemical and environmental properties, whose range of values represents the variability of parameters across a defined set of chemicals and environmental conditions. The tree structure is then defined by a series of constraints placed on the various chemical and environmental properties using the Classification and Regression Tree Algorithm (CART). Each node of the tree is associated with a human exposure value and is considered a bin, which classifies chemicals whose properties are consistent with those parametric constraints associated with the particular node. In addition to being associated with parametric constraints, each bin or tree node is associated with a human exposure level. In this manner, the tree structure functions as a template from which a set of chemicals are classified into parametric regions that are associated with an exposure level. Three important properties of this classification approach are as follows: (a) The variability across this chemical set is described by the template. (b) Parameter correlations are described by assessing which bins are represented by at least one chemical. (c) The sensitivity of the classification is assessed using both the uncertainty of the values for a particular chemical and any uncertainty or variability associated with site-specific exposure and environmental properties. To illustrate these properties, a case study was conducted in which exposures were estimated using the multimedia exposure model CalTOX assuming a regional chemical release into soil. A decision tree template was constructed and then used to classify 79 chemicals. Analysis of the simulation outputs identified 4 out of 14 chemical properties whose value ranges played the dominant role in the classification of chemicals into exposure ranges (R-2 = 0.78); i.e., 78% of the exposure variation seen in the data could be explained using only 4 of the 14 chemical properties that are known to affect chemical fate and transport. The most important classifier was the half-life in root-zone soil, tau(s). In addition, a sensitivity analysis of 93 site-specific environmental and exposure properties suggested that only four of these factors influenced the classification.

J	Wang, XZ; Hong, JR				Wang, XZ; Hong, JR			On the handling of fuzziness for continuous-valued attributes in decision tree generation	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						possibility theory; measures of information; knowledge acquisition; learning; decision trees		In this paper, fuzziness existing in the process of generating decision trees by discretizing continuous-valued attributes is considered. In a sense a better way to express this fuzziness via fuzzy numbers is presented using possibility theory. The fact that selection of membership functions in a class of symmetric distributions does not influence the decision tree generation is proved. The validity of using the tree to classify future examples is explained. On the basis of likelihood possibility maximization, the existing algorithm is revised. The revised algorithm leads to more reasonable and more natural decision trees. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The CNeT performs hierarchical clustering of the feature vectors presented to it as examples, while its growth is controlled by forward pruning, Because of the tree structure, the prototype in the CNeT close to any example can he determined by searching only a fraction of the tree. This paper introduces different search methods for the CNeT, which are utilized for training as well as for recall. The CNeT is evaluated and compared with existing classifiers on a variety of pattern classification problems.

J	Barger, SE				Barger, SE			Assessing school readiness for a practice arrangement using decision tree methodology	JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL NURSING			English	Article						academic nursing centers; academic nursing entrepreneurship; faculty issues, practice; nursing faculty practice		Decision-tree methodology provides a systematic approach for schools to use in examining their own situation to determine if a faculty practice arrangement is appropriate for their particular school at this particular time. Questions in the decision tree address mission, faculty interest, administrative support, a practice plan, and practice models. Specific questions in the decision tree include the following: Does the institutional mission include service/practice? Does the college/school mission include practice? Does the college/school have a critical mass of faculty interested in practice? Does college/school administration support practice? Does a critical mass of faculty desire a faculty practice plan? Can faculty and administration work together to produce a mutually beneficial practice arrangement? Do faculty and administration desire to operate their own practice arrangement? Is there an identified need for nursing services that can be met by the college/school? Does the internal and external environment support the college/school operating a practice? Do internal or external organizations desire the talents/expertise of faculty members? Schools frequently evaluate two models, the Integration/Nursing Center Model and the Organizational Contracting/Entrepreneurship Model, for their specific risks and benefits. Critical to the success of any practice arrangement is that there be congruency between the school's allocation of human resources and its reward system. Copyright (C) 1998 by W.B. Saunders Company.

J	Cohen, MR				Cohen, MR			Expression of anxiety and depression in a case of subcortical motor aphasia	NEUROREHABILITATION			English	Article						subcortical motor aphasia; post-stroke; decision tree; anxiety; depression		A decision tree and decimal rating scales were used for psychotherapy with a patient with post-stroke subcortical motor aphasia. These two methods used in combination were highly efficient in obtaining information about the patient's mood and issues of concern. The patient was able to report on changing levels of anxiety and depression. He was able to relate his emotional state to environmental or personal factors. Values as low as 1 and as high as 10 for anxiety and depression were reported by the patient during the course of 25 psychotherapy sessions. A Pearson correlation indicated that anxiety and depression varied independently. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Vereshchagin, NK				Vereshchagin, NK			Randomized Boolean decision trees: Several remarks	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Boolean decision trees; randomized algorithm; directional algorithms; undirectional algorithms	COMPLEXITY CLASSES; COMPLETE LANGUAGES; MACHINES	Assume we want to show that (a) the cost of any randomized decision tree computing a given Boolean function is at least c. To this end, it suffices to prove that (b) there is a probability distribution over the set of all assignments to variables of that function with respect to which the average cost of any deterministic decision tree computing that function is at least c. Yao (1977) showed that this method is universal for proving lower bounds for randomized errorless decision trees, that is, that (a) is equivalent to (b), In the present paper we prove that this is the case also for randomized decision trees which are allowed to make errors. This gives the positive answer to the question posed in Yao (1977), In the second part of the paper we exhibit an example when randomized directional decision trees (defined in Yao (1977)) to evaluate read once formulae are not optimal. We construct a formula F(n) of n Boolean variables such that the cost of the optimal directional decision tree computing F(n) is Omega(n(alpha)) and there is an undirectional randomized decision tree computing F(n) of cost O(n(beta)) for some beta < alpha.

J	De Fries, RS; Hansen, M; Townshend, JRG; Sohlberg, R				De Fries, RS; Hansen, M; Townshend, JRG; Sohlberg, R			Global land cover classifications at 8 km spatial resolution: the use of training data derived from Landsat imagery in decision tree classifiers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							DATA SET; SATELLITE IMAGERY; VEGETATION; CLIMATE; AVHRR; VARIABILITY; REGRESSION; BIOSPHERE; MODELS; SCALE	This paper reports a study which aims to (i) develop methodologies for global land cover classifications that are objective, reproducible and feasible to implement as new satellite data become available in the future and (ii) provide a global land cover classification product based on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Pathfinder Land (PAL) data that can be used in global change research. The spatial resolution for the land cover classification is 8 km, intermediate between our previously published coarse one degree by one degree spatial resolution and the 1 km global land cover product being developed under the auspices of the International Geosphere Biosphere Program. We first derive a global network of training sites from Landsat imagery, using 156 Landsat scenes mostly from the Multispectral Scanner System, to identify over 9000 pixels in the PAL data where we have high confidence that the labelled cover type occurs. We then use the training data to test a number of metrics that describe the temporal dynamics of vegetation over an annual cycle for potential use as input variables to a global land cover classification. The tested metrics are based on: (i) the ratio between surface temperature and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); (ii) seasonal metrics derived from the NDVI temporal profile, such as length of growing season; (iii) a rule-based approach that determines cover type through a series of hierarchical trees based on surface temperature and NDVI values; and (iv) annual mean, maximum, minimum and amplitude values for all optical and thermal channels in the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) (PAL) data. Highest mean class accuracies from a decision tree classifier were obtained using the annual mean, maximum, minimum, and amplitude values For all AVHRR bands. Finally, we apply these metrics to 1984:PAL data at 8 km resolution to derive a global land cower classification product using a decision tree classifier. The classification has an overall accuracy between 81.4 and 90.3%. The Landsat images used for deriving the training data and the methodology for classification of AVHRR data at 8 km resolution can also be applied to 1 km AVHRR data and, in the future, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data at 250 and 500 m resolution.

Preliminary studies have shown that thoracic positron emission tomography (PET) is more accurate than thoracic computed tomography (CT) for the staging of non-small cell lung carcinoma. In the present study the cost-effectiveness, as measured by national Medicare reimbursed costs, and patient life expectancy are used to compare several thoracic PET-based strategies with a conventional thoracic CT-based strategy for preoperative staging. Methods. Five decision strategies for selection of potential surgical candidates were compared; thoracic CT alone or four different strategies that use thoracic CT plus thoracic PET. The various paths of each strategy are dependent on numerous variables that were determined from a review of the medical literature. Life expectancy was calculated using the declining exponential approximation of life expectancy and reduced on the basis of procedural morbidity and mortality. Costs were based on national Medicare reimbursed costs. For all possible outcomes of each strategy, the expected cost and projected life expectancy were determined. The effects of changing one or more variables on the expected cost and life expectancy were studied using sensitivity analysis. Results. A strategy that uses PET only after a negative CT study is shown to be a cost-effective alternative to the CT-alone strategy ($25,286 per life-year saved). Conclusions. These results show through rigorous decision tree analysis the potential cost-effectiveness of using thoracic PET in the management of non-small cell lung carcinoma. Greater use of thoracic PET for non-small cell lung carcinoma staging is warranted, and further clinical trials should help to validate the analytic results predicted from this study.

J	van Etten, EJB				van Etten, Eddie J. B.			Mapping vegetation in an arid, mountainous region of Western Australia	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Decision tree; Generalised Linear Model; Geographic Information System; Landscape ecology; Vegetation-environment modeling; Vegetation mapping		. Predictive mapping of vegetation using models linking vegetation units to mapped environmental variables has been advocated for remote areas. In this study, three different types of model were employed (within a GIS) to produce vegetation maps of the Hamersley Ranges region of Western Australia. The models were: (1) decision trees; (2) statistical models; and (3) heuristic/conceptual models. Maps were produced for three different levels of a floristic classification, i.e. 16 communities in two community groups with eight subgroups. All models satisfactorily established relationships between the vegetation units and available predictor variables, except where the number of sites of a particular unit was small. The different models often made similar predictions, especially for more widespread vegetation units. Map accuracy (as determined by field testing of maps) improved with increasing level of abstraction, with plant community maps ca. 50 % correct, subgroup maps ca. 60 % correct and group maps 90 % correct. Map inaccuracies were due to several factors, including low sample numbers producing unrepresentative models, poor resolution of and errors in available maps of predictor variables, and available predictor variables not being able to differentiate between certain vegetation units, particularly at the plant community level. Of these factors, poor resolution of maps was seen as the most critical. One type of model could not be recommended over another; however the choice of model will be largely dependent on the nature of the data set and the type of map coverage required.

J	Lilburne, L; Watt, J; Vincent, K				Lilburne, L; Watt, J; Vincent, K			A prototype DSS to evaluate irrigation management plans	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						DSS; expert system; irrigation; water allocation	DECISION-SUPPORT	Inefficient irrigation strategies delivering an excess of irrigation water can result in pesticides and nitrates being leached to groundwater. However, information on the environmental impact of irrigation strategies is not readily available to either growers or the local authority responsible for water consents. Improved irrigation practices can be promoted by making this information more readily available in the form of a decision support system (DSS) linked to the water allocation process. Under this approach, growers would be required to submit to the local authority an irrigation management plan (IMP) which details how they intend to irrigate the crop in each of their management blocks. Sufficient information about the soil, crop, irrigation system and scheduling mechanism would have to be supplied in the IMP to allow it to be evaluated from an environmental impact perspective. The IMP is evaluated by a water allocation consent officer with the help of the decision support system, in which is incorporated environmental impact knowledge. This DSS integrates a simulation model SWIM, a decision tree, and scientific soil hydraulic data. The simulation model is used to estimate the likely water requirement of the grower under the IMP. The decision tree represents expert heuristics on the effects of the various irrigation strategies. The soil hydraulic data provides soil hydraulic properties to SWIM and to the decision tree. Local authorities and growers can use the DSS to learn about the likely environmental impact and water requirements of each grower. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Work on constructing decision trees from data exists in multiple disciplines such as statistics, pattern recognition, decision theory, signal processing, machine learning and artificial neural networks. Researchers in these disciplines, sometimes working on quite different problems, identified similar issues and heuristics for decision tree construction. This paper surveys existing work on decision tree construction, attempting to identify the important issues involved, directions the work has taken and the current state of the art.

J	Salzberg, S; Delcher, AL; Fasman, KH; Henderson, J				Salzberg, S; Delcher, AL; Fasman, KH; Henderson, J			A decision tree system for finding genes in DNA	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						gene finding; decision trees; dynamic programming; Markov models	OPEN READING FRAMES; CODING REGIONS; GENOMIC DNA; SEQUENCES; IDENTIFICATION; PREDICTION; EXONS; RECOGNITION; ALIGNMENT; TRANSLATION	MORGAN is an integrated system for finding genes in vertebrate DNA sequences. MORGAN uses a variety of techniques to accomplish this task, the most distinctive of which is a decision tree classifier. The decision tree system is combined with new methods for identifying-start codons, donor sites, and acceptor sites, and these are brought together in a frame-sensitive dynamic programming algorithm that finds the optimal segmentation of a DNA sequence into coding and noncoding regions (exons and introns), The optimal segmentation is dependent on a separate scoring function that takes a subsequence and assigns to it a score reflecting the probability that the sequence is an exon, The scoring functions in MORGAN are sets of decision trees that are combined to give a probability estimate. Experimental results on a database of 570 vertebrate DNA sequences show that MORGAN has excellent performance by many different measures. On a separate test set, it achieves an overall accuracy of 95%, with a correlation coefficient of 0.78, and a sensitivity and specificity for coding bases of 83% and 79%, In addition, MORGAN identifies 58% of coding exons exactly; i.e., both the beginning and end of the coding regions are predicted correctly. This paper describes the MORGAN system, including its decision tree routines and the algorithms for site recognition, and its performance on a benchmark database of vertebrate DNA.

J	Levy, DA; Collins, BE; Nail, PR				Levy, DA; Collins, BE; Nail, PR			A new model of interpersonal influence characteristics	JOURNAL OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOR AND PERSONALITY			English	Article							SOCIAL RESPONSE; MEMORY; POWER	A reformulation of social influence theory is presented as a taxonomy, decision tree, and glossary of key terms. Types of social influence are sorted on the basis of four "Fundamental Interpersonal Influence Distinctions": (a) level of cognitive processing (conscious vs. nonconscious); b) perceived intentionality (intentional vs. unintentional vs. orthogonal/irrelevant); (c) relative social status thigh vs. peer vs. low vs. orthogonal/irrelevant); and (d) direction of change (positive vs, negative vs. orthogonal/irrelevant). Nonconscious influence (low level of processing) includes affective evaluation (attraction, repulsion), schema/norm activation, echo and hysterical contagion, social facilitation, social leafing, and unlearned social responses. Intentional influence (compliance/anticompliance) includes obedience, rebellion, direct conformity and anticonformity, and power-of-the-powerless. Unintentional influence (imitation/anti-imitation) includes indirect conformity and anticonformity, identification, and disinhibitory contagion. A residual set of influence types includes reactance, informational influence, and direct and vicarious learning. New definitions of social influence terms were derived deductively from the four Influence Distinctions. The reformulation suggests several possible directions for future research and poses at least as many interesting empirical questions as it answers.

J	Mills, GA; Colquhoun, JR				Mills, GA; Colquhoun, JR			Objective prediction of severe thunderstorm environments: Preliminary results linking a decision tree with an operational regional NWP model	WEATHER AND FORECASTING			English	Article							AUSTRALIA	The output from the Australian operational regional numerical weather prediction model has been used to provide input thermodynamic and kinematic fields to a decision tree designed to diagnose the likelihood of thunderstorms and whether the thunderstorm environment is conducive to the development of severe, supercell, or tornadic supercell thunderstorms. On targeted cases of observed severe weather described in this paper the system successfully diagnoses severe thunderstorms and appears to discriminate between tornadic and nontornadic cases. It is shown that the thunderstorm decision tree of Colquhoun has considerable potential, when coupled with a regional NWP model, to provide forecast guidance of areas of thunderstorms, severe thunderstorms, tornadic thunderstorms, and whether these storms are likely to be associated with flash floods, downbursts, strong winds, etc. The results from targeted severe weather case studies show a very good degree of correspondence with the location and type of severe weather observed, and if these results were to be replicated in operational practice, the system would be of great benefit to weather forecast teams. The results of a 33-day trial indicate that the results from the case studies did not occur due to excessive overprediction, with a relatively low number of false alarms and relatively high number of hits based on the admittedly fairly loose subjective criterion for a hit. These results indicate that the system may provide a useful alerting system to form the basis of the definition of thunderstorm watch areas in operational practice in Australia.

A pharmacoeconomic study was undertaken to assess the impact of a 1995 formulary decision to designate cimetidine as the primary histamine H-2-receptor antagonist IH,RA) and to restrict the use of famotidine. Consecutive patients receiving either i.v. cimetidine or famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis were reviewed during a two-month period in 1997, and information on demographics, dosage and duration of H(2)RA therapy, admission date, laboratory test values, and adverse drug reactions was collected. Data for 62 patients (43 cimetidine recipients and 19 famotidine recipients) were evaluated. Therapy was categorized as successful or failed, and the data were then evaluated by decision analysis to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the agents and by multiattribute utility theory (MAUT) to incorporate a humanistic evaluation of the treatments, namely, the number of doses administered and the number of times dosages were changed. The decision tree revealed that the average cost of receiving cimetidine was $82.01 and the average cost of famotidine therapy was $92.15. The MAUT analysis showed that cimetidine was the preferred agent as long as cost was valued at greater than 60% of the decision-making process and efficacy remained equal between the two agents. Two pharmacoeconomic methods lent support to a formulary decision at a health care institution.

The paper concludes that robust pipeline information can be usefully employed in generating optimal solutions that address the three fundamental problem areas: physical integrity, water quality and hydraulic capacity. A generic solution "tree" is proposed from which companies can quickly derive a simplified, company specific, decision tree. Recommendations are made as to the data to be gathered whenever the buried pipe network is exposed.									0	0	0	PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING PUBLISHING LTD	WESTMINISTER	1 BIRDCAGE WALK, WESTMINISTER SW1H 9JJ, ENGLAND	1356-1448	1-86058-232-X	IMECHE CONF TRANS			1999	1999	8					341	352				12	Engineering, Mechanical	Engineering	BP03S	WOS:000083947800028

Given the fact that this is a very general approach to human problem-solving behavior, it is more than natural that there are different approaches for implementing this process on computer systems. In commercial CBR systems, there are three main approaches that differ in the sources, materials, and knowledge they use. The textual CBR approach eases case acquisition. It is very useful in domains where large collections of know-how documents already exist and the intended user is able to immediately make use of the knowledge contained in the respective documents. The approach is well suited when there are not too many cases at a time (less than a couple of hundred) and when each case has a short description (three sentences at most). Otherwise, textual CBR retrieves a large number of cases that are irrelevant. The cost for controlling the quality of textual CBR is high. The conversational CBR approach is very useful for domains where a high volume of simple problems must be solved again and again. The system guides the agent and the customer with predefined dialogs. However, the case base is organized manually by the case author, which is a complex and costly activity when the cases are described by many attributes (questions). The conversational approach is well suited for applications in which only a few questions are needed for decision making. Maintenance costs are high because the developer must manually position each new case in a decision tree-like structure and update the ordering of the questions. The structural CBR approach relies on cases that are described with attributes and values that are pre-defined. In different structural CBR systems, attributes may be organized as flat tables, or as sets of tables with relations, or they may be structured in object-oriented manner. The structural CBR approach is useful in domains where additional knowledge, beside cases, must be used in order to produce good results. The domain model insures that new cases are of high quality and the maintenance effort is low. This approach always gives better results than the two others, but it requires an initial investment to produce the domain model.									0	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743		LECT NOTES ARTIF INT			1999	1612						21	34				14	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Computer Science	BP08X	WOS:000084086500002

Fiscal responsibility and professional ethics require that decision makers use best science approaches instead of relying on arbitrary selection processes, Three case studies ii lustrate how decision tree models and Monte Carlo analysis can be used by the practicing professional to systematically make important environmental restoration decisions. Each case study is based on formerly used defense site projects in the Midwest where explosives es contamination is present in the ground water.

JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						statistical analysis; Bartlett's test; homogeneity of variance; toxicity study; rodents	RAT	We investigated the changes in sample numbers with time and calculated the F values for various quantitative data between control and each treated group from 10 long-term studies using 9,280 rodents by the so-called "decision tree" for computerized statistical analysis. We then examined the detection rate of significant differences using Bartlett's test, and compared the incidence of significant differences between each dose group and the control group obtained with and without Bartlett's test. As a results, the number of animals decreased in the second half of the long-term studies, and variances of body weight, food consumption, hematological tests and organ weights were higher in the dose groups than in the controls. The detection rate of significant differences by Barlett's test was 16-35% for the parameters examined. We conclude that, it seems practical to test the significant difference among mean values by parametric procedures, even if the data are heterogeneous in their variances among groups.

The input space was gradually increased by using mutual information (MI) filtering and part-of-speech (POS) filtering, which determine the portion of words that are appropriate for learning from the information-theoretic and the linguistic perspectives, respectively. We tested the two filtering methods on SVMs as well ass a decision tree algorithm C4.5. The SVMs' results common to both filtering are that I) the optimal number of features differed completely across categories, and 2) the average performance for all categories was best when all of the words were used. In addition, a comparison of the two filtering methods clarified that POS filtering on SVMs consistently outperformed MI filtering, which indicates that SVMs cannot find irrelevant parts of speech. These results suggest a simple strategy for the SVM text categorization: use a full number of words found through a rough filtering technique like part-of-speech tagging.

This can result in low prediction accuracy, or otherwise, low prediction rates, leaving a set of cases for which no predictions are made. This raises two issues. First, when maximizing prediction rate is preferable, what mechanisms can be employed such that a system can make more predictions without severely degrading prediction accuracy? Second, for contexts in which accuracy is of primary importance, how can we further improve prediction accuracy? A recently proposed Dual-model approach, which takes models' temporal characteristics into account, suggests a solution to the first problem, but leaves room for further improvement. This paper presents two classes of Dual-model variant. Each aims to achieve one of the above objectives. With the performance of the original system as a baseline, which does not utilize the temporal information, empirical evaluations in the domain of elementary subtraction show that one class of variant outperforms the baseline in prediction rate while the other does so in prediction accuracy, without significantly affecting other overall measures of the original performance.

Beside the well-known benefit that students can read the courseware at any place and time, WWW provides another advantage for teachers. That is, the learning behavior of students can be recorded in the web log. Teachers can reorganize the log to obtain students learning portfolios. Hence, they can use the teaming portfolios to analyze and predict students' learning performance. However, in doing so, teachers must still make great efforts to process the web log to discover the relationship between the learning portfolios and learning performance. This paper proposes a methodology to assist teachers in discovering potential rules of performance from web based learning portfolios using database systems and decision tree machine learning technologies. Consequently, teacher can identify the students who will probably have learning problems and stipulate proper strategies for these students in early stage. At the same time, the discovered rules can provide teachers evidence to reflect teaching strategies and suggest the learning direction to students.

SPIE, AIPR, Execut Comm		Algorithm Quasi-Optimal (AQ); Decision Tree (DT); machine learning; pattern recognition; Principle Component Analysis (PCA); SAR images; whitening transformation		Machine Learning (ML) is the computational study of algorithms that improve performance based on experience learned from examples. Since machine learning technique provides new learning methodologies capable of dealing with the complexities of input signals (imagery), pattern recognition (PR) investigates the applicability of modern machine learning methods to develop recognition systems with learning capabilities. This paper introduces two machine learning techniques Algorithm Quasi-optimal (AQ) and Decision Tree (DT) as the classifiers far undertaking pattern recognition task. Both learn the 2D signal introduced from MSTAR SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery database consisting of three classes of combat vehicles - BMP-2, BTR-70, and T-72 tank. 67 images drawn from the database with similar aspect (+/- 15 degrees) are used for training the classifiers while unseen 47 images are used for testing. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) method and whitening transformation are used to reduce the dimensionality of input vector from 465 extracted features doum to 30 features. We report three experimental results -(i) DT to Learn from the original 465 features without using PCA, (ii) DT algorithm with the use of PCA for reducing input dimensionality, and (iii) AQ algorithm to learn the input features with PCA. The results show that the AQ has better performance than BT in terms of faster learning and higher recognition accuracy when the PCA and whitening transformation are applied.

Different parameters (current, mass and resistance) were collected simultaneously. Then these laboratory measurements are used by an algorithm software as a logged data file, resulting in to inducing a decision tree. Later, a systematic software is designed based on the rules derived from this decision tree, to recognise the type of unknown solution used in the experiment. This is a new approach to data acquisition in chemical industries involving conducting polymers. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

S	Nock, R; Jappy, P		Hand, DJ; Kok, JN; Berthold, MR		Nock, R; Jappy, P			A "top-down and prune" induction scheme for constrained Decision Committees	ADVANCES IN INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Symposium on Advances in Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA 99)	AUG 09-11, 1999	AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS					It was previously argued that Decision Tree learning algorithms such as CART or C4.5 can also be useful to build small and accurate Decision Lists. In that paper, we investigate the possibility of using a similar "top-down and prune" scheme to induce formulae from a much different class: Decision Committees. A decision committee contains rules, each of which being a couple (monomial, vector), where the vector's components are highly constrained with respect to classical polynomials. Each monomial is a condition that, when matched by an instance, returns its vector. When each monomial is tested, the sum of the returned vectors is used to take the decision. Decision Trees, Lists and Committees are complementary formalisms for the user: while trees are based on literal ordering, lists are based on monomial ordering, and committees remove any orderings over the tests. Our contribution is a new algorithm, WIDC, which learns using the same "top-down and prune" scheme, but building Decision Committees. Experimental results on twenty-two domains tend to show that WIDC is able to produce small, accurate, and interpretable decision committees.

This work explores how a PAC-proven decision tree learning algorithm fares in comparison with two variants of the normal top-down induction of decision trees. The algorithm does not prune its hypothesis per se, but it can be understood to do pre-pruning of the evolving tree. We study a backtracking search algorithm, called Rank, for learning rank-minimal decision trees. Our experiments follow closely those performed by Schaffer [20]. They confirm the main findings of Schaffer: in learning concepts with simple description pruning works, for concepts with a complex description and when all concepts are equally likely pruning is injurious, rather than beneficial, to the average performance of the greedy top-down induction of decision trees. Pre-pruning, as a gentler technique, settles in the average performance in the middle ground between not pruning at all and post pruning.

In this paper, we analyze the particular benefits that feature selection may provide in hierarchical clustering. We propose a view of feature selection as a tree pruning process similar to those used in decision tree learning. Under this framework, we perform several experiments using different pruning strategies and considering a multiple prediction task. Results suggest that hierarchical clusterings can be greatly simplified without diminishing accuracy.

For such problems the classification rule often needs to be order-preserving or monotone as we call it. Since the known decision tree methods generate non-monotone trees, these methods are not suitable for monotone classification problems. We provide an order-preserving tree-generation algorithm for multi-attribute classification problems with Ic linearly ordered classes, and an algorithm for repairing non-monotone decision trees. The performance of these algorithms is tested on random monotone datasets.

In particular, the algorithm builds a tree that better insures that a query and its nearest neighbors will be in the same subtree(s), thus reducing the cost of subsequent search.

However, most learning algorithms only use labeled examples. Thus we address the problem of learning with the help of positive and unlabeled data given a small number of labeled examples. We present both theoretical and empirical arguments showing that learning algorithms can be improved by the use of both unlabeled and positive data. As an illustrating problem, we consider the learning algorithm from statistics for monotone conjunctions in the presence of classification noise and give empirical evidence of our assumptions. We give theoretical results for the improvement of Statistical Query learning algorithms from positive and unlabeled data, Lastly, we apply these ideas to tree induction algorithms. We modify the code of C4.5 to get an algorithm which takes as input a set LAB of labeled examples, a set POS of positive examples and a set UNL of unlabeled data and which uses these three sets to construct the decision tree.

DESIGN: Patient-specific questions received by the DIS were reviewed and evaluated. A panel determined whether a drug misadventure event may have occurred if the DIS had not been consulted. Potential outcomes from drug information requests were classified using a decision-tree model. A severity rating was then attached to each applicable request to predict potential cost savings of the DIS, RESULTS: Seventy-seven of the 570 drug information responses received in the six-week study period had assessable potential cost savings to the institution. During the study interval, potential cost savings were estimated to be $195 000. Projected to one year, potential cost savings reached $1.7 million, Of the savings noted, most were attributable to prevention of increased monitoring or additional treatment. Using a sensitivity analysis, annual potential cost savings ranged from $417 792 to $2 052 740 per year. Based on the estimated annual costs: related to maintaining a DIS of $145 950, the resultant range of benefit/cost ratio is 2.9:1 to 13.2:1. CONCLUSIONS: This model demonstrates that the DIS at our institution provides potential cost savings. This model may be modified to evaluate potential cost savings in other areas of pharmacy practice.

Power laws are fit to learning curves of decision trees trained on data sets from the UCI repository. The learning curves are generated by training C4.5 on different size training sets. The power law predicts diminishing returns in terms of error rate as training set size increase. By characterizing the learning curve with a power law, the error rate for a given size training set can be projected. This projection can be used in estimating the amount of data needed to achieve an acceptable error rate, and the cost effectiveness of further data collection.

This is a retrospective study of 57 mild-to-moderately demented patients of African-American, Caucasian, Chinese, Hispanic, and Vietnamese origin and an equal number of age matched controls from a cross cultural pool, We used a Knowledge Discovery from Databases (KDD) approach. Decision tree learners (C4.5, CART), rule inducers (C4,5Rules, FOCL) and a reference classifier (Naive Bayes) were the machine learning algorithms used for model building. This study identified a clinically useful subset of CASI, consisting of only twenty Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) attributes-CASI-MMSE-M I, saving test time and cost, while maintaining or improving dementia screening accuracy. Also, the machine learning algorithms (in particular C4.5 and CART) gave stable clinically relevant models for the task of screening with CASI-MMSE-M....

Decision tree induction algorithms such as ID3 [3], [4] and CHAID [5], are based on a stepwise search procedure. This is essentially a heuristic search technique based on selecting the best local attribute/values split for each internal node. This is performed according to some given criteria, regardless of the impact on subsequent splits. Once a split is selected, these algorithms have no backtracking mechanism to enable them to change an attribute split. Thus a potential weakness of these algorithms is the lack of a globally optimal search strategy. GAs perform a non-linear search for the optimal or near optimal solution in a pre-defined search space. The aim is to cover the entire search space without performing an exhaustive search of the domain. This paper presents GAs as an effective alternative to the step-wise search strategy employed by traditional decision tree induction algorithms. The new algorithm has been applied to two data sets and has shown a clear improvement in classification accuracy over ID3 generated by a more traditional methods.

This paper introduces a novel method which successfully shows that it is possible to attain decision trees which exhibit both good performance and balance. The method first involves the induction of a decision tree, which is then fuzzified using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Each solution generated by the GA produces a set of fuzzy regions which are mapped onto all nodes in the tree. The GA's fitness function consists of two components : classification accuracy and balance which are optimised concurrently. Three alternative functions are defined, each of which opposes different penalties on the classification accuracy depending on the selected weighting associated with the balance component. The method is applied to two real world data sets and is shown to achieve a high degree of common currency between accuracy and balance.

They are based on different models and the best of them are providing an explanation together with an accurate, reliable and quick response. One of the most viable among models are decision trees, already successfully used for many medical decision making purposes. Although effective and reliable, the traditional decision tree construction approach still contains several deficiencies. Therefore we decided to develop a self-adapting evolutionary decision support model, that uses evolutionary principles for the induction of decision trees. We constructed a multi-population decision model with information spreading and inter-population competition as the self-adaptive method with the aim to improve the quality of the obtained solution. Several solutions were evolved for the classification of mitral valve prolapse syndrome. A comparison has been made with the traditional induction of decision trees. Our approach can be considered as a good choice for different kinds of real-world medical decision making, with respect to the advantages of our model and the quality of the results that we obtain, especially in various medical applications.

J	Chen, JJ; Kodell, RL				Chen, JJ; Kodell, RL			A decision-tree strategy for combining diagnostic tests for prediction	BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						classification; decision-tree; negative predictivity; positive predictivity	CARCINOGENICITY; TOXICITY; ACCURACY	In the context of medical screening, various diagnostic tests have been developed for determining whether a disease is present in an individual. Similarly, in the context of toxicological screening, a variety of short-term assays have been developed to predict whether a chemical would be carcinogenic if tested in a long-term bioassay. In both contexts, it is a challenge to combine the results of several predictive tests in a way that improves on the predictivity of the individual tests. Increases in positive predictivity can be accompanied by decreases in negative predictivity, and vice versa. This article presents a decision-tree classification model for combining results from several independent short-term or diagnostic tests to quantify the likelihood of a true positive result (patient has disease, or chemical is carcinogenic). The decision-tree strategy determines the most advantageous sequence for conducting the predictive tests. The classification model is based on statistical confidence limits on the predictive probability of disease (carcinogenicity) rather than on the central estimate of the predictive probability.

J	Hiatt, MD				Hiatt, MD			Thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase and tissue plasminogen activator in a patient with suspected acute myocardial infarction: A decision analysis	CARDIOLOGY			English	Article						thrombolytic therapy; streptokinase; tissue plasminogen activator; acute myocardial infarction	HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY; TRIAL; LIFE	Two commonly used thrombolytic agents are streptokinase (SK) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), which have different impacts on the incidence of mortality and thrombolysis-related acute intracranial hemorrhage. A decision-analytic model was developed to compare the use of SK and t-PA in the treatment of a patient with suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The outcome was health-related quality of life as quantified in a measure of utility from the patient's point of view. The model included three outcome states: death, nonfatal yet disabling stroke, and survival with no disabling stroke. The utility for disabling stroke was determined relative to the reference states of no disabling stroke (1.00) and death (0.00) by means of the time trade-off estimation technique. Probabilities were derived from the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Artery trial, which revealed that although administering t-PA results in a lower percentage of deaths compared to SK, it may lead to a higher percentage of strokes. A decision tree was constructed to model the options and outcomes. The tree was analyzed by standard decision analytic techniques using SMLTREE software, and the stability of the results was examined as values of parameters were varied systematically in a sensitivity analysis. In the baseline analysis, SK yielded 0.9235, whereas t-PA yielded 0.9329. The sensitivity analysis revealed that if the probability of a disabling stroke attributable to t-PA were greater than 2.08%, SK would yield the higher expected utility. This threshold value, however, was much greater than the probability established in major trials. The administration of t-PA leads to a slightly better outcome than does the administration of SK in a patient with suspected AMI.

We show that this simulation can not be made polynomial: we exhibit explicit Boolean functions f that require deterministic trees of size exp(Ohm(log(2) N)) where N is the total number of monomials in minimal DNFs for f and -f. Moreover, we exhibit new examples of explicit Boolean functions that require deterministic read-once branching programs of exponential size whereas both the functions and their negations have small nondeterministic read-once branching programs. One example results from the Bruen-Blokhuis bound on the size of nontrivial blocking sets in projective planes: it is remarkably simple and combinatorially clear. Other examples have the additional property that f is in AC(0).

Any Boolean function of O(log n) relevant variables can be exactly learned with a set of nonadaptive membership queries alone and a minimum sized decision tree representation of the function constructed, in polynomial time. In contrast, such a function cannot be exactly learned with equivalence queries alone using general decision trees and other representation classes as hypotheses. Our results imply others which may be of independent interest. We show that truth-table minimization of decision trees can be done in polynomial time, complementing the well-known result of Masek that truth-table minimization of DNF formulas is NP-hard. The proofs of our negative results show that general decision trees and related representations are not learnable in polynomial time using equivalence queries alone, confirming a folklore theorem.

To improve the state of the art in this area, we introduced the Genetic Rule and Classifier Construction Environment (GRaCCE). It was previously shown(1) that GRaCCE consistently evolved decision rule sets from data that were significantly more compact than those produced by other methods (such as decision tree algorithms). The primary disadvantage of GRaCCE, however, is its relatively poor run-time execution performance. In this paper, a concurrent version of the GRaCCE architecture is introduced which improves the efficiency of the original algorithm. A prototype of the algorithm is tested on an in-house parallel processor configuration and the results are discussed.

These tools employ techniques that originate from research in various areas such as machine learning, statistical data analysis, and visualization. Each of these techniques makes assumptions concerning the composition of the data collection to be analyzed. If the particular data collection does not meet these assumptions well, the technique usually performs poorly. For example, decision tree tools, such as C4.5, rely on rectangular approximations, which do not perform too well if the boundaries between different classes have other shapes such as a 45 degree line or elliptical shapes. However, if we could find a transformation f that transforms the original attribute space into a space in which class boundaries are more rectangular better approximations could be obtained. In this paper, we address the problem of finding such transformations f. We describe the features of tool, called WOLS, whose goal is the discovery of good ingredients for such transformation functions f, which we call building blocks. The tool employs genetic programming and symbolic regression for this purpose. We also present and discuss the results of case studies in using the building block analysis tool in the areas of decision tree learning and regression analysis.

Many different methods for this type of concealment have been proposed, operating in the spatial, frequency, or temporal domains, or some hybrid combination of them. In this paper, we show how the use of a decision tree that can adaptively choose among several different error concealment methods can outperform each single method. We also propose two promising new methods for temporal error concealment.

Two different approaches for the detection of cumulus clouds in GOES satellite imagery are discussed and intercompared. The first type, structural thresholding, uses the morphology of cumulus cloud fields for detection. The second type, uses 1)classifiers based on texture and spectral, 2)edge detection and spectral, and 3)purely spectral features. For five selected scenes, cumulus cloud masks are created using these various methods and are compared against the expert-labeled masks. The structural thresholding method has the highest percentage of correct classification (764b), followed by classifier based on Laplacian edge detection features (74%). The classification time is lowest for the structural thesholding method, followed by classifiers based on spectral, edge detection, textural features. The structural thresholding method also is capable of detecting individual cumulus clouds within cloud fields. For the five scenes investigated, the average percentage of correct labeling of cumulus clouds by the structural thresholding method is 86%.

One concern is that the performance of polymorphic function calls is too slow. In this paper we describe an experiment that compares the performance of an instrument control unit module implemented using three different techniques. We compare a structured decision tree solution against both static and dynamic polymorphic solutions. Ow results show that polymorphic solutions outperform the structured decision tree solution.

J	Lerche, I				Lerche, I			Measures of value-added information in hydrocarbon exploration projects	ENERGY EXPLORATION & EXPLOITATION			English	Article								This paper shows that use solely of the expected value for an exploration project does not include any aspects concerning the risk of the project. Three additional measures, involving the variance around the expected value, the volatility, and the cumulative probability of making a distinguish between projects that have the same expected value and which would otherwise be considered equal in worth. In addition, the acquisition (at some cost) of further data or of further studies in attempts to resolve better the project, are both shown to depend on two factors: first, whether the information is to be acquired in order to produce desired changes in the success and failure chances of the project (which such newly acquired data may not end up doing!); second, even if the data do as required, one cannot use the difference between expected values of the project in the absence and presence of the new data to provide an estimate of value-added to the project assessment. Such a determination can arise only when measures of risk and uncertainty are used in addition to expected value because expected value, on its own, does not contain the risk information required. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate these points using decision-tree methods.

This uncertainty is exemplified by the fact that predicting the speed of the beer fermentation process is a non-trivial task. We employ neural network and decision tree learning to predict the speed of the beer fermentation process. We use two data sets: one that comes from laboratory-scale experiments and another that has been collected from an industrial scale brewing process. In the laboratory-scale experiments a neural network that employs characteristics of the ingredients and the condition of the yeast, could predict the fermentation speed within 2% of the true value. Decision trees for classifying whether the speed of fermentation will be slow or fast were constructed from the same data. Astonishing simple decision trees were able to predict the classes with 95%-98% accuracy. In contrast to the neural net experiment, even the highest accuracy could be reached by utilizing only standard brewery analyses. We then set out to check the utility of these methods in a real brewery environment. The setting in the brewery is more complex and unpredictable than the laboratory in several ways. Regardless, reasonably good results were obtained: the neural network could, on average, predict the duration of the fermentation process within a day of the true value; an accuracy that is sufficient for today's brewery logistics. The accuracy of the decision tree in detecting slow fermentation was around 70%, which is also a useful result.

The pBIC is applied to two important applications. First, it is used as a decision tree growing criterion in place of the conventional approach of using a heuristic constant threshold. It is found that original BIC penalty is too low and will not lead to compact decision tree state tying model. Based on Wolfe's modification to the asymptotic null distribution, it is derived that two times BIC penalty should be used for decision tree state tying based on pBIC. Secondly, pBIC is studied as a model compression criterion for decision tree state tying based acoustic modeling. Experimental results on a large vocabulary (Wall Street Journal) speech recognition task indicate that compact decision tree could be achieved with almost no loss of the speech recognition performance.

The application of sets of phones, mainly phonetically motivated, that limit the possible clusters, results in a reasonably good modeling of unseen phones while it still enables to model specific phones very precisely whenever this is necessary and enough training data is available. Formal Concept Analysis, a young mathematical discipline, provides means for the treatment of sets and sets of sets that are well suited for further improving tree-based state clustering. The possible refinements are outlined and evaluated in this paper. The major merit is the proposal of procedures for the adaptation of the number of sets used for clustering to the amount of available training data, and of a method that generates suitable sets automatically without the incorporation of additional knowledge.

Unlike phonetic features, non-phonetic features in this context are those features, which cannot be derived from the phoneme identities. Although non-phonetic features are used in speech recognition, they are often treated separately and based on various heuristics. In our approach, non-phonetic features are included as additional tags to the decision tree clustering. Moreover, the proposed tagged decision tree is based on the full training data, and therefore, it alleviates the problem of training data depletion in building specific feature dependent acoustic models. Experimental results indicate that up to 10% word error rate reduction can be achieved in a large vocabulary (Wall Street Journal) speech recognition task based on the proposed approach.

Because of the problems of a diversified training data set and/or possible acoustic mismatches between training and testing conditions, the structure learned from the training data by using a maximum likelihood training method will not necessarily generalize well on mismatched tasks. We apply the above concept to the structural learning problem of phonetic decision-tree based hidden Markov model (HMM) state tying. We present a new method that integrates a linear-transformation based normalization mechanism into the decision-tree construction process to make the learned structure have a better modeling capability and generalizability. The viability and efficacy of the proposed method are confirmed in a series of experiments for continuous speech recognition of Mandarin Chinese.

Standard methods such as ID3 may provide non-monotonic decision trees in the sense that data with larger values in all attributes are sometimes classified into a class with a smaller output value. (In the case of binary data, this is equivalent to saying that the discriminant Boolean function that the decision tree represents is not positive.) A motivation of this study comes from an observation that real world data are often positive, and in such cases it is natural to build decision trees which represent positive (i.e., monotone) discriminant functions. For this, we propose how to modify the existing procedures such as ID3, so that the resulting decision tree represents a positive discriminant function. In this procedure, we add some new data to recover the positivity of data. which the original data had but was lost in the process of decomposing data sets by such methods as ID3. To compare the performance of our method with existing methods, we test (1) positive data, which are randomly generated from a hidden positive Boolean function after adding dummy attributes, and (2) breast cancer data as an example of the real-world data. The experimental results on (1) tell that, although the sizes of positive decision trees are relatively larger than those without positivity assumption, positive decision trees exhibit higher accuracy and tend to choose correct attributes, on which the hidden positive Boolean function is defined. For the breast cancer data set, we also observe a similar tendency; i.e., positive decision trees are larger but give higher accuracy.

In general, the disambiguation rules differ for different words. For this reason, the automatic construction of disambiguation rules is highly desirable. One way to achieve this aim is by applying machine learning techniques to training data containing the various senses of the ambiguous words. In the work presented here, the decision tree learning algorithm C4.5 is applied on a corpus of financial news articles. Instead of concentrating on a small set of ambiguous words, as done in most of the related previous work, all content words of the examined corpus are disambiguated. Furthermore, the effectiveness of word sense disambiguation for different parts of speech (nouns and verbs) is examined empirically.

A new grafting algorithm is presented that considers one set of training data only for each leaf of the initial decision tree, the set of cases that fail at most one test on the path to the leaf. This new technique is demonstrated to retain the error reduction power of the original grafting algorithm while dramatically reducing compute time and the complexity of the inferred tree. Bias/variance analyses reveal that the original grafting technique operated primarily by variance reduction while the new technique reduces both bias and variance.

Often data mining techniques (e.g. discretization or decision tree) are based on searching for an optimal partition of data with respect to some optimization criterion. In this paper, we investigate the problem of optimal binary partition of continuous attribute domain for large data sets stored in relational data bases (RDB). The critical for time complexity of algorithms solving this problem is the number of simple SQL queries like SELECT COUNT FROM... WHERE attribute BETWEEN (related to some interval of attribute values) necessary to construct such partitions. We assume that the answer time for such queries does not depend on the interval length. Using straightforward approach to optimal partition selection (with respect to a given measure), the number of necessary queries is of order O(N), where N is the number of preassumed partitions of the searching space. We show some properties of considered optimization measures, that allow to reduce the size of searching space. Moreover, we prove that using only O(log N) simple queries, one can construct the partition very close to optimal.

Associative models provide efficiency by matching the observed situation to a recorded pattern equipped with an accurate decision. We rely on a decision tree accounting for the context and temporal chronicles expressing dynamic patterns. In highly reactive domains, i.e. when actions get as frequent as observations, the decision must anticipate the complete recognition of a pattern, comparing possible evolutions. This paper focuses on the on-line decision process, a game against Nature in the general case: a timed game automaton gathers the possible next steps with associated goodness values, and uses an opportunistic algorithm to compute a temporally expressive decision, maximizing its utility, i.e. the chances of "winning".

This is a complex spatio-temporal pattern recognition problem which we propose to solve by integrating image understanding and natural language understanding. Specifically, this paper describes the model representation used at different levels of abstraction incorporating several types of knowledge: expert knowledge, domain knowledge and spatio-temporal knowledge. We also describe a decision tree based incremental learning algorithm which combines context. knowledge, attribute selection and the ageing of knowledge to keep the model representation of the plays consistent with the information extracted from the American Football video tapes.

The technique can be divided into three major steps: The first step is pre-processing in which the original image is transformed into a binary image utilizing a 300 dpi scanner and then forming the connected component. At the moment we extract seven types of global features: number of subwords, number of peaks of each subwords, number of loops of each peak, number and position of complementary characters,. Second, global features of the input Arabic word are then extracted such as number subwords, number of peaks within the subword, number of loops of each peak, number the height and width of each peak and position of the complementary character, etc.. Finally, Machine learning C4.5 is used for character classification to generate a decision tree. The system was tested with a set of 500 different classes of Arabic words teach class has fifteen different fonts) using Cross validation algorithm and the average recognition rate obtained was 96.52%. This is a very promising result and clearly shows that machine learning techniques are well suited to these types of application.

The platforms will consist of ships, aircraft, etc The resources will be various sensors: ESM, RADAR, IFF, and communications. The RM will allow codification of military expertise in a simple mathematical formalism known as the fuzzy decision tree. The fuzzy decision tree will form what is known as a fuzzy linguistic description, ie., a formal fuzzy if-then rule based representation of the system. Since the decision tree is fuzzy the uncertainty inherent in the root concepts propagates throughout the tree. The functional form of the fuzzy membership functions for the root concepts will be selected heuristically and will generally carry one or more free parameters. The free parameters in the root concepts will be determined by optimization both initially and later at non-critical times. A genetic algorithm will be used for optimization.

Construction of good classifiers is computationally intensive and offers plenty of scope for parallelization. Divide-and-conquer paradigm can be used to efficiently construct decision tree classifiers. We discuss in detail various techniques for parallel divide-and-conquer and extend these techniques to handle efficiently disk-resident data. Furthermore, a generic technique for parallel out-of-core divide-and-conquer problems is suggested We present pCLOUDS, the parallel version of the decision tree classifier algorithm CLOUDS, capable of handling large out-of-core data sets. pCLOUDS exhibits excellent speedup, sizeup and scaleup properties which make it a competitive tool for data mining applications. We evaluate the performance of pCLOUDS for a range of synthetic darn sets on the IBM-SP2.

The selection of the excavating and haulage equipment to remove the overburden in opencast mining has a significant effect on the profitability of the operation. Thirty-five to fifty percent of the total cost of operating an opencast mine is attributed to excavation costs and 15-20% of the total cost is attributed to haulage costs. The decision to select equipment is often based on past experience, location, and different organizational pressures, as well as complex numerical computations, Therefore, the research was directed into the development of a decision support system XpertRule for the selection of opencast mine equipment (XSOME), which was designed using a hybrid knowledge-base system and genetic algorithms. The knowledge base within XSOME is a decision-making task utilizing a decision tree that represents several nested production rules. The knowledge base relates mainly to the selection of equipment in broad categories. XSOME also applies advanced genetic algorithms search techniques to find the input variables that can achieve the optimal cost. The system was tested on four case studies to validate its accuracy. For each case study the equipment selected by XSOME was analyzed and compared with the actual equipment used by the contractor in the mine. A sensitivity analysis was performed on each case study to provide potential suggestions in areas where improvements could be made.

Six Malaysian gastroenterologists met to discuss the direct costs related to Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication treatment. Five treatment strategies were compared: (i) histamine H(2) receptor antagonists (H(2)RA), acid suppression therapy for 6 weeks followed by maintenance therapy as needed; (ii) bismuth triple + proton pump inhibitor (PPI), bismuth (120 mg, q.i.d.), metronidazole (400 mg; t.i.d.), tetracycline (500 mg, q.i.d.) for 7 days and PPI, b.i.d., fur 7 days; (iii) OAC, omeprazole (20 mg, b.i.d.), amoxycillin (1000 mg, b.i.d.) and clarithromycin (500 mg, b.i.d.) for 7 days; (iv) OMC, omeprazole (20 mg, b.i.d.), metronidazole (400 mg, b.i.d.) and clarithromycin (500 mg, b.i.d.) for 7 days; and (v) OAM, omeprazole (20 mg, b.i.d.), amoxycillin (1000 mg, b.i.d.) and metronidazole (400 mg, b.i.d.) for 7 days. A decision tree model was created to determine which therapy would be the most cost-effective. The model considered eradication rates, resistance to anti-microbial agents, compliance and cost implications of treatment regimens, physician visits and ulcer recurrences during a 1 year time period assumption. The H(2)RA. maintenance therapy was the most expensive treatment at Malaysian Ringgit (MR) 2335, followed by bismuth triple therapy (MR 1839), OMC (MR 1786), OAM (MR 1775) and OAC, being the most cost-effective therapy, at MR 1679. In conclusion, HP eradication therapy is superior to H(2)RA maintenance therapy in the treatment of duodenal ulcer disease. Of the HP eradication regimens, OAC is the most cost-affective.

Amer Med Informat Assoc				We show how to generate case-based explanations for non-case-based learning methods such as artificial neural nets or decision trees. The method uses the trained model (e.g., the neural net or the decision tree) as, a distance metric to determine which cases in the training set are most similar to the case that needs to be explained. This approach is well suited to medical domains, where it is important to understand predictions made by complex machine learning models, and where training and clinical practice makes users adept at case interpretation.

These classifiers are in the form of a majority vote over a number of decision trees. Unfortunately, these classifiers are often large, complex and difficult to interpret. This paper describes a new type of classification rule, the alternating decision tree, which is a generalization of decision trees, voted decision trees and voted decision stumps. At the same time classifiers of this type are relatively easy to interpret. We present a learning algorithm for alternating decision trees that is based on boosting. Experimental results show it is competitive with boosted decision tree algorithms such as C5.0, and generates rules that are usually smaller in size and thus easier to interpret. In addition these rules yield a natural measure of classification confidence which can be used to improve the accuracy at the cost of abstaining from predicting examples that are hard to classify.

We have shown that it performs quite well, in terms of accuracy and learning times, in comparison with other multivariate systems like LMDT, OC1, and CART. In this work, we extend the previous work by using two new discriminant functions: a quadratic discriminant and a logistic discriminant. Using the same architecture as Ltree we obtain two new multivariate trees Qtree and LgTree. The three systems have been evaluate on 17 UCI datasets. From the empirical study, we argue that these systems can be shown as a composition of classifiers with low correlation error. From a bias-variance analysis of the error rate, the error reduction of all the systems in comparison to a univariate tree, is due to a reduction on both components.

The major techniques developed in system design include (a) image standardization by applying a series of preprocessing to remove extrinsic signal, extract breast area, and normalize the image intensity; (b) multi-mode processing by decomposing image features using directional wavelet transform (DWT) and non-linear multi-scale representation using anisotropic diffusion (AD); (c) adaptive processing in image segmentation using localized adaptive thresholding (LAT) and adaptive clustering (AC); and (d) combined "hard"-"soft" classification by using a modified fuzzy decision tree and committee decision-making method. Evaluations and comparisons were taken with a training dataset containing 30 normal and 47 abnormal mammograms with totally 70 masses, and an independent testing dataset consisting of 100 normal images, 39 images with 48 minimal cancers and 25 images with 25 benign masses. A high detection performance of sensitivity TP=93% with false positive rate FP=3.1 per image and a good generalizability with TP=80% and FP=2.0 per image are obtained.

They are based on different models and the best of them are providing an explanation together with an accurate, reliable and quick response. One of the most viable among decision-making models is the concept of decision trees, already successfully used for many medical decision making purposes. Although effective and reliable, the traditional decision tree construction approach still contains several deficiencies. Therefore we decided to develop and compare several decision supporting models, each of them built with different discretization of attributes and decision classes. For the construction of decision trees we used MtDeciT, in our laboratory developed tool for building decision trees using the classical induction method. All solutions were evolved for determining the influence of basic properties of child and his/her parents to length of successful breastfeeding. A comparison between developed models and obtained results has shown that the way of discretization obviously plays a great role in the reliable and accurate real-world medical decision making.

What is especially true about accessibility of rapid prototyping for terminal impaction is the enhancement of a system structure that will direct the specific material and impact situation toward a specific predictive model, yielding an outcome of physical significance. This, of course, is of particular importance when the ranges of validity are at stake and the pertinent constraints associated with the impact are unknown. Hence, a compilation of semi-empirical predictive penetration relations for various physical phenomena has been organized into a data structure for the purpose of developing a knowledge-based decision-aided expert system to predict the terminal ballistic behavior of projectiles and targets. The ranges of validity and constraints of operation of each model were examined and cast into a decision tree structure to include target type, target material, projectile types, projectile materials, attack configuration, and performance or damage measures. This decision system implements many penetration relations, identifies formulas that match user-given conditions, and displays the predictive relation coincident with the match, in addition to a numerical solution. The physical regimes under consideration encompass the hydrodynamic, transitional, and solid; the targets are either semi-infinite or plate; and the projectiles include kinetic energy (KE) and chemical energy (CE). A preliminary database has also been created to allow further development of inductive and deductive reasoning techniques to be applied to ballistic situations involving terminal mechanics.

Since the complexity of technical system increases and innovation cycles are shortened, the need for systematic decision tree generation and maintenance arises. In this paper, the MAD system is introduced which generates decision trees based on qualitative device models. Existing resources such as design data and expert design know-how as well as decision trees and diagnosis knowledge can easily be reused and integrated into decision tree generation. Since decision tree generation is based on device models, applying MAD reduces average fault identification cost and facilitates quality management of diagnosis equipment. Furthermore, cost of diagnosis system generation, modification and maintenance is reduced. We have successfully evaluated the MAD system in cooperation with the german forklift manufacturer STILL GmbH Hamburg.

When people try to communicate their concepts with words, the difference in the meaning and usage of words can lead to misunderstanding in communication, which can hinder their collaboration. In our approach each granule of knowledge in classification from users is structured into a decision tree so that difference in the usage of word can be discovered as the difference in the structure of tree. By treating each granule of classification knowledge as an individual in Genetic Algorithm (GA), evolution is carried out with respect to the classification efficiency of each individual and diversity as a population so that difference in the usage of words will emerge as the difference in the structure of decision tree. Experiments were carried out on motor diagnosis cases with artificially encoded difference in the usage of words and the result shows the effectiveness of our evolutionary approach.

The odor samples are obtained from an electronic nose that contains conducting polymer sensors with partially overlapping sensitivities to odors. The sensor responses are represented by means of the coefficients of their Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). A feature reduction method is applied to reduce the feature space dimension. Then, an unsupervised Fuzzy Divisive Hierarchical Clustering (FDHC) method is used to establish the optimal number of clusters in the data set as well as the optimal cluster structure. The output of FDHC is a binary hierarchy of fuzzy classes that are used to build a supervised fuzzy hierarchical classifier. At each level of the fuzzy hierarchy a separating hyperplane of the two corresponding fuzzy training classes is determined. The hyperplane identifies two crisp decision regions, which will be refined at the next level of the hierarchy. Zn this way, we obtain a hierarchy of regions, which defines a crisp decision tree. Each region is, therefore, related to a specific expected output of the system. Recognition of an unknown odor is accomplished by computing the FFT of the corresponding signal and using the decision tree to establish the region the odor belongs to. Two small-scale applications of the method yielded 100% classification accuracy on out-of-sample data.

A new NT classifier with backtracking capabilities is employed at different levels of the system architecture. First, it is used to obtain a rough interpretation of the scene by classifying each image pixel into multiple classes of static background objects, e.g. road, sky, vegetation, or into one generic class representing moving objects, e.g, vehicles, pedestrians. Then it is applied to obtain a more accurate scene interpretation by classifying all detected mobile objects into multiple classes, e.g. cars, lorries, buses, and also estimating their pose. Experiments have been performed on a large set of optical and infrared images. System performances are tested on both clean and noisy data, and comparative studies with other classifiers (i.e, a multi layer perceptron, a binary decision tree, a standard NT and a bank of neural networks) and with other scene classification methods are carried out.

A public third-party perspective was adopted. Design: The analysis was based on a decision tree and considered the episode of care from the decision to initiate an antibacterial until the end of the first course of treatment or the end of a subsequent course of treatment when needed. Efficacy data were retrieved from published clinical trials. Direct medical costs included the costs of physician visits, diagnostic tests and medications. Setting: The study pertained to adults treated in a primary-care setting in the Canadian province of Quebec. Interventions: The antibacterials studied were amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, azithromycin, cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil and clarithromycin. Main outcome measures and results: The main outcome measured was the proportion of patients showing resolution or improvement of their symptoms. Initiating a treatment with amoxicillin was associated with similar efficacy and lower overall costs when compared with the other antibacterials. Low dosages of clarithromycin and azithromycin followed amoxicillin in terms of cost-efficacy ratio.

The contour of embryo images was segmented, digitalized and converted to numerical values after the discrete and fast Fourier transformation. These values, or Fourier features, along with some other shape factors, were used for embryo classification. The pattern recognition system used a hierarchical decision tree to classify Douglas fir embryos into three normal and one abnormal embryo classes. An accuracy of greater than 80% was achieved for normal embryos. This system provides an objective and efficient method of classifying embryos of Douglas fir. It will be a useful tool for kinetic studies and process optimization of conifer somatic embryogenesis.

Of these, even fewer have their performance qualified by how they are used. But how a data structure is used can significantly affect performance. This paper makes three original contributions. (1) We present an algorithm for generating a benchmark according to a given use of data structure. (2) We compare use of an automated tool based on this algorithm, with the traditional technique of hand-picked benchmarks, by benchmarking six implementations of random-access list using both methods. (3) We use the results of this benchmarking to present a decision tree for the choice of random-access list implementation, according to how the list will be used.

In this paper we consider two applications of decision tree learning in the domain of river water quality: a) the simultaneous prediction of multiple physico-chemical properties of the water from its biological properties using a single decision tree (as opposed to learning a different tree for each different property) and b) the prediction of past physico-chemical properties of the river water from its current biological properties. We discuss some experimental results that we believe are interesting both to the application domain experts and to the machine learning community.

However, these aproaches either cause a loss of accuracy or cannot effectively uncover the data structure. We explore a more promising GA-based decision tree classifier, OOGASC4.5, to integrate the strengths of decision tree algorithms with statistical sampling and genetic algorithm. The proposed program could not only enhance the classification accuracy but assumes the potential advantage of extracting valuable rules as well. The computational results are provided along with analysis and conclusions.

One disadvantage is that they do not take the structure of the data into account. By going from the standard single-relation approach to the multi-relational approach as in ILP this disadvantage is removed. However, the straightforward generalisation loses the efficiency. In this paper we present a framework that allows for efficient discovery of multi-relational decision trees through exploitation of domain knowledge encoded in the data model of the database.

Accordingly there is special interest in understanding the nature of variations in load shape, better to devise competitive tariff structures and facilitate aggressive niche marketing. Utilities have databases of half-hourly loads too large to be interpreted by hand and eye; potentially valuable information is hidden therein which is nor revealed by coarse statistics. The heterogeneity of response, the large number of predictors, and the sheer size of these databases impose severe theoretical and computational difficulties on load shape modeling. Data mining refers (in part) to the use of adaptive non-parametric models (which vary their strategy according to the local nature of the data) for efficiently discovering knowledge in just such databases. A method centering on adaptive decision tree clustering of load profiles is presented, and results utilising an actual database are discussed.

The proposed framework is also used to improve the grouping process of the individual cores so as to reduce the variation in core loss of assembled transformer. Several neural network structures and the respective training sets have been stored in a database, corresponding to the various magnetic materials. Selection of the most appropriate network from the database is relied on the satisfaction of customers' requirements and several technical and economical criteria. In case that the network performance is not satisfactory, a small adaptation of the retrieved network weights is performed. A decision tree methodology has been adopted to select the most appropriate attributes used as input vectors to the neural networks.

LCM encompasses an increasing group of mold filling processes, which involve the injection of a resin into a mold cavity filled with a fibrous reinforcement preform. The goal is to understand the fiber fluid interactions at the microscopic level and to develop a macroscopic description to predict the movement of the free surface flow front of a thermosetting resin through a complex three-dimensional mold geometry. Practice has converged on use of Darcy's law to describe the impregnation process by treating the stationary fibers as an anisotropic porous media. A key to successful modeling is the permeability of the porous media which characterizes the resistance of the fibers to the flow of the infiltrating resin. The seminar will address modeling permeability for plain weave fabric, fabric deformation and its effect on flow, race tracking near the mold walls and edges, presence of fiber bundles with low permeabities as compared to the overall preform resistance and how to incorporate this knowledge in a numerical simulation of the LCM process. A promising approach to implement on-line control of LCM based on numerical simulations and in-situ sensors will also be discussed.

This paper discusses a digital music library from the information retrieval viewpoint and proposes a method for extracting theme phrases. These are then used to present a shorter version of retrieved music to users. The method consists of two steps, phrase extraction and syntactical classification of segmented fragments of melodies. Phrase extraction is carried out based on a few heuristic rules. We conducted an experiment on the accuracy of phrase extraction using 94 Japanese popular songs and obtained 0.766 recall and 0.786 precision. The syntactical classification is based on a probabilistic syntactical pattern analysis combining classification and syntactical analysis. The proposed method uses a decision tree and a finite state automaton and obtained 0.884 accuracy in theme phrase extraction.

Given a training database of records, each tagged with a class label, the goal of classification is to build a concise model that can be used to predict the class label of future, unlabeled records. A very popular class of classifiers are decision trees. All current algorithms to construct decision trees, including all main-memory algorithms, make one scan over the training database per level of the tree. We introduce a new algorithm (BOAT) for decision tree construction that improves upon earlier algorithms in both performance and functionality. BOAT constructs several levels of the tree in only two scans over the training database, resulting in an average performance gain of 300% over previous work. The key to this performance improvement is a novel optimistic approach to tree construction in which we construct an initial tree using a small subset of the data and refine it to arrive at the final tree. We guarantee that any difference with respect to the "real" tree (i.e., the tree that would be constructed by examining all the data in a traditional way) is detected and corrected. The correction step occasionally requires us to make additional scans over subsets of the data; typically, this situation rarely arises, and can be addressed with little added cost. Beyond offering faster tree construction, BOAT is the first scalable algorithm with the ability to incrementally update the tree with respect to both insertions and deletions over the dataset. This property is valuable in dynamic environments such as data warehouses, in which the training dataset changes over time. The BOAT update operation is much cheaper than completely rebuilding the tree, and the resulting tree is guaranteed to be identical to the tree that would be produced by a complete re-build.

Provided they are presented with sufficient training data, inductive classifier builders such as C4.5 are limited by encoding deficiencies and noise in the data, rather than by the method of deciding the category. However, such classification techniques do not perform well on the small, dirty/or and dynamic data sets which are all that are available in many decision making domains. Moreover, their computational overhead may not be justified. This pager draws on conjectures about human categorization processes to design a frugal algorithm for use with such data. On presentation of an observation, case-specific rules are derived from a small subset of the stored examples, where the subset is selected on the basis of similarity to the encoded stimulus. Attention is focused on those features that appear to be most useful for distinguishing categories of observations similar to the current one. A measure of logical semantic information value is used to discriminate between categories that remain plausible after this. The new classifier is demonstrated against neural net and decision tree classifiers on some standard UCI data sets and shown to perform well.

In this paper, we introduce a new method for detecting feature interactions by evaluating the accuracies of a learning algorithm on random subsets of features. We give an operational definition for feature interactions based on when a set of features allows a learning algorithm to achieve higher than expected accuracy, assuming independence. Then we show how to adjust the sampling of random subsets in a way that is fair and balanced, given a limited amount of dime. Finally, we show how decision trees built from sets of interacting features can be converted into DNF expressions to form constructed features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method empirically by showing that it can improve the accuracy of the C4.5 decision-tree algorithm on several benchmark databases.

First, tree size is often a linear function of training set size, even when additional tree structure yields no increase in accuracy. Second, building trees with data in which the class label and the attributes are independent often results in large trees. In both cases, the pruning algorithms fail to central tree growth as one would expect them to. We explore this behavior theoretically by constructing a statistical model of reduced error pruning. The model explains why and when the pathologies occur, and makes predictions about how to lessen their effects.

This paper discusses two tools to help select and implement environmental sampling plans. SampTOOL and Visual Sample Plan (VSP), two software tools under development by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, will be demonstrated. Both tools support a Data Quality Objectives (DQO) approach to ensure the right type, quality, and quantity of data are gathered to permit confident decisions about remediation and environmental characterization needs. SampTOOL is a web-based software application for determining the best sampling design for certain types of environmental media contamination problems. SampTOOL is structured as a decision tree (flow chart) that can be accessed interactively over the Internet in conjunction with hard copy flow charts. Users are posed a series of questions about their site, the problem to be resolved with sampling data, and availability of supplemental information. SampTOOL uses the responses to narrow down the feasible sampling designs suited for this problem and identifies the best-matched design for the problem and sampling constraints. Once a sampling plan has been selected, Visual Sample Plan, a stand-alone Windows-95 program, can be used to overlay the recommend sampling design on a map of the site and the actual number and placement of the samples can be derived. Since this is done on-screen, the user can immediately see the implications of the various assumptions that go into a sampling design and interactively experiment with different scenarios. Finally, the sampling coordinates of the selected design can be exported to a GPS system to facilitate fieldwork.

Unlike the recent results which utilize binary Decision Trees (DTs), we study the minimization procedure as a heuristic search bused oil information measures on the Free pseudo ternary DTs. The main contribution of tills paper is an experimental justification of the entropy based method that yields the extreme improvements compared to some recent results on application of information theory methods for SOP minimization of switching functions. In most cases, we obtained that the quality of minimization with our minimizer InfoMin-2 is the same as that produced by ESPRESSO package, but is often performed faster.

J	Rama, M				Rama, M			Public sector downsizing: An introduction	WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW			English	Editorial Material							DISPLACED WORKERS; PRIVATIZATION	Authorities throughout the developing world are turning to downsizing in an effort to reduce budget deficits and address the inefficiencies engendered by state-led development strategies. Because large-scale involuntary dismissals are often politically difficult, a voluntary approach to reductions in public sector employment is increasingly Popular among developing-country governments, multilateral organizations, and donor countries. This article (and, more generally, the research project on Public Sector Retrenchment) attempts to sketch a protocol for public sector downsizing that takes into account the costs and benefits for the workers and the economy. After reviewing the international experience with downsizing, the article addresses five questions: how to identify the redundant workers, how to predict their losses from separation, how to design compensation and assistance packages, how to assess the financial and economic returns to downsizing, and how to deal with downsizing in one-company towns. Based on the answers to these questions, a decision tree is proposed.

Ten genera of ubiquitous fungi, most of which were potential pathogens, were isolated from the whales over a 16-month period. During this same period, the whales did not exhibit any behavioral, physical, hematological, or biochemical indications of disease. All the genera of fungi isolated from the whales were also found in air and water samples taken throughout the facility. Opportunities for contamination of samples of expired air were identified. A decision tree, which incorporated subjective probability estimates, was created. The final risk-management plan involved: 1) alterations to the management of the pool to reduce environmental contamination and opportunities for exposure to fungi, 2) more rigorous quality control for sample collection, and 3) an increased frequency of blowhole cultures. The animals at the facility, including the newborn calf, remained healthy during the 3 years after the risk-management program. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The proposed algorithms span the gamut of data and task parallelism. The data parallelism is based on attribute scheduling among processors. This basic scheme is extended with task pipelining and dynamic load balancing to yield faster implementations. The task parallel approach rues dynamic subtree partitioning among processors. Our performance evaluation shows that the construction of a decision-tree classifier can be effectively parallelized on an SMP machine with good speedup.

A corresponding decision tree induction algorithm that induces Fril (a support logic programming language) classification rules involving both forms of uncertainties is also de scribed. This algorithm iteratively builds decision trees where each decision tree consists of one branch. This branch is directly translated into Fril rules that explain a part of the problem. The work presented here focuses on propositional representations for both the input data; values and the learned models. The approach is illustrated on the Pima Indian dataset. Finally an overview of the current work: is given which deals with improving the algorithm with a new method for the calculation of support pairs and also with a new, user-independent, stopping criterion for adding literals to the body of a rule.

Several 2-dimensional and Doppler hemodynamic variables from the TTE studies were derived. Prosthetic MR was significant (moderate or severe) by TEE in 20 patients, whereas mild or no MR was seen in 37 patients. The best univariate predictors of significant MR by TIE were peak velocity of mitral inflow, mean gradient, tricuspid regurgitation velocity, isovolumic relaxation time, and ratio of time velocity integral of mitral inflow to time velocity integral in the left ventricular outflow (TVIMV/TVILVO). Peak mitral velocity and TVIMV/TVILVO were the best predictors of significant MR and performed similarly (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve: 0.97 for both). A peak velocity of greater than or equal to 1.9 m/s was 90% sensitive and 89% specific for significant prosthetic MR, whereas a TVIMV/TVILVO greater than or equal to 2.5 had a sensitivity and specificity of 89% and 91%, respectively. A decision tree was constructed to assess the conditional probabilities of having significant MR given all the possible outcomes of the 2 best predictors. None of the patients with peak velocity <1.9 m/s and TVIMV/TVILVO <2.5 by TTE had significant MR. Conversely, all patients with peak velocity greater than or equal to 1.9 m/s and TVIMV/TVILVO greater than or equal to 2.5 had significant MR. The use of more complex algorithms did not further improve the results. Thus, measurements of hemodynamic Doppler variables on TTE examination can accurately identify a large number of patients without significant prosthetic MR, thereby reducing the need for further investigation with TEE, (C) 1999 by Excerpta Medico, Inc.

The prevailing practice seems to favor KA-LD over SPK, presumably due to the superior long-term renal graft survival in KA-LD and the elimination of the lengthy waiting time on the cadaver transplant list. In this study, two treatment options, KA-LD followed by pancreas-after-kidney (PAK) and SPK transplant, are compared using a cost-utility decision analysis model. The decision tree consisted of a choice between KA-LD + PAK and SPK. The analysis was based on a 5-yr model and the measures of outcome used in the model were cost, utility and cost-utility. The expected 5-yr cost was $277638 for KA-LD + PAK and $288466 for SPK. When adjusted for utilities, KA-LD + PAK at a cost of $153911 was less cost-effective than SPK at a cost of $110828 per quality-adjusted year. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed by varying patient and graft survival probabilities, utilities and cost. SPK remained the optimal strategy over KA-LD + PAK across all variations. Two-way sensitivity analysis showed that in order for KA-LD + PAK to be at least as cost-effective as SPK, 5-yr pancreas and patient survival rates following PAK would need to surpass 86 and 80%. In conclusion, according to the 5-yr cost-utility model presented in this study, KA-LD followed by PAK is less cost-effective than SPK as a treatment strategy for a type I diabetic with end-stage renal disease. For patients interested in the benefits of a pancreas transplant, it would be reasonable to offer SPK as the optimal treatment, even if a living kidney donor is available.

J	Kearns, M; Mansour, Y				Kearns, M; Mansour, Y			On the boosting ability of top-down decision tree learning algorithms	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER AND SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART Symposium on Principles of Database Systems	JUN 03-05, 1996	MONTREAL, CANADA	SIGACT, SIGMOD, SIGART				We analyze the performance of top-down algorithms for decision tree learning, such as those employed by the widely used C4.5 and CART software packages. Our main result is a proof that such algorithms are boosting algorithms. By this we mean that if the functions that label the internal nodes of the decision tree can weakly approximate the unknown target function, then the top-down algorithms we study will amplify this weaks advantage to build a tree achieving any desired level of accuracy, The bounds we obtain for this amplification show an interesting dependence on the splitting criterion used by the top-down algorithm, More precisely, if the functions used to label the internal nodes have error 1/2 - gamma as approximations to the target function, then for the splitting criteria used by CART and C4.5, trees of size (1/epsilon)(O(1/gamma 2 epsilon 2)) and (1/epsilon)(O(log(1/epsilon)/gamma 2)) (respectively) suffice to drive the error below epsilon. Thus (for example), a small constant advantage over random guessing is amplified to any larger constant advantage with trees of constant size. For a new splitting criterion suggested by our analysis, the much stronger bound of (1/epsilon)(O(1/gamma 2)) which is polynomial in 1/epsilon) is obtained, which is provably optimal for decision tree algorithms, The differing bounds have a natured explanation in terms of concavity properties of the splitting criterion, The primary contribution of this work is in proving that some popular and empirically successful heuristics that are base on first principles meet the criteria of an independently motivated theoretical model.

The hybrid control architecture described combines properties of purely reactive and behaviour-based systems, providing the ability both to learn automatically behaviours from inception, and to capture these in a distributed hierarchy of decision tree networks. The robot is first trained in the simplest world which has no obstacles, and is then trained in successively more complex worlds, using the knowledge acquired in the previous worlds. Each world representing the perceptual space is thus directly mapped on a unique rule layer which represents in turn the robot action space encoded in a distinct decision tree. A major advantage of the current implementation, compared with the previous work, is that the generated rules are easily understood by human users. The paper demonstrates that the proposed behavioural decomposition approach provides efficient management of complex knowledge, and that the learning mechanism is able to cope with noise and uncertainty in sensory data.

All of these data were subjected to a principal components analysis, On the basis of this multivariate analysis, Fuhrman grade II was subdivided into grades II- and II+, and Fuhrman grade III into grade III- and III+. The same kind of subcategorization was performed in the case of the T2 and T3 clinical stages. The results show that the classification into grade II- and III- RCCs correspond to a more favourable prognosis than grade II+ and III+, to which shorter survival periods mere attributable. Similar results were obtained for the subcategorization of the T2 and T3 clinical stages, Very simple biological characterizations of these grade- or stage-related RCC groups mere obtained by means of a decision tree approach applied to the cytometry-generated variables. The resulting classification rules mere validated on a new series of 18 patients and enabled very accurate predictions of survival. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this study, we used decision tree induction as an information processing system for the analysis of flow cytometry immunophenotype results of bone marrow specimens obtained for the diagnosis of acute leukemia. By using decision tree analysis, we queried which antibodies and at what percentage cut-offs led to particular diagnoses. Flow cytometry results of up to 27 monoclonal antibodies from bone marrow specimens of 175 adult and pediatric cases were used: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 80), myeloid leukemia (n = 44), mixed lineage (n = 16), and reactive marrow (n = 35). The percentage of positive cells was used as input data, and the diagnoses were used as output of the information processing system. Results of the decision tree showed an easy, accurate, and intuitive algorithm that can delineate a hierarchy of antibodies relevant to diagnosis. A correct discrimination of acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemia from benign bone marrow can be inferred by using the results of four to eight from a panel of up to 27 antibodies with an accuracy of 95%. Here, we describe a computer-aided model that uses decision tree induction applied to flow cytometry immunophenotype data. If generalizable, this technique may be an alternative approach to modeling complex information like that seen in hematopathology and may complement the immunologist's interpretation, along with cytochemistry and morphology results, in the diagnosis of acute leukemia.

J	Daelemans, W; Van den Bosch, A; Zavrel, J				Daelemans, W; Van den Bosch, A; Zavrel, J			Forgetting exceptions is harmful in language learning	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						memory-based learning; natural language learning; edited nearest neighbor classifier; decision-tree learning	ALGORITHMS; INDUCTION	We show that in language learning, contrary to received wisdom, keeping exceptional training instances in memory can be beneficial for generalization accuracy. We investigate this phenomenon empirically on a selection of benchmark natural language processing tasks: grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, part-of-speech tagging, prepositional-phrase attachment, and base noun phrase chunking. In a first series of experiments we combine memory-based learning with training set editing techniques, in which instances are edited based on their typicality and class prediction strength. Results show that editing exceptional instances (with low typicality or low class prediction strength) tends to harm generalization accuracy. In a second series of experiments we compare memory-based learning and decision-tree learning methods on the same selection of tasks, and find that decision-tree learning often performs worse than memory-based learning. Moreover, the decrease in performance can be linked to the degree of abstraction from exceptions (i.e., pruning or eagerness). We provide explanations for both results in terms of the properties of the natural language processing tasks and the learning algorithms.

J	Haruno, M; Shirai, S; Ooyama, Y				Haruno, M; Shirai, S; Ooyama, Y			Using decision trees to construct a practical parser	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						stochastic parsing; decision tree; boosting; dependency grammar; corpus linguistics	NETWORKS	This paper describes a novel and practical Japanese parser that uses decision trees. First, we construct a single decision tree to estimate modification probabilities: how one phrase tends to modify another. Next, we introduce a boosting algorithm in which several decision trees are constructed and then combined for probability estimation. The constructed parsers are evaluated using the EDR Japanese annotated corpus. The single-tree method significantly outperforms the conventional Japanese stochastic methods, Moreover, the boosted version of the parser is shown to have great advantages; (1) a better parsing accuracy than its single-tree counterpart for any amount of training data and (2) no over-fitting to data for various iterations. The presented parser, the first non-English stochastic parser with practical performance, should tighten the coupling between natural language processing and machine learning.

Nine hundred and eighty three consecutive subjects entering the Stanford Sleep Disorder Clinic completed the questionnaire. Clinic physicians reported on the presence or absence of "clear-cut" cataplexy. Responses to 51 cataplexy-related questionnaire items were compared between subjects with clear-cut cataplexy (n=63) and all other patients (n=920). As previously reported, a large portion of the non-narcoleptic population was found to experience muscle weakness with various intense emotions (1.8% to 18.0%) or athletic activities (26.2% to 28.8%). Factor analysis and Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) analysis were used to determine the most predictive items for clear-cut cataplexy. Most strikingly, cataplexy was best differentiated from other types of muscle weakness when triggered by only three typical situations: "when hearing and telling a joke," "while laughing," or "when angry." Face or neck, rather than limbs, were also more specifically involved in clear-cut cataplexy. Other items, such as length of attacks, bilaterality, and alteration in consciousness, were poorly predictive. A simple decision tree was constructed to isolate high-(91.7%) and low-(0.6%) risk groups for cataplexy. This questionnaire will be used to increase diagnostic consistency across clinical centers, thus providing more homogenous subject pools for clinical and basic research studies.

Taking Ekman's data and our previous results into account, we tried to verify a possible evocation by odorants of some basic emotions, i.e. anger, fear, sadness, surprise, disgust and happiness. The question investigated was: would it be possible to associate any of these emotions with a pattern of autonomic responses? A total of 15 subjects inhaled five odorants: lavender, ethyl aceto acetate, camphor, acetic acid and butyric acid acting as olfactory stimuli, after inhaling the odorant, subjects were requested to fill out an Ii-point hedonic scale to rate its 'pleasantness' vs. 'unpleasantness'. ANS parameters monitored were skin potential and resistance, skin blood flow and temperature, instantaneous respiratory frequency and instantaneous heart rate. Simultaneous recording of these six autonomic parameters permitted the analysis of phasic responses through specific ANS patterns. An analysis of variance made it possible to differentiate among the five odorants. Two-by-two odorant comparisons for autonomic responses using Tukey's HSD multiple comparison test only permitted differentiation between 'pleasant' and 'unpleasant' odors. Camphor was differentiated from both types. For instance, long duration responses were associated with 'unpleasant' odors whereas camphor elicited intermediate responses. Taking into account each subject's preferential channel, it was possible to associate each ANS pattern with a basic emotion by means of a decision tree. The computation of subjects' responses made it possible to associate an odorant with a basic emotion, over the whole group: lavender elicited mostly "happiness', as did, to a lesser degree ethyl aceto acetate; camphor induced either 'happiness'. 'surprise' or 'sadness' according to subjects' past histories; butyric and acetic acids mainly induced negative emotions:'anger' and 'disgust'. A high correlation was evidenced between subjects' hedonic evaluation and autonomic estimation of basic emotions. These results obtained from 15 subjects were compared to those observed in two similar experiments. These approaches showed comparable results. Thus, more than 60 subjects showed similar autonomic responses which can be transcribed into basic emotions. Thus, a multiparametric autonomic analysis allows the identification of the quality of the response, i.e. the type of basic emotion in addition to the intensity. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B,V.

J	Boyen, X; Wehenkel, L				Boyen, X; Wehenkel, L			Automatic induction of fuzzy decision trees and its application to power system security assessment	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; artificial intelligence; decision tree; fuzzy sets; inductive inference; neural networks; power systems; transient stability assessment	REGRESSION	In the context of power system security assessment, automatic learning methods have been proposed along many different paradigms (statistics, neural nets, symbolic artificial intelligence, fuzzy systems). In order to solve various learning problems, different automatic learning methods are complementary and the best way to exploit large real data bases is to use a data mining tool-box approach. In this paper we argue that fuzzy decision tree induction promises to be a particularly attractive tool in this framework. It is indeed able to handle large scale problems, while combining interpretability with smooth interpolation capabilities. We describe a new algorithm able to infer fuzzy decision trees in domains where most of the input variables are numerical and output information is best characterized as a fuzzy set. It comprises three complementary steps: growing (selecting relevant attributes and fuzzy thresholds); pruning (determining the appropriate tree complexity); refitting (tuning the tree parameters in a global fashion). The basic features of the method are discussed from theoretical and practical viewpoints. Simulation results obtained in the context of transient stability assessment of a real system are provided in order to support our claims. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This study examined the cost-effectiveness of general and targeted strategies for residential radon testing and mitigation in the United States. Methods. A decision-tree model was used to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of preventing radon-associated deaths from lung cancer. Results. For a radon threshold of 4 pCi/L, the estimated costs to prevent 1 lung cancer death are about $3 million (154 lung cancer deaths prevented), or $480000 per life-year saved, based on universal radon screening and mitigation, and about $2 million (104 lung cancer deaths prevented), or $330000 per life-year saved, if testing and mitigation are confined to geographic areas at high risk for radon exposure. For mitigation undertaken after a single screening test and after a second confirmatory test, the estimated costs are about $920000 and $520000, respectively, to prevent a lung cancer death with universal screening and $130000 and $80000 per life-year for high risk screening. The numbers of preventable lung cancer deaths are 811 and 527 for universal and targeted approaches, respectively. Conclusions. These data suggest possible alternatives to current recommendations.

Methods: This study was conducted in an urban academic emergency department as a prospective observational study of consecutive patients from August 1, 1991, to August 31, 1992, who had abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding and a positive beta-human chorionic gonadotropin level. Patients were excluded if they had a diagnostic ultrasound during a previous visit, or if the uterine size was larger than 12 weeks by pelvic examination. Data were analyzed using chi(2) With a P value less than .05 identified as significant. Odds ratios were determined for significant variables. A classification and regression tree analysis was then performed using the predictive variables to derive a decision tree. Results: Four hundred forty-one patients were enrolled, 57 of whom (13%) had an EP. Factors by history that increased the risk of EP included pain that was described as moderate to severe, lateral, or sharp. Pain located in the midline decreased the risk of EP A history of previous intrauterine device use, infertility, prior pelvic surgery, or tubal ligation were each found to be predictive. On physical examination, the presence of peritoneal signs, cervical motion tenderness, or lateral or bilateral abdominal or pelvic tenderness increased the risk of EP. A uterine size larger than 8 weeks by pelvic examination decreased the risk of EP Combinations of predictive variables identified subsets of patients with either an increased or decreased frequency of EP but in no case was a combination identified that would confirm or exclude this diagnosis with a high degree of certainty. Conclusion: History and physical examination findings predictive of EP were identified. However no constellation of findings could confirm or exclude this diagnosis with a high degree of reliability.

J	Casciola, D; Miers, GL; Surette, RA				Casciola, D; Miers, GL; Surette, RA			UHF antenna choices	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BROADCASTING			English	Article								The implementation of DTV is forcing every television broadcaster to purchase a new antenna. Choosing the best antenna to meet all of the station's needs is not a simple task. With tower space at a premium, tower leasing rates soaring, and FCC deadlines approaching quickly, the broadcaster faces new and non-traditional issues - for example: Do I co-locate with others? Do I go on the air with a temporary low power system now and worry about my final higher power system later? Can I or should I broadcast my current NTSC signal and my new DTV signal on the same antenna? These questions have no historic precedent. To answer them, the broadcaster needs to know about the types of antennas available and the advantages and concerns associated with each one. Three types of UHF antennas are on the market today. They are the slot, the panel, and the superturnstile. This paper presents an overview of each of these. Their advantages and disadvantages are discussed, and a decision tree is developed to help choose the best antenna.

J	Carrasco, JA; Sune, V				Carrasco, JA; Sune, V			An algorithm to find minimal cuts of coherent fault-trees with event-classes, using a decision tree	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY			English	Article						fault tree; minimal cuts; decision tree	TEST-GENERATION; CIRCUITS; DIAGRAMS; MODULES	A new algorithm (CS-MC) for computing the minimal cuts of s-coherent fault trees is presented. Input events of the fault tree are assumed classified into classes, where events of the same class are indistinguishable. This allows capturing some symmetries which some systems exhibit. CS-MC uses a decision tree. The search implemented by the decision tree is guided by heuristics which try to make CS-MC as efficient as possible. In addition, an irrelevance test on the inputs of the fault tree is used to prune the search. The performance of CS-MC is illustrated and compared with the basic top-down and bottom-up algorithms using a set of fault trees, some of which are very difficult. The CS-MC performs very well even in the difficult examples, and the memory requirements of CS-MC are small.

The proposed PCS chooses periodically, on the basis of the current state of the system, the most appropriate scheduling rule, out of several predetermined ones. The proposed PCS is based on multi-layer NNs, one for each competing scheduling rule, that predict the FMC's performance. The NNs are retrained periodically. The performance of the proposed NN-based PCS was tested by simulation of two different FMC configurations. The NN-based PCS has performed significantly better than a decision-tree-based PCS and a single-rule-based PCS.

J	Piater, JH; Riseman, EM; Utgoff, PE				Piater, JH; Riseman, EM; Utgoff, PE			Interactively training pixel classifiers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						interactive image classifier construction; incremental decision trees; human effort; overfitting	TERRAIN CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES; PERFORMANCE; IMAGES	For typical classification tasks, all training data are prepared in advance and are supplied to the classifier all at once. This is unnecessarily expensive and incurs overfitting problems, since the individual contributions of the training instances to the classifier are not known. We address this by proposing an interactive incremental framework for image classifier construction, where small numbers of training examples are supplied at each user interaction. After incorporating new training instances, the classifier immediately reclassifies the image to provide the user with instant feedback. This allows the user to choose additional informative training pixels from among the currently misclassified ones. Using a realistic terrain classification task, we demonstrate the potential of our method to generate small and accurate decision tree classifiers from surprisingly few training examples while avoiding overspecialization. We also briefly discuss the novel concept of hierarchical classification, where higher-level classifiers take as input the output of lower-level classifiers. We present preliminary results indicating that within our interactive framework, this is a practical approach to exploiting spatial relationships for classification.

The use of MRI to screen patients with suspected IDK could avoid unnecessary arthroscopies with a reduction in costs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of arthroscopy among patients with IDK, and to estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of MRI in these patients to avoid unnecessary arthroscopies. The study was based on a retrospective cohort of all patients attending three orthopedic clinics between April and September 1993 with a new diagnosis of IDK. Charts were reviewed in 1994 to allow for a follow-up of more than 6 months. An economic evaluation was performed based on cost-effectiveness ratios (per averted arthroscopy), including direct and indirect costs. There were 241 patients with a new diagnosis of IDK (67% males, mean age 35 +/- 12 years), and 110 (46%) underwent arthroscopy. The remaining patients received conservative therapy and were not scheduled for arthroscopy within the period of observation. Using a priori established criteria, 10% of the arthroscopies could be considered diagnostic only (e.g., normal knee) and 27% were of doubtful efficacy from a therapeutic perspective (e.g., debridement alone). Many of these arthroscopies could have been avoided by performing a prior MRI. Using these findings, we conducted decision tree analyses of the use of MRI among patients requiring arthroscopy of the knee. A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the various model assumptions. In general, MRI appeared to be a cost-effective diagnostic procedure for patients with IDK requiring arthroscopy of the knee, and there were cost savings associated with it in some of the models tested.

A screening test should be acceptable, safe, Introduction simple, accurate, reliable, effective, and inexpensive. Screening for colorectal cancer with the faecal occult blood test is done to reduce the incidence and mortality from colorectal cancel: How does this test measure up to these requirements? Methods. The characteristics of faecal occult blood test are described by means of clinical epidemiology, analysing its compliance, sensitivity specificity, positive predictive value, and its test performance in Bernoulli trials. A decision tree and a Markov model are used to compare the cost-effectiveness of screening strategies involving faecal occult blood test and colonoscopy Results. After 5-10 years, patient compliance in a faecal occult blood test screening programme falls below 50%. Over 80% of the patients are likely to leave the programme before its completion. Although the rest itself may seem safe and simple, the high rate of false-positive, outcomes exposes many subjects To the potential complications of colonoscopy The high rate of false-negative tests gives patients with colorectal cancer a false sense of security and delays their proper diagnostic work-up. In populations with low prevalence rates of colorectal cancel; faecal occult blood test becomes very inaccurate in diagnosing colorectal cancer; as its positive predictive value falls below 5%. Its long-term test performance is unreliable in that it comes to depend on the frequency with which the test is repeated. Arty negative or positive test result can be achieved by varying the frequency of test repetition. Screening by colonoscopy every five or ten years is more cost-effective than screening by annual faecal occult blood rest in preventing, the occurence of colorectal cancer and its associated mortality Conclusions.

Feedback was received from 13 companies on 78 compounds, mostly recombinant proteins but also on a number of nonrecombinant proteins, which had been assessed for genotoxicity in a total of 177 tests. Four of the 78 compounds appeared to elicit reproducible genotoxic effects. For one of these compounds, the activity could be related to a nonpeptidic linker molecule. No scientifically convincing rationale for the other three compounds could be established, although, at least for two compounds, their activity may be connected with the enzymatic/hormonal activity. In addition to the survey, published reports on genotoxicity testing of biotechnology products were reviewed. The data are discussed relative to whether genotoxicity testing is a valuable exercise when assessing potentially toxic liabilities of biotechnology-derived compounds. It is concluded that genotoxicity testing is generally inappropriate and unnecessary, a position which is in accordance with the available guidelines addressing this area. For the 'average' protein, electrophilic reactions are difficult to envision. Indirect reactions via DNA metabolism and growth regulation seem possible for only very specific proteins such as nucleases, growth factors, cytokines. No information on testing of different types of biotechnology-derived products (e.g., ribozymes, antisense-oligonucleotides, DNA vaccines) has been received in the questionnaires. Discussion of their potential to cause genotoxic changes was based on literature reports. Even for those products for which concerns of genotoxic/tumourigenic potential cannot be completely ruled out, e.g., because of their interaction with DNA metabolism or proliferation control, the performance of standard genotoxicity assays generally appears to be of little value. All information, including also information on the occurrence of genotoxic impurities, has been utilized to formulate a decision tree approach for the genotoxicity testing of biotechnology-derived products.

PL decision analysis model was used in which the sequence of decisions and their possible consequences was described as a decision tree for each of the three strategies. The likelihood of each event occurring was determined based on a literature review. Each event was assigned a cost and a utility. Direct medical costs for the society include the cost of the material, the cost of implantation and removal of the device in the operating room, and the cost of treating complications directly ascribable to the strategy used. Utility is a combination of efficacy las evaluated based on the likelihood of use of the strategy for one year) and quality of life las evaluated by experts). In the basic analysis, RPC was the most cost-saving method but had an adverse effect on quality of life (0.82). The cost of using IC or TCC for one year was higher, with the main contributors to the excess cost being the insertion procedure and the management of complications (primarily deep vein thrombosis and infection). Quality of life was better with IC (0.98) than with TCC (0.93), IC also had a higher cost-utility ratio (11738 French francs [FF]) versus 17393 FF), A one-way sensitivity comparison of IC and TCC showed that the only realistic change capable of reversing the order between these two methods was a decrease by one-third in the risk of infection with TCCs. This model, used here for the first time, establishes that IC is superior over TCC.

However, despite the proliferation of implemented CPG and their wide diffusion thanks to Internet-based technologies, physicians compliance with formal standards is weak, Developed according to a document-based paradigm, OncoDoc proposes an original framework for implementing CPG. Domain knowledge has been encoded as a decision tree whose branches are both exclusive and exhaustive. This generic knowledge is operationalized at the point of care by the interactive building, through hypertextual navigation, of a patient-based clinical contest leading to specific therapeutic recommendations. OncoDoc has first been applied to the management of breast cancer patients and demonstrated within a full-scale experimentation in a clinical setting a compliance of 80 per cent.

Epidemiological data were obtained from a survey of 150 children with varicella, from hospitalizations and from the Spanish literature. A Markov decision tree was designed with two alternatives, vaccination or nonvaccination. Direct costs derived from the disease were lower than the cost of vaccination (ratio 0.54:1), however when indirect costs, such as working time loss were taken into account, vaccination was the best alternative, with a saving of P(T)2627 per vaccinated subject (P(t)1.6 recovered per peseta invested in the program). Sensitivity analysis shows that decreasing vaccine coverage and efficacy to 0.7, increasing the annual discount rare to 20% and with a vaccine price less than P(T)6000, vaccination is always the best alternative. In conclusion, from the economic point of view, a universal varicella vaccination program in children at 15 months of age would be justified in Spain. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Nisan, N; Rudich, S; Saks, M				Nisan, N; Rudich, S; Saks, M			Products and help bits in decision trees	SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						decision trees; help bits		We investigate two problems concerning the complexity of evaluating a function f on k distinct inputs by k parallel decision-tree algorithms. In the product problem, for some fixed depth bound d, we seek to maximize the fraction of input k-tuples for which all k decision trees are correct. Assume that for a single input to f, the best depth-d decision tree is correct on a fraction p of inputs. We prove that the maximum fraction of k-tuples on which k depth-d algorithms are all correct is at most p(k), which is the trivial lower bound. We show that if we replace the restriction to depth d by "expected depth d" then this result need not hold. In the help-bits problem, before the decision-tree computations begin, up to k ? 1 arbitrary binary questions (help-bit queries) can be asked about the k-tuple of inputs. In the second stage, for each possible (k?1)-tuple of answers to the help-bit queries, there is a k-tuple of decision trees where the ith tree is supposed to correctly compute the value of the function on the ith input, for any input that is consistent with the help bits. The complexity here is the maximum depth of any of the trees in the algorithm. We show that for all k sufficiently large, this complexity is equal to deg(s) (f), which is the minimum degree of a multivariate polynomial whose sign is equal to f.

J	Borak, JS; Strahler, AH				Borak, JS; Strahler, AH			Feature selection and land cover classification of a MODIS-like data set for a semiarid environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							HIGH-RESOLUTION RADIOMETER; REMOTE-SENSING DATA; NEURAL NETWORK; SATELLITE DATA; AVHRR DATA; EOS-MODIS; VEGETATION; TREES; CLASSIFIERS	The advent of the Earth Observing System (EBS), and the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in particular, will usher in a new era of global remote sensing by providing very large data volumes for interpretation and processing. Since many data streams will contain correlated data, feature selection is an important practical problem for such activities as classification of global land cover based on spectral, temporal, spatial and directional data. Tree-based classification methods offer a suite of promising approaches to extraction of meaningful features from large measurement spaces. This research develops a tree-based model that performs feature selection on a satellite database containing information on land covers in a semiarid region in Cochise County, Arizona. In addition, we test the abilities of several classifiers to correctly label land cover using this reduced set of inputs under various sampling schemes. Results from this analysis indicate that decision trees can reduce a high-dimension dataset to a manageable set of inputs that retain most of the information of the original database, while remaining largely insensitive to choice of sampling strategy, and that Fuzzy ARTMAP, a type of artificial neural network classifier, achieves highest accuracy in comparison to maximum-likelihood or decision-tree classifiers.

J	Emmons, EE; Jennings, MJ; Edwards, C				Emmons, EE; Jennings, MJ; Edwards, C			An alternative classification method far northern Wisconsin lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article							DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; FISH; TREES; USA	Wisconsin has nearly 15 000 lakes with great variation in limnology, morphometry, and origin. Classification of lakes into groups is a continuing goal. This study examines two alternative approaches to lake classification, one common and the other somewhat novel. Both approaches used lake morphometry and limnological variables and were compared for ability to form groups and assign lakes to groups with a high probability of correct classification. The first approach used nonhierarchical cluster analysis to form lake groups and discriminant analysis to put lakes into these groups. The second approach formed lake groups by iterative dichotomous splitting of the sampling space into smaller and smaller subspaces. Each binary split was done using nonhierarchical cluster analyses on a subset of the original variables. This iterative splitting resulted in a hierarchical classification tree with reduced dimensionality in comparison with the original data set. At each branch, multiple logistic regression was used to place lakes into nodes of the tree. Validation of both approaches was performed with a resubstitution analysis of the model building data set as well as a separate validation data set. The decision tree method yielded significantly lower rates of misclassification and was more easily interpreted than the discriminant analysis approach.

Design: Costs were estimated from the hospital perspective. Resource use data were collected from patient record files. Unit cost data were gathered from the hospital administration records. A decision tree model was built to estimate the mean cost far each treatment arm. Patients: Forty patients were randomised. At study entry, all had infected ulcers and were clinically investigated regarding their vascular condition. At inclusion no significant difference was observed between cases and controls. Results: Clinical results showed that the recovery of the filgrastim-treated patient was quicker, resulting in an earlier hospital discharge. The intent-to-treat cost analysis demonstrated that the mean cost savings were pound 2666 (36%) in favour of the filgrastim treatment arm. Sensitivity analysis was performed on patient type, probability distribution, unit cost and hospital duration. Subgroup analysis identified that the cost savings ranged from pound 3129 (39%) to pound 155 (4%) when patients with vascular problems and/or tissue necrosis were excluded from the analysis. Conclusion: The overall clinical benefit observed with the use of filgrastim could be translated into cost savings. These measured cost savings should, however, be interpreted cautiously as patient selection may have occurred that appeared during the in-hospital stay. More patients in the control group experienced a bad vascular condition inducing more costly interventions. The results need therefore to be confirmed in a large phase III randomised clinical trial.

An assessment of the RSV-related expenses for managing both groups of infants is needed to provide insight into the value of prophylaxis. The present study was conducted to identify and compare RSV-related health care expenditures incurred by infants who did not receive prophylaxis throughout one RSV season and after. Using a decision-analytic model populated with data from the contemporary medical literature, a pharmacoeconomic study was conducted from the perspective of the payer. Probabilities for RSV-related hospitalizations of infants who did and did not receive prophylaxis were abstracted from several published studies. Components of inpatient and outpatient care were identified through examination of hospital records, reviews of the published literature, and consultation with expert clinicians. Charges related to prophylaxis and medical management of infection were abstracted from hospital billing records and published data. Appropriate charges were applied to decision-tree branches and multiplied by in-line probabilities for outcomes. Products at terminal nodes were summed to establish total expected charges for both groups of infants. Widespread clinical use of prophylactic palivizumab would result in incremental expenses less than or equal to$3459 per infant or cost savings less than or equal to$39,107 per infant. The variability in value of prophylaxis derives from the rate of RSV-related hospitalizations in the community and the total health care expense of managing infected infants.

Consequent reductions in prostate volume, increases in urinary flow rates and improvements in symptoms compared with placebo have been observed in trials of up to 4 years' duration and in noncomparative extensions (for up to 6 years). Results from the 4-year placebo-controlled PLESS trial show finasteride to significantly reduce the risk of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH)-related acute urinary retention and the requirement fur surgical intervention, Finasteride has significantly greater efficacy in patients with a large prostate (greater than or equal to 40ml) than in patients with a small prostate. However, the predictive value of prostate size has been questioned, Results of an earlier comparative 1-year trial show terazosin monotherapy and terazosin plus finasteride therapy to be significantly more effective than both finasteride monotherapy and placebo in reducing symptom scores and improving maximum urinary flow rates. Prostatic volume was significantly reduced by finasteride monotherapy and combination therapy only. The overall efficacy of finasteride in patients with mild to moderate symptomatic BPH tended to be greater than that of serenoa repens (Permixon(R))(1) in a 6-month trial, A US cost analysis model indicates that finasteride and terazosin are less expensive than transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) during the first 1 years of initiation, Canadian cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses using decision analysis modelling have shown primary intervention with finasteride to provide more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at lesser cost than watchful waiting or TURP in patients with moderate symptoms who receive the drug for less than or equal to 3 years and less than or equal to 14 years, respectively, but fewer QALYs at a higher cost in patients with severe symptoms needing therapy for greater than or equal to 4 years. Confirmatory prospective economic studies are required. Finasteride appears to improve overall quality of life to a similar extent to serenoa repens; patient satisfaction appears similar with finasteride and TURF. Finasteride is generally well tolerated, Most commonly reported adverse effects are sexually related (1 to 2.1%). Gynaecomastia has been reported in 0.4% of patients. Conclusions: Despite modest improvements in maximum urinary flow rates and symptom scores, finasteride is a first-line treatment option in those with moderate uncomplicated BPH, especially in patients with a large prostate (greater than or equal to 40ml). It is also an option in patients with more severe symptoms who are unable or unwilling to undergo surgery and in those awaiting surgery. Importantly, finasteride appears to reduce disease progression, significantly decreasing the incidence of acute urinary retention and the requirement for surgical intervention; to date, no other pharmacological agent has been shown to reduce these outcomes. Finasteride is a 4-azasteroid which selectively and competitively inhibits the activity of Sa-reductase. This nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent enzyme is necessary for converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. The drug specifically inhibits the type 2 isoenzyme of 5 alpha-reductase, the predominant form in prostatic tissue. Dose-dependent inhibition of 5 alpha-reductase results in significant reductions in prostatic (by up to >90%) and circulating (by up to 60 to 80%) dihydrotestosterone levels. Prostatic testosterone levels are increased by finasteride (by approximately 85%) in patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH); however, these levels do not appear to affect prostatic growth or morphology. The drug has no significant affinity for the androgen receptor. Finasteride significantly reduces serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels by 41 to 71% in patients with symptomatic BPH. However, the mean free-to-total PSA ratio is unaffected by the drug (see also Dosage and Administration summary). Prostate size is reduced by finasteride by a combination of atrophy and apoptosis. Drug-induced histological changes have been observed after 6 months' treatment; glandular elements of prostatic tissue are the most sensitive to finasteride. Finasteride reduces detrusor pressure in patients with bladder outlet obstruction due to BPH. Finasteride is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with food slowing the rate but not the extent of absorption. The drug appears to accumulate after multiple doses. Time to steady state appears to be longer than 17 days; the exact time is unknown. The volume of distribution of finasteride is large (76L at steady state); the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier and small amounts are found in semen. The drug may be absorbed through the skin on contact with crushed tablets (see Dosage and Administration summary). Finasteride is extensively metabolised in the liver to essentially inactive metabolites. Elimination is mainly via the faeces and bile and, to a lesser extent, in the urine. The overall pharmacokinetic profile of the drug appears generally unaffected by increased age or renal impairment (see also Dosage and Administration summary). The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of finasteride are not known. In a 4-year placebo-controlled trial of patients with moderate to severe disease (PLESS study), finasteride 5 mg/day had significantly superior effects on maximum urinary flow rates (Q(max)). prostate volume and symptom scores to those of placebo. Between-treatment differences were usually observed within 4 months of treatment initiation, These findings confirm those of previous trials of up to 2 years' duration, in which finasteride 5 mg/day, compared with placebo, significantly reduced total symptom scores (by 13 to 23%), increased Q(max) (by 12.5 to 22%) and decreased prostate volume (by 15 to 47%) in patients with mild to moderate symptomatic BPH. More finasteride than placebo recipients were classified as responders. Finasteride 5 mg/day was significantly more effective in reducing symptoms and improving Q(max) in patients with a large prostate (greater than or equal to 40ml and >30ml, respectively) than in patients with a smeller prostate, in a pooled analysis of data from 6 placebo-controlled trials. Evidence suggests that finasteride may halt and begin to reverse the natural progression of BPH. In contrast to placebo recipients, finasteride-treated patients showed sustained or continued improvements over the study periods. The observed improvements with finasteride in placebo-controlled trials have been at least sustained in noncomparative extensions of several of these trials (for up to 6 years). Furthermore. data from large placebo-controlled trials have shown finasteride 5 mg/day, administered for up to 4 years, to significantly decrease the risk of acute urinary retention and BPH-related surgical intervention compared with placebo. Symptom scores and Q(max) were improved to a significantly greater extent with both terazosin monotherapy and terazosin plus finasteride therapy compared with either finasteride monotherapy or placebo in a trial of > 1200 patients with symptomatic BPH. No significant differences between the effects of terazosin monotherapy and combination therapy or between finasteride monotherapy and placebo were observed. Prostate volume was significantly reduced by finasteride and combination therapy: nonsignificant increases occurred with both terazosin monotherapy and placebo. This study was limited by failure to stratify patients according to mean baseline prostate volumes. However, superior effects of terazosin over finasteride and placebo were seen in a subsequent subanalysis of patients with prostate volumes greater than 50 ml (data presented in abstract form). In contrast to other findings, there was no evidence of a linear relationship between prostate volume and clinical response. The overall efficacy of finasteride in patients with mild to moderate symptomatic BPH tended to be greater than that of serenoa repens (Permixon(R)(1) in a 6-month trial. Longer term trials are needed to confirm these findings. During postmarketing surveillance, the most common adverse events with finasteride therapy in patients with symptomatic BPH were sexually related, namely impotence or ejaculatory failure (2.1%) and decreased libido (1 Crc). Gynaecomastia. was reported in 0.4% of patients. The incidence of adverse events related to sexual dysfunction was significantly greater with finasteride than with placebo (2.1 to 19 vs 0.6 to 10%) in 2-year placebo-controlled trials involving a total of more than 7600 patients with symptomatic BPH. Adverse events were usually mild and transient, The overall incidence of adverse events and the overall percentage of patients withdrawing because of adverse effects was similar in the finasteride and placebo groups. A 4-year placebo-controlled trial showed the incidence of decreased libido and impotence to be more frequent with finasteride than with placebo only in the first year of therapy. There is no evidence that the incidence of sexually related adverse effects with finasteride increases with increased duration of therapy, according to the results of noncomparative extensions (for up to 6 years) of placebo-controlled trials. Up to 62% of finasteride-related sexual adverse events resolved with continued treatment. A reduced ejaculate volume, observed in some finasteride recipients, did not interfere with normal sexual function. Other adverse events that have been probably or possibly associated tin case reports) with finasteride administration include exfoliative dermatitis, perioral numbness, lymphadenopathy, ataxia and wheeziness. Hypersensitivity reactions and lip swelling have also been observed. A significantly higher incidence of impotence and decreased libido has been observed with finasteride (9 and 5%, respectively) than with terazosin (6 and 3%) monotherapy. In contrast, the incidences of dizziness and asthenia were significantly lower with finasteride (8 and 7%, respectively) than with terazosin (26 and 14%) therapy. Ejaculatory abnormalities occurred in significantly mon finasteride plus terazosin recipients than in finasteride monotherapy, terazosin monotherapy or placebo recipients (7 vs 0.3 to 2%). The incidence of impotence and decreased libido with finasteride tended to be greater than that with serenoa repens. There is no evidence that finasteride masks the detection of prostate cancer through its effects on serum PSA levels (see also Pharmacodynamic Properties and Dosage and Administration summaries). No pharmacodynamic interactions have been reported between finasteride and terazosin (coadministration with terazosin increased finasteride maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve values in healthy volunteers), and no pharmacokinetic interactions have been observed between finasteride and doxazosin. In vitro, evidence suggests that agents which inhibit CYP3A activity are likely to inhibit the metabolism of finasteride. No clinically significant interactions between finasteride and warfarin, theophylline, digoxin or propranolol have been observed. Both finasteride and terazosin were less expensive than transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), from a US third-party payer perspective, according to a decision analytic modelling study in which direct treatment costs were assessed during the first 2 years. Overall treatment costs with finasteride tended to be higher than those with terazosin. Break-even points for medical versus surgical treatment were longer with terazosin than with finasteride. According to the results of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses (using retrospective data and decision analysis modelling), primary intervention with finasteride, from the perspective of Canadian provincial/territorial healthcare systems, provides more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at lesser cost than watchful waiting or TURF in patients with moderate symptoms who receive the drug for less than or equal to 3 years and less than or equal to 14 years, respectively. Conversely, it provides fewer QALYs at a higher cost than these options in patients with severe symptoms needing therapy for greater than or equal to 4 years. In a 36-month decision-tree model, initial treatment of patients with BPH with alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists was more cost effective than initial treatment with finasteride, from the perspective of the US military. Finasteride 5 mg/day appeared to produce treater improvements in disease-specific quality-of-life measures than placebo in pooled data from 2 placebo-controlled trials of more than 1600 patients with symptomatic BPH: however, sexual functioning was reduced in finasteride recipients. Similarly, health-related quality of life las assessed by the BPH Impact Index) was greater in finasteride than placebo recipients in a 1-year placebo-controlled trial of 2342 men with moderate to severe symptomatic BPH. Improvements in overall quality of life were similar in finasteride and serenoa repens recipients in the 1 available comparative trial, However, sexual function was significantly better in serenoa repens than finasteride recipients. Patient satisfaction has been reported to be similar with finasteride therapy and TURF. Finasteride is indicated for use in men with symptomatic BPH. The recommended dosage of finasteride is 5 mg/day orally administered with or without food. A minimum of 6 months' treatment may be required to determine a response. The optimal duration of therapy has not been determined. The presence of prostate cancer must be excluded before administering finasteride and all patients who receive finasteride should undergo periodic monitoring for the presence of prostate cancer. The presence of other conditions which may mimic BPH should also be excluded. Because of finasteride-induced reductions in serum PSA levels and the potential to mask the detection of prostate cancer, serum PSA values obtained after 6 months' therapy should be doubled before interpreting results. Patients with renal impairment and the elderly do nest appear to require reduced dosages of finasteride, Caution is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment; specific dosage recommendations are not available at present. Finasteride use should be avoided in women and children, pregnant women or those who may become pregnant should avoid contact with crushed finasteride tablets.

Surveys were conducted in 2 Douglas-fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France, and 2 lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta variety latifolia Engelmann, seed orchards over a 3-yr period. Tree height, cone density, and flowering phenology data were obtained for each tree surveyed. Chi-square analyses disclosed significant discrepancies between the frequency distributions of trees selected by L. occidentalis and the frequency distributions of trees by height class. cone density class, and particularly height and cone density classes combined. Seed bugs avoided short trees with low cone density, but also avoided the tallest trees with the greatest cone density. Because trees with moderate numbers of cones tend to have large cones with many seeds per cone, it would be highly adaptive for seed bugs to select such trees. Visual reflectance measurements demonstrated that conelets consistently reflected more Light and at different wavelengths than foliage. Conelets from preferred clones reflected more light over a broader range of wavelengths than those from nonpreferred clones. A hypothetical decision tree model was developed incorporating 4 key steps that may be used by L. occidentalis to select host trees.

Fast blob extraction from fruit images was performed by using an adaptive spherical transformation A binary decision-tree-structured rule base was established using blob feature extraction and analysis. Both off-line and on-line test results demonstrated that the rule-based system was effective for apple defect detection. Compared with the neural network method, the rules-based approach had more flexibility for changing or adding parameters, features and rules to meet various sorting requirements. The technique presented in this paper is being commercialized by a leading manufacturer of fruit/vegetable packinghouse equipment. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The use of computer algorithms to create new decision trees can improve efficiency and increase systematization in the field of microbiology. Preliminary results indicate that decision tree algorithms can create new structures that require fewer tests on average to reach a positive identification of an unknown organism. Including test time and cost factors can make further improvements, resulting in systems that are more time-efficient and/or cost-effective. Machine learning techniques can also create customized ID systems for specific applications. This paper will explain the induction of decision trees and show examples of their use in microbial ID.

Comparison between a statistical and an intuitive approach	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY			English	Article						immunohistochemistry; ovarian carcinoma; colorectal carcinoma; breast carcinoma; differential diagnosis; discriminant analysis; decision tree	DISEASE FLUID PROTEIN-15; CARCINOEMBRYONIC ANTIGEN; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; CARCINOMA; ESTROGEN; TUMORS; EXPRESSION; CYTOKERATIN-7; DIAGNOSIS; NEOPLASMS	Aim-To discriminate between adenocarcinomas that are primary to the ovary and metastatic to the ovary, especially of colonic and breast origin, by immunohistochemistry, using stepwise discriminant analysis or a decision tree. Methods-312 routinely processed, formalin fixed tissue specimens were used. The tumours were divided into a learning set (n = 159), composed of primary tumours of ovary, breast, and colon, and a test set, comprising 134 metastases from these sites and an additional 19 primary ovarian carcinomas. The immunohistochemical panel was composed of antibodies against cytokeratin 7 (CK7) and 28 (CK20), CA125, vimentin, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), gross cystic disease fluid protein- 15 (GCDFP-15), and the oestrogen receptor (ER). The staining results of the tumours were expressed as the product of the staining intensity and the percentage of positive tumour cells. Analyses were first performed on the learning set and then evaluated on the test set. Results-Although the immunostaining patterns showed a considerable overlap between the three types of adenocarcinoma, the breast carcinomas were typically positive for GCDFP-15 and often for ER, and negative for vimentin. Ovarian carcinomas were always positive for CK7 and to a lesser extent for CR125. Colonic carcinomas showed prominent positivity for CEA and CK20, while no staining was seen for ER and vimentin. In discriminant analysis, six antibodies (alpha CK7, alpha CK20, alpha CA125, alpha CEA, alpha ER, and alpha GCDFP-15) appeared to be necessary for optimal classification: 89% of the learning set and 82% of the test set were classified correctly. In the decision tree, only four antibodies (aCK7, alpha CEA, alpha ER, and alpha GCDFP15) were used to obtain ri correct classification score of 89% for the learning set and 84% for the test set. Conclusions-Using a semiquantitative assessment of the immunostaining results by a restricted panel of six antibodies with stepwise discriminant analysis, 80-90% of the adenocarcinomas of colon, breast, and ovary can be correctly classified. Discriminant analysis is computer aided and therefore an easy method and for each case a probability value of the classification result is obtained. The intuitive decision tree method provides a slightly better result, requires only four antibodies, and offers a more practical method for the surgical pathologist.

J	Downs, SH				Downs, SH			Technical report: Urinary tract infections in febrile infants and young children	PEDIATRICS			English	Review						urinary tract infection, infant, child; decision analysis; cost-effectiveness analysis; vesicoureteral reflux	TC-99M DIMERCAPTOSUCCINIC ACID; PRIMARY VESICOURETERAL REFLUX; SINGLE DOSE TRIMETHOPRIM; CIRCUMCIZED MALE INFANTS; LONG-TERM PROPHYLAXIS; EXCRETORY UROGRAPHY; VOIDING CYSTOURETHROGRAPHY; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; SIGNIFICANT BACTERIURIA; SUPRAPUBIC ASPIRATION	Overview. The Urinary Tract Subcommittee of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Quality Improvement has analyzed alternative strategies for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children. The target population is limited to children between 2 months and 2 years of age who are examined because of fever without an obvious cause. Diagnosis and management of UTI in this group are especially challenging for these three reasons: 1) the manifestation of UTI tends to be nonspecific, and cases may be missed easily; 2) clean voided midstream urine specimens rarefy can be obtained, leaving only urine collection methods that are invasive (transurethral catheterization or bladder tap) or result in nonspecific test results (bag urine); and 3) a substantial number of infants with UTI also may have structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract that put them at risk for ongoing renal damage, hypertension, and endstage renal disease (ESRD). Methods. To examine alternative management strategies for UTI in infants, a conceptual model of the steps in diagnosis and management of UTI was developed. The model was expanded into a decision tree. Probabilities for branch points in the decision tree were obtained by review of the literature on childhood UTI. Data were extracted on standardized forms. Cost data were obtained by literature review and from hospital billing data. The data were collated into evidence tables. Analysis of the decision tree was used to produce risk tables and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for alternative strategies. Results. Based on the results of this analysis and, when necessary, consensus opinion, the Committee developed recommendations for the management of UTI in this population. This document provides the evidence the Subcommittee used in the development of its recommendations. Conclusions. The Subcommittee agreed that the objective of the practice parameter would be to minimize the risk of chronic renal damage within reasonable economic constraints. Steps involved in achieving these objectives are: 1) identifying UTI; 2) short-term treatment of UTI; and 3) evaluation for urinary tract abnormalities.

To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) between a standard antiemetic regimen -chlorpromazine + dexamethasone (CPM-DEX)- and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist -tropisetron (TROP)- in the control of acute emesis induced by highly emetogenic chemotherapy in children, considering two analytic perspectives: hospital and patients. Methods. The CEA was performed by constructing a decision tree, for both analytic perspectives, of the possible outcomes of treatment with TROP (single 0.2 mg/kg i.v.) or CPM (5-15 mg i.v. infusion for 3 doses) plus DEX (2 mg/m(2) i.v. bolus i.v. x 2). The patients were stratified by age in two groups (2-12 and 13-17). To estimate the probability of each endpoint at the decision tree we have taken as a base a trial developed in the Department of Pediatrics. Direct medical cost of primary therapy, failure, complications and side effects were included in the cost calculations. Results. From patients' analytic perspective, TROP was more cost-effective than CPM-DEX for both groups of patients. Discrepancy between both analytic perspectives in 13-17 year-old patient's group was resolved in favour of the option chosen from the patients' analytic perspective (TROP). Sensitivity analysis showed the reliability of the results. Conclusions. 1. TROP was more cost-effective than CPM-DEX. 2. Taking into account the patients' analytic perspective is essential when we compare antiemetics pharmacoeconomically. 3. It seems necessary to increase the effectiveness of TROP in pediatric patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy with strategies such as the addition of a steroid.

A program accepts a large training set of program material in a conventional compiler intermediate representation (IR) and automatically infers a decision tree that separates IR code into streams that compress much better than the undifferentiated whole.

Discriminant analysis identified that the most important species in discriminating among station-groups in terms of numbers were: Pagellus erythrinus, Mullus barbatus, Mullus surmuletus, Diplodus annular-is, Spicara flexuosa, Sardina pilchardus and Parapenaeus longirostris. In terms of weight, the most important discriminating species were: Mullus barbatus, Pagellus erythrinus, Spicara maena, Scyliorhinus canicula, Loligo vulgaris and Parapenaeus longirostris. Supervised machine learning approaches and, in particular, the decision tree construction method were utilized in order to induce rules which determine the station-grouping. Several species, notably, Argentina sphyraena, Aristaeomorpha foliacea, Lepidorhombus bosci, Lepidotrigla cavillone, Mullus barbatus, Serranus cabrilla and Sepia officinalis appeared in most of the rules.

Dementia staging in clinical settings is at present complex and highly subjective because of the ambiguities and the complicated nature of existing guidelines. Our model abstracts the two-stage process used by physicians to arrive at the global Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDRS) score. The model incorporates learning intermediate concepts (CDRS category scores) in the first stage that then become the feature space for the second stage (global CDRS score). The sample consisted of 678 patients evaluated in the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the University of California, Irvine. The demographic variables, functional and cognitive test results used by physicians for the task of dementia severity staging were used as input to the machine learning algorithms. Decision tree learners and rule inducers (C4.5, Cart, C4.5 rules) were selected for our study as they give expressive models, and Naive Bayes was used as a baseline algorithm for comparison purposes. We first learned the six CDRS category scores (memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, personal care, home and hobbies, and community affairs). These learned CDRS category scores were then used to learn the global CDRS scores. The Two-Stage ML model classified as well as or better than the published inter-rater agreements for both the category and global CDRS scoring by dementia experts. Furthermore, for the most critical distinction, normal versus very mildly impaired, the Two-Stage ML model was 28.1 and 6.6% more accurate than published performances by domain experts. Our study of the CDRS examined one of the largest, most diverse samples in the literature, suggesting that our findings are robust. The Two-Stage ML model also identified a CDRS category, Judgment and Problem Solving, which has low classification accuracy similar to published reports. Since this CDRS category appears to be mainly responsible for misclassification of the global CDRS score when it occurs, further attribute and algorithm research on the Judgment and Problem Solving CDRS score could improve its accuracy as well as that of the global CDRS score.

For this purpose, the parameters pulse wave velocity and biological impedance were used. With the aid of these parameters it is; possible, in the extracorporeal model, to detect different kinds of stenosis, volume losses; vessel dilatation and vessel constriction. In addition, the influence of arteriosclerosis on circulation dynamics was investigated. The assignment of the parameters to various events is effected using a,,decision tree" and a neural network. Finally, the technique is verified using data obtained from animal experiments.

The main measure of outcome was the cost per case averted. Assuming a 0.80 probability of diagnosing and treating early Lyme disease, a 0.005 probability of contracting Lyme disease, and a vaccination cost of $50 per year, the mean cost of vaccination per case averted was $4,466. When we increased the probability of contracting Lyme disease to 0.03 and the cost of vaccination to $100 per year, the mean net savings per case averted was $3,377. Since few communities have average annual incidences of Lyme disease >0.005, economic benefits will be greatest when vaccination is used on the basis of individual risk, specifically, in persons whose probability of contracting Lyme disease is greater than or equal to 0.01.

J	Padmanabhan, M; Bahl, LR; Nahamoo, D				Padmanabhan, M; Bahl, LR; Nahamoo, D			Partitioning the feature space of a classifier with linear hyperplanes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING			English	Article						classifiers; decision trees; fast Gaussian computation; linear discriminant-analysis (LDA); speech recognition		We describe the design and use of linear hyperplanes to partition the feature space of a classifier. The objective of the partitioning is to minimize the average entropy of the class distribution in the final partitions, The hyperplanes are characterized by a vector <(nu)under bar>(n) and scalar h(n), which are computed with the objective of maximizing the mutual information associated with the partitioning, We show that the problem of designing the <(nu)under bar>(n) can be simplified to an approximately equivalent problem, the solution of which, interestingly enough, turns out to be the linear discriminant of the data. We also describe a decision-tree based technique that partitions the feature space in a hierarchical fashion where each node in the decision tree represents a linear hyperplane that further partitions the feature space into two regions. The end result of the tree-growing process is that the entire feature space is partitioned into nonoverlapping regions where each region is bounded by a number of hyperplanes. As the criterion for the design of the hyperplanes is the minimization of the average class entropy of the regions, each region is characterized by the occurence of only a small number of classes. The partitioning information provided by the decision-tree can then be used to eliminate a number of classes from being considered, and hence simplifies the job of the classifier, We show the application of the decision-tree as a preprocessor to a classifier in the speech recognition problem, Here the classes are modeled with mixtures of tens to hundreds of thousands of Gaussians, and the use of the partitioning information reduces the computation associated with the classification process by factors larger than 20 with negligible degradation in the word error rate (note, however, that the overall decoding process comprises other steps in addition to the classification-the computational speedup mentioned above does not affect the computation of these other steps). We also compare the performance of this quantization scheme with standard Gaussian clustering schemes and show that the decision-tree based quantization provides better performance in most cases.

Study Design: A decision-tree was used in a prospective study of 89 patients from April 1994 to May 1997, It included a fiberscopy and Muller's maneuver, rhinomanometry, pH monitoring, computed tomography scan to measure the pharyngeal lumen, pulse oximetry and polysomnography in case of sleep apnea syndrome was suspected. Methods: The authors performed their LAUP technique on 43 patients (48.5%) whose snoring was mainly caused by the velum, This technique consists of scarifying the velum by vaporizing the mucosa and the submucosa along a rectangle extending from the palatal dimple to the uvula and having a width of 1.5 to 2 cm, Vaporization of the palatal arches follows without exceeding the junction of the anterior and posterior pillars in height. The uvula is cut if necessary, preserving a length of at least 0.5 cm. The other patients under-went different procedures according to the cause of snoring Results: There was no significant difference between LAUP and uvulopalatoplasty (UPPP) regarding pain. No permanent phonatory disorders and no regurgitation occurred. Satisfaction evaluated on a scale ranging from 0 to 10 was equivalent for the two techniques: mean value = 7.68 (+/-2.18) for LAUP and 8.60 (+/-2.27) for UPPP. The mean followup was 17 months (range, 1-37 mo), Satisfaction was also identical for all techniques. Conclusion: Our LAUP technique combined with other procedures according to a decision-tree is efficient and safe.

J	Shih, YCT; Kauf, TL				Shih, YCT; Kauf, TL			Reconciling decision models with the real world - An application to anaemia of renal failure	PHARMACOECONOMICS			English	Article							HEMODIALYSIS-PATIENTS; ERYTHROPOIETIN; DISEASE; THERAPY; ANEMIA; HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA; SIMVASTATIN; PRAVASTATIN; MEN	Objective: The choice of evidence used in decision modelling of healthcare interventions divides analysts into 2 groups: (i) those who favour randomised clinical trial (RCT) data; and (ii) those who prefer 'real world' data. This preference may have serious consequences if the end result is to inform healthcare policy. This paper uses Medicare coverage of epoetin-alpha [erythropoietin (EPO)] as a case study to illustrate a technique which can be used to overcome some of the bias inherent in RCT data while avoiding some of the common pitfalls associated with the use of observational data. Design and setting: Cost analysis of 2 treatments for anaemia of renal failure primarily in an outpatient setting is modelled in a decision tree. This method can be used to analyse healthcare interventions or policies in any setting. Patients and participants: Patients with nontransplanted end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who received either EPO or blood transfusion for treatment of anaemia at any time during the 1-year study period (July 1989 to June 1990) were included in the sample. Methods: Outcome effects in the natural setting are decomposed into 2 parts: a treatment effect and a population effect. This is then extended to the special case of policy analysis. Logistic and multiple regression are used to estimate branch probabilities and payoffs, respectively, for 2 treatment options. Main outcome measures and results: Under standard methods of decision analysis, an increase of $US7032 per patient following EPO coverage is observed. With the decomposition technique, the policy effect is estimated to be less, $US6172, the difference coming from the population effect. Conclusions: Failure to remove population effects from observed outcome effects may lead to biased decision-making. Although not directly observable, the population effect can be imputed from secondary data. The decomposition and imputing technique allows for a more meaningful interpretation of the results for the purpose of policy analysis.

In this representation, the perception space is decomposed into a hierarchical set of worlds reflecting environments which are homogeneous in nature and which vary in complexity in an ordered manner. Each world is used to produce a corresponding decision tree which is trained incrementally. The instantaneous perception of the robot is used to select an appropriate rule from the decision tree and a sequence of rule activations form the complete trajectory. The ability to keep the knowledge complexity manageable and under control is an important aspect of the technique.

J	Brasel, KJ; Borgstrom, DC; Weigelt, JA				Brasel, KJ; Borgstrom, DC; Weigelt, JA			Management of penetrating colon trauma: A cost-utility analysis	SURGERY			English	Article							COLOSTOMY CLOSURE; DECISION-ANALYSIS; PRIMARY REPAIR; INJURED COLON; MORBIDITY; WOUNDS; TRIAL; GUIDE; SAFE	Background. Management of penetrating colon injuries in the presence of multiple associated risk factors is controversial. Issues not considered in previous management strategies are patient perception of quality of life with a colostomy and the true cost of each therapeutic option, which includes colostomy supplies and costs of colostomy takedown. To evaluate these issues, we performed a cost-utility analysis. Methods. We constructed a decision tree with 3 options: primary repair resection and anastomosis, and colostomy. Chance and decision nodes on each decision branch represent injury severity, complications, colostomy takedown, and death. Chance node frequencies and utility assignments were taken from published data. We obtained actual costs for all components of perioperative care. The outcomes reported are cost and quality of life. Results. Colostomy has the least quality of life and the greatest cost. Primary repair and resection each dominate colostomy in the baseline analysis. No variable significantly altered these conclusions in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions. Simple suture or resection and anastomosis at the time of initial exploration is the dominant management method for penetrating colon trauma. It also demonstrates the trade-off between cost and life expectancy of the 3 management options.

We present a diagnostic decision tree for the correct use of neuropsychological evaluation techniques in head injury. Our aim is to avoid extensive, intensive use of unnecessary tests and measurements or lapses into diagnostic error which often accompany cognitive dysfunction when 'superficial' 'undirected' studies are done. Development. It is essential to select the neuropsychological, neuroconductal and psychosocial evaluation tests which are most suitable bl each case and establish a reliable diagnosis of the functional, cognitive, emotional and psychosocial conditions of the patient. The decision tree for neuropsychological evaluation is a guide to assist professionals so that they may adequately examine the functional changes which can occur as a consequence of traumatic brain damage, adapted to each point ill its evolution and taking into account factors which may influence neuropsychological evaluation. Conclusion. The evaluation of consequences of trauma includes evaluation of the gravity of the head injury, and the neuropsychological, neuroconductal and functional evaluation of the patient [REV NEUROL 1999; 28: 999-1006].

This method was based on the use of dialysis as sample purification step, followed by enrichment of the dialysate on a precolumn and liquid chromatographic analysis. All sample handling operations were carried out automatically by means of an ASTED system. Atenolol and its internal standard (sotalol) were separated on a C-8 column with a mixture of pH 7.0 phosphate buffer containing 1-octanesulphonate and methanol (81/19; v:v) as mobile phase and monitored photometrically at 225 nm. The validation strategy comprises two steps. The experiments performed during the first step, the so called pre-validation step, have permitted the selection of the most appropriate model for the calibration curve by means of a decision tree, i.e. a least squares regression model obtained after transformation of data (square root in this case), the estimation of the limit of quantitation at 25 ng/ml by means of an accuracy profile, the determination of the calibration range (from 25 to 1000 ng/ml), the estimation of the limit of detection at 9 ng/ml and the calculation of the mean extraction efficiency (about 65%). The second step is the validation itself, comprising the evaluation of method selectivity towards endogenous components, the confirmation of the limit of quantitation, the verification of linearity and the assessment of method precision (repeatability and intermediate precision) as well as accuracy using quality control samples at different concentration levels over the range investigated. The relative standard deviation values for repeatability and intermediate precision were between 2.7% and 9.0%. Moreover, the method was found to be accurate. Indeed, the 95% one-sided confidence limits of the mean recovery did not exceed the acceptance limits of 80% and 120%. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Allen, MW; Hendi, P; Bassett, L; Phelps, ME; Gambhir, SS				Allen, MW; Hendi, P; Bassett, L; Phelps, ME; Gambhir, SS			A study on the cost effectiveness of sestamibi scintimammography for screening women with dense breasts for breast cancer	BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT			English	Review						breast cancer; cost effectiveness; dense breasts; mammographic parenchymal patterns; Sestamibi scintimammography	FINE-NEEDLE ASPIRATION; MEDICAL DECISION-MAKING; PARENCHYMAL PATTERNS; PRONE SCINTIMAMMOGRAPHY; LIFE-EXPECTANCY; CORE BIOPSY; CONVENIENT APPROXIMATION; CYTOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS; LIKELIHOOD RATIOS; PRIMARY-CARE	The potential impact of Sestamibi scintimammography (SSMM) on the cost effective management of women with dense breasts is not known. This study addresses this issue quantitatively by examining the impact of SSMM based screening strategies on the similar to 3,000,000 women over 40 with very dense breasts (DY patterns) without palpable masses and who have had one or more prior mammograms, who undergo routine screening each year. Quantitative decision tree sensitivity analysis was used to compare the conventional mammography (MM) strategy (strategy A), which does not subject patients with negative mammograms to any further examination until their next screening, with two decision strategies for screening with SSMM SSMM after a negative mammogram (strategy B) or SSMM as the only screening test for women already identified as having dense breasts by a previous mammogram (strategy C). Cost effectiveness was measured by calculating the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of strategies B and C, which is the cost of achieving an additional year of life in the screening population by choosing a SSMM based decision strategy rather than the conventional strategy. Strategies B and C reduced the number of false negative diagnoses by 62% and 8%, respectively. The ICER was $632,000 and $3.18M per life year for strategy B and C, respectively. To be cost effective, the pre-test probability of cancer in the study population must be greater than 3% for strategy B or the cost of SSMM must be less than $50 for strategy C. These results show the ICER of an SSMM based breast cancer screening strategy in the management of patients with dense breasts is not currently within the range (similar to$50,000 per year life saved) of other commonly performed medical interventions that are considered cost effective.

J	Coppersmith, D; Hong, SJ; Hosking, JRM				Coppersmith, D; Hong, SJ; Hosking, JRM			Partitioning nominal attributes in decision trees	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						binary decision tree; classification; data mining; entropy; Gini index; impurity; optimal splitting		To find the optimal branching of a nominal attribute at a node in an L-ary decision tree, one is often forced to search over all possible L-ary partitions for the one that yields the minimum impurity measure. For binary trees (L = 2) when there are just two classes a short-cut search is possible that is linear in n, the number of distinct values of the attribute. For the general case in which the number of classes, k, may be greater than two, Burshtein et al. have shown that the optimal partition satisfies a condition that involves the existence of (L\atop 2) hyperplanes in the class probability space. We derive a property of the optimal partition for concave impurity measures (including in particular the Gini and entropy impurity measures) in terms of the existence of L vectors in the dual of the class probability space, which implies the earlier condition. Unfortunately, these insights still do not offer a practical search method when n and k are large, even for binary trees. We therefore present a new heuristic search algorithm to find a good partition. It is based on ordering the attribute's values according to their principal component scores in the class probability space, and is linear in n. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method through Monte Carlo simulation experiments and compare its performance against other heuristic methods.

J	Chen, Z				Chen, Z			Knowledge acquisition assisted by CLIPS programming	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							EXPERT	Knowledge acquisition is important and machine learning techniques can be used to achieve automated knowledge acquisition. This article examines how knowledge acquisition can be assisted by programming using CLIPS (an acronym for C Language Integrated Production System). A machine learning preprocessor has been developed for the CLIPS environment, so that the CLIPS rule-base can be expanded by adding rules generated through machine learning techniques. The paper also shows how knowledge updating can be supported in the CLIPS environment itself. Operational engineering knowledge is captured in a data structure called a decision tree, and its structure can be updated when new knowledge is acquired. In addition, some advanced features are also briefly discussed, including using COOL (the CLIPS object-oriented language) for knowledge acquisition in a software product recommendation system, as well as the design of a self-evolving knowledge-acquisition tool.

J	Dietlein, M; Knapp, WH; Lauterbach, KW; Schicha, H				Dietlein, M; Knapp, WH; Lauterbach, KW; Schicha, H			Economic evaluation studies in nuclear medicine: the need for standardization	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Review						cost-effectiveness; cost-utility; nuclear medicine; imaging; radiopharmaceuticals	COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS; EMISSION COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; CELL LUNG-CANCER; NONPALPABLE BREAST ABNORMALITIES; SUSPECTED PULMONARY-EMBOLISM; LYMPH-NODE METASTASES; MANAGED HEALTH-CARE; FDG-PET; DECISION-ANALYSIS; INTRAVENOUS ADENOSINE	The guidelines for publishing economic evaluations require a statement of the economic importance of the analysis and the viewpoint from which it has been carried out, as well as specification of at least two alternative programmes or interventions, the form of economic evaluation, the outcome measure, the method of costing, the time horizon and adjustment for timing of costs and benefits (e.g. by a discount factor), and the allowance for uncertainties (e.g. by implementation of a sensitivity analysis). The decision analysis can be based on clinical trial data, on retrospective or administrative databases, or on modelling. The choice of outcome measures is the key issue in an economic evaluation. In cost-effectiveness analysis, benefits are usually measured in natural units. This is the form of economic evaluation most frequently used in nuclear medicine. Endpoints of effectiveness applied in studies in this field have been procedures avoided, procedures initiated, cardiac events, survival probability, morbidity, quality of life and protracted or failed surgical procedures. In other instances, surrogate endpoints have been used such as metastases detected, staging, viability or tumour response. This, however, limits comparability of cost-effectiveness considerably, as proof of a change in the health outcome cannot be obtained. Measures of utility such as QALYs (quality-adjustled life years) have so far only been applied for decision tree analysis. Useful examples of economic evaluation studies in nuclear medicine are presented here for fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in the preoperative staging of non-small cell lung cancer, for FDG-PET in differentiating indeterminate solitary pulmonary nodules, for somatostatin receptor scintigraphy in detecting metastases of carcinoid tumours, for routine preoperative scintigraphy with sestamibi in patients with parathyroid adenoma, for periodic measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone in detecting mild thyroid failure, for diagnostic algorithms including a lung scan in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, for myocardial perfusion imaging as an incremental prognostic factor in patients with coronary artery disease, and for the use of radioiodine as first-line therapy of Graves' hyper-thyroidism and of toxic nodular goitres. Further evaluations of effectiveness or utility should be carried out within a multidisciplinary framework to ensure that nuclear medical procedures are included in the general management guidelines.

The clinical data used were taken from published meta-analyses. This analysis supports: (1) a comparable efficacy of milnacipran and TCA with a better tolerance; and, (2) an advantage of milnacipran over SSRI for efficacy with a comparable tolerance. Based on these findings, a decision tree was constructed with the assistance of a panel of psychiatrists in order to provide a model of usual clinical practice. Estimates not available from clinical studies were obtained either from literature analysis or from the panel. Economic appraisal was performed according to the viewpoint of the French national sickness fund (securite sociale), and expenditure assessment was limited to direct costs (hospitalizations, antidepressant medications, visits, and laboratory tests). The results suggest that milnacipran is a cost-effective alternative: the expected cost of treatment per depressive episode is lower than either a French representative panel of TCAs (a saving of 288 FF), or SSRIs (a savings of 961 FF). The expected length of clinical remission is slightly higher than comparators. The robustness of these findings was supported by sensitivity analyses. (C) 1999 Elsevier, Paris.

J	Setiono, R; Liu, H				Setiono, R; Liu, H			A connectionist approach to generating oblique decision trees	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						decision trees; network pruning; neural networks; oblique decision rules	ALGORITHM	Neural networks and decision tree methods are two common approaches to pattern classification. While neural networks can achieve high predictive accuracy rates, the decision boundaries they form are highly nonlinear and generally difficult to comprehend. Decision trees, on the other hand, can be readily translated into a set of rules. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for generating oblique decision trees that capitalizes on the strength of both approaches. Oblique decision trees classify the patterns by testing on linear combinations of the input attributes. As a result, an oblique decision tree is usually much smaller than the univariate tree generated for the same domain. Our algorithm consists of two components: connectionist and symbolic. A three-layer feedforward neural network is constructed and pruned, a decision tree is then built from the hidden unit activation values of the pruned network. An oblique decision tree is obtained by expressing the activation values using the original input attributes. We test our algorithm on a wide range of problems. The oblique decision trees generated by the algorithm preserve the high accuracy of the neural networks, while keeping the explicitness of decision trees. Moreover, they outperform univariate decision trees generated by the symbolic approach and oblique decision trees built by other approaches in accuracy and tree size.

J	Robinson, JG				Robinson, JG			Standardizing risk analysis for the evaluation of oil and gas properties	JOURNAL OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	47th Annual Technical Meeting	JUN 10-12, 1996	CALGARY, CANADA					It is becoming more and more difficult to add new reserves to replace annual production from depleting oil and gas resources. Mos tof the "easy" oil and gas fields have been discovered, and now we must look for the more elusive accumulations and become more creative in devising improved or new production practices. Although advances in 3D seismic, horizontal drilling, completion techniques and computer application shave improved our ability to find and produce new reserves, risks have, unfortunately, increased. In addition to the technical risks, economic risks are becoming more burdensome. Various groups have attempted to develop standards to deal with this increasing uncertainty, but are encountering a great reluctance to change. The Petroleum Society Standing Committee on Reserves Definitions has been actively trying to promote a revised reserve classification system to serve as a standard for all reserves evaluations. The Society of Petroleum Engineers, the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, The World Petroleum Congress and the Canadian Securities Commissions are all looking at upgrading their respective Reserve Definitions. Every factor used in the evaluation of oil and gas assets has varying degrees of uncertainty associated wit it; thus, evaluators must have some knowledge of statistical methods in dealing wit the problem. There are many statistical techniques available to deal wit the problem of uncertainty, such as Monte Carlo Simulation, Expected Value and Decision Tree Analyses. These can be sophisticated or simple, depending upon the data, the resources, and the need to derive statistical measurements. The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the need to incorporate and standardize the application of risk, and to propose a revised Expected Value Method for the economic evaluations of reserves and dispel the myths that statistical procedures are difficult, time consuming, and expensive.

Design: A decision-tree model was constructed to compare the cost-effectiveness of four preoperative screening strategies from the perspective of the health care system. Setting: Based on patient mortality, morbidity, and cost data from a literature review. Participants: Hypothetical cohort of patients scheduled for elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair followed up over a 5-year period. Interventions: Patients either proceeded directly to surgery or were screened using one of three possible preoperative screening strategies. In the first strategy, all patients were screened with a dipyridamole-thallium test. In the second strategy, all patients underwent coronary angiography. The third strategy, selective screening, first divided patients into high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups using clinical criteria. High-risk patients underwent preoperative angiography. Intermediate-risk patients were screened noninvasively, and tow-risk patients proceeded directly to surgery without further testing. Measurement and Main Results: Proceeding directly to vascular surgery resulted in the poorest 5-year survival rate (77.4%) compared with preoperative risk stratification followed by selective coronary revascularization, routine noninvasive testing (86.1%), selective testing (86.0%), and routine angiography (87.9%; p=0.00). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for selective testing was significantly lower than for routine angiography ($44,800/years of life saved (YLS) v $93,300/YLS; p < 0.02). Routine noninvasive testing was not cost-effective. Thirty-day mortality was the same for all four strategies (p = 0.84). Conclusion: Selective screening before Vascular surgery may improve 5-year survival and be cost-effective. Neither routine noninvasive testing nor routine angiography appears to be cost-effective compared with currently accepted medical therapies. Copyright (C) 1999 by W.B. Saunders Company.

The methods were evaluated in the diagnosis of female urinary incontinence in terms of prediction accuracy of classifiers, on the basis of patient data. The best methods were discriminant analysis, logistic regression, C4.5 a nd Galactica. Practically no statistically significant differences existed between the prediction accuracy of these classification methods. We consider that machine-learning systems C4.5 and Galactica are preferable for automatic construction of medical decision aids, because they can cope with missing data values directly and can present a classifier in a comprehensible form. Galactica performed nearly as well as C4.5, The results are in agreement with the results of earlier research, indicating that genetic algorithms are a competitive method for constructing classifiers from medical data.

J	Lu, ZK; Chi, ZR; Siu, WC; Shi, PF				Lu, ZK; Chi, ZR; Siu, WC; Shi, PF			A background-thinning-based approach for separating and recognizing connected handwritten digit strings	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						character recognition; character segmentation; connected digit strings; thinning; fuzzy rules	CHARACTER SEGMENTATION; RECOGNITION	Most algorithms for segmenting connected handwritten digit strings are based on the analysis of the foreground pixel distributions and the features on the upper/lower contours of the image, In this paper, a new approach is presented to segment connected handwritten two-digit strings based on the thinning of background regions. The algorithm first locates several feature points on the background skeleton of a digit image. Possible segmentation paths are then constructed by matching these feature points. With geometric property measures, all the possible segmentation paths are ranked using fuzzy rules generated from a decision-tree approach. Finally, the top ranked segmentation paths are tested one by one by an optimized nearest neighbor classifier until one of these candidates is accepted based on an acceptance criterion. Experimental results on NIST special database 3 show that our approach can achieve a correct classification rate of 92.5% with only 4.7% of digit strings rejected, which compares favorably with the other techniques tested.

J	Payne, K				Payne, K			The VC dimension and ecological modelling	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						statistical learning theory; VC dimension; complexity; vegetation modelling; Australia; decision tree analysis	NETWORKS	In this article, a measure of model complexity known as the VC dimension is presented and some mathematical theory surrounding the derivation and use of this metric is summarized. The metric allows in some instances, for a modeller to control the amount of error that is returned from a modelling system. Moreover, it allows modellers to state upper bounds on the amount of error that the modelling system will return on ail future, as yet unseen and uncollected datasets. Some computational experiments utilizing this theory in a series of models predicting the spatial distribution of plant species on the east coast of Australia are presented and their results are discussed.

J	Zacharias, MA; Morris, MC; Howes, DE				Zacharias, MA; Morris, MC; Howes, DE			Large scale characterization of intertidal communities using a predictive model	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						gap analysis; classification; intertidal; modeling; Strait of Georgia; biotopes	DYNAMICS	This research presents a methodology that combines shoreline morphology, temperature, salinity, and current (tidal stream velocity) data with biological field sampling to develop kilometer scale intertidal biotopes in the southern Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, Canada. The abiotic component of the classification was based on a geomorphological shoreline classification acquired from low level aerial video, fetch (wave exposure) estimates, as well as salinity, temperature, and current velocity predicted from a hydrodynamic model. The biotic component of the classification was based on in situ field sampling of 39 sites using a published sampling methodology. The inter-relationships between community and habitat were first explored using the two-way indicator species analysis (Twinspan) to define communities and functional groups, and then with regression tree models to determine what combinations of abiotic variables were necessary to support the communities identified by Twinspan. This methodology is predictive, and can be used to quantitatively model the occurrence of biological communities based on abiotic data. The classification presented here is composed of two parts. The first part clustered site by species data collected at 39 sites in the study area using Twinspan. Seven community types were identified by Twinspan. Using an exploratory technique termed tree-based regression, these community types were used as response variables, while abiotic data were used as predictors. The regression tree model predicted seven intertidal biotopes with an accuracy of 72%. Binary decision tree rules produced from the model were used to attach biotopes to the remainder of the 1486 km of shoreline in the study area. Results indicate that this methodology is an effective technique for assessing the broad scale biological composition of large areas of shoreline. This method will be used to assist in the identification of representative, distinct, and rare communities at scales consistent with the identification of conservation importance for site protection and management. It is expected that this methodology will be applied to the remaining 29 000 km of shoreline on Canada's Pacific coast in the near future. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Guijarro, D; Lavin, V; Raghavan, V				Guijarro, D; Lavin, V; Raghavan, V			Exact learning when irrelevant variables abound	INFORMATION PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						algorithms; decision tree minimization; exact learning	BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS; QUERIES	We prove the following results. Any Boolean function of O(log n) relevant variables can be exactly learned with a set of nonadaptive membership queries alone and a minimum sized decision tree representation of the function constructed, in polynomial time. In contrast, such a function cannot be exactly learned with equivalence queries alone using general decision trees and other representation classes as hypotheses. Our results imply others which may be of independent interest. We show that truth-table minimization of decision trees can be done in polynomial time, complementing the well-known result of Masek that truth-table minimization of DNF formulas is NP-hard. The proofs of our negative results show that general decision trees and related representations are not learnable in polynomial time using equivalence queries alone, confirming a folklore theorem.

J	Lavington, S; Dewhurst, N; Wilkins, E; Freitas, A				Lavington, S; Dewhurst, N; Wilkins, E; Freitas, A			Interfacing knowledge discovery algorithms to large database management systems	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						data mining; parallelism; KDD primitives; decision trees; client-server		The efficient mining of large, commercially credible, databases requires a solution to at least two problems: (a) better integration between existing Knowledge Discovery algorithms and popular DBMS; (b) ability to exploit opportunities for computational speedup such as data parallelism. Both problems need to be addressed in a generic manner, since the stated requirements of end-users cover a range of data mining paradigms, DBMS, and (parallel) platforms. In this paper we present a family of generic, set-based, primitive operations for Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). We show how a number of well-known KDD classification metrics, drawn from paradigms such as Bayesian classifiers, Rule-Induction/Decision Tree algorithms, Instance-Based Learning methods, and Genetic Programming, can all be computed via our generic primitives. We then show how these primitives may be mapped into SQL and, where appropriate, optimised for good performance in respect of practical factors such as client-server communication overheads. We demonstrate how our primitives can support C4.5, a widely-used rule induction system. Performance evaluation figures are presented for commercially available parallel platforms, such as the IBM SP/2. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yeun, YS; Lee, KH; Yang, YS				Yeun, YS; Lee, KH; Yang, YS			Function approximations by coupling neural networks and genetic programming trees with oblique decision trees	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						federated agents; genetic programming; oblique decision tree	STRUCTURAL DESIGN; IDENTIFICATION; SYSTEM	This paper is concerning the development of the hybrid system of neural networks and genetic programming (GP) trees for problem domains where a complete input space can be decomposed into several different subregions, and these are well represented in the form of oblique decision tree. The overall architecture of this system, called federated agents, consists of a facilitator, local agents, and boundary agents. Neural networks are used as local agents, each of which is expert at different subregions. GP trees serve as boundary agents. A boundary agent refers to the one that specializes at only the borders of subregions where discontinuities or a few different patterns may coexist. The facilitator is responsible for choosing the local agent that is suitable for given input data using the information obtained from oblique decision tree. However, there is a large possibility of selecting the invalid local agent as result of the incorrect prediction of decision tree, provided that input data is close enough to the boundaries. Such a situation can lead the federated agents to produce a higher prediction error than that of a single neural network trained over the whole input space. To deal with this, the approach taken in this paper is that the facilitator selects the boundary agent instead of the local agent when input data is closely located at certain border of subregions. In this way, even if decision tree yields an incorrect prediction, the performance of the system is less affected by it. The validity of our approach is examined by applying federated agents to the approximation of the function with discontinuities and the configuration of the midship section of bulk cargo ships.

J	Donovan, RE; Woodland, PC				Donovan, RE; Woodland, PC			A hidden Markov-model-based trainable speech synthesizer	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Article								This paper presents a new approach to speech synthesis in which a set of cross-word decision-tree state-clustered context-dependent hidden Markov models are used to define a set of subphone units to be used in a concatenation synthesizer. The models, trees, waveform segments and other parameters representing each clustered state are obtained completely automatically through training on a 1 hour single-speaker continuous-speech database. During synthesis the required utterance, specified as a string of words of known phonetic pronounciation, is generated as a sequence of these clustered states using a TD-PSOLA waveform concatenation synthesizer. The system produces speech. which, though in a monotone, is both natural sounding and highly intelligible. A Modified Rhyme Test conducted to measure segmental intelligibility yielded a 5.0% error rate. The speech produced by the system mimics the voice of the speaker used to record the training database. The system can be retrained on a new voice in less than 48 hours, and has been successfully trained on four voices. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

The proposed algorithm is based on the concept of a local network and the multi-solution reconfiguration algorithm. The introduction of the local network concept reduces the dimension of the problem, while the multi-solution reconfiguration algorithm based on the decision tree, efficiently selects a specified number of "high quality" variants of alternate supply. All these variants are then ranked according to specified criteria. The final output of the algorithm is presented in the form of a ranking list of alternate supply variants and switching operation plans for their performance. The test results from a real-life distribution network have shown that the multi-objective algorithm is an efficient and robust tool for solving large scale operation problems in real time.

J	Van den Bosch, A				Van den Bosch, A			Careful abstraction from instance families in memory-based language learning	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						careful abstraction; memory-based learning; generalized exemplars; natural language processing	ALGORITHMS	Empirical studies in inductive language learning point at pure memory-based learning as a successful approach to many language learning tasks, often performing better than learning methods that abstract from the learning material. The possibility is left open, however, that limited, careful abstraction in memory-based learning may be harmless to generalization, as long as the disjunctivity of language data is preserved. We test this hypothesis, by comparing empirically a range of careful abstraction methods, focusing particularly on methods that (i) generalize instances and (ii) perform oblivious (partial) decision-tree abstraction. These methods are applied to a selection of language learning tasks, and their generalization performance as well as memory item compression rates are collected. On the basis of the results we conclude that when combined with feature weighting or value distance metrics, careful abstraction equals or outperforms pure memory-based learning, yet mainly on small data sets. In the concluding case study involving large data sets, we find that the FAMBL algorithm, a new careful abstractor which merges families of instances, performs close to pure memory-based learning, though it equals it only on three of the six tasks. On the basis of the gathered empirical results, we discuss the incorporation of the notion of instance families, i.e. carefully generalized instances, in memory-based language learning.

J	Bauer, E; Kohavi, R				Bauer, E; Kohavi, R			An empirical comparison of voting classification algorithms: Bagging, boosting, and variants	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	AAAI 1996 Workshop on Integrating Multiple Learned Models for Improving and Scaling Machine Learning Algorithms	AUG   05, 1996	PORTLAND, OREGON			classification; boosting; Bagging; decision trees; Naive-Bayes; mean-squared error	BIAS	Methods for voting classification algorithms, such as Bagging and AdaBoost, have been shown to be very successful in improving the accuracy of certain classifiers for artificial and real-world datasets. We review these algorithms and describe a large empirical study comparing several variants in conjunction with a decision tree inducer (three variants) and a Naive-Bayes inducer. The purpose of the study is to improve our understanding of why and when these algorithms, which use perturbation, reweighting, and combination techniques, affect classification error. We provide a bias and variance decomposition of the error to show how different methods and variants influence these two terms. This allowed us to determine that Bagging reduced variance of unstable methods, while boosting methods (AdaBoost and Arc-x4) reduced both the bias and variance of unstable methods but increased the variance for Naive-Bayes, which was very stable. We observed that Arc-x4 behaves differently than AdaBoost if reweighting is used instead of resampling, indicating a fundamental difference. Voting variants, some of which are introduced in this paper, include: pruning versus no pruning, use of probabilistic estimates, weight perturbations (Wagging), and backfitting of data. We found that Bagging improves when probabilistic estimates in conjunction with no-pruning are used, as well as when the data was backfit. We measure tree sizes and show an interesting positive correlation between the increase in the average tree size in AdaBoost trials and its success in reducing the error. We compare the mean-squared error of voting methods to non-voting methods and show that the voting methods lead to large and significant reductions in the mean-squared errors. Practical problems that arise in implementing boosting algorithms are explored, including numerical instabilities and underflows. We use scatterplots that graphically show how AdaBoost reweights instances, emphasizing not only "hard" areas but also outliers and noise.

Decision criteria included residual risk of infection and overall monetary cost. Tree parameters were determined using data from the Central African Republic. The prevalences observed among blood donors for HIV infection, hepatitis B, syphilis, and hepatitis C varied between 6% and 15%. The current residual risk of transfusion-transmitted infections is very high (8.4%). Screening for HCV would bring that risk down to about 3% with either the HC Pasteur, the HC Abbott, or the combined test. Even though baseline analysis gives preference to the HC Abbott test (the combined test coming out last), Monte Carte sensitivity and uncertainty analyses showed that Abbott's and Pasteur's tests are interchangeable, on the basis or either risk or cost considerations.

We used TFIDF heuristics to determine term frequency and decision trees to evaluate the quality of sites. Training set for the decision tree contained manually evaluated websites. Each website was described by the combination of various attributes, complexity metrics and the evaluation. The intelligent search tool is equipped with a user-friendly interface, which enables people to exploit the tool to its limits with minimum effort, in their quest for information. For testing purposes, we looked for sites with telemedical content. The set of sites, which was the result of using the intelligent search tool, has been evaluated by a group of students.

J	Pippenger, N				Pippenger, N			Upper and lower bounds for the average-case complexity of path-search	NETWORKS			English	Article							NETWORKS	A channel graph is the union of all paths between a given input and a given output in an interconnection network. At any moment in time, each vertex in such a graph is either idle or busy. The search problem that we consider is to find a path (from the given input to the given output) consisting entirely of idle vertices or to find a cut (separating the given input from the given output) consisting entirely of busy vertices, We shall also allow the search to fail to find either a path or a cut with some probability bounded by a parameter called the failure probability. This is to be accomplished by sequentially probing the idle-or-busy status of vertices, where the vertex chosen for each probe may depend on the outcome of previous probes. Thus, a search algorithm may be modeled as a decision tree. For average-case analysis, we assume that each vertex is independently idle with some fixed probability, called the vacancy probability (and therefore busy with the complementary probability). For one commonly studied channel graph type, the parallel graph, we show that the expected number of probes is at most proportional to the length of a path, irrespective of the vacancy probability, and even if the allowed failure probability is zero. Another type of channel graph that we study is the spider-web graph, which is superior to the parallel graph as regards linking probability (the probability that an idle path, rather than a busy cut, exists). For this graph, we give upper and lower bounds that grow exponentially with the length of a path, when the vacancy probability and failure probability are fixed appropriately.

A detailed perspective economic evaluation for Germany is not available. Methods: A deterministic decision-tree analysis was developed to estimate the main cost-relevant pathophysiological events: deep vein thrombosis (DTV), pulmonary embolism (PE) and major bleeding complications (BC) in general and orthopaedic surgery. The specific costs were analysed, summed up and put into relation with saved lifeyears from the perspective of society, third party payer and hospital management. The robustness of these results were substantiated by a detailed sensitivity analysis. Result: LMWH avoids pathophysiological events, saves costs and lifeyears in general and orthopaedic surgery from all perspectives. Conclusion: The use of LMWH as post-operative thromboprophylactic agents is more cost-effective than UFH in Germany. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

J	Fleischer, R				Fleischer, R			Decision trees: Old and new results	INFORMATION AND COMPUTATION			English	Article							LOWER BOUNDS; COMPLEXITY; SETS	In this paper, we prove two general lower bounds for algebraic decision trees which test membership in a set S subset of or equal to R-n which is defined by linear inequalities. Let rank(S) be the maximal dimension of a linear subspace contained in the closure of S (in Euclidean topology). First we show that any decision tree for S which uses products of linear functions (we call such functions mlf-functions) must have depth at least n-rank(S). This solves an open question raised by A. C. Yao and can be used to show that mlf-functions are not really more powerful than simple comparisons between the input variables when computing the largest k out of n elements. Yao proved this result in the special case when products of at most two linear functions are allowed. Our proof also shows that any decision tree for this problem must have exponential size. Using the same methods, we can give an alternative proof of Rabin's theorem, namely that the depth of any decision tree for S using arbitrary analytic functions is at least n-rank(S).

Although such treatment strategy is widely recommended, its impact on health expenditures has not been evaluated. Methods: The economic analysis compares the medication costs of competing medical treatment strategies, using two different sets of cost data. Medication costs are estimated from the average wholesale prices (AWP) and from the lowest discount prices charged to governmental health institutions. A decision tree is used to model the step-wise treatment of GERD, In a Monte Carlo simulation, all transition probabilities built into the model are varied over a wide range. A threshold analysis evaluates the relationship between the cost of an individual medication and its therapeutic success rate, Results: In a governmental health care system, a stepwise strategy saves on average $916 per patient every 5 years (range: $443-$1628) in comparison with a strategy utilizing only the most potent medication, In a cost environment relying on AWP, the average savings amount to $256 (-$206 to +$1561). The smaller the cost difference between two consecutive treatment steps, the longer one needs to follow the patients to reap the benefit of the small cost difference. However, even a Small cost difference can turn into tangible cost savings, if a large enough fraction of GERD patients responds to the initial step of a less potent but also less expensive medication. Conclusions: The economic analysis suggests that a stepwise utilization of increasingly more potent and more expensive medications to treat GERD would result in appreciable cost savings.

J	Erstad, BL				Erstad, BL			Pharmacoeconomic comparison of an albumin-furosemide complex versus sequential therapy for renal insufficiency	CLINICAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							FAILURE; ILL	The purpose of this economic analysis was to develop an economic model using intra-institutional cost data for acute, oliguric renal insufficiency treated with either an albumin-furosemide complex or albumin followed by furosemide (sequential therapy). The perspective of this study was from the standpoint of the institution (University Medical Center, a teaching hospital). The decision tree and sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the albumin-furosemide complex would be more effective and less costly than sequential therapy for a range of outcome probabilities. Using effectiveness assumptions from published literature, the complex could avoid dialysis in 27% of patients compared with 8% of patients receiving sequential therapy. The complex would also be less costly ($7778 vs $8748). In terms of cost-effectiveness, the complex is $28,807 per averted dialysis compared with $109,350 for sequential therapy.

Either low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UH) may be used for the prophylaxis of post-operative venous thromboembolic disease (VTD) in elective hip replacement. This study was aimed at assessing the cost-effectiveness of LMWH over UH from the society perspective, which considers all the outcomes occurring in the lifelong time horizon. Design and Methods. A decision tree modeled the clinical outcomes and resources used in consequence of restricted (2 weeks) and extended (4 weeks) prophylaxis of VTD with LMWH or UH. Results. In the studied population, that of 67 year-old patients, restricted prophylaxis with LMWH saved 25 quality-adjusted days and $75 over UH. Extended prophylaxis provided a small additional benefit with additional cost savings. The incremental outcomes of the model proved independent of most parameters. Interpretation and Conclusions. We conclude that LMWH has considerable advantages over UH in the prophylaxis of VTD following elective hip replacement, and should be recommended in clinical practice.

These improvements alone however, will not significantly reduce costs unless they are accompanied by revisions in the entire claims processing system. This study explores the reliability and utility of probabilistic inductive learning (PrIL), a statistically enhanced decision tree algorithm, for improving the decision-making process at the New York State Workers' Compensation Board (WCB), The WCB sees a high volume of claims every year, and its administrative costs are considerably higher than other states of similar size. In response, legislation had been enacted which would differently route cases with a short expected duration of benefits for nontraditional processing. It is expected that such regulation will shorten the claim life cycle and reduce a backlog of cases at a reduced cost. Using several different models, PrIL was used to generate rules that could be used to assign cases to different processing routes within the WCB system. For purposes of comparison, models using logistic regression analysis and conventional decision tree methodology were also produced. Results indicated that the PrIL algorithm is favorably comparable to both the purely statistical and the classical decision tree methodologies, with the added advantages of easy to understand rules and user-defined reliability measures for each of those rules. Given the appropriate information regarding the relative value of correct and incorrect classification of cases in the WCB system, PrIL can be used to accurately assist in the decision making process in terms of reducing cost, predicting and enhancing quality and case outcomes in managed care practices.

J	Marsh, W				Marsh, W			The economics of animal health in farmed livestock at the herd level	REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE DE L OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES			English	Article						benefit-cost ratio; data quality; decision tree analysis; economics; financial accounting; internal rate of return; net present value		Animal health economics is a relatively new discipline which makes use of concepts, procedures and data to support the decision-making process with the objective of optimising animal health management. As the economic impact of most diseases that afflict farmed livestock is typically greater at the sub-clinical rather than the clinical level, animal health management often involves decisions regarding expenditure on preventive measures as well as the treatment of obviously sick animals. Animal health programmes have been shown to provide a very high return on investment. This is because reduction of the impact of disease increases the efficiency of production, often without the need for additional inputs such as feed or labour. The analytical techniques described in this chapter are the simplest, most useful, and most commonly used by animal health economists. Most decisions in animal health economics at the farm level can be arrived at by using partial budgeting, decision tree analysis, or cost-benefit analysis techniques - either alone or in combination. Regardless of the technique chosen, the analysis is only as good as the quality of the data used.

The phonemic and prosodic boundaries were manually marked on the recorded speech, and morphological analysis, grapheme-to-phoneme conversion and syntactic analysis were also done on the text. A decision tree and regression trees were trained on 240 sentences (of approximately 20 min length), and tested on 160 sentences (of approximately 13 min length). Features for modeling prosody are proposed, and their effectiveness is measured by interpreting the resulting trees. The misclassification rate of the decision tree was 14.46%, the RMSEs of the regression trees, which predict pause duration and segmental duration, were 132 and 22 ms, respectively, for the test set. To understand the performance of our approach in the run time of TTS systems, we trained and tested tries with the output of our text analyzer. The misclassification rate and the RMSE were 18.49% and 134 ms, respectively, for prosodic phrasing and pause duration on the test set. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Du, H; Corkan, LA; Yang, KX; Kuo, PY; Lindsey, JS				Du, H; Corkan, LA; Yang, KX; Kuo, PY; Lindsey, JS			An automated microscale chemistry workstation capable of parallel, adaptive experimentation	CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS			English	Article						automated workstation; parallel experimentation; microscale chemistry	SYNTHETIC CHEMISTRY; MODIFIED SIMPLEX; REFLECTIONS; SCHEDULER	We have designed and constructed a 3rd-generation chemistry workstation and accompanying software for automated experimentation in relatively clean domains of chemistry. The workstation is designed for flexible, high-throughput, microscale chemistry and includes a reaction station with 60 reaction vessels. The experiment manager software includes a large number of features to facilitate experiment planning and implementation. The significant advances in software from the 2nd-generation system include the following: (1) Five experiment-planning modules have been incorporated to match different types of scientific experimentation, including open-loop and closed-loop experiments. The five modules enable plans to be composed for general-purpose (GP), decision-tree (DT), factorial design (FD), composite modified Simplex (CMS) and multidirectional search (MDS) experiments. (2) Parallel experimentation and adaptive experimentation have been blended so that some decision-making can be done using objective functions or early-termination functions while multiple experiments are in progress. Some planning modules (CMS, MDS and DT) can cause new experiments to be spawned based on the chemistry data obtained. (3) Decision-making can involve the local course of individual experiments and/or the global course of sets of experiments. (4) Resource management features provide the capability to look-ahead at experiments in queue, assess resource (chemicals, containers) availability and designate suitability for implementation. (5) Intelligent reagent-handling features support the autodilution of reagents, autoselection of appropriate stock solutions, autoassignment of containers and control over reaction volumes. (6) Opportunistic rescheduling features have been provided so that pending experiments can be advanced in queue whenever possible, leading to compressed experimental timeframes. (7) Templates composed for FD, CMS and MDS experiments can be stored and reused with modifications as required for specific experiments. (8) The scheduling module contains both a rigid scheduler and a flexible scheduler. (9) The software is modular and runs under Windows 95. This workstation is especially designed for fundamental investigations of chemical reactions and optimization of experimental reaction conditions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Du, H; Shen, W; Kuo, PY; Lindsey, JS				Du, H; Shen, W; Kuo, PY; Lindsey, JS			Decision-tree programs for an adaptive automated chemistry workstation. Application to catalyst screening experiments	CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS			English	Article						decision-tree programs; automated chemistry workstations; screening compounds	SYNTHETIC CHEMISTRY	Automated chemistry workstations with the capability of altering the course of experimentation based on acquired data are essential for performing strategic searches. Such adaptive experimentation requires the ability to compose experimental plans for initiating, monitoring, evaluating, and making decisions about experiments. We have developed a decision-tree (DT) experiment-planning module that includes a complete command set for adaptive operation of the workstation. Functions for dialog prompts are included, enabling generic programs to be tailored for specific applications by various users. The DT experiment-planning module is one component of an experiment planner for an automated microscale chemistry workstation. The DT functions are also used to compose early-termination programs and describe objective functions for use in the companion factorial design, composite-modified simplex, and multidirectional search experiment-planning modules. The features of the DT experiment-planning module are illustrated with a program that screens a list of candidate compounds for catalytic activity. A set of dialog boxes at the beginning of the program prompts the user for information. Based on this information, the candidates are examined automatically (in a serial process) in exhaustive or hill-climbing searching strategies. A yield vs. time pattern-matching procedure is performed dynamically in order to assess whether monitoring should be continued. Decisions also are made concerning examination of the candidate at higher or lower concentrations. Higher concentrations are achieved by addition of aliquots of the candidate to the ongoing reaction, while lower concentrations are achieved by spawning a new reaction. When a user-defined yield threshold is reached or the entire user-specified concentration range has been spanned, catalysts and their effective concentration ranges are identified. This experiment-planning module enables composition of flexible programs for adaptive experimentation that can be used as stand-alone programs or as decision-making components of other searching programs.

J	Erickson, J				Erickson, J			Lower bounds for linear satisfiability problems	CHICAGO JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article							ALGEBRAIC DECISION TREES; COMPUTATION TREES; COMPLEXITY; SETS; SUMS	We prove an Omega(n(inverted right perpendicularr/2inverted left perpendicular)) lower bound for the following problem: For some fixed linear equation in r variables, given n real numbers, do any r of them satisfy the equation? Our lower bound holds in a restricted linear decision tree model, in which each decision is based on the sign of an arbitrary linear combination of r or fewer inputs. In this model, our lower bound is as large as possible. Previously, this lower bound was known only for a few special cases and only in more specialized models of computation. Our lower bound follows from an adversary argument. We show that for any algorithm, there is a input that contains Omega(n(inverted right perpendicularr/2inverted left perpendicular)) "critical" r-tuples, which have the following important property. None of the critical tuples satisfies the equation; however, if the algorithm does not directly test each critical tuple, then the adversary can modify the input, in a way that is undetectable to the algorithm, so that some untested tuple does satisfy the equation. A key step in the proof is the introduction of formal infinitesimals into the adversary input. A theorem of Tarski implies that if we can construct a single input containing infinitesimals that is hard for every algorithm, then for every decision tree algorithm there exists a corresponding real-valued input which is hard for that algorithm.

J	Blogg, AE; O'Shaughnessy, DV; Cairns, DR				Blogg, AE; O'Shaughnessy, DV; Cairns, DR			Levels and predictors of distress in home hemodialysis caregivers	DIALYSIS & TRANSPLANTATION			English	Article							FAMILY	The principal objective of this study was to understand the level of distress in the home hemodialysis caregiver community. A literature review revealed that relativity little attention had been given to this group. Seventy-two caregivers of the Sydney Dialysis Center's home hemodialysis population were approached to complete a self-report questionnaire with 64 caregivers responding (89% response rate). This analysis includes 61 caregivers of a patient of the opposite sex. The questionnaire included a global measure of distress (General Health Questionnaire) and a specific measure of distress (Relatives' Stress Scale). The Relatives' Stress Scale included subscales for Personal Distress, Life Upsets, and Negative Feelings. Other variables included were demographic and medical. Descriptive statistics revealed that the specific distress scales were more sensitive measures of caregiver distress than the global distress score. Segmentation modeling (SPSS CHAID decision-tree analysis) was performed to identify, caregiver subgroups which reported high distress. Separate segmentation analyses were performed for Personal Distress, Life Upsets, and Negative Feelings. The main predictors of high Personal Distress were younger age of the caregiver combined with low levels of involvement with the patient. The main predictors of high Life Up-sets were a perception of the patient's health as "fair" combined with a younger caregiver For caregivers who perceived their patient to be in "fair" health,females were also high on Life Up-sets. The main predictor of high Negative Feelings was level of involvement, with high Negative Feelings associated with both low and high involvement. Two caregiver subgroups-rural-based caregivers with high involvement; and caregivers, able to fake a break from caring responsibilities, with low involvement-were particularly at risk of reporting high Negative Feelings. Interestingly, the age of the caregiver was not associated with Negative Feelings. Overall complete segmentation decision-tree analysis assists in the identification of caregiver subgroups with specific forms of distress that may not be identified with global distress measures.

In our base-case analysis (a 45-year-old man with a prior probability of endocarditis of 20%), use of transesophageal imaging improved quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALYs) by 9 days and reduced costs by $18 per person compared with the use of transthoracic echocardiography. Sequential test strategies that reserved the use of transesophageal echocardiography For patients who had an inadequate transthoracic study provided similar QALYs compared with the use of transesophageal echocardiography alone, but cost $230 to $250 more. For patients with prior probabilities of endocarditis greater than 60%, the optimal strategy is to treat for endocarditis without reliance on echocardiography for diagnosis. Patients with a prior probability of less than 2% should receive treatment for bacteremia without imaging. Transthoracic imaging was optimal for only a narrow range of prior probabilities (2% or 3%) of endocarditis. CONCLUSION: The appropriate use of echocardiography depends on the prior probability of endocarditis. For patients whose prior probability of endocarditis is 4% to 60"/o, initial use of transesophageal echocardiography provides the greatest quality-adjusted survival at a cost that is within the range for commonly accepted health interventions.

This process can be quantified by combining the probabilities of expected outcomes with their desirability. We studied differences in the valuation of bir th outcomes among pregnant women, mothers, and obstetricians, and assessed how these would affect a particular obstetric decision. Methods: In a study conducted at Leiden Hospital, Leiden, The Netherlands, 12 obstetricians, 15 pregnant women, and 15 mothers participated in a standard reference gamble to determine the value of 12 different outcomes: 3 types of bir th combined with 4 states of infant outcome. These were then applied to an obstetric decision tree based on the Dublin trial of intermittent auscultation versus electronic intrapartum . fetal heart rate monitoring. Results: Contrary to obstetricians, women valued permanent tt neurologic handicap significantly higher than neonatal death (p < 0.01). Women expressed no overriding preferences for the type of birth, whereas obstetricians were clearly antipathetic to cesarean section. Within-group consistency was significantly higher for pregnant women and mothers than for obstetricians (p < 0.0001). However application of the measured values to the obstetric decision tree merely led to marginal changes in overall expected value of the decision alternatives. Conclusions: Values attached to birth processes and outcomes differ significantly between (expectant) mothers and doctors. These differences should be recognized and respected in obstetric decision making.

J	Srivastava, A; Han, EH; Kumar, V; Singh, V				Srivastava, A; Han, EH; Kumar, V; Singh, V			Parallel formulations of decision-tree classification algorithms	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						data mining; parallel processing; classification; scalability; decision trees		Classification decision tree algorithms are used extensively for data mining in many domains such as retail target marketing, fraud detection, etc. Highly parallel algorithms for constructing classification decision trees are desirable for dealing with large data sets in reasonable amount of time. Algorithms for building classification decision trees have a natural concurrency, but are difficult to parallelize due to the inherent dynamic nature of the computation. In this paper, we present parallel formulations of classification decision tree learning algorithm based on induction. We describe two basic parallel formulations. One is based on Synchronous Tree Construction Approach and the other is based on Partitioned Tree Construction Approach. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using these methods and propose a hybrid method that employs the good features of these methods. We also provide the analysis of the cost of computation and communication of the proposed hybrid method. Moreover, experimental results on an IBM SP-2 demonstrate excellent speedups and scalability.

J	Sielken, RL; Valdez-Flores, C				Sielken, RL; Valdez-Flores, C			Probabilistic risk assessment's use of trees and distributions to reflect uncertainty and variability and to overcome the limitations of default assumptions	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							CANCER POTENCY FACTORS; COMPREHENSIVE REALISM; MODEL; CARCINOGENESIS; FRAMEWORK; BIOASSAYS; RFD	Probabilistic risk assessment is an emerging approach to exposure assessment and quantitative cancer and non-cancer risk characterizations. The approach is easily extended to other types of risks and outcomes. A tree, like a decision tree or probability tree, encourages the evaluation of not only the default assumptions but also alternatives to those defaults, and reflects the uncertainty in the current state of knowledge. Trees are used in both the characterization of the dose received by individuals in a potential exposure situation and the characterization of the dose-response relationship for a specified response of concern. Probability distributions are used to reflect the variability in exposure, dose, and dose-response relationships among individuals and over time within individuals. Distributions incorporating variabilities, uncertainties, subjective probabilities, and expert judgements are used to characterize the probabilities of observing an individual in a population with a specified dose from exposure, with a specified probability of a certain adverse health effect for a designated dose, and with a specified probability of a certain adverse health effect (i.e., a specified risk). Some suggestions are given on how a risk manager can incorporate a distributional risk characterization into decision making. Some discussion is included concerning sensitivity analyses and path analyses. The major finding is methodology to explicitly incorporate variability, uncertainty, and alternatives to defaults into exposure, dose-response, and risk characterizations.

J	Wu, XD; Urpani, D				Wu, XD; Urpani, D			Induction by attribute elimination	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; rule induction; attribute selection; information entropy		In most data-mining applications where induction is used as the primary tool for knowledge extraction from real-world databases, it is difficult to precisely identify a complete set of relevant attributes. This paper introduces a new rule induction algorithm called Rule Induction Two In One (RITIO), which eliminates attributes in the order of decreasing irrelevancy. Like ID3-like decision tree construction algorithms, RITIO makes use of the entropy measure as a means of constraining the hypothesis search space; but, unlike ID3-like algorithms, the hypotheses language is the rule structure and RITIO generates rules without constructing decision trees.

The authentication task performed by an expert is a binary classification problem: reject or accept identity claim. Combining experts, each based on a different modality (speech, face, fingerprint, etc.), increases the performance and robustness of identity authentication systems. In this context, a key issue is the fusion of the different experts for taking a. final decision (i.e., accept or reject identity claim). We propose to evaluate different binary classification schemes (support vector ;machine, multilayer perceptron, C4.5 decision tree, Fisher's linear discriminant, Bayesian classifier) to carry on the fusion, The experimental results show that support vector machines and Bayesian classifier achieve almost the same performances, and both outperform the other evaluated classifiers.

However, FNAB does not provide a reliable benign versus malignant diagnosis for 100% of the cases analysed. It is possible to increase the accuracy of the cytological diagnosis by means of information contributed by different clinical variables. In the present study we evaluate the diagnostic value of 10 variables in addition to FNAB on a series of 218 specimens for which we obtained histological diagnoses including 37 cancers (17%). The diagnostic information contributed by these variables was analyzed by means of the Decision Tree technique, an artificial intelligence-related method which forms part of the Supervised Learning algorithms. The results show that Decision Trees enable some subpopulations of patients with uncertain FNAB results to be characterized.

STUDY DESIGN: Data from a clinical study that aligned two screening and treatment strategies and it noscreening or treatment strategy with three gynecologic practices in Berlin were used in decision tree analysis. Costs applied to the clinical outcomes were determined from standard German references and the charges from university clinics. RESULTS: Practices A and B screened all 600 patients in the early second trimester and treated the positive cases with clindamycin 2% vaginal cream (A) or a Lactobacillus preparation (B), which incurred lower total costs, $493,159 and $497,619, as compared to practice C (total costs, $534,926), which did not screen or treat for bacterial vaginosis. Including costs of screening and treatment, the net savings of practice A as compared to practice C was estimated to be $47,316. CONCLUSION: The presence of more preterm, premature and low-birth-weight infants added costs for practice C. The estimated cost savings lend support to the value of screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis in early pregnancy.

J	Pereira, FC; Singer, Y				Pereira, FC; Singer, Y			An efficient extension to mixture techniques for prediction and decision trees	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						mixture models; decision and prediction trees; on-line learning; statistical language modeling	UNIVERSAL; PROBABILITIES; ALGORITHM	We present an efficient method for maintaining mixtures of prunings of a prediction or decision tree that extends the previous methods for "node-based" prunings (Buntine, 1990; Willems, Shtarkov, & Tjalkens, 1995; Helmbold & Schapire, 1997; Singer, 1997) to the larger class of edge-based prunings. The method includes an online weight-allocation algorithm that can be used for prediction, compression and classification. Although the set of edge-based prunings of a given tree is much larger than that of node-based prunings, our algorithm has similar space and time complexity to that of previous mixture algorithms for trees. Using the general online framework of Freund and Schapire (1997), we prove that our algorithm maintains correctly the mixture weights for edge-based prunings with any bounded loss function. We also give a similar algorithm for the logarithmic loss function with a corresponding weight-allocation algorithm. Finally, we describe experiments comparing node-based and edge-based mixture models for estimating the probability of the next word in English text, which show the advantages of edge-based models.

Nevertheless, they are common in practical tasks and, therefore, need to be taken into account. We characterize the well-behavedness of an evaluation function, a property that guarantees the optimal multi-partition of an arbitrary numerical domain to be defined on boundary points. Well-behavedness reduces the number of candidate cut points that need to be examined in multisplitting numerical attributes. Many commonly used attribute evaluation functions possess this property; we demonstrate that the cumulative functions Information Gain and Training Set Error as well as the non-cumulative functions Gain Ratio and Normalized Distance Measure are all well-behaved. We also devise a method of finding optimal multisplits efficiently by examining the minimum number of boundary point combinations that is required to produce partitions which are optimal with respect to a cumulative and well-behaved evaluation function. Our empirical experiments validate the utility of optimal multisplitting: it produces constantly better partitions than alternative approaches do and it only requires comparable time. In top-down induction of decision trees the choice of evaluation function has a more decisive effect on the result than the choice of partitioning strategy; optimizing the value of most common attribute evaluation functions does not raise the accuracy of the produced decision trees. In our tests the construction time using optimal multisplitting was, on the average, twice that required by greedy multisplitting, which in its part required on the average twice the time of binary splitting.

The study describes two different classifiers for the identification of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) in surface ECGs. A decision-tree algorithm based on inductive learning from a training set and a fuzzy rule-based classifier are explained in detail. Traditional features for the classification task are extracted by analysing the heart rate and morphology of the heart beats from a single lead. In addition, a novel set of features based on the use of a filter bank is presented. Filter banks allow for time-frequency-dependent signal processing with low computational effort. The performance of the classifiers is evaluated on the MIT-BIH database following the AAMI recommendations. The decision-tree algorithm has a gross sensitivity of 85.3% and a positive predictivity of 85.2%, whereas the gross sensitivity of the fuzzy rule-based system is 81.3%, and the positive predictivity is 80.6%.

J	Messori, A; Trippoli, S				Messori, A; Trippoli, S			A new method for expressing survival and life expectancy in lifetime cost-effectiveness studies that evaluate cancer patients (review)	ONCOLOGY REPORTS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European Conference of the International-Society-for-Pharmacoeconomics-and-Outcomes-Research	DEC, 1998	COLOGNE, GERMANY	Int Soc Pharmacoecon & Outcomes Res		cost-effectiveness analysis; life expectancy; cost per life year gained; lifetime analyses; survival gains	CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA; CHRONIC HEPATITIS-C; CONVENIENT APPROXIMATION; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; INTERFERON-ALPHA; THERAPY; HEALTH; RECOMMENDATIONS; MEDICINE; ISSUES	The methodology of cost-effectiveness studies that use a lifetime perspective is based on the extrapolation to infinity of the survival curves. However, the research in this methodological area is at an initial phase. Hence, adequate techniques for survival curve extrapolation still need to be devised for handling the different clinical settings that can be analysed by cost-effectiveness survival studies. After a brief overview of the two most commonly used extrapolation methods (Markov decision-tree model and Gompertz technique), we describe a new method for expressing lifetime survival in cost-effectiveness studies that evaluate cancer patients. Our method extrapolates to infinity a traditional survival curve by assigning a normal life expectancy to 'cured' patients (or long-term survivors). In this way, the value of mean lifetime survival (MLS) for the patient cohort under study can be determined using a lifetime perspective. This value can be employed in lifetime cost-effectiveness analyses that compare different forms of intervention for that disease condition. A separate section of our method compares the overall survival pattern of cured and not cured patients with that of a reference healthy population to assess the impact of the disease on life expectancy. As an example of the application of our method, we reanalysed a survival data set reported by Spinolo et al in 1992, that refers to patients with acute leukaemia who relapsed after their first allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and who received a second transplant (n=17, mean age at relapse = 26 years). The use of our extrapolation method provided the following results: MLS for leukaemia patients = 105.9 months per patient or 8.8 years per patient; MLS for the reference cohort of healthy subjects = 583.8 months per patient or 48.6 years per patient. We conclude that the extrapolation technique described herein can be useful to handle lifetime survival data in cost-effectiveness analysis.

TRANSFUSION			English	Article							COST-EFFECTIVENESS	BACKGROUND: Prevention of exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion during surgery is an important financial issue when recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) is used in addition to preoperative blood donation. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to carry out a cost-effectiveness analysis of the use of rHuEPO in preoperative blood donation in orthopedic surgery. The study, based on a decision tree analysis of the use of rHuEPO, was conducted from the perspective df the French health care system. The efficacy criterion was the number of hepatitis C infections prevented. The decision tree analysis was constructed as follows: the residual risk of hepatitis C infection was 8.26 per million units transfused, and the chance node was defined according to the number of units transfused. RESULTS: With the use of rHuEPO in preoperative brood donation, 0.30562 cases of hepatitis C infection per 100,000 patients were prevented. The incremental cost of one prevented hepatitis C infection amounted to $888,000,000 (US). CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations of our model, the cast-effectiveness ratio was so large that variations only slightly modified the size of the result. From the societal perspective it was not cost-effective to add rHuEPO to preoperative blood donation.

J	Chambers, C; Chen, WM				Chambers, C; Chen, WM			Efficient multiple and predicate dispatching	ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES			English	Article							MULTIMETHODS	The speed of message dispatching is an important issue in the overall performance of object-oriented programs. We have developed an algorithm for constructing efficient dispatch functions that combines novel algorithms for efficient single dispatching, multiple dispatching, and predicate dispatching. Our algorithm first reduces methods written in the general predicate dispatching model (which generalizes single dispatching, multiple dispatching, predicate classes and classifiers, and pattern-matching) into ones written using a simpler multimethod dispatching model. Our algorithm then computes a strategy for implementing multiple dispatching in terms of sequences of single dispatches, representing the strategy as a lookup DAG. Finally, our algorithm computes an implementation strategy separately for each of the single dispatches, producing for each dispatch a dispatch tree, which is a binary decision tree blending class identity tests, class range tests, and table lookups. Our algorithm exploits any available static information (from type declarations or class analysis) to prune unreachable paths from the lookup DAG, and uses any available dynamic profile information to minimize the expected time to search the dispatch trees. We measure the effectiveness of our dispatching algorithms on a collection of large Cecil programs, compiled by the Vortex optimizing compiler, showing improvements of up to 30% over already heavily optimized baseline versions.

This article presents a unifying framework according to which any pruning method can be defined as a four-tuple (Space, Operators, Evaluation function, Search strategy), and the pruning process can be cast as an optimization problem. Six well-known pruning methods are investigated by means of this framework and their common aspects, strengths and weaknesses are described. Furthermore, a new empirical analysis of the effect of post-pruning on both the predictive accuracy and the size od induced decision trees is reported. The experimental comparison of the pruning methods involves 14 datasets and is based on the cross-validation procedure. The results confirm most of the conclusions drawn in a previous comparison based on the holdout procedure. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A decision tree was constructed to predict the expected functional outcomes for operative and nonoperative treatment, Outcome probabilities were derived from the surgical and natural history literature. Cost data were based on averaged figures from the senior author's institution, Utility values were determined from a questionnaire administered to 285 local university students. Cost effectiveness was calculated in terms of dollars spent per additional quality adjusted life year provided by the surgical reconstruction for the initial 7 years after an injury, The operative strategy provided 5.10 quality adjusted life years versus 3.49 years for nonoperative treatment, yielding a marginal effectiveness of 1.61 quality adjusted life years. The estimated total costs of the operative and nonoperative strategies were $11,768 and $2333, respectively, for a marginal cost of $9435, The resulting marginal cost effectiveness ratio was $5857 per quality adjusted life year. These data suggest that, when based on functional outcomes, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a cost effective method of treatment For acute tears in young adults. The cost effectiveness ratio predicted compares favorably with those of other health care interventions that aim to improve quality of life.

J	Rudolfer, SM; Paliouras, G; Peers, IS				Rudolfer, SM; Paliouras, G; Peers, IS			A comparison of logistic regression to decision tree induction in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome	COMPUTERS AND BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article							MODELS; PREDICTION; VARIABLES	This paper aims to compare and contrast two types of model (logistic regression and decision tree induction) for the diagnosis of carpel tunnel syndrome using four ordered classification categories. Initially, we present the classification performance results based on more than two covariates (multivariate case). Our results suggest that there is no significant difference between the two methods. Further to this investigation, we present a detailed comparison of the structure of bivariate versions of the models. The first surprising result of this analysis is that the classification accuracy of the bivariate models is slightly higher than that of the multivariate ones. In addition, the bivariate models lend themselves to graphical analysis, where the corresponding decision regions can easily be represented in the two-dimensional covariate space. This analysis reveals important structural differences between the two models, (C) 1999 Academic Press.

Three different families algorithms have been analyzed: divide and conquer (top down induction decision tree), covering, and inductive logic programming (ILP). We have used (1) fault data collected on corrective maintenance activities for the Generalized Support Software reuse asset library located at the Flight Dynamics Division of NASA's GSFC and (2) product measures extracted directly from the faulty components of this library. In our data set, the software quality models generated by both C4.5-rules (a divide and conquer algorithm) and FOIL (an inductive logic programming one) presented the best results from the point of view of model accuracy.

J	Raz, R; Tardos, G; Verbitsky, O; Vereshchagin, N				Raz, R; Tardos, G; Verbitsky, O; Vereshchagin, N			Arthur-Merlin games in boolean decision trees	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER AND SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity	JUN 15-18, 1998	BUFFALO, NEW YORK	IEEE, Comp Soc Tech Comm Math Fdn Comp, Univ Buffalo			COMPLEXITY; ORACLES	It is well known that probabilistic boolean decision trees cannot be much more powerful than deterministic ones (N. Nisan, SIAM J. Comput. 20, No. 6 (1991), 999-1007), Motivated by a question if randomization can significantly speed up a nondeterministic computation via a boolean decision tree, we address structural properties of Arthur-Merlin games in this model and prove some lower bounds. We consider two cases of interest, the first when the length of communication between the players is limited and the second, if it is not. While in the first case we can carry over the relations between the corresponding Turing complexity classes, in the second case we observe in contrast with Turing complexity that a one-round Merlin-Arthur protocol is as powerful as a general interactive proof system and, in particular, can simulate a one-round Arthur-Merlin protocol. Moreover, we show that sometimes a Merlin-Arthur protocol can be more efficient than an Arthur-Merlin protocol and than a Merlin-Arthur protocol with limited communication. This is the case for a boolean function whose set of zeroes is a code with high minimum distance and a natural uniformity condition. Such functions provide an example when the Merlin-Arthur complexity is 1 with one-sided error epsilon is an element of (2/3, 1), but at the same time the nondeterministic decision tree complexity is Ohm(n). The latter should be contrasted with another fact we prove. Namely, if a function has Merlin-Arthur complexity 1 with one-sided error probability epsilon is an element of (0, 2/3], then its nondeterministic complexity is bounded by a constant. Other results of the paper include connections with the block sensitivity and related combinatorial properties of a boolean function. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

Since the attribute selected by the algorithm at a given node is often the best attribute according to the Quinlan's information gain criterion, the decision tree it induces is often identical to the ID3 tree when the number of attributes is small. In problem-solving applications of the induced decision tree, an advantage of the approach is that the relevance of a selected attribute or test can be explained in strategic terms. An implementation of the algorithm in an environment providing integrated support for incremental learning, problem solving and explanation is presented. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Ragel, A; Cremilleux, B				Ragel, A; Cremilleux, B			MVC - a preprocessing method to deal with missing values	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th SGES International Conference on Knowledge-Based Systems and Applied Artificial Intelligence (ES98)	DEC 14-16, 1998	CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND	Specialist Grp Expert Syst		association rules; missing values; preprocessing; decision trees		Many of analysis tasks have to deal with missing values and have developed specific and internal treatments to guess them. In this paper we present an external method, MVC (Missing Values Completion), to improve performances of completion and also declarativity and interactions with the user for this problem. Such qualities will allow to use it for the data cleaning step of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD process (U.M. Fayyad, G. Piatetsky-Shapiro, P. Smyth, From data mining to knowledge discovery: an overview, in: Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, USA, 1996, pp. 1-36). The core of MVC, is the Robust Association Rules (RAR) algorithm that we have proposed earlier (A. Ragel, B Cremilleux, Treatment of missing values for association rules, in: Proceedings of the Second Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD-98), Melbourne, Australia, Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence 1394, Springer, Berlin, 1998, pp. 258-270). This algorithm extends the concept of association rules CR. Agrawal, T. Imielinski, A. Swami, Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases, in: Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD Conference on Management of Data, Washington, DC, USA, 1993, pp. 207-216) for databases with multiple missing values. It allows MVC to be an efficient preprocessing method: in our experiments with the c4.5 (J.R. Quilan, C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning, Morgan Kaufmann, San Mateo, CA, USA, 1993) decision tree program, MVC has permitted to divide, up to two, the error rate in classification, independently of a significant gain of declarativity.

The literature on medical decision analysis suggests the use of two-branch chance nodes in decision trees to avoid logical inconsistencies during sensitivity analysis. The authors show that the two-branch decomposition is not appropriate for sensitivity analysis when multiple outcomes from a single state cannot be disentangled into a sensible sequence of events. They recommend retaining the natural structure of the tree and propose two sensitivity analysis methods for use on chance nodes with three or more branches.

The construction of a knowledge base for an expert system may be a difficult task; to automate this task several machine learning methods have been developed. These methods can be also used in the refinement of knowledge bases for removing inconsistencies and redundancies, and for simplifying decision rules. In this study, decision tree induction was employed to acquire diagnostic knowledge for otoneurological diseases and to extract relevant parameters from the database of an otoneurological expert system ONE. The records of patients with benign positional vertigo, Meniere's disease, sudden deafness, traumatic vertigo, vestibular neuritis and vestibular schwannoma were retrieved from the database of ONE, and for each disease, decision trees were constructed. The study shows that decision tree induction is a useful technique for acquiring diagnostic knowledge for otoneurological diseases and for extracting relevant parameters from a large set of parameters.

J	Frohwein, HI; Lambert, JH; Haimes, YY				Frohwein, HI; Lambert, JH; Haimes, YY			Alternative measures of risk of extreme events in decision trees	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						decision trees; risk; sequential decisions; extreme events; multiple objectives; optimization; multicriteria decision making	HAZARDOUS MATERIALS; EXPECTED UTILITY; MODEL	A need for a methodology to control the extreme events, defined as low-probability, high-consequence incidents, in sequential decisions is identified. A variety of alternative and complementary measures of the risk of extreme events are examined for their usability as objective functions in sequential decisions, represented as single- or multiple-objective decision trees. Earlier work had addressed difficulties, related to non-separability, with the minimization of some measures of the risk of extreme events in sequential decisions. In an extension of these results, it is shown how some non-separable measures of the risk of extreme events can be interpreted in terms of separable constituents of risk, thereby enabling a wider class of measures of the risk of extreme events to be handled in a straightforward manner in a decision tree. Also for extreme events, results are given to enable minimax- and Hurwicz-criterion analyses in decision trees. An example demonstrates the incorporation of different measures of the risk of extreme events in a multi-objective decision tree. Conceptual formulations for optimizing non-separable measures of the risk of extreme events are identified as an important area for future investigation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Microbiological testing included counts of mesophilic and psicrothrophic microorganisms, yeasts and molds, total and fecal coliforms, C. perfringens, coagulase positive staphylococci, bacteria of the B. cereus group and detection of Salmonella. Time/temperature binomial was measured in all steps of preparation. A decision tree was used to help in the determination of CCPs. The detected hazards were: contamination of raw meat and vegetables, multiplication of the microorganisms during meat manipulation, poor hygiene of utensils and equipment, and survival of microorganisms to the cooking process. Cooking and hot-holding were considered CCPs. The results stress the importance of the implementation of a training program for nutricionists and foodhandlers and the monitoring of CCPs and other measures to prevent foodborne diseases.

Methods and patients A decision tree model of the outcomes of mandibular third molar retention and removal was constructed. Probability data for possible outcomes were obtained from a comprehensive literature review and entered into the decision tree. The cost to the NHS in treating each outcome was calculated. 100 patients attending the oral surgery clinics, University of Wales Dental Hospital rated the effect of each outcome on their own life. The cost and effectiveness data for each outcome were entered into the decision tree and the analyses were conducted by 'folding back' the decision tree based on the probabilities. Main findings Mandibular third molar retention was less costly (pound 170), more effective (69.5 effectiveness units on a 100 point scale) and more cost-effective (pound 2.43 per unit of effectiveness) than removal (pound 226, 63.3 and pound 3.57 respectively). These findings were sensitive to changes in the probability of pericoronitis, periodontal disease and caries. Principal conclusions Mandibular third molar retention is less costly to the NHS, more effective for the patient and more cost-effective to both parties than removal. However, should the likelihood of developing pericoronitis, periodontal disease and caries increase substantially then removal becomes the more cost-effective strategy.

STUDY DESIGN: A decision-tree model was used to assess the number of pediatric human immunodeficiency virus cases that would be averted if women who were unable to determine their human immunodeficiency virus serostatus antenatally were offered an intrapartum rapid human immunodeficiency virus test. Medical costs associated with the introduction of this policy were also determined. Probability and cost estimates entered into the model are based on data in the published literature. RESULTS: Under the base-case assumptions, a policy of intrapartum voluntary rapid human immunodeficiency virus testing decreases the number of cases of perinatal human immunodeficiency virus from 407 to 339 per 100,000 women without adequate prenatal care per year, with a corresponding cost savings of $6 million. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that these cost savings are maintained across a wide range of assumptions and that even conservative scenarios still result in a cost-effective policy. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of adequate prenatal care, a voluntary rapid human immunodeficiency virus test not only allows patients to fully explore their options with regard to testing and treatment but also has the potential to provide significant health benefits to women and children and economic benefits to the medical system.

Two arms were compared << no diagnosis >>, patients being treated by lipid lowering drugs in the long run, << diagnosis >>, patients being screened for thyroid disturbance mid proposed adequate correction by hormone treatment. Relevant clinical data introduced into the model were obtained from published data and from experts. At the end of the initial diagnostic patients could enter three different health states: euthyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism or overt hypothyroidism. During 30 years, patients were assumed to be seen each year by a general practitioner for clinical examination and cholesterol dosage, plus, according to the health state evolution, TSH and T4 screening. In the baseline analysis, euthyroidian patients who had a inexplicable degradation of hypercholesterolaemia control were tested for TSH and if abnormal, T4 serum: for subclinical hypothyroidian patients, TSH and T4 were measured every year. The direct costs taken into account were concerning medical supervision, drug treatment and biologic exams. Costs were analysed from the societal perspective and were expressed in 1998 French Francs (FF) with an accounting rate of 5 % by year. A sensitivity analysis was also performed. Results: the total cost at 30-year was equal to 25,006 F for << diagnosis >> strategy, to 24,390 F for << no diagnosis >> strategy. The incremental cost of the first strategy decreased according to the time horizon. It was 6.8 % at 5-year and 2.5 % at 30-year. Results were sensitive to variation in response rare of hypercholesterolaemic patients to hormone treatment of hypothyroidism (0.25 in base-case). Conclusion : The investment cost in screening and treatment of hypercholesterolemic female patient aged 55 and more can be considered offset in the long run (30 years). Considering the other important outcomes in favour of hormonal drug treatment of hypothyroidism, such as enhancement of well-being functional capacities and quality of life, the << diagnosis >> strategy can be recommended in the ambulatory medical practice.

The probablities of the clinical outcomes were based on a literature review, A survey of Norwegian rheumatologists was undertaken to explore their clinical management of dyspepsia in RA patients taking NSAIDs. Valuation of health states was based on results of the Short Form 36 health survey. Results. In female RA patients without any risk factors associated with serious gastrointestinal (GI) complications, the incremental cost of replacing diclofenac with the fixed misoprostol/diclofenac combination therapy was $72,700 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. For patients with 1 risk factor, the cost was less than $16,000, With 2 or 3 risk factors, the use of misoprostol was cost saving, The cost-effectiveness ratios in males were similar to 20% higher than in females. Conclusion. Replacing diclofenac with a fixed diclofenac/misoprostol combination is cost effective when restricted to Ri patients at increased risk of serious GI events.

For example, even though the principal steps of translation initiation in prokaryotes are known, it is difficult to point out the exact pattern of the mRNA that is recognized by the ribosome. in this study, we have carried out a systematic context analysis of the complete genome of E. coli, around codons in competition for translation initiation. Using a combinatorial approach, we first show that it is possible to accurately define the initiation site by looking for the localization of patterns representing various combinations of trinucleotides. We have combined this approach with a statistical analysis based on the frequencies of these patterns. This lends to a decision tree, able to discriminate true and false starts with a recognition level near 90%. Our method may help to precisely localize the beginning of open reading frames, and point to likely mistakes for some genes in the database. The method may be included as a component of a gene recognition system, is not restricted to a particular genome or a two-classes discrimination, and may be applied to a broader class of biological patterns.

We hypothesized that a reliable, computerized, self-administered question naire could be designed to screen for a full range of pediatric health issues and provide a comprehensive health database for pediatric patients. An age- and gender-specific pediatric questionnaire of 478 questions was formatted to elicit only a "Yes," "No," or "Not Sure" response and structured in a branched, decision-tree for-mat. The initial draft was reviewed for content by pediatric experts in Canada and the United States and revised in accordance with their suggestions. The questionnaire was divided into two modules, Medical Peds, covering biomedical issues and Prevent Peds, covering prevention, psychosocial, educational, and safety topics. Cognitive interviews were carried out with 132 parents in pediatric ambulatory care centers in Chicago and Halifax, with use of scripted and nonscripted probe questions, to ensure comprehensibility among patients with widely varying educational levels and health knowledge, Reliability was tested in 100 parents of children aged 1 month to 12 years, through use of five different test-retest sequences, Respondents' impressions were surveyed on completion of the procedure. Following content reviews, and cognitive and reliability testing, the total bank of questions was reduced to 375. As a result of the use of blanching logic, individual parents answered an average of 111 Prevent Peds and 144 Medical Peds questions. Average time required to complete the entire questionnaire was 13 minutes for Prevent Peds and 19 minutes for Med Peds. Retesting within 36 hours showed an overall 97% concordance of response pairs in the Medical Peds and Prevent Peds questionnaires. There were no statistically significant differences in test-retest reliability between different sequence formats used, (e.g., HealthQuiz followed by personal interview or HealthQuiz vs, HealthQuiz). A few questions that frequently elicited "Not Sure" responses were eliminated, As a result, the majority of questions elicited either a "Yes" or "No" response. Pediatric HealthQuiz identified a wide spectrum of child health problems that are often overlooked in routine health visits.

J	Schmitz, GPJ; Aldrich, C; Gouws, FS				Schmitz, GPJ; Aldrich, C; Gouws, FS			ANN-DT: An algorithm for extraction of decision trees from artificial neural networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						decision trees; hybrid systems; induction; neural networks; rule extraction; sensitivity analysis	KNOWLEDGE; RULES	Although artificial neural networks can represent a variety of complex systems with a high degree of accuracy, these connectionist models are difficult to interpret. This significantly limits the applicability of neural networks in practice, especially where a premium is placed on the comprehensibility or reliability of systems. A novel artificial neural-network decision tree algorithm (ANN-DT) is therefore proposed, which extracts binary decision trees from a trained neural network. The ANN-DT algorithm uses the neural network to generate outputs for samples interpolated from the training data set. In contrast to existing techniques, ANN-DT can extract rules from feedforward neural networks with continuous outputs, These rules are extracted from the neural network without making assumptions about the internal structure of the neural network or the features of the data. A novel attribute selection criterion based on a significance analysis of the variables on the neural-network output is examined, It is shown to have significant benefits in certain cases when compared with the standard criteria of minimum weighted variance over the branches, In three case studies the ANN-DT algorithm compared favorably with CART, a standard decision tree algorithm.

These models map process measurements to product quality. They are used for product and process design, addressing material and processing issues, and defining the operating window and its robustness. The models are developed based on data from designed and other experiments. Linear regression, decision tree induction, nonlinear regression, as well as "stepwise neural networks" were used for feature selection and model comparison. The final model consists of a neural network with three inputs, one hidden layer and five outputs, modeling five critical to quality variables (CTQ's) simultaneously with high accuracy, The neural network was visualized for validation and insight.

J	Shah, S; Sastry, PS				Shah, S; Sastry, PS			New algorithms for learning and pruning oblique decision trees	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART C-APPLICATIONS AND REVIEWS			English	Article						learning; linear separability; optimization; tree induction; tree pruning		In this paper, we present methods for learning and pruning oblique decision trees, We propose a new function for evaluating different split rules at each node while growing the decision tree. Unlike the other evaluation functions currently used in literature (which are all based on some notion of purity of a node), this new evaluation function is based on the concept of degree of linear separability, We adopt a correlation-based optimization technique called the Alopex algorithm for finding the split rule that optimizes our evaluation function at each node. The algorithm we present here is applicable only for 2-class problems. Through empirical studies, we demonstrate that our algorithm learns good compact-decision trees. We suggest a representation scheme for oblique decision trees that makes explicit the fact that an oblique decision tree represents each class as a union of convex sets bounded by hyperplanes in the feature space. Using this representation, we present a new pruning technique. Unlike other pruning techniques, which generally replace heuristically selected subtrees of the original tree by leaves, our method can radically restructure the decision tree. Through empirical investigation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

This study was conducted from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) hospital sector. Design: We used our previously reported trial as the clinical basis for the analysis (see Participants and interventions). These data were combined with resource utilisation data, enabling us to construct a decision tree model of the treatment paths attributable to managing patients in each arm of the trial. The model was used to calculate the cost effectiveness of using amphotericin B plus G-CSF compared to amphotericin B monotherapy in neutropenic patients with a presumed deep-seated fungal infection. Setting: An adult leukaemia/bone marrow transplant (BMT) unit in a large UK teaching hospital. Participants: Patients with a neutrophil count of <0.5 x 10(9)/L and having a presumed deep-seated fungal infection after either chemotherapy or stem cell/bone marrow transplantation for haematological malignancy. Interventions: 29 patients received intravenous amphotericin B (1 mg/kg daily) plus subcutaneous G-CSF (3 to 5 mu g/kg daily) and 30 patients received intravenous amphotericin B (1 mg/kg daily) monotherapy. The clinical trial showed that 62% of patients responded to antifungal treatment with amphotericin B plus G-CSF compared to 33% of patients who responded to amphotericin B monotherapy (p = 0.027). Nonresponders went on to receive a lipid formulation of amphotericin B. Main outcome measure and results: The mean cost per patient treated with amphotericin B plus G-CSF was pound 11 247 and the corresponding cost for amphotericin B monotherapy was pound 14 317 (1996/1997 values) - a cost reduction of pound 3070 per patient. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the addition of G-CSF to conventional amphotericin B in the treatment of a presumed deep-seated fungal infection offers not only clinical benefits, but cost benefits which are robust to changes in clinical and economic parameters. Conclusion: From a UK hospital perspective, amphotericin a plus G-CSF is cost effective compared with amphotericin B monotherapy in managing a presumed deep-seated fungal infection in neutropenic patients. This result should provide strong arguments to clinicians and policy-matters for the adoption of this treatment strategy in such patients.

This work, briefly summarized here, used stochastic decision trees trained on phonetic and linguistic features, and was applied to the DARPA North American Business News read-speech ASR task. More recently, the ICSI spontaneous-speech phonetically transcribed corpus was collected at the behest of the 1996 and 1997 LVCSR Summer Workshops held at Johns Hopkins University. A 1997 workshop (WS97) group focused on pronunciation inference from this corpus for application to the DoD Switchboard spontaneous telephone speech ASR task. We describe several approaches taken there. These include (1) one analogous to the AT&T approach, (2) one, inspired by work at WS96 and CMU, that involved adding pronunciation variants of a sequence of one or more words ('multiwords') in the corpus (with corpus-derived probabilities) into the ASR lexicon, and (1 + 2) a hybrid approach in which a decision-tree model was used to automatically phonetically transcribe a much larger speech corpus than ICSI and then the multiword approach was used to construct an ASR recognition pronunciation lexicon.

Deem comparing the medical costs of a diagnosis by means of a traditional method (ONAST) to a new and quicker method (RAST). The conclusion is that, the traditional method proofs tp be more expensive regarding different types of costs. A goal of this analysis was to prove the results of this US study for an application in the German health care system. square Methods: A cost efficacy analysis by means of a decision tree was carried out measuring the costs using the surviving of patients as a parameter. As in the RAST group 24 out of 273 and in the ONAST group 46 in 300 persons died, the efficacy rates amount to 0.912 and 0.847, respectively. Finally, sensitivity analyses were performed. square Results: Results of total (direct and indirect) costs per surviving patient showed an advantage of the RAST procedure amounting to DM 3,653 (28.3%) compared to the ONAST procedure. From the perspective of a German sickness fund, the RAST procedure leads to a saving potential of about DM 2,671 (13.0%) in comparison to the ONAST procedure. As a result, a minimum of 10 patients a year are required to save costs front the perspective of the hospital. If costs for drugs in the RAST procedure amount to DM 8,764.93, equality of total costs is obtained. This case is rather unlikely. square Conclusion: From both perspectives of the payer as well as that of the hospital it can be concluded that the rapid method is more cost-effective than the overnight method.

Only 20-30% of monozygotic twin pairs are concordant for the disease. So far, more than 20 different risk genes have been identified on different chromosomes. The dominating risk genes differ with different age at onset and also in different populations. Thus, the aetiology of the disease is complex, with interactions between different risk genes and environmental risk factors. Several pathogenetic models have been proposed, most of which include autoimmune destruction mechanisms. Screening for genetic markers for diseases with such complex aetiology encounters pitfalls due to the low predictive value of each single marker in the general population. To overcome such problems combinations of markers and decision-tree analysis are necessary. The identification of several immune markers for the disease has provided potential for screening for secondary prevention When increasing the number of markers to increase the predictive value, sensitivity will be lost. A Swedish population based study found the best combined positive predictive value in the general population to be 20%, whereas the sensitivity was only 34%. Type diabetes still needs more precise risk markers in addition to a very safe prevention strategy before neonatal screening programmes may be instituted.

This correspondence describes a type of fuzzy intervals implemented in the HCV (Version 2.0) rule induction software (referred to as HCV hereafter) for the interpretation of rule induction results when rules with sharp intervals do not clearly apply to a test example at hand. A battery of experimental results with HCV show that these fuzzy intervals are useful.

J	Suarez, A; Lutsko, JF				Suarez, A; Lutsko, JF			Globally optimal fuzzy decision trees for classification and regression	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						automatic learning; decision trees; fuzzy set theory; global optimization; backpropagation; nonparametric regression; classification	CLASSIFIERS; ALGORITHM; DESIGN	A fuzzy decision tree is constructed by allowing the possibility of partial membership of a point in the nodes that make up the tree structure. This extension of its expressive capabilities transforms the decision tree into a powerful functional approximant that incorporates features of connectionist methods, while remaining easily interpretable. Fuzzification is achieved by superimposing a fuzzy structure over the skeleton of a CART decision tree. A training rule for fuzzy trees, similar to backpropagation in neural networks, is designed. This rule corresponds to a global optimization algorithm that fixes the parameters of the fuzzy splits. The method developed for the automatic generation of fuzzy decision trees is applied to both classification and regression problems. In regression problems, it is seen that the continuity constraint imposed by tt-re function representation of the fuzzy tree leads to substantial improvements in the quality of the regression and limits the tendency to overfitting. In classification, fuzzification provides a means of uncovering the structure of the probability distribution for the classification errors in attribute space. This allows the identification of regions for which the error rate of the tree is significantly tower than the average error rate, sometimes even below the Bayes misclassification rate.

J	Braue, EH				Braue, EH			Development of a reactive topical skin protectant	JOURNAL OF APPLIED TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						topical skin protectant; decontamination; sulfur mustard; S-330; ICD 2701; ICD 2837		The use of a topical skin protectant (TSP) as a means of protecting troops from percutaneous chemical warfare agent (CWA) exposure has been proposed since these weapons were first used during World War I. The TSP is applied to vulnerable skin surfaces prior to entry into a chemical combat area. In 1990, the US Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense transferred two non-reactive TSPs into advanced development. Following US Food and Drug Administration approval, the final product is expected to be available to soldiers in 1999, A continuing research effort is designed to develop a second-generation TSP that will increase effectiveness and also decontaminate CWAs into non-toxic products, We identified a list of 29 reactive moieties as potential additives to the TSP formulation, All candidate formulations are evaluated in a decision tree network, consisting of a series of 11 efficacy testing models, A prototype formulation (ICD 2701) containing the reactive ingredient S-330 has dramatically improved the protection against saturated sulfur mustard vapor. In addition, we have discovered a compound (ICD 2837) that significantly increases the skin's natural resistance to CWA penetration. Our goal is to transfer a significantly improved TSP formulation into advanced development by 1999.

J	Messmer, BT; Bunke, H				Messmer, BT; Bunke, H			A decision tree approach to graph and subgraph isomorphism detection	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						graph isomorphism; subgraph isomorphism; tree search; decision tree; indexing	3-D OBJECTS; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM; RELAXATION; VISION; MODEL	A new approach to the problem of graph and subgraph isomorphism detection from an input graph to a database of model graphs is proposed in this paper. It is based on a preprocessing step in which the model graphs are used to create a decision tree. At run time, subgraph isomorphisms are detected by means of decision tree traversal. If we neglect the time needed for preprocessing, the computational complexity of the new graph algorithm is only polynomial in the number of input graph vertices. In particular, it is independent of the number of model graphs and the number of edges in any of the graphs. However, the decision tree is of exponential size. Several pruning techniques which aim at reducing the size of the decision tree are presented. A computational complexity analysis of the new method is given and its behavior is studied in a number of practical experiments with randomly generated graphs. (C) 1999 Pattern Recognition Society.

A genetic algorithm is used to query the trained network and extract prototypes. A prototype selection mechanism is then used to select a subset of the prototypes. Finally, a standard induction method like ID3 or C5.0 is used to extract the decision tree. The extracted decision trees can be used to understand the working of the neural network besides performing classification. This method is able to extract different decision trees of high accuracy and comprehensibility from the trained neural network. (C) 1999 Pattern Recognition Society.

J	Nagabhushan, P; Pai, RM				Nagabhushan, P; Pai, RM			Modified region decomposition method and optimal depth decision tree in the recognition of non-uniform sized characters - An experimentation with Kannada characters	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						character recognition; Kannada characters; region decomposition; bricks; horizontal extension; vertical extension; learning; optimal depth decision tree	CHINESE CHARACTERS	In contrast to English alphabets, some characters in Indian languages such as Kannada, Hindi, Telugu may have either horizontal or vertical or both the extensions making it difficult to enclose every such character in a standard rectangular grid as done quite often in character recognition research. In this work, an improved method is proposed for the recognition of such characters (especially Kannada characters), which can have spread in vertical and horizontal directions. The method uses a standard sized rectangle which can circumscribe standard sized characters. This rectangle can be interpreted as a two-dimensional, 3 x 3 structure of nine parts which we define as bricks. This structure is also interpreted as consecutively placed three row structures of three bricks each or adjacently placed three column structures of three bricks each. It is obvious that non-uniform sized characters cannot be contained within the standard rectangle of nine bricks. The work presented here proposes to take up such cases. If the character has horizontal extension, then the rectangle is extended horizontally by adding one column structure of three bricks at a time, until the character is encapsulated. Likewise, for vertically extended characters, one row structure is added at a time. For the characters which are smaller than the standard rectangle, one column structure is removed at a time till the character fits in the shrunk rectangle. Thus, the character is enclosed in a rectangular structure of m x n bricks where m greater than or equal to 3 and n greater than or equal to 1. The recognition is carried out intelligently by examining certain selected bricks only instead of all Inn bricks. The recognition is done based on an optimal depth logical decision tree developed during the Learning phase and does not require any mathematical computation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper responds to that call by demonstrating a distributional approach that draws upon human data to derive potency estimates and to identify and quantify important sources of uncertainty. The approach is rooted in the science of decision analysis and employs an influence diagram, a decision tree, probabilistic weights, and a distribution of point estimates of carcinogenic potency. Its results estimate the likelihood of different carcinogenic risks (potencies) for a chemical under a specific scenario. For this exercise, human data on formaldehyde were employed to demonstrate the approach. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the relative impact of specific levels and alternatives on the potency distribution. The resulting potency estimates are compared with the results of an exercise using animal data on formaldehyde. The paper demonstrates that distributional risk assessment is readily adapted to situations in which epidemiologic data serve as the basis for potency estimates. Strengths and weaknesses of the distributional approach are discussed. Areas for further application and research are recommended.

J	Oh, CH; Schweitzer, ME; Spettell, CM				Oh, CH; Schweitzer, ME; Spettell, CM			Internal derangements of the shoulder: decision tree and cost-effectiveness analysis of conventional arthrography, conventional MRI, and MR arthrography	SKELETAL RADIOLOGY			English	Article						shoulder, arthrography; shoulder, comparative studies; shoulder, injury; shoulder, MRI	ROTATOR CUFF TEARS; GLENOID LABRUM; FOLLOW-UP; DIAGNOSIS; ECHO; ACCURACY; IMAGES; CT	Purpose. In a patient with internal derangement of the shoulder, the diagnostic method of choice is controversial. Conventional arthrography can diagnose most rotator cuff tears accurately; however, in many institutions MR arthrography is usually necessary to diagnose labral tears. We utilized decision tree methodology to compare the cost-effectiveness of conventional arthrography and conventional MRI with a hypothetical algorithm in which a patient underwent arthrography, performed with admired gadolinium, which if negative, was followed by MRI. Design. The use of double-contrast arthrography alone, conventional MRI alone, and gadoliniuIn-enhanced MRI used as an adjunct to conventional arthrography were modeled for the diagnosis of full-thickness rotator cuff tears (RCT), partial RCTs, labral tears, and the absence of cuff/labral tears using decision analysis methodology. English language medical publications were searched to determine the base probabilities for the accuracy of the diagnostic tests. The outcome utilities ranged from -1 to +1 to reflect the value of correct diagnostic evaluation. Charges for diagnostic tests and appropriate surgical treatments were based on 1997 Medicare reimbursement rates for professional fees and hospital charges in an outpatient setting. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the effects of uncertainty regarding the prevalence of each disease state and the accuracy of several diagnostic tests. Results. In the base-case analysis, the average effectiveness of double-contrast arthrography alone, MRI alone and arthrography selectively followed by MRI were 0.6610, 0.6715, and 0.7204, respectively. The average costs for each of these strategies were $1090, $2033, and $2339, respectively. Conclusion. Arthrography performed with admired diluted gadolinium, which if negative is immediately followed by MRI, was somewhat more expensive than conventional MRI. However, because of much greater effectiveness, cost-effectiveness was significantly higher for our proposed algorithm. Conventional arthrography without gadolinium, although less expensive, had severely limited effectiveness.

J	Amann, RP				Amann, RP			Issues affecting commercialization of sexed sperm	THERIOGENOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Current Status of Sexing Mammalian Sperm	JAN   08, 2000	MAASTRICHT, NETHERLANDS			sexing sperm; biotechnology; economics	SPERMATOZOA; MOTILITY	A decision tree for genetics or sperm-sexing entities considering sales of sexed sperm is discussed in terms of: (a) how best to avoid harm; (b) how best to do good; (c) needed synergy with other assisted reproductive technologies; (d) constraints on biotechnology; and (e) costs with current and likely technologies versus potential benefits to producers. The sexed-sperm industry might wish to take a pro-active stance on societal issues potentially affecting use of sexed sperm. For most sales in animal agriculture, cost of added value must be <50% of benefit. Cost is less important for emotionally-driven uses with horses and human beings. Current procedures for flow-sorting allow most sperm to retain their fertilizing potential. Added cost to produce and package 2 x 10(6) sperm is estimated at US $30 to US $46 with flow sorted sperm. Estimating cost of any alternative technology is premature. For IVF/embryo transfer (ET), cost and numbers of flow-sorted sexed sperm are appropriate for commercial use. For use in low-dose AI, however, added cost to supply one insemination dose must be near US $12. Flow-sorting instruments with higher throughput and lower purchase and operating costs are obligatory for economic application in most AI situations. Developers of antibody-based separations also will face issues of retention of fertilizing potential while minimizing cell loss, separation of living from dead sperm concurrent with sperm sexing, output, and cost. To benefit producers and consumers in a changing world, genetics and sperm-sexing companies will have to collaborate and interface to provide funding for needed research and development and to recover these costs, using mechanisms not yet obvious.

The exclusion test, using linked markers, ensures the parent's wish not to know because the parent's risk is not changed, When mutation analysis became available in 1993, new testing options for 25% at-risk persons emerged: viz., the exclusion-definitive test and direct mutation analysis. These new tests not only disclose the risk of the test candidate, but may also change the risk of the at-risk parent and siblings. The testing options for 25% at-risk test applicants and their consequences are discussed and the testing procedures and results of testing 64 25% at-risk persons in the period 1987 to 1997 are described.

J	Nielsen, TT				Nielsen, TT			Characterization of fire regimes in the Experiment for Regional Sources and Sinks of Oxidants (EXPRESSO) Study Area	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							BIOMASS; VEGETATION; DYNAMICS; SAVANNA	Temporal and spatial distribution patterns of detected fire affected pixels within the Experiment for Regional Sources and Sinks of Oxidants (EXPRESSO) window from 1994 to 1997 were analyzed, and key parameters for describing the fire regime for each season were determined. The parameters were three temporal parameters and five spatial parameters. The spatial parameters were shown to be highly correlated, while the temporal parameters only show low correlation coefficients. The spatial parameters were transformed into the first principal component which was used for subsequent analyses. The temporal parameters were used in a decision tree classification to classify fire regimes, based on the onset of the season, the steepness of a hypothetical logistical curve, and the length of the fire season. This classification resulted in three generic fire regime types; rapid increase regime, late fire regime, and prolonged fire regime. By a combination of temporal generic fire regime types with the first principal component, representing most of the variance in the spatial parameters, the fire regimes of the EXPRESSO window were classified into 12 different regimes. These fire regimes were found to be correlated to the general vegetation types, and it was found that, even though interannual fluctuations in the fire regime existed, the major part of the EXPRESSO window is affected by low and, average intensity rapidly increasing fire regimes and that the late and prolonged fire regimes occur mainly in the southeastern parts of the EXPRESSO window. Furthermore, it is shown that the spatial extent of the fire regimes is controlled by vegetation zone characteristics.

However, existing boosting theorems for decision tree learning allow only binary-branching trees and the generalisation to multi-branching trees is not immediate. Practical decision tree algorithms, such as CART and C4.5, implement a trade-off between the number of branches and the improvement in tree quality as measured by an index function. Here we give a boosting justification for a particular quantitative trade-off curve. Our main theorem states, in essence, that if we require an improvement proportional to the log of the number of branches then top-down greedy construction of decision trees remains an effective boosting algorithm.

Two of the four predictive models are based on machine learning techniques - neural networks and decision trees, while the third and fourth are statistical approaches -- multiple discriminant analysis and logistic regression. Three different feature selection methods ANOVA, principal component, and computation plus human judgement are used for prediction. From our empirical study, we found, as far as the total accuracy is concerned, the machine learning methods - neural networks and decision trees performed best. For feature selection, we found computation and human judgement feature selection, with just 3 variables, gave the best result on average. If we also take into account failed prediction accuracy, time consumption and easy of use, then discriminant analysis is a very competitive model in the prediction of corporate failure.

In this paper, the same learning framework is applied to decision tree classifiers. In T-step, an ensemble of decision trees is constructed with bootstrapping training data sets, rn O-step, one generate "virtual" data each of whose target class label is determined by observing the member trees' output labels for an input which is generated by adding some gaussian noises into training input attributes. These virtual data added to the training data set and the two steps are repeatedly executed. The virtual data function as a regularization penalty for making classifiers smooth and therefore prevent them from being overfitted to their training data. The experiments using sia: publicly available data sets from Statlog project and UCI repository show that the proposed algorithm gives better classification performance than Bagging algorithm.

As opposed to the development of new similarity metrics, the approach uses multiple existing metrics to-build a "collection of experts" model that performs better than the single best metric. Decision tree induction is the data-driven learning method chosen. The model is shown to perform well on data intended to be representative of the problem domain of classifying graphs derived from objects extracted from both still and moving images.

The various modes of transport are required to be integrated in such a way that each mode supplements the other. Assessment of parking requirement for the commuter demand at the MRT is a difficult and sensitive job. Difficult, because getting to estimate the modal split of the feeder trips requires very detailed analysis and sensitive because the acquisition of land will be based on the demand estimated. Delhi where the population is growing at a fast pace and there being scarcity of land, acquiring land for the purpose of traffic integration requires justification on the basis of a mathematical model. Thus st need to develop a parking model was felt. The interchange mode depends on the distance of the interchange trip and availability of modes. The distribution of interchange trips is an output of the assignement model developed to get the ridership on the MRTS. The relationship between distance and mode of the interchange trip was worked out. One of the most critical estimates is the proportion of walk, especially when it is a high proportion. The allocation between other modes is less critical, as parking requirements partly compensate. The data from Stated Preferences Survey revealed that only 6 % of travellers found it acceptable to walk more that, 1, 000 meters. This distribution was used for further analysis. Availability of modes depends on the trip end and station locality. Private modes are only available at the production trip end (i.e. home). Certain hired modes are not available at all stations, and this was also been taken into account. The commuters were divide into vehicle owning and non-vehicle owning. The vehicle owning decision tree is only available to travellers from non-vehicle owning households and to all trip attractions. The hired modes are further split between taxi, auto rickshaw and cycle rickshaw. While the split is based on estimated ratios, it may be noted that the area requirement is not particularly sensitive to the exact ratios, as an increase in the area a the area requirement of one mode is partly offset by a decrease of trips on road over the day to obtain a value for each hour. It was also disaggregated by two purposes - work/education and other. Distributions of parking times (between outward and return trips) were also assigned by trip purpose, with work/education having a longer average stay than other. The model performed a Furness-type procedure to obtain agreement between the arrival/departure profiles and the parking times. Vehicle occupancy and area required per mode further formed input to the model. The area rates include an allowance for circulation, but in some cases different areas may be needed, depending on the specific site layout. For buses, in particular, the type of operation will affect the area requirement. Turn-round time will depend on the passenger and driver facilities, the number of services using a bay, intensity of operation, provision of pedestrian bridges or underpasses to stances, etc.	RITES, New Delhi, India	Madhugiri, A (reprint author), RITES, New Delhi, India.						*RITES, 1995, DET PROJ REP INT FAC	1	0	0	A A BALKEMA PUBLISHERS	LEIDEN	SCHIPHOLWEG 107C, PO BOX 447, 2316 XC LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS		90-5809-128-7				2000							515	521				7	Engineering, Civil; Transportation	Engineering; Transportation	BQ14B	WOS:000087286800081

The result or decision model is represented in hierarchical manner, where the significance or contribution of single attribute to final decision is shown very clearly. When the decision tree is built upon real-world data this data is more often numeric than discrete. While, it is in human nature to better use the words than numbers in order to describe something the fuzzy logic theory, was introduced to fill this gay. Description of the attribute properties using fuzzy logic approach is represented by vector of plausibility where the coordinates between 0 and 1 show the plausibility of attribute to its subsets of possible attribute values. This is the way to successfully overcome the problem of boundary values between attribute subsets where the sharp determined boundaries can incorrectly affect the final result a lot. In Laboratory for system design we have developed the software tool for building the decision trees with fuzzy heuristics function. The tool was used upon the data collected from breastfeeding booklet and the results are used for developing different advisory systems for health-care professionals as well as for breastfeeding support groups and mothers who have access to Internet.

The system exploits the characteristics of the gray level histogram of the road to detect lane markers. Each lane marker is then analyzed using a decision tree and finally the relations between lane markers are analyzed to create structures defining the lane boundaries. The resulting system also generates images that can be used as preprocessing stages in lane detection, lane tracking or obstacle detection algorithms. The system runs in realtime at rates of about 30 Hz.	Gen Dynam Robot Syst, Westminster, MD 21157 USA	Gonzalez, JP (reprint author), Gen Dynam Robot Syst, Westminster, MD 21157 USA.

Transportat Res Board				The utility-maximizing framework-in particular, the logit model-is the dominantly used framework in transportation demand modeling. Computational process modeling has been introduced as an alternative approach to deal with the complexity of activity-based models of travel demand. Current rule-based systems, however, lack a methodology to derive rules from data. The relevance and performance of data-mining algorithms that potentially can provide the required methodology are explored. In particular, the C4 algorithm is applied to derive a decision tree for transport mode choice in the context of activity scheduling from a large activity diary data set. The algorithm is compared with both an alternative method of inducing decision trees (CHAID) and a logit model on the basis of goodness-of-fit on the same data set. The ratio of correctly predicted cases of a holdout sample is almost identical for the three methods. This suggests that for data sets of comparable complexity, tire accuracy of predictions does not provide grounds for either rejecting or choosing the C4 method. However, the method may have advantages related to robustness. Future research is required to determine the ability of decision tree-based models in predicting behavioral change.

In our model, two parties owning confidential databases wish to run a data mining algorithm on the union of their databases, without revealing any unnecessary information, This problem has many practical and important applications, such as in medical research with confidential patient records. Data mining algorithms are usually complex, especially as the size of the input is measured in megabytes, if not gigabytes. A generic secure multi-party computation solution, based on evaluation of a circuit computing the algorithm on the entire input, is therefore of no practical use. We focus on the problem of decision tree learning and use ID3, a popular and widely used algorithm for this problem. We present a solution that is considerably more efficient than generic solutions. It demands very few rounds of communication and reasonable bandwidth. In our solution, each party performs by itself a computation of the same order as computing the ID3 algorithm for its own database. The results are then combined using efficient cryptographic protocols, whose overhead is only logarithmic in the number of transactions in the databases. We feel that our result is a substantial contribution, demonstrating that secure multi-party computation can be made practical, even for complex problems and large inputs.

However, they may fail in discovering effective knowledge when the input dataset consists of a large number of uncorrelated many-valued attributes. In this paper we present an algorithm, Noah, that tackles this problem by applying a multivariate search. Performing a multivariate search leads to a much larger consumption of computation time and memory, this may be prohibitive for large datasets. We remedy this problem by exploiting effective pruning strategies and efficient data structures. We applied our algorithm to a real marketing application of cross-selling. Experimental results revealed that the application database was too complex for C4.5 as it failed to discover any useful knowledge. The application database was also too large for various well known rule discovery algorithms which were not able to complete their task. The pruning techniques used in Noah are general in nature and can be used in other mining systems.

This method is designed for practical attributive data such as customer data on age, income, occupation, and so on. Although conventional BP classifiers have been applied to attributive data, no decision procedure for appropriate neural network topology has yet been established to reliably obtain a good classification performance. The proposed method decides the neural network topology according to the results of a linear discriminant analysis as a preprocess. From numerical simulations using credit scoring data, the method showed a good generalization ability and a higher classification performance for completely unknown data than a decision tree.

Typically, a graph representing an unknown pattern is matched with a database of models. If the database of model graphs is large, an additional factor in induced into the overall complexity of the matching process. Various techniques for reducing the influence of this additional factor have been described in the literature. In this paper we propose to extract simple features from a graph and use them to eliminate candidate graphs from the database. The most powerful set of features and a decision tree useful for candidate elimination are found by means of the C4.5 algorithm, which was originally proposed for inductive learning of classification rules. Experimental results are reported demonstrating that efficient candidate elimination can be achieved by the proposed procedure.

Although this problem has been heavily studied from the perspective of worst-case query time, there has been surprisingly little theoretical work on expected-case query time. We are given an n-vertex planar polygonal subdivision S satisfying some weak assumptions (satisfied, for example, by all convex subdivisions). We are to preprocess this into a data structure so that queries can be answered efficiently. We assume that the two coordinates of each query point are generated independently by a probability distribution also satisfying some weak assumptions (satisfied, for example, by the uniform distribution). In the decision tree model of computation, it is well-known from information theory that a lower bound on the expected number of comparisons is entropy(S). We provide two data structures, one of size O(n(2)) that can answer queries in 2 entropy(S) + O(1) expected number of comparisons, and another of size O(n) that can answer queries in (4 + O(1/root log n)) entropy(S) + O(1) expected number of comparisons. These structures can be built in O(n(2)) and O(n log n) time respectively. Our results are based on a recent result due to Arya and Fu, which bounds the entropy of overlaid subdivisions.

Also, unlabeled data are abundant. We investigate in this paper the design of learning algorithms from positive and unlabeled data only. Many machine learning and data mining algorithms use examples for estimate of probabilities. Therefore, we design an algorithm which is based on positive statistical queries (estimates for probabilities over the set of positive instances) and instance statistical queries (estimates for probabilities over the instance space). Our algorithm guesses the weight of the target concept (the ratio of positive instances in the instance space) with the help of a hypothesis testing algorithm. It is proved that any class learnable in the Statistical Query model [Kea93] such that a lower bound on the weight of any target concept f can be estimated in polynomial time is learnable from positive statistical queries and instance statistical queries only. Then, we design a decision tree induction algorithm POSC4.5, based on C4.5 (Qui93), using only positive and unlabeled examples. We also give experimental results for this algorithm.

Unlike worst-case approaches, we do not rely on bounds that hold for all possible learning problems. Instead, we study the behavior of a learning algorithm for a given problem, taking properties of the problem and the learner into account. The solution depends only on known quantities (e.g., the sample size), and the histogram of error rates in the model class which we determine for the case that the sought target is a randomly drawn Boolean function. We then discuss how the error histogram can be estimated from a given sample and thus show how the analysis can be applied approximately in the more realistic scenario that the target is unknown. Experiments show that our analysis can predict the behavior of decision tree algorithms fairly accurately even if the error histogram is estimated from a sample.

Attempts to minimise losses due to this risk involve the lender in detection and mitigation activities which are expensive in terms of staff cost, and may be inconsistently performed. This paper explores the possibility of reducing both the cost of risk management, and the percentage of loan monies lost, by means of the introduction of Artificial Intelligence support for these risk management activities. A data sample drawn from a lending organisation's operational databases is analysed by decision tree induction, in order to identify case features associated with instances of loss. A k-nearest: neighbour algorithm is then devised, using these features both to rank cases in order of risk, and to enable case-based reasoning support to the formulation of a risk mitigation plan. A proposal is presented, for the trial implementation of the risk management support tools which have been created. This proposal provides for the critical evaluation and assessment of these tools, both against each other and against the status quo. In the best of the trials conducted, minimal overlap occurred at score 41, with 9% of bads scoring 41 and above, compared to 73% of goods. This result is equivalent to misclassifications of 9% "bad-as-good" and 27% "good-as-bad" for a rule "If the score is 41 or over, the classification is good".

Most variants of decision trees test a single attribute at a node, leading to axis-parallel trees, where the test results in a hyperplane which is parallel to one of the dimensions in the attribute space. These trees can be rather large and inaccurate in cases where the concept to be learned is best approximated by oblique hyperplanes. In such cases, it may be more appropriate to use an oblique decision tree, where the decision at each node is a linear combination of the attributes. Oblique decision trees have not gained wide popularity in part due to the complexity of constructing good oblique splits and the tendency of existing splitting algorithms to get stuck in local minima. Several alternatives have been proposed to handle these problems including randomization in conjunction with deterministic hill-climbing and the use of simulated annealing. In this paper, we use evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to determine the split. EAs are well suited for this problem because of their global search properties, their tolerance to noisy fitness evaluations, and their scalability to large dimensional search spaces. We demonstrate our technique on a synthetic data set, and then we apply it to a practical problem from astronomy, namely, the classification of galaxies with a bent-double morphology. In addition, we describe our experiences with several split evaluation criteria. Our results suggest that, in some cases, the evolutionary approach is faster and more accurate than existing oblique decision tree algorithms. However, for our astronomical data, the accuracy is not significantly different than the axis-parallel trees.

Typical pruning algorithms require retraining the network which incurs additional cost. This paper presents FERNN, a fast method for extracting rules from trained neural networks without network retraining. Given a fully connected trained feedforward network with a single hidden layer, FERNN first identifies the relevant hidden units by computing their information gains. For each relevant hidden unit, its activation values is divided into two subintervals such that the information gain is maximized. FERNN finds the set of relevant network connections from the input units to this hidden unit by checking the magnitudes of their weights. The connections with large weights are identified as relevant. Finally, FERNN generates rules that distinguish the two subintervals of the hidden activation values in terms of the network inputs. Experimental results show that the size and the predictive accuracy of the tree generated are comparable to those extracted by another method which prunes and retrains the network.

B	Achten, HH		Gero, JS		Achten, HH			Design case retrieval by generic representations	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN DESIGN '00			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Design (AID 00)	2000	WORCESTER, MA					Case-Based Reasoning and Case-Based Design have been proposed to utilize knowledge of previous design solutions to understand or solve current design problems. Case retrieval is often performed on the basis of verbal indexing systems, whereas in design the use of graphic representations is predominant. Case retrieval therefore, requires verbalization from the designer, which can interrupt the flow of thought during design. This paper aims to demonstrate how the theoretical work on generic representations in architectural design can form a graphic indexing scheme for cases that are graphic representations. The paper outlines three techniques: a decision-tree for graphic unit recognition, a query composition algorithm, and a lookup table for case retrieval. These three techniques are worked out in the context of a Case-Based Design Aid System.

However, their most standard algorithms do not deal with uncertainty, especially the cognitive one. In this paper, we develop a method to adapt the decision tree technique to the case where the object's classes are not exactly known, and where the uncertainty about the class' value is represented by a belief function. The adaptation concerns both the construction of the tree and its use to classify new objects characterized by uncertain attribute values.

Parna can be recognised on the basis of colour, texture, distributional patterns, and pedology. Parna deposits have been recorded across a wide area of south eastern Australia and have influenced the local pedology and hydrology. In some cases parna has increased soil sodicity and the potential for dryland salinisation. Predicting its spatial distribution is useful when considering agricultural potential and in assessing the risk and spatial spread of dryland salinity. Here we present the results of modelling to predict its local distribution in an area covering 291 km(2) in the Young district of NSW. Two conceptual models of parna deposition and subsequent redistribution were used to develop a current parna distribution map: (a) deposition = f(topography, aspect) after assuming that interactions of rainfall, vegetation, and wind speed were relatively the same at the local scale; (b) removal or retention = (slope angle, catchment size, slope length) as a representation of the erosive energy of gravity. Five landscape variables, elevation, aspect, slope, flow accumulation, and flow length, were derived from a 20 m digital elevation model (DEM). A training set of parna deposits was established using air photos and field survey from limited exposures in the Young district of NSW. These areas were digitised and converted to a grid of areas of parna and no-parna. This training set for parna and the 5 landscape variable grids were processed in the IDRISI for WINDOWS Geographic Information System (GIS). Spatial relationships between the parna and no-parna deposits and the 5 landscape variables were extracted from this training set. This information was imported into an inductive learning program called KnowledgeSEEKER. A decision tree was built by recursive partitioning of the data set using Chi-squares to categorise variables, and an F test for continuous variables to best replicate the training data classification of 'parna' and 'no-parna'. The rules derived from this process were applied to the study area to predict the occurrence of parna in the broader landscape. Predictions were field checked and the rules adjusted until they best represented the occurrence of parna in the field. The final model showed predictions of parna deposits as follows: (i) higher elevations in the Young landscape were the dominant sites of parna deposits; (ii) thicker deposits of parna occurred on the windward south-west and northwest; (iii) thinner deposits occurred on the leeward side of a central ridge feature; (iv) because the training set concentrated around the major central ridge feature, poorer predictions were obtained on gently undulating country.

Specifically, we present a deterministic algorithm to find a minimum spanning forest; of a graph with n vertices and m edges that runs in time O(tau*(m, n)) where tau* is the minimum number of edge-weight comparisons needed to determine the solution. The algorithm is quite simple and can be implemented on a pointer machine. Although our time bound is optimal, the exact function describing it is not known at present. The current best bounds known for tau* are tau*(m, n) = Omega(m) and tau*(m, n) = O(m . alpha(m, n)), where alpha is a certain natural inverse of Ackermann's function. Even under the assumption that tau* is super-linear, we show that if the input graph is selected from G(n,m), our algorithm runs in linear time w.h.p., regardless of n, m, or the permutation of edge weights. The analysis uses a new martingale for G(n,m) similar to the edge-exposure martingale for G(n,p).

The current practice is to manually run many mold filling simulations and iteratively approach a possible solution, which can be extremely time consuming even for simple mold geometries. The new design environment enables the user to create possible disturbance scenarios, search and find a solution for them and include them into an injection controller. The location and the number of necessary sensors are automatically determined and a decision tree used by the controller for the resin injection machine is created. Optimal injection parameters are provided by another module and implemented into the injection controller based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The simulated inputs are implemented into two resin injection units using LabVIEW data acquisition software. These injection units are used with the controller to successfully fill a mold and demonstrate experimental validation.

J	Martin, JLFV				Martin, JLFV			Using genetics to extract information	BT TECHNOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article								A navel genetic approach to optimisation has been devised and applied to information retrieval. In BTGP, each query can be expressed as a Boolean decision tree. This method, based on genetic programming techniques, first generates a population of query trees. These are evaluated for a set of training cases previously chosen and altered at each generation by the genetic operators of mutation and crossover. The precision and recall rates at extracting the relevant documents and rejecting the non-relevant ones is the measure of performance. At each generation the best solutions are those that when evaluated for a different set of test documents for which the system has not been trained, give the best fitness results. Degrees of precision and recall of 90% and above are obtained.

J	Schulz, R				Schulz, R			Status of the noble crayfish Astacus astacus (L.) in Germany: Monitoring protocol and the use of RAPD markers to assess the genetic structure of populations.	BULLETIN FRANCAIS DE LA PECHE ET DE LA PISCICULTURE			English	Article						Astacus astacus; conservation genetics; freshwater decapod; geographical isolation; stocks monitoring programme	ARBITRARY PRIMERS; PCR	On the basis of a literature review and new studies in Brandenburg, northeast Germany, the status and the genetic structure of the noble crayfish Astacus astacus (L.) in Germany are described. The present situation is characterized by a patchy distribution comprising at least. 719 stocks, documented after 1990. Stocks are mainly confined to the uppermost stretches of small streams or to small lakes without connection to other surface waters. As is typical of Europe, geographical isolation, inbreeding and genetic drift may play an important role in the population structure of the noble crayfish in Germany. By means of RAPD-PCR, stocks in Brandenburg (Br1, Br2 and Br3), Schleswig-Holstein (SH) and Bavaria (B1 and B2) were analysed for their genetic structure. RAPD markers show high ability to separate significantly all investigated stocks as single populations. Mean non-dimensional distances were 5.8, 5.6 and 4.2 for SH-B, SH-Br and B-Br between-region comparisons, respectively. Values for within-region comparisons were 3.1 and 1.3 for B-B and Br-Br, respectively. However, even the three different lakes located in Brandenburg, which are only about 20 km apart from each other, contained significantly distinguishable populations. So far it is not possible to judge whether the distinct populations result from isolation of stocks or indicate local adaptations to the specific environmental conditions. The answer to this question is important with respect to conservational management and the design of restocking programmes. A decision tree for the inventory and monitoring of noble crayfish stocks is suggested, since some areas in the northeast of Germany may still contain many unknown stocks, which are of considerable importance for conservation.

Because enoxaparin and warfarin are useful for extended outpatient prophylaxis, the objective of this study was to determine which of these agents is most cost effective in preventing venous thromboembolic complications. A decision tree analysis was developed to simulate a hypothetical cohort of patients with total hip arthroplasty, The analysis considered home health care services to perform monitoring and compliance verification. Accounting for prophylactic failures and treatment complications, results showed that enoxaparin maintained a cost effective advantage over warfarin for extended prophylaxis in the time after discharge and total hip arthroplasty ranging from 19 to 31 days after the patient was discharged from the hospital. The duration of cost effectiveness of enoxaparin was reduced to 14 to 17 days when home care services were excluded. These results indicated that approximately 3 weeks of outpatient therapy with enoxaparin is cost effective.

J	Forman, R				Forman, R			Morse theory and evasiveness	COMBINATORICA			English	Article							CELL COMPLEXES	In [12] it was shown that if M is a non-contractible subcomplex of a simplex S then M is evasive. In this paper we make this result quantitative, and show that the more noncontractible M is, the more evasive it is. Recall that M is evasive if for every decision tree algorithm A there is a face sigma of S that requires that one examines all vertices of S (in the order determined by A) before one is able to determine whether or not sigma lies in M. We call such faces evaders of A. M is nonevasive if and only if there is a decision tree algorithm A with no evaders. A main result of this paper is that for any decision tree algorithm A, there is a CW complex M', homotopy equivalent to M, such that the number of cells in M' is precisely 1/2 (the number of evaders of A) +/-1, where the constant is +1 if the emptyset empty set is not an evader of A, and -1 otherwise. In particular, this implies that if there is a decision tree algorithm with no evaders, then M is homotopy equivalent to a point. This is the theorem in [12]. In fact, in [12] it was shown that if M is non-collapsible then M is evasive, and we also present a quantitative version of this more precise statement. The proofs use the discrete Morse theory developed in [6].	Rice Univ, Dept Math, Houston, TX 77251 USA	Forman, R (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Math, Houston, TX 77251 USA.

A thermoset resin is injected into a mould cavity filled with a reinforcing fibrous preform. The composite part is demoulded after the filling is completed and resin has cured. During prototype development, the design engineers may combine their manufacturing experience with simulations to decide which LCM process must be used for the selected part. For complicated mould shapes, the manufacturing engineer has to make decisions about injection pressure, flow rate, location of gates and vents, etc, to achieve a high-quality composite part which is free of dry spots. Inherent variability in the process and the possible errors in characterization of material properties, such as fibre volume fraction and permeability, challenge the manufacturing engineer to reduce the number of unacceptable parts. An on-line strategic controller with in situ sensor data can influence the flow front pattern during mould filling and drive the process towards successful completion. Some of these variabilities are considered in off-line mould filling simulations. By analysing the simulation results, the sensors are placed inside the mould to identify the variabilities and take corrective action(s) to eliminate voids. Sensor data and the control actions are cast in the form of a decision tree. Data acquisition software collects the in situ sensor data and implements the control actions from this decision tree. A case study was included in which various race-tracking and hulk permeability variations can be expected during manufacturing. The proposed controller is described in detail for this selected case study and its usefulness is verified with experiments. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

In particular we obtain an asymptotic formula, having a linear main term, for the average sensitivity of the Boolean function deciding whether a given integer is square-free. This result allows us to derive a quadratic lower bound for the formula size complexity of testing square-free numbers and a linear lower bound on the average decision tree depth. We also obtain lower bounds on the degrees of exact and approximate polynomial representations of this function.

On the one hand, it attempts to define an specific framework to make comparative studies of different statistical and machine learning methods in the context of regression analysis. On the other, it takes a specific known economics problem and apply this framework using different algorithms-OLS, neural network, decision tree, and k-nearest; neighbor. This methodology is based on the study of the error curves-the behavior of the root mean square error (RMSE) when varying the sample size and the capacity (degrees of freedom) of each analytical method. Using state-of-the art techniques we build more than 13,920 models to test the methodology by recovering a restricted version of the Black-Scholes call option pricing formula with noise-where the instantaneous standard deviation of the noise is 0.78. The results show that-given the level of noise-neural networks provide the best estimation with an average RMSE of 0.7825 for a training sample of 6,000 records. OLS is the second best with an average RMSE of 0.7861 and its first best for sample sizes smaller than 1,125. The k-Nearest Neighbor achieved, an average RMSE of 0.8380 which is comparable to the worst performer CART which attained an average RMSE of 0.8721.(1)	Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA	Flores, JG (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.

Also strata with a common rule are obtained. Common predictors and criterion variable describe population in all strata or classes of individuals. Algorithm considers strata structure in tree-building algorithm and combines in each step maximisation of an information content measure for the criterion variable in a new binary partition of the population and selection of decisional nodes, based in quality of prediction for subsets of strata. Each decisional tree node is composed of a set of strata and a rule for individuals in these strata that will jointly explain the criterion variable. Symbolic data analysis fits the method. Input of the algorithm is composed of classes of individuals. Algorithm is extended to individuals described by probabilistic symbolic objects. As output, symbolic objects describe tree, decisional nodes and strata.

To avoid generating rules with irrelevant conditions, we propose a new algorithm to remove irrelevant conditions of rules in the process of converting the decision tree to rules according to information on the decision tree. Since irrelevant conditions are removed from the resultant rules, the resultant rules are more general than those represented by the decision tree. As a side effect, the resultant rules are less likely to suffer from missing branches.

That is the basis for computer-assisted radiology development. Further development of computer-assisted radiology is associated with the use of new intelligent capabilities such as multimedia support and data mining in order to discover the relevant knowledge for diagnosis. In this paper, we present our work on data mining in medical picture archiving systems. We use decision tree induction in order to learn the knowledge for computer-assisted image analysis. We are applying our method to interpretation of x-ray images for lung cancer diagnosis. We are describing describing our methodology on how to perform data mining on picture archiving systems and our tool for data mining. Results are given. The method has shown very good results so that we are going on to apply it to other medical image diagnosis tasks such as lymph node diagnosis in MRI and investigation of breast MRI.

This paper describes our research effort on the application of a data mining technique, decision trees, to automatically learn and recognize intrusion signatures for intrusion detection. In our study, decision tree classifiers are used to classify activities in a computer and network system into different states and determine the possibility of an intrusion based on the state classification. Our design of decision tree classifiers is based on an incremental tree induction algorithm. Two decision tree classifiers are developed. One decision tree classifier examines single events of activities in a computer and network system for intrusion detection (single event version). Another decision tree classifier examines a sequence of events in a moving window at a given time for intrusion detection (moving window version). We use computer audit data for training and testing the decision tree classifiers. The testing results of the two decision tree classifiers are analyzed and compared. The "moving window" version of the decision tree classifier produces better performance in intrusion detection.

Relatively little attention has been paid to mining changes in databases collected over time. For businesses, knowing what is changing and how it has changed is of crucial importance because it allows businesses to provide the right products and services to suit the changing market needs. If undesirable changes are detected, remedial measures need to be implemented to stop or to delay such changes. In many applications, mining for changes can be more important than producing accurate models for prediction. A model, no matter how accurate, can only predict based on patterns mined in the old data. That is, a model requires a stable environment, otherwise it will cease to be accurate. However, in many business situations, constant human intervention (i.e., actions) to the environment is a fact of life. In such an environment, building a predictive model is of limited use. Change mining becomes important for understanding the behaviors of customers. In this paper, we study change mining in the contexts of decision tree classification for real-life applications.

This is of interest when one deals with massive database or with probabilistic models. We illustrate our method with a dataset describing districts of Great Britain. Our decision tree yields rules which explain the unemployment rate. The decision tree in our case is built by replacing the test X > a, which is used to split the nodes in the usual case of real numbers, by the test P(X > alpha) < beta, where alpha and beta are determined through an algorithm based on probabilistic split evaluation criteria.

The aim of this article is to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis as in real-world practice according to the findings of this clinical trial. Methods: A decision tree was used to estimate the clinical outcomes and direct costs of treating intra-abdominal infections using the two carbapenems from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service (INHS) or a private insurance company (PIC). Results: In a population of 30,000 patients with intraabdominal infections in Italy, it was estimated that 97 potential deaths/year could be avoided if these patients were treated with I/C versus meropenem. In addition, from the perspective of INHS, the total costs of treatment were estimated as ITL 106,874 million and 134,042 million for I/C and meropenem, respectively. In favor of the PIC point of view, the total costs were estimated as ITL 110,500 million and 135,899 million for I/C and meropenem, respectively. Conclusion: The treatment of intraabdominal infections with I/C is shown to be more effective (97 deaths avoided/year) and less costly than with meropenem (with a saving of ITL 27,168 and 25,393 million/year for INHS and PIC, respectively).

Because of different styles in some Persian digits, in this work they were divided into 18 classes. In recognition algorithm a heuristically designed binary decision tree recognizes the digits via a series of initiative structural features. The research aim was to choose those structural features that were useful both in terms of accuracy and speed. A set of 6180 digits was used for the test. About 93.1 percent of the digits were recognized correctly. The recognition average speed of this algorithm is 24 digits per second on a 486DX4 100MHZ.

The layout of a document contains a significant amount of information that can be used to classify a document's type in the absence of domain specific models. A document type or genre can be defined by the user based primarily on layout structure. Our classification approach is based on "visual similarity" of the layout structure by building a supervised classifier, given examples of the class. We use image features, such as the percentages of text and non-text (graphics, image, table, and ruling) content regions, column structures, variations in the point sizes of fonts, the density of content area, and various statistics on features of connected components which can be derived from class samples without class knowledge. Tn order to obtain class labels for training samples, we conducted a user relevance test where subjects ranked UW-I document images with respect to the 12 representative images. We implemented our classification scheme using the OC1, a decision tree classifier, and report our findings.

We describe a text categorization task and an experiment using documents from the Reuters and OHSUMED collections. We applied the Decision Forest classifier and compared its accuracies to those of C4.5 and kNN classifiers, using both category dependent and category independent term selection schemes. It is found that Decision Forest outperforms both C4.5 and kNN in all cases, and that category dependent term selection yields better accuracies. Performances of all three classifiers degrade from the Reuters collection to the OHSUMED collection, but Decision Forest remains to be superior.

The algorithm, that we have called EOP (Editing by Ordered Projection) has some interesting characteristics: important reduction of the number of examples from the database; lower computational cost in respect of other typical algorithms due to the absence of distance calculations; conservation of the decision boundaries, especially from the point of view of the application of axis-parallel classifiers; reduction of the decision tree size or the number of decision rules. The performance of EOP is showed by comparing the results provided by C4.5 [5] before and after applying it on databases with continuous attributes. These experiments have been realised using some databases from UCI repository [1]. The use of EOP as preprocessing method for the later application of any axis-parallel learning algorithm convert it in a valuable tool in the field of data mining.

This paper presents genetic and stochastic optimization strategies which are based on a representation of the plant by means of a modified decision tree. By taking into account hierarchical dependencies of decisions this representation guarantees that designs generated by mutation operators automatically comply with an important class of constraints. The method is explained and its potential is demonstrated with the example of an important industrial application problem: The design optimization of feed-water heater strings in fossil-fueled power plants. For the treatment of the structural and continuous design variables two strategies have been implemented and tested. The first approach considers structural decisions as the primary problem, which is solved by means of a Metropolis algorithm, and regards the optimization of the continuous variables as a subproblem, which is solved by Sequential Quadratic Programming for each generated plant structure. The second strategy is an evolutionary one-level algorithm which simultaneously optimizes both types of variables. In the design problem which is investigated here, the one-level Evolutionary computation algorithm performs slightly better than the hierarchical method. This result is explained by analyzing the objective function.

Existing BDD-based symbolic algorithms for image computation are limited by memory resources in practice, while SAT-based algorithms that can obtain the image by enumerating satisfying assignments to a CNF representation of the Boolean relation are potentially limited by time resources. We propose new algorithms that combine BDDs and SAT in order to exploit their complementary benefits, and to offer a mechanism for trading off space vs. time. In particular, (1) our integrated algorithm uses BDDs to represent the input and image sets, and a CNF formula to represent the Boolean relation, (2) a fundamental enhancement called BDD Bounding is used whereby the SAT solver uses the BDDs for the input set and the dynamically changing image set to prune the search space of all solutions, (3) BDDs are used to compute all solutions below intermediate points in the SAT decision tree, (4) a fine-grained variable quantification schedule is used for each BDD subproblem, based on the CNF representation of the Boolean relation. These enhancements coupled with more engineering heuristics lead to an overall algorithm that can potentially handle larger problems. This is supported by our preliminary results on exact reachability analysis of ISCAS benchmark circuits.

We focus on (numerical) attribute domain partitioning and decision tree pruning, which are the main subtasks in decision tree learning and, at the same time, constitute the main research problems within the field. In recent years important analytical developments in these problems have been obtained.

The prediction is made by means of a piecewise linear model (PLM), which is more flexible than the usual piecewise constant models produced by standard regression trees. The complexity of the linear predictors at the leaves is limited by using a stepwise regression procedure, which ensures that only statistically relevant attributes are included in the regression. The accuracy and robustness of the PLM regression trees are demonstrated in a series of examples, including problems with noisy data and/or irrelevant attributes.

However, for a very large data set building CART is nearly an impossible task. We argue that a tree built entirely from a large simple random sample from the data set is reasonable. In addition, we propose two new algorithms; the parabola method that relies on the property that the Gini-index is a smooth function in any continuous attribute thus allowing accurate approximation of the minimum Gini-index and the double sampling method useful when a data set is very large. Experimental results show that these two method perform extremely well.

Let us consider that all attributes are discrete. In this situation we develop a method (CIDIM) that improves any TDIDT algorithm. With this method we obtain a little tree, few rules, but a better success index than the version of the algorithm without this improvement. This method has two new characteristics: the induction process is controlled and the attribute values are grouped in a dynamic and local way during the decision tree construction. The experiences set is divided in three sets: the classical test set and, fbr constructs the tree, we split the remainder experiences in two sets. training set and control set. The training set is used for construct the tree. The control set verifies if the expansion of a node improves the prediction. This supervision is achieved by means of two indexes. In each step of the CIDIM method a node is expanded if these indexes increase.

Nearest neighbor classifiers and decision tree classifiers bused on 1,2,3-grams were constructed for NP nucleotide and amino acids strains and their classification efficiencies were compared with the groupings obtained using phylogenetic analysis. Our results show, that disregarding positional information for NP can provide almost the same high level of classification accuracy as alternative more complex classification techniques that usf positional information.

Relevance feedback is a mechanism for improving retrieval precision over time by allowing the user to implicitly communicate to the system which of these features are relevant and which are not. We propose a relevance feedback retrieval system that, for each retrieval iteration, learns a decision tree to uncover a common thread between all images marked as relevant. This tree is then used as a model for inferring which of the unseen images the user would most likely desire. I We evaluate our approach within the domain of HRCT images of the lung.

Accurate and fast classification algorithms, adaptive to different data sources and scales, will facilitate cost effective routine updating of land cover maps using current satellite imagery to monitor and detect a broad array of land cover phenomena. A new binary decision tree classifier incorporating an evolutionary genetic learning algorithm is proposed for land cover classification. The new classifier referred to as the Enhanced Binary Tree Genetic Algorithm (BTGA+) has been applied to automatically classify tens of millions of pixels in two full scenes of Landsat TM data using multispectral multitemporal radiance features. The BTGA+ classifier can assign pixels into eight land cover categories for Landsat TM scenes in central Missouri with nearly 90% classification accuracy.

Our objective was to examine the utility of time-series data to rapidly update maps of vegetation condition and land cover change in Mexico as an input to biodiversity modeling. We downloaded AVHRR NDVI 10-day composites from the USGS EROS Data Center for 1992-1993 and adjusted for cloud contamination by further aggregating the data. In the first phase of our analysis, we selected training sites for various land cover types using a land cover map created by the Mexican National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics (INEGI) as a guide. Since there is a high degree of spectral variability within many of the vegetated land cover types, we subjected the spectral response patterns to cluster analysis. We then used the statistics of the clusters as training data in a supervised classification. We also compared unsupervised and univariate decision tree approaches, but these provided unsatisfactory results. Best results were achieved with a 19-class map of land use/land cover employing a supervised approach.

The decision rules for separating these two types of change signals are referred to as the spectral trajectories of land cover changes. These trajectories, derived from samples of the two types of signals using a decision tree classifier [1], were applied to three test images. In general, the trajectory method gave accuracies slightly lower than the best accuracies achieved by thresholding difference images or principal component transformed images. While the thresholding techniques rely on human interpreters to derive appropriate threshold values, land cover change trajectories were applied to calibrated images with little human intervention. Therefore, the trajectory approach has the potential for use in operational land cover change detection. Better accuracies using this method could be achieved by refining the spectral trajectories of land cover change processes using improved global data sets generated by new sensor systems like the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS).

To meet these needs, a case study is carried out in New England. A univariate decision tree is implemented to classify IGBP land cover using MODIS-like data. Classification results are presented using different combinations of input features including NDVI, NEAR (nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectances), and NDVI+NBAR. It is shown that NBAR is the best input feature for this classification problem. The abundance of green vegetation is calculated using a constrained linear mixture modeling approach based on NBARs. Variation in green vegetation abundance within each land-cover type is analyzed at different phenological stages from July to October 1996.

The data generation process is further enhanced by incorporating the high quality rules obtained from a decision tree. Results indicate that the approach results in improved generalization, especially in difficult to learn domains.

The first technique we proposed is a neural-net based clamping technique and another is based on inductive learning algorithm - decision tree's heuristic. They are compared with a number of other techniques,i.e. automatic relevance determination(ARD), weight-product, random selection, in addition to a standard statistical technique - linear correlation analysis. The salience of the features that compose a proposed set is an important problem to solve efficiently and effectively not only for neural computing technology but also in order to provide a sound basis for any attempt to design an optimal computational system. The focus of this study is the efficiency as well as the effectiveness with which high-salience subsets of features can be identified in the context of ill-understood and potentially noisy real-world data.

The algorithm assumes that the networks have been trained with more then the necessary number of hidden units and it consists of two stages. In the first stage, redundant hidden units are removed and in the second stage, irrelevant input units are removed. Experimental results on seven publicly available data sets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other methods such as nearest neighbor-, decision tree- and regression-based methods.

Neurofuzzy systems take advantage of fuzzy logic and of the learning and approximation capabilities of neural networks to build fuzzy rule bases, while preserving the massively parallel computing character. Fuzzy decision trees provide a way to manipulate fuzzy information and continuous input/output models while maintaining the interpretability and effectiveness of classical decision trees. A combination between the two ideas is discussed, which performs a global gradient-descent type optimization of the fuzzy rules corresponding to a tree, yielding improved accuracy while maintaining interpretability.

The amount of "computation" carried out by human players is smaller by orders of magnitudes because they employ specific patterns that help them narrow the search tree. Similar approach should in principle be feasible also in computer programs. To draw attenion to this issue, we report our experiments with a program that learns to classify chessboard positions that permit the well-known bishop sacrifice at h7. We discuss some problems pertaining to the collection of training examples, their representation, and pre-classification.

The Tinted Colored Petri net is responsible for the transition of states in the decision process, establishing in time the use of resources and of heuristics that correspond to the more important managerial and operational actions for the planning activities and programming of the productive processes of an industrial plant. To negotiate with the uncertainties involved in a decision process, that in general takes care of the responsible specialist's knowledge for the routines involved in the productive system, we make use of the theory of fuzzy sets to suggest decisions logically consistent that obtain a viable solution just leading the viable states of the decision tree, that, in this case, is confused with the occurrence graph of the Petri net. As application example to the proposed model, we used a production system characterized by a port plant, whose model and simulation results are described at the end of this work.

Part 2	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						automatic visual inspection; feature selection; image classification; neural network	SURFACE-DEFECTS; BOARDS	A decision tree using smaller more specialised modular neural networks for the classification of wood veneer by an automatic visual inspection system was presented in Part 1 [1]. A key process in the design of a modular neural network is the use of "normalised inter-class variation" in the selection of the most appropriate image features to be rued for its particular specialised classification task. At the root of the decision tree is a single large (holistic) neural network that initially attempts to classify all of the image classes which include clear wood and 12 possible defects (13 classes). The initial design uses 17 features of the acquired image of the wood veneer as inputs. The selection (or more correctly pruning) of inputs for this large neural network used nor only "normalised inter-class variation", but also "normalised intra-class variation" in the features and their "correlation" within the same class. This results in the elimination of 6 inputs. The revised smaller 11 input neural network results in a substantial reduction in classification rime, for the computer implementation used here, and at the same time the classification accuracy is improved. This is the root of the decision tree described in the previous paper.

The algorithm consists of four steps, namely, a preprocessing stage for conditioning the data, a decision tree based feature extraction stage for identifying relevant features for analysis, a neural network based classification stage for identifying signals from various defect types and benign structures, and finally a blind deconvolution based characterization stage for accurately estimating the size and orientation of the detected defects. This algorithm is optimized to maximize the probability of detection (POD), while keeping the number of false alarms (PFA) at a minimum. Initial results presented in this paper look very promising and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Although design patterns have spread widely in object-oriented software design, disordered application of them often makes the design more complicated or worsens performance. In the case study, we introduce a hot-spot based approach to apply design patterns effectively. Then we quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of applying design patterns to the redesigning. The C&K metrics suite is used for the evaluation. We collect C&K metrics values for two versions of the decision tree learning system. One is a prototype version designed without using design patterns while the other redesigned using design patterns. We conduct the Mann-Whitny U-test, one of the nonparametric statistics for testing hypotheses about whether two sample values differ. As a result, we find significant differences between the C&K metrics values of the two versions. Finally we discuss the applicability of the C&K metrics to criterion for evaluation of the flexibility and extensibility of software.

The query is characterized by searching images with feature vectors similar to those of the example based upon either a default or a user-defined similarity metric. However, low level features often encounter a severe performance bottleneck as applied to natural image collections with complicated contents and great perceptual varieties. The feature-based similarity matching approach tends to retrieve many irrelevant images. This is not surprising since images different in semantic meanings but close enough in low level features can be returned as a pertinent result. Such a query process lacks user involvement and therefore results in a gap between features and semantics. In this work, a novel content-based image retrieval scheme that learns image visual similarities and semantic categories from relevance feedback is presented. First, we choose the most suitable low level features to describe images by analyzing image contents and categorize each image by predicting its semantic meanings. During the interactive retrieval process, users are allowed to confirm semantic classification of the query example and evaluate retrieval results with relevance feedback. By processing the feedback information, the system learns both image visual similarities and semantic meanings. In similarity learning, the retrieving results are refined by modifying the similarity metric. Semantic learning is performed by using the decision tree training algorithm. The system continues being updated along the retrieval procedure.

Similarly, distance learning systems on the Web should be designed to record students' behaviors to assist teachers in assessing performance and making decisions related to curriculum. Recent developments in Web server systems can record the students' access to the learning systems in Web logs. Information processing analysis on the historical classroom processes can help teachers to develop knowledge for applying proper teaching strategies according to available information in Web logs. However, teachers cannot easily infer the pedagogical meaning of Web logs and discover the pedagogical rules of students' behavior patterns in the Web logs to refine teaching strategies. Therefore, to use Web logs for pedagogical purposes, this article adopts decision tree and data cube information processing methodologies to observe students' behaviors and discover the pedagogical rules on students' learning performance from Web logs. The architecture and guidelines of utilizing the data cube and decision tree methodologies for pedagogical purposes are also presented. Consequently, teachers can efficiently estimate and explain the effectiveness of pedagogical strategies, ultimately improving instruction with decision tree and data cube software.

J	Zheng, ZJ				Zheng, ZJ			Constructing conjunctive attributes using production rules	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND PRACTICE IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						constructive induction; decision tree learning; classification; machine learning	MINIMUM DESCRIPTION LENGTH; DECISION TREES; INDUCTION	Many existing constructive decision tree learning algorithms such as Fringe and Citre construct conjunctions or disjunctions directly from paths of decision trees. This paper investigates a novel attribute construction method for decision tree learning It creates conjunctions from production rules that are transformed from decision trees. Irrelevant or unimportant conditions are eliminated when paths are transformed into production rules. Therefore, this new method is likely to construct new attributes with relevant conditions. Three constructive induction algorithms based on this basic idea are described and are empirically evaluated by comparing with C4.5 and a Fringe-like algorithm in a set of artificial and natural domains. The experimental results reveal that constructing conjunctions using production rules can significantly improve the performance of decision tree learning in the majority of the domains tested in terms of both higher prediction accuracy and lower theory complexity. These results suggest an advantage of the attribute construction method that uses production rules over the method of constructing new attributes directly from paths in noisy domains.

To examine the efficacy of chondroitin sulfate (CS) in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) on the basis of a metaanalysis of controlled clinical trials. Methods. After personal, Medline, and Embase searches, a decision tree analysis of the available publications was performed, with respect to types of joint involvement studied, study designs, numbers of patients enrolled, and variables analyzed. The Lequesne index and pain rating on visual analog scale (VAS) were considered the main variables, Of a total bf 16 publications found, 7 trials of 372 patients taking CS could be enrolled into the metaanalysis. Although all selected studies claimed to be randomized, double blind designs in parallel groups, it should be noted that CS was given along with analgesics or nonsteroidal antiiflammatory drugs, making required dosage of comedication an important factor. Results, Following patients to 120 or more days, CS was shown to be significantly superior to placebo with respect to the Lequesne index and pain VAS. Pooled data confirmed these results and showed at least 50% improvement in the study variables in the CS group compared to placebo. Conclusion.

Two data mining techniques, clustering and decision tree induction were used. Clustering was used to group patients according to the overall presence/absence of deletions at the tested markers. Decision trees and On-Line-Analytical-Processing (OLAP) were used to inspect the resulting clustering and look for correlations between deletion patterns, populations and the clinical picture of infertility. The results of the analysis indicate that there are correlations between deletion patterns and patient populations, as well as clinical phenotype severity.

This approach was operationalized in EpiCS, a type of learning classifier system specially adapted to model clinical data. In applying EpiCS to a large, prospective. injury surveillance database, EpiCS was found to create accurate predictive models quickly that were highly robust, being able to classify > 99% of cases early during training. After training, EpiCS classified novel data more accurately (p <0.001) than either logistic regression or decision tree induction (C4.5), two traditional methods for discovering, or building predictive models.

The chosen mass vaccination strategy was implemented and changed the natural course of the epidemic in that state. We have built a model using a decision tree and compare it to the fuzzy logic model. Using essentially the same set of assumptions about this problem, we contrast the two approaches. The models identify the same strategy as being the best one, but exhibit differences in the ranking of the remaining strategies.

So, GP may search for global optimum solution. But, in general, GP'S learning speed is not so fast. Apriori Algorithm is one of association rule algorithms. It can he applied to large database. But, It is difficult to define its parameters without experience. We propose a rule generation technique from a database using GP combined with association rule algorithm. It rakes rules generated hy the association rule algorithm as initial individual of GP. The learning speed of GP is improved hy the combined algorithm. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we apply it to the decision tree construction problem from UCI Machine Learning Repository. We compare the result of proposed method with prior ones.

In this paper, a new method of guessing missing attribute values is suggested. This method selects attributes one by one using attribute group mutual information calculated by flattening the already selected attributes. As each new attribute is added, its missing values are filled up by generating a decision tree, and the previously filled up missing values are naturally utilized. This ordered estimation of missing values is compared with some conventional methods including Lobo's ordered estimation which uses static ranking of attributes. Experimental results show that this method generates good recognition ratios in almost all domains with many missing values.

We use a set of public data sets to compare VQTree with two existing decision tree induction algorithms, C5.0 and OC1.

Modeled as semi-structured documents, Email messages consist of a set of fields with predefined semantics and a number of variable length free-text fields. While most work on classification either concentrates on structured data or free text, the work in this paper deals with both of them. To perform classification, a naive Bayesian classifier was designed and implemented, and a decision tree based classifier was implemented. The design considerations and implementation issues are discussed. Using a relatively large amount of real personal E-mail data, a comprehensive comparative study was conducted using the two classifiers. The importance of different features is reported. Results of other issues related to building an effective personal E-mail classifier are presented and discussed. It is shown that both classifiers can perform filtering with reasonable accuracy. While the decision tree based classifier outperforms the Bayesian classifier when features and training size are selected optimally for both, a carefully designed naive Bayesian classifier is more robust.

Such a rule set can be associated with a database as a knowledge base that can be used to help answering frequent queries. In this paper, a study is done that enables us to show that classification by means of a fuzzy decision tree is equivalent to the generalized modus ponens. Moreover, it is shown that the decision taken by means of a fuzzy decision tree is more stable when observation evolves.

Decision tree based classification algorithms perform computations to find the best split point at each node of the tree. Efficient computation of the split in the decision tree can be done by using the one-dimensional aggregates if the cell values are the class-id values, and counts are maintained for each class. This is used repeatedly at the nodes of the decision tree to calculate splits and manage data. Previous parallel approaches for decision-tree based classification use sorted attribute lists and hash tables to compute the split point and split the data appropriately. The amount of data communicated is proportional to the product of number of records in the training set, and the number of dimensions, at each level of the tree, in the worst case. Parallel formulation of our approach uses data communication proportional to the product of the sum of cardinality of all dimensions and the number of non-classified nodes at each level of the tree. Communication volume is greatly reduced in our approach and is done in one phase of communication at each level of the tree, by coalescing messages. Preliminary results from our experiments on a coarse-grained, distributed memory parallel machine (IBM-SP2) show good performance.

J	Geurtis, P				Geurtis, Pierre			Some Enhancements of Decision Tree Bagging	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE <D>			English	Article								This paper investigates enhancements of decision tree bagging which mainly aim at improving computation times, but also accuracy. The three questions which are reconsidered are: discretization of continuous attributes, tree pruning, and sampling schemes. A very simple discretization procedure is proposed, resulting in a dramatic speedup without significant decrease in accuracy. Then a new method is proposed to prune an ensemble of trees in a combined fashion, which is significantly more effective than individual pruning. Finally, different resampling schemes are considered leading to different CPU time/accuracy tradeoffs. Combining all these enhancements makes it possible to apply tree bagging to very large datasets, with computational performances similar to single tree induction. Simulations are carried out on two synthetic databases and four real-life datasets.

A Genetic Algorithm-Based Solution for the Problem of Small Disjuncts	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE <D>			English	Article								In essence, small disjuncts are rules covering a small number of examples. Hence, these rules are usually error-prone, which contributes to a decrease in predictive accuracy. The problem is particularly serious because, although each small disjuncts covers few examples, the set of small disjuncts can cover a large number of examples. This paper proposes a solution to the problem of discovering accurate small-disjunct rules based on genetic algorithms. The basic idea of our method is to use a hybrid decision tree / genetic algorithm approach for classification. More precisely, examples belonging to large disjuncts are classified by rules produced by a decision-tree algorithm, while examples belonging to small disjuncts are classified by a new genetic algorithm, particularly designed for discovering small-disjunct rules.

The basic model of a decision tree algorithm is presented and then used to justify the design choices and system architecture issues. The library has been designed for flexibility and adaptability. Its basic goal was an open system that could easily embody parts of different conventional as well as new algorithms, without the need of knowing the inner organization of the system in detail. The system has an integrated interface (ClassExplorer), which is used for controlling and combining components that comprise decision trees. The ClassExplorer can create objects "on the fly", from classes unknown during compilation time. Conclusions and considerations about extensions towards a more visual system are also described.

Decision tree induction algorithms such as C4.5 have incorporated in their learning phase an automatic feature selection strategy while some other statistical classification algorithm require the feature subset to be selected in a preprocessing phase. It is well know that correlated and irrelevant features may degrade the performance of the C4.5 algorithm. In our study, we evaluated the influence of feature pre-selection on the prediction accuracy of C4.5 using a real-world data set. We observed that accuracy of the C4.5 classifier can be improved with an appropriate feature pre-selection phase for the learning algorithm.

Experienced dermatologists with specific training make the diagnosis by clinical inspection and they reach 80% level of both sensitivity and specificity. In this paper, we present a multi-classifiers system for supporting the early diagnosis of melanoma. The system acquires a digital image of the skin lesion and extracts a set of geometric and colorimetric features. The diagnosis is performed on the vector of features by integrating with a voting schema the diagnostic outputs of three different classifiers: discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbor and decision tree. The system is build and validated on a set of 152 skin images acquired via D-ELM. The results are comparable or better of the diagnostic response of a group of expert dermatologists.

Different discretization procedures are first studied empirically, then means to reduce the discretization variance are proposed. The experiment shows that discretization variance is large and that it is possible to reduce it significantly without notable computational costs. The resulting variance reduction mainly improves interpretability and stability of decision trees, and marginally their accuracy.

However, it has difficulty in obtaining the relation between continuous-valued data points. Many data sets show significant correlations between input variables, and a large amount of useful information is hidden in the data as nonlinearities. It has been shown that neural network is better than direct application of induction tree in modeling nonlinear characteristics of sample data. It is proposed in this paper that we derive a compact set of rules to support data with input variable relations. Those relations as a set of linear classifiers can be obtained from neural network modeling based on back-propagation. This will also solve overgeneralization and overspecialization problems often seen in induction tree. We have tested this scheme over several data sets to compare with decision tree results.

We first discuss an analysis of the generalization error of decision trees that gives us a new perspective on the regularization parameter that is inherent to any regularization (e.g., pruning) algorithm. There is an optimal setting of this parameter for every learning problem; a setting that does well for one problem will inevitably do poorly for others. We will see that the optimal setting can in fact be estimated from the sample, without "trying out" various settings on holdout data. This leads us to a nonparametric decision tree regularization algorithm that can, in principle, work well for all learning problems.

The ADABOOsT algorithm of Freund and Schapire has been successfully applied to many domains [2,10,12] and the combination of ADABOOST with the C4.5 decision tree algorithm has been called the best off-the-shelf learning algorithm in practice. Unfortunately, in some applications, the number of decision trees required by ADABOOsT to achieve a reasonable accuracy is enormously large and hence is very space consuming. This problem was first studied by Margineantu and Dietterich [7], where they proposed an empirical method called Kappa pruning to prune the boosting ensemble of decision trees. The Kappa method did this without sacrificing too much accuracy. In this work-in-progress we propose a potential improvement to the Kappa pruning method and also study the boosting pruning problem from a theoretical perspective. We point out that the boosting pruning problem is intractable even to approximate. Finally, we suggest a margin-based theoretical heuristic for this problem.
