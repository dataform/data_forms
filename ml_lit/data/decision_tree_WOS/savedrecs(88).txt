J	Johns, RH; Hirt, WD				Johns, Robert H.; Hirt, William D.			Derechos: Widespread Convectively Induced Windstorms	WEATHER AND FORECASTING			English	Article								The derecho, a widespread convectively induced windstorm, is identified and defined in terms of current nomenclature. A comprehensive dataset consisting of 70 derecho cases has been developed from the warm season months of May through August for the 4-year period 1980-1983. Analyses of this dataset reveal that the warm season derecho typically emanates from a mesoscale convective system (MCS) moving along a quasistationary, low-level thermal boundary in an environment characterized by high potential instability and relatively strong midtropospheric winds. In the continental United States these windstorms are most frequent in a zone extending from eastern South Dakota to the Upper Ohio Valley, and typically commence during the afternoon and evening hours. Particular radar and satellite imagery characteristics are associated with the derecho-spawning MCS. Based upon the meteorological parameters and synoptic patterns associated with derecho events, a decision tree has been developed to assist the operational meteorologist in anticipating derecho development.

Thirty-six 24-h radio-tracking sessions were conducted on 2 sets: 5 subadult males (26 sessions) and 4 breeding females (10 sessions). Three kinds of movement were distinguished: activity zone (AZ), slow movement (< 1 km/h), fast movement (> 1 km/h). Individuals from both sets proved capable of performing all their nocturnal activity within a single AZ. Another strategy, observed only in males, consisted of ranging continuously and not using AZ. In most instances the night began with slow activity and an AZ was frequently associated with the initial resting place. Conversely, the final resting place is rarely associated with an AZ. The strategy employed led to a more or less complicated succession of the 3 kinds of movement. Total distance covered and activity duration were correlated with this complexity, but in any way most variations in the movement parameters are refered to individual, sex and period differences. If we assume that the home range organization is based on preferred places (AZ and resting places), a decision tree can be drawn. All results suggest that the succession of decisions was for the most part determined by the search for a maximum safety resting place. They also suggest that the use of AZ is partly related to non-feeding activities, e.g. social relations and short resting phases. The wild boar movement strategy as a whole showed similarities with that used by a number of polyphagous predators.

J	KING, V				KING, V			A LOWER BOUND FOR THE RECOGNITION OF DIGRAPH PROPERTIES	COMBINATORICA			English	Article								The complexity of a diagraph property is the number of entries of the adjacency matrix which must be examined by a decision tree algorithm to recognize the property in the worst case. Aanderaa and Rosenberg conjectured that there is a constant epsilon such that every diagraph property which is monotone (not destroyed by the deletion of edges) and nontrivial (holds for some but not all digraphs) has complexity at least epsilon-v2 where v is the number of nodes in the diagraph. This conjecture was proved by Rivest and Vuillemin and a lower bound of v2/4-0(v2) was subsequently found by Kahn, Saks, and Sturtevant. Here we show a lower bound of v2/2-o(v2). We also prove that a certain class of monotone, nontrivial bipartite digraph properties is evasive (requires that every entry in the adjacency matrix be examined in the worst case).

J	Sirat, JA; Nadal, JP				Sirat, J. A.; Nadal, J-P			Neural trees: a new tool for classification	NETWORK-COMPUTATION IN NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article							LAYERED NETWORKS; FEEDFORWARD; ALGORITHM; MEMORY	We propose a new classifier based on neural network techniques. The 'network' consists of a set of perceptrons functionally organized in a binary tree ('neural tree'). The learning algorithm is inspired from a growth algorithm, the tiling algorithm, recently introduced for feedforward neural networks. As in the former case, this is a constructive algorithm, for which convergence is guaranteed. In the neural tree one distinguishes the structural organization from the functional organization: each neuron of a neural tree receives inputs from, and only from, the input layer; its output does not feed into any other neuron, but is used to propagate down a decision tree. The main advantage of this approach is due to the local processing in restricted portions of input space, during both learning and classification. Moreover, only a small subset of neurons have to be updated during the classification stage. Finally, this approach is easily and efficiently extended to classification in a multiclass problem. Promising numerical results have been obtained on different two- and multiclass problems (parity problem, multiclass nearest-neighbour classification task, etc) including a 'real' low-level speech processing task. In. all studied cases results compare favourably with the traditional 'backpropagation' approach, in particular on learning and classification times as well as on network size.	[Sirat, J.

In its present form, the DCR is a diagnostic method for identifying small disease entities in the spectrum of reactive (i.e. psychogenic) and functional (i.e. endogenous) psychoses. The nosological concept of the DCR can be characterized by thirteen paradigms: (1) a nonkraepelinian clinical classificatory system given by Leonhard; (2) the index-psychosis paradigm as opposed to the end-state paradigm; (3) conceptual differentiation of the disease entities as opposed both to the full disease entity paradigm and to the only-one-psychosis (or no disease entity) paradigm, respectively; (4) an aristotelian distinction between content (meaning) and form as opposed to the paradigm of ideas; (5) three-aspect approach to the psychopathological phenomena instead of choosing only one or two of the aspects of experience, of the behavior and of the achievement as special paradigm; (6) gestalt paradigm specified in different ways, as completing the associationist paradigm; (7) structural paradigm, especially concerning the delusions; (8) method of understanding in contrast to the method of causal explanation in distinguishing reactive (i.e. psychogenic) psychoses from functional (i.e. endogenous) psychoses; (9) behavioral symptoms overrule experiential symptoms in the decision-tree process concerning schizophrenias; (10) erosive psychotic phenomena ('minus symptoms') overrule productive phenomena ('plus symptoms') in the decision-tree process concerning hebephrenias in the group of systematic schizophrenias; (11) three-dimensional (polarity, rhythmicity, deterioration) assessment of course of illness; (12) sociological paradigm in reformulation of types of 'defect'; (13) psychosis paradigm concerning the operationalization of applicability of DCR to patients. Some empirical investigations are mentioned concerning the validity of the DCR.

The result of applying the algorithm is an irreducible tree that is no less efficient than the original, and may be more efficient. Irreducible trees arise in discrete decision theory as an algebraic form for decision trees. This form has significant computational properties. In fact, every irreducible is optimal with respect to some expected testing cost criterion and is strictly better than any given distinct tree with respect to some criterion. Many irreducibles are decision equivalent to a given tree; only some of these are reductions of the tree. The reduction algorithm is a particular way of finding one of these. It tends to preserve the overall structure of the tree by reducing the subtrees first. A bound on the complexity of this algorithm with input tree t is O(hgt(t)2. usize(t)), where usize(t) is the uniform size of the tree (the number of leaves less one) and hgt(t) is the height of the tree. This means that decision tree reduction has the same worst-case order of complexity as most heuristic methods for building suboptimal trees. While the purpose of using heuristics is often rather different, such comparisons are an indication of the efficiency of the reduction algorithm.

J	RAJAGOPAL, R				RAJAGOPAL, R			ECONOMICS OF SCREENING IN THE DETECTION OF ORGANICS IN GROUND-WATER	CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS			English	Article							SITES	Screening may be defined as the use of efficient test procedures to determine and/or to quantify the presence or absence of contaminants in samples. In support of screening, many commercial laboratories offer price-breaks when analysis for only a few compounds are sought instead of a standard scan (such as those required under a governmental regulatory program). Screening is a step-wise or a decision tree approach to sampling and analysis. For a fixed number of compounds in a screen, a model to maximize the total expected number of positive determinations (detections) of organic compounds in ground water samples is developed and evaluated. This model is tested with extensive data on organic measurements obtained from ground-water samples at hazardous waste sites. The economic viability of the model is evaluated within the context of price-breaks in analytical services offered by commercial laboratories. For a set of price-break assumptions, screening is shown to be far superior in the detection of pesticide, acid, and base neutral compounds than in the detection of volatile organic compounds in ground water at hazardous waste sites. By incorporating relevant QA/QC costs, it is further shown that screening is a cost-effective alternative for all four groups of organic compounds. A few promising avenues for further research are also outlined.

The assumption that endogenous estrogen can be easily replaced with supplemental medication fosters the decision for routine oophorectomy. Published reports on the use of postmenopausal estrogen indicate that compliance is less than perfect. This fact could affect the overall outcome. Decision analysis techniques with Markov cohort modeling were used to evaluate the policy of elective bilateral oophorectomy. Results from studies judged methodologically sound were combined to determine values representing the influence of estrogen on coronary heart disease, breast cancer, and osteoporotic fracture. The decision tree also explicitly incorporated patient compliance. When compliance with estrogen therapy is assumed to be perfect, oophorectomy yields longer life expectancy than retaining the ovaries. When actual drug-taking behavior is considered, retaining the ovaries results in longer survival. This analysis highlights the importance of including the effects of patient compliance with treatment recommendations when the impact of a health policy decision such as prophylactic surgery is assessed.

J	CLARKE, JR; BADAWY, SB				CLARKE, JR; BADAWY, SB			ACUTE PAIN OVER THE APPENDIX - A MODEL OF THE SURGICAL DECISION	ANNALES DE CHIRURGIE			English	Article						APPENDICITIS; DECISION MAKING; UTILITY ASSESSMENT		The decision to do an appendectomy for a patient with right lower abdominal pain has been analysed. We have described a simple decision tree model of the tradeoffs. The three critical variables can be measured quantitatively. The probability of appendicitis has been predicted. The probability that an inflamed appendix will perforate during observation can be estimated. It can be projected that the rate of perforation is increased in the very young and old. Therefore, the minimal threshold probability of appendicitis justifying an appendectomy is lower at the extremes of age. The decision must consider not only the probabilities of outcomes, but their utilities as well. The utility of appendectomy is discussed. Experience measuring the personal utilities of appendectomy in a group of surgeons using a standard gamble technique is presented. The variation in utilities was greater than expected. The perceived ratio of the magnitude of the increased risk of an avoidable perforation compared to that of an unnecessary operation ranged from over 30:1 to less than 1:3, with a median of about 3.5:1. The ratio predicted from mortality and morbidity rates had a median range from 20:1 to 2:1. Other factors may be influencing the utility assessments. The individual's utility for appendectomy could be shown to have a large influence on the decision to operate or observe.

J	KING, V				KING, V			AN OMEGA(N5/4) LOWER BOUND ON THE RANDOMIZED COMPLEXITY OF GRAPH PROPERTIES	COMBINATORICA			English	Article								A decision tree algorithm determines whether an input graph with n nodes has a property by examining the entries of the graph's adjacency matrix and branching according to the information already gained. All graph properties which are monotone (not destroyed by the addition of edges) and nontrivial (holds for somes but not all graphs) have been shown to require OMEGA(n2) queries in the worst case. In this paper, we investigate the power of randomness in recognizing these properties by considering randomized decision tree algorithms in which coins may be flipped to determine the next entry to be examined. The complexity of a randomized algorithm is the expected number of entries that are examined in the worst case. The randomized complexity of a property is the minimum complexity of any randomized decision tree algorithm which computes the property. We improve Yao's lower bound on the randomized complexity of any nontrivial monotone graph property from OMEGA(n log1/12 n) to OMEGA(n5/4).

The analysis was carried out using a geographical information system environmental data base of those topographic and geological variables thought to influence the distribution of vegetation and derived from cartographic sources. The resulting maps of forest communities are of a resolution sufficient to delimit individual forest stands and contain much ecological information.

The difficulty in this situation arises from the variety of savings schemes offered presently in Greece, and other countries, differing mainly in interest rates, blocking periods and penalties. Formulating the problem in a decision-tree context, an optimum scheme is found which yields the maximum expected utility from the set of possible actions. The whole package is user-friendly and can be easily incorporated in an existing Decision Support System.

First, a simple derivation of a best linear discriminant function (BLD) is presented through geometrical consideration on ellipses with equi-Mahalanobis distance. It is shown that the function satisfies the Minimax criterion, which implies the robustness with regard to prior probabilities. Then, the binary decision tree (BDT) is introduced in order to make the method efficient, where the BLD is utilized as a decision rule. Care is taken to prevent a decline in the classification accuracy during the process of constructing the BDT. In addition to the theoretical evaluation of the processing speed, the actual performance of the proposed method is shown by applying it to multispectral data of Landsat-5. It is shown that the BDT/BLD becomes more efficient than Fisher's linear discriminant function when the number of classes increases.

In this study, the dose-concentration-time relationships of amitriptyline in overdose were modeled with discriminant analysis, with an evolutionary heuristic search program, and with a decision-tree model based on the entropy of uncertainty of classification. The computer models all used the same data from dogs administered treatment (80 mg/kg), toxic (250 mg/kg), or fatal (500 mg/kg) doses directly into the surgically isolated duodenum. All the models achieved a high degree of success (77 to 93%) in assigning records to the high-, low-, or middle-dose groups. Two of the models gave a probability of the assignment. Results of this analysis suggest that blood amitriptyline and nortriptyline concentrations are most useful in estimating dose in acute amitriptyline overdose.

Using a simple decision tree, we found that the decision to give empiric antibiotic treatment is the decision of choice. The difference in quality-adjusted life expectancy between the "best" and "worst" decisions was only 11 days. However, this difference translated to prevention of death or permanent disability in 60 cases per 100,000 febrile children. Further, empiric treatment remained the best management alternative unless the probability of bacteremia was less than 1.4% (less than any published prevalence), or the efficacy of treatment was less than 21%. Our analysis demonstrated that a test with far greater sensitivity than leukocyte count or other tests currently in use is needed to justify testing rather than treating empirically. Further, an enormous patient population would be needed to find a difference of both clinical and statistical significance between treated and untreated patients in a controlled trial. In the absence of such trials, we recommend blood culture and empiric antibiotic treatment of all infants at risk for occult bacteremia.

J	HASKELL, RE; NOUIMEHIDI, A				HASKELL, RE; NOUIMEHIDI, A			DESIGN OF HIERARCHICAL CLASSIFIERS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article								Decision trees provide a powerful method of pattern classification. At each node in a binary tree a decision is made based upon the value of one of many possible attributes or features. The leaves of the tree represent the various classes that can be recognized. Various techniques have been used to select the feature and threshold to use at each node based upon a set of training data. Information theoretic methods are the most popular techniques used for designing each node in the tree. An alternate method uses the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to design classification trees involving two classes. This paper presents an extension of this method that can produce a single decision tree when there are multiple classes. The relationship between this generalized Kolmogorov-Smirnov method and entropy minimization methods will be described. Experiments comparing classification results using this decision tree with results of using a Bayesian classifier will be presented.

In contrast, we observe that the problem of computing the Voronoi diagram of a finite sequence of points in the plane which gives the sorted order of the points with respect to a single direction requires OMEGA (n log n) operations in the algebraic decision tree model. As a corollary from the first result, we show that the bounded Voronoi diagrams of simple n-vertex polygons which can be efficiently cut into the so called monotone histograms can be computed in omicron (n log n) time.

The RID method permits a decision maker (DM) to voluntarily and interactively express strong (viz; sure) binary preferences for actions, partial decision functions, and full decision functions, and only imprecise probability and utility function assessments. These inputs are used with various dominance operators to prune the state probability space, utility space, and decision space until an optimal choice strategy is obtained. Conceptually, the operation of the RID method can be regarded as a state-space pruning system and the computer implementation of the RID methodology can be viewed as a DSS. In this paper, we extend the RID concept and DSS to deal with multiple criteria decisions, circumventing the need to precisely assess attribute importance criteria/attribute weights. The approach is described and shown to be effective in eliminating inefficient alternatives. But, since the aggregate utility of each alternative is interval valued, it then becomes difficult to choose an optimal alternative from among the remaining efficient one, since the intervals are not defined by probability distributions. However, goal programming is used to vitiate this problem, thereby allowing the decision maker to choose an optimal alternative.

These include algorithms that learn decision trees, classification rules, and distributed networks. However, no investigation has analyzed algorithms that use only specific instances to solve incremental learning tasks. In this paper, we describe a framework and methodology, called instance-based learning, that generates classification predictions using only specific instances. Instance-based learning algorithms do not maintain a set of abstractions derived from specific instances. This approach extends the nearest neighbor algorithm, which has large storage requirements. We describe how storage requirements can be significantly reduced with, at most, minor sacrifices in learning rate and classification accuracy. While the storage-reducing algorithm performs well on several real-world databases, its performance degrades rapidly with the level of attribute noise in training instances. Therefore, we extended it with a significance test to distinguish noisy instances. This extended algorithm's performance degrades gracefully with increasing noise levels and compares favorably with a noise-tolerant decision tree algorithm.

J	DEMANTARAS, RL				DEMANTARAS, RL			A DISTANCE-BASED ATTRIBUTE SELECTION MEASURE FOR DECISION TREE INDUCTION	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Note						DISTANCE BETWEEN PARTITIONS; DECISION TREE INDUCTION; INFORMATION MEASURES		This note introduces a new attribute selection measure for ID3-like inductive algorithms. This measure is based on a distance between partitions such that the selected attribute in a node induces the partition which is closest to the correct partition of the subset of training examples corresponding to this node. The relationship of this measure with Quinlan's information gain is also established. It is also formally proved that our distance is not biased towards attributes with large numbers of values. Experimental studies with this distance confirm previously reported results showing that the predictive accuracy of induced decision trees is not sensitive to the goodness of the attribute selection measure. However, this distance produces smaller trees than the gain ratio measure of Quinlan, especially in the case of data whose attributes have significantly different numbers of values.

J	MILSUM, JH				MILSUM, JH			ON THE OPTIMIZATION OF CHOLESTEROL SCREENING	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						CHOLESTEROL; SCREENING; DECISION TREE; OPTIMIZATION; SPREAD-SHEETS	CORONARY HEART-DISEASE; MORTALITY; POLICY; RISK	Total serum cholesterol is a major risk factor for Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). Some guidelines have been published regarding treatment levels. However, before implementing cholesterol screening, the costs and benefits should be analyzed as a function of cholesterol level. Analysis is readily implemented on microcomputer spreadsheets using decision tree analysis. Because it is very difficult to establish some of the costs satisfactorily, the facility of spreadsheets in performing sensitivity analysis is crucial. Here, plausible numerical values are used as "default" conditions for estimating in a preliminary way the costs and benefits of a putative screening-intervention program. The cost-benefit condition remains very close to optimal over the range 200-240 mg/dl for cholesterol marker level. The optimal condition may shift considerably when the default parameter values are altered. With the default values, the maximal net benefit is around 5% of the estimated currents costs of CHD deaths without screening.

Its use in the area of learning from examples is studied. HC-Expression is a tree-like structure with alternate levels representing positive and negative exceptions to the rule. It is flexible and powerful enough to describe disjunctive concepts and can be visualised as a decision tree. Expressions to describe a concept can be efficiently generated from a set of examples and counter examples of a concept. The efficacy of the proposed method is examined by applying it to a set of data collected from the Institute of Indian Medicine.

Elliptic Fourier descriptors are used for aircraft classification and pose determination from a two-dimensional image recorded at an arbitrary viewing angle. The computation model of the nearest neighbor classification rule (or, simply, NNR) is analysed to come up with proper necessary conditions used by our method for reducing the set of near neighbors of a test projection for a fast partial library search. On the other hand, our method is robust to noise by incorporating a perturbation analysis of feature variation into the classifier design. Both graphics-generated data and real data of five aircraft have been used to demonstrate the applicability of the new method. The results indicate that the method is almost as accurate as the NNR method, but is much faster. The method is also shown to outperform other existing classification methods including the decision-tree classification method.

Instead of using stopping rules to halt partitioning, we follow the approach of growing a large tree with pure terminal nodes and selectively pruning it back. A new efficient iterative method is proposed to grow and prune classification trees. This method divides the data sample into two subsets and iteratively grows a tree with one subset and prunes it with the other subset, successively interchanging the roles of the two subsets. The convergence and other properties of the algorithm are established. Theoretical and practical considerations suggest that the iterative tree growing and pruning algorithm should perform better and require less computation than other widely used tree growing and pruning algorithms. Numerical results on a waveform recognition problem are presented to support this view.		GELFAND, SB (reprint author), PURDUE UNIV,SCH ELECT ENGN,COMP VIS & IMAGE PROC LAB,W LAFAYETTE,IN 47907, USA.

The evaluation was specifically designed to measure test sensitivity and specificity for detection of dairy cattle with subclinical paratuberculosis. The case definition of subclinical bovine paratuberculosis was isolation of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis from fecal samples or internal organs of cattle without diarrhea or chronic weight loss. Animals designated as free of the disease originated exclusively from four herds in Wisconsin that were certified to be free of disease. The kit had a sensitivity of 47.3% for serum specimens from 150 infected cattle. The test detected 59.7% of animals that shed M. paratuberculosis in their feces, as defined by conventional fecal culture, at the time of serum collection. Testing of 196 serum specimens from cattle without paratuberculosis yielded two false-positive results; the test specificity was thus 99.0%. Decision analysis procedures on the economics of using the kit in a test-and-cull disease control program indicated it would be cost-effective in any herd with a true paratuberculosis prevalence of greater-than-or-equal-to 3%. Comparison of the sensitivity and specificity of the Johne's Absorbed EIA with those of other tests for detection of subclinical paratuberculosis indicated that it may be the most accurate commercially available test at present and better than the standard complement fixation test used in the United States.

Panic disorder may entail considerable morbidity, particularly if left untreated. This observation, coupled with clinical experience that the benefits of pharmacologic treatment generally outweigh their risks, suggests that patients with panic disorder should be treated with medication. A decision tree for the acute and maintenance treatment of panic disorder patients is presented, and possible indications for both acute and maintenance treatments are discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of treatment with each of the three classes of drugs that have been found effective for panic disorder-the tricyclic antidepressants, the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and the benzodiazepines-are reviewed.

We elaborate and expand on work by Banks (1985), Miller (1977, 1980), Miller, Grofman and Feld (1986), and Shepsle and Weingast (1984). We discuss algorithms to obtain these two decisions under such procedures, the location of these two decisions in the underlying majority tournament, the relative locations of these two decisions in the voting agenda, and the possibility of an alternative which is both of these decisions.

This initial value tree contains a series of questions that are intended to identify specific features of a user's problem, relevant to the selection of suitable software. An appropriate basic or general approach for the numerical solution is identified, and then specific sets of codes, incorporating this "generic" approach, are selected. Where Possible, the recommended codes are in libraries where the software has been tested extensively and is maintained. The tree can be used with NITPACK (ACM Algorithm 606), a set of software tools that guide a user through a tree in an interactive computer session.

It is shown that for most cases, the construction of the storage optimal decision tree is an NP-complete problem, and therefore a heuristic approach to the problem is necessary. A systematic procedure analogous to the information theoretic heuristic is developed. The algorithm has low computational complexity and performs well experimentally.

A HISTORICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL OVERVIEW	JOURNAL OF PROSTHETIC DENTISTRY			English	Article								The study of clinical decision making provides a common model on which to base dental practice and thus promotes standardization of care and treatment. Decision analysis can assist in identifying missing data in clinical problems and thus generate clinically relevant research agendas. In Part I of this article several of the leading methods of decision analysis are briefly described with examples of how they can be applied in dentistry. The methods presented are Bayes' theorem, decision-tree design, receiver-operating-characteristic curves, sensitivity analysis, and utilities assessment.

This problem is encountered in tropical mixed forests, in uneven-aged and even-aged forests of the Northern Hemisphere, and in intensively managed timber plantations. Optimizing the temporal spatial pattern of forest harvest is a combinatorial problem which can be solved using the "Model I". It is difficult to imagine forest management without the support of an integrated database system. Equally important are flexible growth and yield models. These are generally available for even-aged stands, but are not readily available for uneven-aged mixed forests.

Accumulated experience has made clear, however, that this determination has distinct limitations. Consequently, the knowledge of the origin of hyperamylasemia may have an important influence on treatment, hospitalization, and extent of clinical investigations. We undertook a logical and systematic approach to the interpretation of hyperamylasemia through the use of an algorithm that can be applied in clinical situations without the need for the integration of radiologic procedures or clinical data. The proposed algorithm was tested for effectiveness in 97 consecutive hospitalized patients with hyperamylasemia (amylase level greater than twice the upper reference limit) for a 2-year period. The majority (52.5%) of these patients had acute pancreatitis. The algorithm assigned the correct diagnostic categories in 95.8% of cases, with a disagreement between patient diagnosis and algorithm-generated diagnosis in only four cases. These four patients (two with acute biliary disease, one with bacterial peritonitis, and one with chronic renal failure) had pancreatic lipase values greater than five times the upper reference limit, so that the algorithm classified their condition as acute pancreatitis. The clinical trial indicated that the proposed decision tree, which requires only knowledge of biochemical data that are readily available, is useful in the evaluation of elevated amylase activity and facilitates arrival at a definitive diagnosis.

J	CHOU, PA				CHOU, PA			OPTIMAL PARTITIONING FOR CLASSIFICATION AND REGRESSION TREES	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						CLUSTERING; DECISION TREES; INFORMATION DIVERGENCE; TEXT-TO-SPEECH	DECISION TREES; VECTOR QUANTIZATION; INFORMATION-THEORY; DESIGN; RECOGNITION; CONVERSION; ALGORITHM; TABLES	In designing a decision tree for classification or regression, one selects at each node a feature to be tested, and partitions the range of that feature into a small number of bins, each bin corresponding to a child of the node. When the feature's range is discrete with N unordered outcomes, the optimal partition, that is, the partition minimizing an expected loss, is usually found by an exhaustive search through all possible partitions. Since the number of possible partitions grows exponentially in N, this approach is impractical when N is larger than about 10 or 20. In this paper, we present an iterative algorithm that finds a locally optimal partition for an arbitrary loss function, in time linear in N for each iteration. The algorithm is a K-means like clustering algorithm that uses as its distance measure a generalization of Kullback's information divergence. Moreover, we prove that the globally optimal partition must satisfy a nearest neighbor condition using divergence as the distance measure. These results generalize similar results of Breiman et al. to an arbitrary number of classes or regression variables and to an arbitrary number of bins. We also provide experimental results on a text-to-speech example, and we suggest additional applications of the algorithm, including the design of variable combinations, surrogate splits, composite nodes, and decision graphs.

A commercially available induction system was used to create a rule-based decision tree using these estimates as a training set. In the classification of normal and abnormal studies two useful rules were found; one of these involved the standard deviation of the left ventricular phase histogram and the other concerned the correlation of adjacent pixels in the left ventricular region of the amplitude image. A discriminant analysis performed on five amplitude and five phase parameters produced no better discrimination than the use of the phase standard deviation alone. Although it was hoped that induction would find more than two useful rules, the results of the discriminant analysis confirm that induction has performed creditably on a difficult problem.

A detailed evaluation of all SSMI channels is made in arriving at the optimum channel selection for the global identification of precipitation and snow cover without the use of any ancillary information. The resulting algorithm takes the form of a decision tree which uses the dual polarized channels at 19 GHz and the vertically polarized channels at 22 and 85 GHz. These four channels enable the identification of precipitation from all other atmospheric and surface features, including snow cover.

J	STAVER, CP; BYERS, AC; RAVELO, AC; DICKINSON, JC				STAVER, CP; BYERS, AC; RAVELO, AC; DICKINSON, JC			REFINING SOIL CONSERVATION STRATEGIES IN THE MOUNTAIN ENVIRONMENT - THE CLIMATIC FACTOR - AN ECUADORIAN CASE-STUDY	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							LANDSCAPE CHANGE; KHUMBU; NEPAL	The fragile resource base of hill and mountain regions in Latin America is increasingly overused and abused, leading to land degradation from soil erosion. However, soil conservation projects directed toward this problem have often been based on the indiscriminate application of technologies that do not take into account variations in the biophysical conditions of the specific region. The hypothesis of this study is that the systematic and full use of available data, and the generation of appropriate complementary information, can lead to better project design. As an example, available climatic, slope, and soil data for twelve locations in Highland Ecuador are reviewed. Supplemented by field visits, the data are used to generate a preliminary "decision tree" designed to assist the practitioner in the choice of more appropriate conservation techniques (e.g., microrelief, bench terraces, biological barriers, or drainage ditches). Although the present study focuses primarily on biophysical parameters, it is also suggested that a thorough and concurrent understanding of social, economic, and institutional factors is needed in order to advance the starting point for project implementation, while facilitating later project modification and refinement.

This paper presents the development of a knowledge based system that can facilitate the process of controls and displays selection. Information from the literature was aggregated and classified into selection criteria. Based on these criteria, decision trees for selection of displays and controls were developed. The decision trees were then programmed using an artificial intelligence language, XLISP. The system can recommend appropriate devices that can meet the process requirements.

The assessed value of an intermediate result can be used as a minimum price acceptable to the inventor (reservation price) when the knowledge is disseminated to others. This issue is especially important if a firm (or society) is concerned about the distributive aspect of access to superior knowledge. The model discussed incorporates a number of structural variables including research cost, future development cost, potential profits, rivalry, and discount rate. For invention production functions with the memorylessness property (e.g., exponential functions), we will derive a closed form equation for the reservation price, and demonstrate how the model can be applied in a competitive R&D situation.

Perhaps, the most important feature of DTC's is their capability to break down a complex decision-making process into a collection of simpler decisions, thus providing a solution that is often easier to interpret. A survey of current methods for DTC designs and the various existing issues are presented. After considering potential advantages of DTC's over single-state classifiers, the subjects of tree structure design, feature selection at each internal node, and decision and search strategies are discussed. Some remarks concerning the relation between decision trees and neural networks (NN) are also made.		SAFAVIAN, SR (reprint author), PURDUE UNIV,SCH ELECT ENGN,W LAFAYETTE,IN 47907, USA.

J	NUNEZ, M				NUNEZ, M			THE USE OF BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE IN DECISION TREE INDUCTION	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						DECISION TREES; KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION; ECONOMIC INDUCTION; BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE		At present, algorithms of the ID3 family are not based on background knowledge. For that reason, most of the time they are neither logical nor understandable to experts. These algorithms cannot perform different types of generalization as others can do (Michalski, 1983; Kodratoff, 1983), nor can they reduce the cost of classifications. The algorithms presented in this paper tries to generate more logical and understandable decision trees than those generated by ID3-like algorithms; it executes various types of generalization and at the same time reduces the classification cost by means of background knowledge. The background knowledge contains the ISA hierarchy and the measurement cost associated with each attribute. The user can define the degrees of economy and generalization. These data will influence directly the quantity of search that the algorithm must undertake. This algorithm, which is an attribute version of the EG2 method (Nunez, 1988a, 1988b), has been implemented and the results appear in this paper comparing them with other methods.

Generally, it requires a computer expert to implement the cardiologist's diagnostic reasoning into computer language. The average cardiologist, however, is not able to verify whether his intentions have been properly realized and perform as he hoped for. But also for the initiated, it often remains obscure how a particular result was reached by a complex classification program. An environment is presented which solves these problems. The environment consists of a language, DTL (Decision Tree Language), that allows cardiologists to express their classification algorithms in a way that is familiar to them, and an interpreter and translator for that language. The considerations in the design of DTL are described and the structure and capabilities of the interpreter and translator are discussed.

J	MANNE, AS; RICHELS, RG				MANNE, AS; RICHELS, RG			BUYING GREENHOUSE INSURANCE	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						GLOBAL WARMING; DECISION ANALYSIS; VALUE OF INFORMATION		There have been numerous proposals for immediate cutbacks in CO2 emissions. Proponents argue that sizable reductions are necessary as a hedge against unacceptably rapid changes in climate. This paper provides a decision tree analysis of the problem. We examine how the optimal hedging strategy might vary with: a) the damage potential associated with the continued buildup of greenhouse gases; b) the accuracy and timing of climate research; and, c) the prospects for new supply and conservation technologies. The analysis is from the perspective of a single country, the USA. Optimal hedging strategies need to be explored on a region-by-region basis.

J	KIM, BY; LANDGREBE, DA				KIM, BY; LANDGREBE, DA			HIERARCHICAL CLASSIFIER DESIGN IN HIGH-DIMENSIONAL, NUMEROUS CLASS CASES	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							SAMPLE-SIZE; TREE	As the progress of new sensor technology continues, increasingly high spectral resolution imaging sensors are being developed. These sensors will provide detailed, complex data for each picture element and greatly increase the dimensionality of data over past systems. As a result, they should make possible discrimination of much larger numbers of classes. In applying pattern recognition methods in remote sensing problems, an inherent limitation is that there is almost always only a small number of training samples with which to design the classifier. The growth in both the dimensionality and the number of classes is likely to aggravate this already significant limitation of training set size. Thus ways must be found for future data analysis which can perform effectively in the face of large numbers of classes without unduly aggravating the limitations on training. In this work we propose a hybrid decision tree classifier design procedure which produces efficient and accurate classifiers for this situation. In doing so, several key questions are addressed, among them the question of feature extraction techniques to be used and the mathematical relationship between sample size, dimensionality, and risk value. Empirical tests comparing the hybrid design classifier with a conventional single layered one are also presented. They suggest that the hybrid design produces higher accuracy with fewer features. The need for fewer features is an important advantage, because it reflects favorably on both the size of the training set needed and the amount of computation time that will be needed in analysis.

J	CLEMENT, RP				CLEMENT, RP			RULE GENERATION AND SELECTION WITH A PARALLEL GENERALIZATION ARCHITECTURE	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS ELECTRONICS INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article								The BAMBOO algorithm is an expert system rule generating algorithm developed from the well-known C4 decision tree algorithm. Because BAMBOO's search is less restricted than C4's it usually finds simpler rules than C4. Both algorithms have problems with incomplete search and brittleness. These problems can be avoided by layering both algorithms together with other algorithms, generating independent rule sets and selecting a subset of rules to use in the final expert system. This learning strategy is referred to as parallel generalisation. Problems of search and brittleness are because the algorithms have a single fixed bias. By layering several algorithms together the effect is of a single algorithm selectively applying many heuristics. Because selecting rules is much easier than generating rules, the select procedure has its own parameterised bias. The layered algorithm is much more flexible than the single algorithms, in addition to generating more accurate and concise rule sets. Brittleness is avoided as when one algorithm produces a worst case rule set other algorithms generate better rules. Parallel generalisation can be improved by altering the algorithms to cooperate more.

In the herd environment, this methodology offers a means of employing population-based decision strategies that can help the producer control economic variation in expected return from a given set of decision options. An economic decision tree model regarding the use of prostaglandin in dairy cows with undetected estrus was used to determine the expected return of the decisions to use prostaglandin and breed on a timed basis, use prostaglandin and then breed on sign of estrus, or breed on signs of estrus. The risk attributes of these decision alternatives were calculated from the decision tree, and portfolio theory was used to find the efficient decision combinations (portfolios with the highest return for a given variance). The resulting combinations of decisions could be used to control return variation.

It is difficult to make a decision support system (DSS) to cover all possible clinical cases. An inductive learning program can be used to construct an expert system for detecting cases that differ from routine cases. The ID3 algorithm and the pessimistic pruning algorithm were tested in this study: a DSS was built directly from the data of patient records. A decision tree was generated, and the cases misclassified by the decision tree as compared with the classifications of a clinician were listed on a checklist, which formed the feedback to the clinician. In clinical situations about 5-10% of functional thyroid disorders may be misclassified. At this error level, the method found over 90% of the errors with a specificity of 95%. In simple medical classification tasks this dynamic self-learning system can be used to create a DSS that can assist in the quality control of clinical decision making.

J	ZHOU, XJ; DILLON, TS				ZHOU, XJ; DILLON, TS			A STATISTICAL-HEURISTIC FEATURE-SELECTION CRITERION FOR DECISION TREE INDUCTION	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Letter						DECISION TREES; FEATURE-SELECTION CRITERION; INDUCTIVE MACHINE LEARNING; KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION; MULTIVALUED FEATURES; NOISY DATA; STATISTICAL-HEURISTIC METHOD	CATEGORICAL DATA; DESIGN; CLASSIFIER; INFORMATION; VARIANCE; RULE	Many machine learning systems have been developed for constructing decision trees from collections of examples. When they are applied to complicated real-world problems they often suffer from the difficulties of coping with multivalued features and noisy data. To cope with these difficulties, a key issue is a feature-selection criterion for direct handling of multivalued features in noisy environments. This paper proposes a statistical-heuristic criterion, the symmetrical tau-(tau), and then discusses its consistency with a Bayesian classifier and its built-in statistical test. The combination of a measure of proportional-reduction-in-error and cost-of-complexity heuristic enables the symmetrical-tau to be a powerful criterion with many merits, including robustness to noise; fairness to multivalued features; capability to handle a boolean combination of logical features and "middle-cut" preference. The tau-criterion also provides a natural basis for prepruning and dynamic error estimation. On the basis of the tau-criterion, an effective approach for constructing multibranching decision trees in noisy environments is developed. Illustrative examples are also presented.

The case study method provided the data through: (1) observation of 47 professional online searchers performing their job-related searches; and (2) analysis of verbal and search protocols involved. Each option in the selection of search keys presents the use of a certain combination of textwords and descriptors which searchers choose because of request or database requirements, or because of their own beliefs. The routine delineates the terminological conditions which lead to the selection of each option.

As one step toward reducing the number of unnecessary preoperative tests ordered, we used an automated method to aid preoperative assessment of 239 patients in Chicago and in Winnipeg. The "HealthQuiz," a small hand-held device containing a computer chip and video screen, uses a decision tree to ask a minimum of 60 health-related questions (the patient's response to certain questions determines the number of questions presented). The device then generates a summary printout of patient answers, the health areas needing further attention, and the laboratory tests most likely to uncover clinically important abnormalities in that patient. HealthQuiz responses are intended to aid the physician and not to replace the personal interview. As an aid, the automated interview highlights possible problem areas for in-depth pursuit by the physician. The need for nonselective batteries of tests is eliminated because recommendations for tests are based on specific elements of a patient's history. To be effective, responses to the HealthQuiz should be the same as responses to similar questions asked by a physician. We tested that premise in this study. Patient's answers to the HealthQuiz were compared with their responses to a randomly selected set of the same questions in a personal interview. Ninety-seven percent of the response pairs were identical, and most of the 3% that differed involved changes from "not sure" replies to the HealthQuiz. Laboratory tests suggested by responses to the two methods of questioning did not differ. We conclude that an automated system for obtaining health histories and selecting laboratory tests could be used by most patients who read English, and that patients from differing socioeconomic backgrounds would respond similarly to both video and oral presentation of questions.

This paper discusses two proven techniques-a probability method using a decision tree and a component damage method to predict the weakest circuit component. These methods are applicable to circuits typically found in both fossil and nuclear generating stations and provide simple tools for selecting circuitry arrangements or components. These analytical techniques have not been applied in the same manner as illustrated in the paper's several examples.

J	KLEIN, GA; CALDERWOOD, R				KLEIN, GA; CALDERWOOD, R			DECISION-MODELS - SOME LESSONS FROM THE FIELD	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article							INFORMATION; MANAGEMENT; JUDGMENT; TASK	In recent years there have been a number of studies of decision making in naturalistic environments such as nuclear power plants, urban fire departments, command-and-control centers, and courtrooms. These studies provide a different perspective on decision strategies from laboratory studies that rely on naive subjects performing relatively context-free tasks under little time pressure and static task conditions. The field research paradigms generate a description of proficient decision making that emphasizes recognitional rather than analytical processes and challenges the "decision tree" representation of decision problems. That is, failure to use analytical methods is not a sign of incompetence since the recognitional strategies shown by decision makers seem reasonable and effective. Implications of these models for decision support systems and for training are discussed.

J	MARTINEZ, TR				MARTINEZ, TR			A SELF-ORGANIZING BINARY DECISION TREE FOR INCREMENTALLY DEFINED RULE-BASED SYSTEMS	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS			English	Letter							PARALLEL	This paper presents an adaptive self-organizing concurrent system (ASOCS) model for massively parallel processing of incrementally defined rule systems in such areas as adaptive logic, robotics, logical inference, and dynamic control. An ASOCS is an adaptive network composed of many simple computing elements operating asynchronously and in parallel. This paper focuses on adaptive algorithm 3 (AA3) and details its architecture and learning algorithm. It has advantages over previous ASOCS models in simplicity, implementability, and cost. An ASOCS can operate in either a data processing mode or a learning mode. During the data processing mode, an ASOCS acts as a parallel hardware circuit In learning mode, rules expressed as Boolean conjunctions are incrementally presented to the ASOCS. All ASOCS learning algorithms incorporate a new rule in a distributed fashion in a short, bounded time.		MARTINEZ, TR (reprint author), BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIV,DEPT COMP SCI,PROVO,UT 84602, USA.

J	OHTA, S; KANAYA, F				OHTA, S; KANAYA, F			OPTIMAL DECISION TREE DESIGN BASED ON INFORMATION THEORETICAL COST BOUND	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS ELECTRONICS INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article								Decision tree design is an important issue because decision trees have many applications in, for example, fault diagnosis and character recognition. This paper describes an algorithm designing a probabilistic decision tree, in which a test applied to a state produces different outcomes with non-zero probability. The algorithm strictly minimizes the tree cost, which is defined as the weighted sum of expected loss and expected test execution time. The lower bound of the cost is utilized to remove the excessive computing time needed to search for the exact optimum. This lower bound is derived from information theory and is transformed to an easily computable representation by introducing a network model. The result of a computational experiment confirms the time efficiency of the proposed method.

The main measure for a transparent representation is the decision tree which will be presented and whose purpose will be demonstrated by means of an example. Almost constantly medical decisions must be taken with uncertainty. Nevertheless, in order to come to optimum decisions, the stochastic issue must replace the determinist one. The basic elements for the use of probability calculus will be discussed and an example will demonstrate how to use them. Finally the notion >>utility<< will be explained in order to define the assessment of treatment results.

In order to establish the current situation, the results of a national survey of coastal and estuarine sewage discharges are presented. A review of the impact of sewage discharges on the marine environment is presented in conjunction with an assessment of the impact of sewage-treatment processes on the land and in the air. These aspects are integrated into overall conclusions about net environmental impact. Finally, a decision-tree approach to the assignment of priority to additional action required at individual locations is developed.

The indices are 'days of growth opportunity' based on soil water availability and calculated using a water budget model, the mean temperature on days when sufficient water is available for plant growth, and the mean temperature on days too dry for growth to occur. The difference between the growth and no-growth temperatures provides an indication of the degree of rainfall seasonality. These indices have also been used successfully to differentiate the five other biomes in South Africa (forest, fynbos, nama-karoo, savanna and succulent karoo) in a 'biome model' presented as a decision-tree. This model provides a simple method of predicting possible vegetation responses to climatic change. The possible long-term response to a scenario of climatic change, (a 2-degrees-C increase in temperature and a 15% decrease in rainfall), is illustrated as an example. Such an approach to modelling the impact of climate change has several advantages, including simplicity, appropriateness of scale and detail to the predictions of current climate models, identification of regions and processes that may require more intensive study and identification of the kind of information that will be required if scenarios of climatic change are to be translated into vegetation response. The model fails, however, to identify rates or pathways of change, or the species involved. This approach will therefore have to be complemented by more detailed dynamic models.

Aggarwal (1988), the lower bound proof for the planar extreme points decision problem of J.M. Steel and A.C. Yao (1982) is only good when the points are not necessarily in general position. It is unclear whether their proof can be modified to handle the case where an extreme point is also defined to be a point on the edge of the convex hull. In the fixed-order algebraic-decision-tree model, this paper answers the question with Ben-Or's theorem.

Although the results of recent research clarify the underlying physical and chemical phenomena to a certain extent, the prediction of the process evolution remains hard. Employing the machine learning methodology, we have explored the identification of plunge grinding via vibration signals generated by the grinding wheel and the workpiece. A two-stage experiment has been carried out, comprising (1) grinding, signal detection, extraction of spectral attributes and assessment of performance classes, and (2) learning the process evolution from the extracted data. Within the learning stage, a decision tree has been synthesized, predicting the grinding wheel performance from the attribute values. Two important aspects of the machine learning approach to the grinding process identification have been demonstrated by the experiment. First, the synthesized knowledge enables new insight in the problem domain, and second, it provides a ground for an efficient control algorithm.

Subjects and methods: A model of the treatment decision was created using the decision-tree format. The probabilities of treatment outcomes in the decision tree were derived from the literature. Utilities for treatment outcomes were obtained from five internists, five geriatricians, six nurse practitioners, five plastic surgeons, and six lay people. Results: A majority in each group of respondents favored surgery, according to the decision analysis. Sensitivity analysis showed that surgery was preferred unless its success rate was less than 30%, or the rate of healing with conservative measures was at least 40%, which are unlikely values. Economic analysis demonstrated that surgery was $17,000 more expensive than conservative therapy. Conclusion: The myocutaneous flap procedure is preferred by the majority of relevant decision makers when cost is not a consideration. The relative underutilization of surgery in practice has many possible explanations. The most likely are the failure of providers to appreciate the morbidity of pressure ulcers and the reluctance of practitioners to perform expensive procedures on demented patients.

The former evaluates actual component reliability through statistical analysis on field maintenance data. The latter provides preventive maintenance (PM) planning guidance using heuristic expert knowledge and estimated reliability parameters. The following aspects have been investigated: (1) A systematic and effective method of managing components/parts design information and field maintenance data (2) A method for estimating component aging based on a statistical analysis of field maintenance data (3) A method for providing PM planning guidance using estimated component reliability/performance parameters and decision tree analysis. Based on these investigations, two MMSSs were developed. One deals with "general maintenance data", which are common to all component types and are amenable to common data handling. The other system deals with "specific maintenance data", which are specific to an individual component type. Both systems provide PM planning guidance for PM cycles propriety and the PM work priority. The function of these systems were verified using simulated maintenance data.

The algorithm consisted of 14 specific patient management loops and 31 decision nodes. During a 4-month period, the management decisions and clinical course of 434 trauma patients were prospectively observed. Thirty-four patients had no signs of life on arrival to the emergency department (ED) and were excluded from the statistical evaluation; the remaining 400 patients constituted the study group. The mean Injury Severity Score (ISS), Penetrating Abdominal Trauma Index (PATI), and Trauma Score (TS) scores in the series were 21 +/- 10, 34 +/- 12, and 13 +/- 3. The overall patient mortality of the study group was 17 per cent; it was 61 per cent in those patients with major deviations from the algorithm and 6 per cent in patients who complied with the algorithm. The ISS, PATI, and TS scores were 29 +/- 9, 32 +/- 12, and 13 +/- 2 in patients with deviations and 20 +/- 10, 37 +/- 12, and 14 +/- 2 in patients who complied with the algorithm. Of the 37 patients who died with major deviations from the algorithm, the deviation was directly contributory to death in 21 cases (57%) and probably contributory in another 14 cases (38%). There were 108 patients with ISS scores between 20 and 50. In this group, mortality was 55 per cent when a major deviation occurred and 5 per cent without major deviations from the algorithm. The authors conclude that the survival of trauma patients may be improved by following the specific management criteria outlined by the algorithm.

The problem example illustrating results of all the procedures was the gestational age which had to be forecasted on the basis of variables describing not only the current pregnancy but also the previous ones. The best result, the highest prognostic accuracy (61.31% as absolute and 53.06% as relative one), was achieved by using the combination of two methods: decision tree construction and Bayesian approach as >>First Tree Than Bayes<< approach. This result can be considered as much more valuable, taking into account the fact that selected predictor system is not very close to the outcome which has to be predicted.

J	KRAFT, C				KRAFT, C			CLOSED SOLUTION OF BERLEKAMP ALGORITHM FOR FAST DECODING OF BCH CODES	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS			English	Letter								We present a decision tree solution for the most complicated step in decoding binary BCH codes, namely the computation of an error location polynomial over GF(2m) from the syndrome vector of received data. We run Lin's iterative version of the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm symbolically, keeping the results at each level in the form of branches of a binary decision tree. A decoder can then be constructed that uses the derived formulas to evaluate a decision variable at each level. Complete traversal of the tree using the decision variables leads to the correct polynomial coefficients for the received vector. The decoder can be implemented in a very straightforward way with a simple processor or program that performs extension field arithmetic, or it can be realized entirely in hardware using lookup tables for multiplications, inverses, and exponents, and exclusive OR operations for addition. This latter method can provide an extremely fast decoder that is compatible with realization in VLSI.

Five population studies are discussed: 1) screening the general population; 2) screening the patients of a general practice; 3) diagnosing initial patients referred to a periodontist; 4) monitoring periodontal maintenance patients; and 5) monitoring postsurgical refractory patients. A decision tree is constructed in which the primary decision branches are test and no test. Chance branches after the test branch were test positive and test negative. The treatment alternatives in the treatment branches were prophylaxis and oral hygiene, scaling and root planing, and advanced periodontal therapy (including surgical intervention and/or antibiotics or chemotherapies). Probabilities for the prevalence of disease in each population were obtained from epidemiological surveys. Disease activity and outcome states were estimated from clinical studies of periodontal treatment. For initial periodontal patients, using a sensitivity of .87 and a specificity of .84 the value of the test branch is .851 versus .566 for the no test branch. Assumptions on the diagnostic test's sensitivity and specificity and the utility of outcomes were tested with the decision analysis techniques of sensitivity and 2-way threshold analyses. These analyses show that using a test had a greater value than no test for older patients in the general practitioner's office, and for the 3 types of periodontal treatment patients. In contrast, using the test had a lower value than not using the test in younger dental patients in the general practitioner's office and for screening the general population. The diagnostic and treatment schemes proposed here are amenable to rigorous testing to evaluate their reliability and usefulness.

J	NISAN, N				NISAN, N			CREW PRAMS AND DECISION TREES	SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						PRAM; DECISION TREES; BLOCK SENSITIVITY	BOUNDS	This paper gives a full characterization of the time needed to compute a boolean function on a CREW PRAM with an unlimited number of processors. The characterization is given in terms of a new complexity measure of boolean functions: the "block sensitivity," a generalization of the well-known "critical sensitivity" measure. The block sensitivity is also shown to relate to the boolean decision tree complexity, and the implication is that the decision tree complexity also fully characterizes the CREW PRAM complexity. This solves an open problem of Wegener. The results imply that changes in the instruction set of the processors or in the capacity of the shared memory cells do not change by more than a constant factor the time required by a CREW PRAM to compute any boolean function. Moreover, it is shown that a seemingly weaker version of a CREW PRAM, the CROW PRAM, can compute functions as quickly as a general CREW PRAM. This solves an open problem of Dymond and Ruzzo. Finally, the results have implications regarding the power of randomization in the boolean decision tree model. It is shown that in this model, randomization may achieve only a polynomial speedup over deterministic computation. This was known for Las Vegas randomized computation; it is also proven for one-sided error computation (a quadratic bound) and two-sided error (a cubic bound).

J	COLLINS, MT; MORGAN, IR				COLLINS, MT; MORGAN, IR			ECONOMIC DECISION-ANALYSIS MODEL OF A PARATUBERCULOSIS TEST AND CULL PROGRAM	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article							LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT-ASSAY; PARA-TUBERCULOSIS; JOHNES DISEASE; MYCOBACTERIUM-PARATUBERCULOSIS; VETERINARY PRACTICE; TREE ANALYSIS; DAIRY-CATTLE; DIAGNOSIS; ELISA; IMMUNODIFFUSION	A spreadsheet program was written to perform decision tree analysis for control of paratuberculosis (Johne's disease), when testing all adults in a herd and culling all animals with positive test results. The program incorporated diagnostic test sensitivity, specificity, and test cost with the cost or value of each of the 4 possible outcomes; true-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and false-negative test results. The program was designed to repeat the analysis for the independent variable pretest paratuberculosis prevalence (0 to 100%). Model output was graphed as profit or loss in dollars vs pretest prevalence. The threshold was defined as the pretest prevalence at which benefit-cost equaled zero. Reed-Frost disease modeling techniques were used to predict the number of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis-infected replacement heifers resulting from infected cows during a control program. Sensitivity analysis was performed on variables of the decision tree model; test sensitivity, specificity, test cost, and factors affecting the cost of paratuberculosis to a commercial dairy. A test and cull program was profitable when paratuberculosis caused greater-than-or-equal-to 6% decrease in milk production if the pretest prevalence was > 6%, test sensitivity was 50%, test specificity was 98%, and the testing cost was $4/cow. Test specificities > 98% did not markedly affect the threshold for tests with a 50% sensitivity and costing $4/cow. Test sensitivity had minimal effect on the threshold. Using a diagnostic test with a 50% sensitivity and a 98% specificity as an example, test cost was shown to affect the threshold prevalence at which the test and cull program became profitable. Any test costing less-than-or-equal-to $8/cow was roughly equivalent in profit threshold. Given the characteristics of most diagnostic tests for paratuberculosis in use today, and assuming that paratuberculosis causes at least a 6% decrease in milk production of cows, the decision analysis model suggested a test and cull program should be profitable when pretest paratuberculosis herd prevalence is > 5%.

The problem solving strategy followed a four-step procedure: defining the problem, gathering information, stepwise decision making by means of a heuristic decision tree and a selection of biomedical and clinimetric trials for answering the questions in this decision tree and finally drawing conclusions. An antihistamine H-1- + H-2-propylaxis was rationally, not definitely recommended for patients at risk (previous reactions to i.v. agents, atopy, multimorbidity or age > 70 years) on the basis of drawing conclusions after passing stepwise the heuristic decision tree. Definitive answers can be expected from two randomized trials in Mainz and Frankfurt, the conduct of which is finished and which are at present in the phase of data analysis. They investigate the effectiveness of the H-1- + H-2-prophylaxis in high risk patients as identified in our problem solving strategy.

A 'decision tree' classification based on the percentage of nucleolated nuclei, percentage of nuclei with two or more nucleoli and mean major nuclear diameter was adopted. We observed that the reproducibility and the validity of the follicular adenoma vs follicular carcinoma discrimination are greater than in the subjective evaluation. Moreover, similar classification results were obtained when measurements were performed either with a fully automated image analysis system or with semiautomatic or manual instrumentation. As for reproducibility of the inter-instrument comparisons, the k statistic values ranged from 0.85 to 1.00 (mean value 0.90, that is, an 'almost perfect' degree of agreement); in the subjective evaluations, the inter-observer comparisons showed values ranging from 0.20 to 0.56 (mean value 0.37, that is, 'fair'). In the decision tree classification, feature value thresholds were selected in order to have specificity of 100% and the predictive value of a positive result (carcinoma) of 100%; accuracy was 87% (range 86-89%), sensitivity 74% (71-79%), the predictive value of a negative result (adenoma) 79% (78-82%). In the subjective evaluation the values were as follows: accuracy 67% (64-71%), sensitivity 57% (50-64%), specificity 77% (71-79%), predictive value of a negative result (adenoma) 64% (61-69%), predictive value of a positive result (carcinoma) 71% (67-75%). The conclusion is that, by using a routine microscope equipped with a micrometer, the preoperative diagnosis of follicular carcinoma from smears can be formulated with a high degree of certainty.

To exactly embody the shape information of PCBs, morphological skeleton is utilized to extract rotation-and translation-invariant features. This kind of multiscale shape representation constructs a multiscale automatic visual inspection technique. During the feature verification, we introduce a decision tree classifier. Both feature extraction and verification are implementable in a parallel architecture, which is required by real-time inspection system.

These issues included: What are the goals of treatment? Who should not be treated with radiation? What are the optimal treatment regimens? What are the areas of controversy where future investigations may be useful? The brain consensus panel attempted to develop guidelines for radiation oncologists through use of a decision tree format. Existing data to support management decisions, particularly those regarding radiation treatment, were reviewed. Data regarding cost of treatment as well as data regarding explicit quality of life measures were felt to be very important but were largely not available and therefore played little scientific role in the guideline development. Areas where controversy existed and where consensus could not be reached were identified.

It incorporates a graph-editor called Gr2 and a Dutch natural language dialogue system called DoNaLD. EDWARD is capable of realizing referring actions in three ways: it can utter unimodal referring expressions, it can generate pointing gestures and it can produce multimodal referring expressions which combine referring expressions with a pointing gesture. The system uses its knowledge base and a context model to decide the type and the conceptual content of its referring expressions. The context model used is based on Alshawi's notions of context factors and salience. Presently seven types of context factors are used. The decision tree and a set of rules used by EDWARD to guide the generation process axe described.

This system inductively learns classification knowledge in the form of a decision tree, and analyzes the results and the processes with domain and task specific knowledge to detect improper states. Then it asks suggestive questions to eliminate the improprieties and acquires new domain knowledge for the next induction cycle. One of the final objectives of this research is to frame a unified theory in the classification trees' paradigm arguing: (1) what means to have a good/bad tree; (2) why it is good/bad; and (3) how to obtain a better one. To achieve this goal, KAISER has been enhanced with a meta-learner named Meta-KAISER to accumulate the meta-knowledge by keeping track of the experts' response of domain level interaction.

Since the control structure of Decision Making Processes (DMP's) tends to be very complex, it is difficult to apply structured methods to the development of specifications. This paper provides a formal meaning for the term ''specification'' as it applies to DMP's and which can be used as a design and evaluation standard.

We show that if f can be represented in k - DNF form and in j - CNF form, then O(n log(min{j, k}/q)) queries suffice to compute f with probability of error less than q. This work uses a new approach to extend results of Feige, Raghavan, Peleg and Upfal, who proved the same bound for a narrower class of functions.

We present a minimum space algorithm that sorts stably a multiset in asymptotically optimal worst-case time. A Quicksort type approach is used, where at each recursive step the median is chosen as the partitioning element. To obtain a stable minimum space implemention, we develop linear-time in-place algorithms for the following problems, which have interest of their own: Stable unpartitioning: Assume that an n-element array A is stably partitioned into two subarrays A0 and A1. The problem is to recover A from its constituents A0 and A1. The information available is the partitioning element used and a bit array of size n indicating whether an element of A0 or A1 was originally in the corresponding position of A.

To describe such concepts, the method employs a two-tiered representation. in which the first tier captures explicitly basic concept properties, and the second tier characterizes allowable concept's modifications and context dependency. In the proposed method, the first tier, called Base Concept Representation (BCR), is created in two phases. In phase 1. the AQ-15 rule learning program is applied to induce a complete and consistent concept description from supplied examples. In phase 2, this description is optimized according to a domain-dependent quality criterion. The second tier, called the inferential concept interpretation (ICI), consists of a procedure for flexible matching, and a set of inference rules. The proposed method has been implemented in the POSEIDON system, and experimentally tested on two real-world problems: learning the concept of an acceptable union contract, and learning voting patterns of Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Congress. For comparison, a few other learning methods were also applied to the same problems. These method, included simple variants of exemplar-based learning, and an ID-3-type decision tree learning, implemented in the ASSISTANT program. In the experiments, POSEIDON generated concept descriptions that were both, more accurate and also substantially simpler than those produced by the other methods.

A review and comparison paper by Mingers (Mingers, 1989) looked at the first stage of tree building, which uses a "splitting rule" to grow trees with a greedy recursive partitioning algorithm. That paper considered a number of different measures and experimentally examined their behavior on four domains. The main conclusion was that a random splitting rule does not significantly decrease classificational accuracy. This note suggests an alternative experimental method and presents additional results on further domains. Our results indicate that random splitting leads to increased error. These results are at variance with those presented by Mingers.

The result serves to give a better understanding of the entropy measure, to point out that the behavior of the information entropy heuristic possesses desirable properties that justify its usage in a formal sense, and to improve the efficiency of evaluating continuous-valued attributes for cut value selection. Along with the formal proof, we present empirical results that demonstrate the theoretically expected reduction in evaluation effort for training data sets from real-world domains.

This test has a high sensitivity but equivocal images may led to complementary tests including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or bone biopsy. Based on bone metastases prevalence, scintigraphy is recommended for patients entering a therapeutic trial, having bone pain, having a non characteristic bone abnormality on radiography or CT, having a non epidermoid histology or having associated pathologies inceasing the risk of surgery. The utility of bone scan is questionable for patients having a Stage I or II epidermoid cancer, having already evidence of bone metastases or for whom the result of the bone scan will not change the therapeutic management. After a negative bone scan, there will be probably an indication for MRI at search of small infra-scintigraphic osteo-medullary metastases.

A decision-tree-based model has been developed which enables the calculation of expected costs and expected numbers of hepatitis A virus HAV infections based on different intervention strategies. The model is sufficiently generic to allow for the evaluation of both population-wide strategies and strategies targeted at particular risk groups. An economic analysis focusing on travellers from Europe to high-endemic countries compared a non-intervention strategy to the following three strategies: active immunization with HAV vaccine; screening for HAV antibodies and vaccinating only susceptibles; passive immunization by means of immunoglobulin. The net cost per HAV infection prevented proved very sensitive to a number of important input parameters of the model. These included epidemiological characteristics such as HAV attack rate and prevalence of immunity, behavioural characteristics such as compliance with the vaccination scheme and vaccine characteristics such as rate and duration of protection. Our estimated expected cost per HAV infection prevented among Belgian travellers to high-endemic countries for three weeks per year over ten years amounts to approximately US$4880 for active immunization, US$5621 for screening followed by vaccination of susceptibles and US$29932 for passive immunization. Although these estimates are clearly sensitive to a number of crucial assumptions pertaining to the input parameters of the model, it seems safe to conclude that vaccination is more cost-effective than the currently recommended passive immunization with immunoglobulin. Screening for antibodies before vaccinating may be more cost-effective for risk groups having a sufficiently high prevalence of immunity.

The goal of the analysis has been to identify the technical and operational solutions, with respect mainly to the Logistic Support System design, to guarantee operational availability thereby minimizing delays. To this purpose, the FMEA and Fault Tree analysis technique for reliability assessment of each subsystems have been supplemented by a Event Tree Analysis performed through a computer package (ADMIRA). All sequences of failure and/or success for the whole system have been analyzed during the whole operation steps. This analysis has allowed an estimate of the delay for each possible system state. The analysis performed has shown that the Event Tree approach is a very adequate tool to handle situations where failures occurrence and dependencies among different events have to be taken into account. Of course this problem could be handled as well with conventional methods as FTA, though it would require complex and skilled manipulations of the many "trees". The FMEA/FTA method has been limited to specific analysis of subsystems whose states are considered independent from other subsystems states, thou obtaining failure probabilities that are inserted at the appropriate nodes of a decision tree. The inductive reasoning has permitted to follow system behaviour and to identify all possible output states. Such representation of the system permits: to evaluate the probability distribution of each state in which the global mission has been subdivided; to evaluate the probability-consequence curves for a number of parameters of interest (time delay, costs, ecc.), by associating a value representing the parameter itself to each state. In this study such parameter has been the time delay, so deriving a delay distribution for each module operation. Such delay distribution as well as meteorological statistics data correlated to the area of operation have been used to perform a Monte Carlo simulation. This allowed an assessment of the distribution of mission duration as a function of the area of operation, the type of support vessel used and the logistic support system chosen both at ground level and on board. The whole analysis has led to improved design, operator skills and training as well as support system definition.

Decision analysis, which is a formal framework for dealing with such issues, has been applied to a variety of public-sector problems over the last two decades. A limitation of using decision analysis is the often onerous assessment burden it places on the decision maker (DM). We have developed a novel interactive procedure and Decision Support System (DSS) for performing decision analysis on the personal computer, called robust interactive decision analysis (RID), which avoids the difficult problems of precisely assessing a DM's utility and state probability functions associated with traditional decision tree analysis. The RID method permits a DM to voluntarily and interactively express strong (viz, sure) binary preferences for actions, partial decision functions, and full decision functions, and only imprecise probability and utility function assessments. The inputs are used with various dominance operators via a mathematical programming framework to prune the state probability, utility, and decision space until there is convergence on a relatively small subset of efficient strategies or an optimal choice strategy. Conceptually, the operation of the RID method can be regarded as a state-space pruning system and its computer implementation as a DSS. In this paper, we extended the RID concept and DSS to deal with multiple-criteria decisions, obviating the need to precisely and completely assess attribute weights (tradeoffs), consequences, and/or value/utility functions. The approach, which we call multiple-criteria robust interactive decision analysis, MCRID, is developed, illustrated, and shown to be effective in eliminating many inefficient alternatives. However, since the aggregate utility of each alternative is interval-valued, it then becomes difficult to intuitively choose an optimal alternative from among the remaining efficient ones since the intervals are not defined by any specific probability distributions. We have tentatively shown that aggregate utility intervals ultimately converge toward a normal density function, and can be so approximated with	PURDUE UNIV,DEPT AGR ECON,W LAFAYETTE,IN 47907; PURDUE UNIV,DEPT ELECT ENGN,W LAFAYETTE,IN 47907	MOSKOWITZ, H (reprint author), PURDUE UNIV,KRANNERT GRAD SCH MANAGEMENT,W LAFAYETTE,IN 47907, USA.

Certain ST-segment patterns correlate with various degrees of ischemia. Overall, stress testing has a sensitivity and a specificity of about 70 and 75 percent, respectively, but the results are even more useful than this when considered in light of the pre- and post-test probability of coronary artery disease. Use of the exercise test score and decision-tree algorithms is helpful in clinical decision making.

This paper reports on the development, testing, an commissioning of an expert system for the on-line control of a distribution network. The expert system is used to determine the optimal switching operation sequence for load rerouting during fault restoration, emergency operation overload relieving, and network maintenance planning. The main features of the system can be summarized as follows. Employment of hierarchical structure of knowledge base decision tree, introduction of function-oriented and network scale-oriented rules, easily changable priorities used during decision making can be done using a CRT display, in addition to the facility of changing the network operating constraints. The results of such changes can be evaluated by a built-in simulator using a snapshot of the on-line data. A tracing facility is also introduced to trace the reasoning during the decision making process. The techniques used, development process, system evaluation and testing are reported.

For this strategy to work effectively, sufficient knowledge is required to enable prediction of which rule is the best to use under the current line status. In this paper, a new learning algorithm for acquiring such knowledge is proposed. In this algorithm, a binary decision tree is automatically generated using empirical data obtained by iterative production line simulations, and it decides in real time which rule to be used at decision points during the actual production operations. The configuration of the developed dynamic scheduling system and the learning algorithm are described in detail. Simulation results on its application to the dispatching problem are discussed with regard to its scheduling performance and learning capability.

J	RAMANAN, P				RAMANAN, P			TESTING THE OPTIMALITY OF ALPHABETIC TREES	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article							SEARCH TREES; LENGTH	In this paper, we consider the worst-case time complexity of constructing optimal alphabetic trees. Hu and Tucker (1971) presented an O(n log h) algorithm for this problem in the linear decision tree model. On the other hand, there are only 2-THETA(n) different solutions (outputs) for this problem and, so, the only obvious lower bound in the decision tree model is OMEGA(n). One way to resolve this disparity is to consider the complexity of testing if a given alphabetic tree is optimal (for a given sequence of weights). Using the correctness of the Hu-Tucker algorithm, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions on the weight sequence for a given tree to be optimal. These conditions are derived from the shape of the tree, level-by-level. bottom-up. From this, it is easily seen that the optimality of very skewed trees (i.e. trees in which the number of nodes in each level is bounded by some constant) can be tested in linear time. We show that the optimality of well-balanced trees (i.e. trees in which the maximum difference between the levels of any two leaves is bounded by some constant) can also be tested in linear time. Finally, we consider a class of trees that is neither skewed nor well balanced, and discuss the difficulty and the issues involved in testing its optimality in linear time. It is not clear if the optimality of an arbitrary tree can be tested in linear time.		RAMANAN, P (reprint author), WICHITA STATE UNIV,DEPT COMP SCI,WICHITA,KS 67208, USA.

These approaches are unsatisfactory when the problem to be solved has features that can ''trade-off'' in the recommendation process. A quantitative system is proposed that permits tradeoffs and can be built and modified incrementally. This quantitative approach extends other knowledge-engineering techniques in its knowledge representation and aggregation facilities. The system is demonstrated on the domain of ordinary differential equation initial value problems. The results are significantly superior to an existing qualitative (decision tree) system.

We propose a THETA(\rho\log\rho\) time algorithm for constructing a BST on a point set-rho, with points labeled as Steiner or demand; a lower bound, in the linear decision tree model, is also established. We show that if we further want to minimize the number of used Steiner points, then the problem becomes NP-complete. Finally, we show that when locations of Steiner points are not fixed then the problem remains NP-complete; however, if the topology of the final tree is given, then the problem can be solved in THETA(\rho\log\rho\) time. The BST problem finds application, for example, in VLSI layout, communication network design, and (facility) location problems.

Considerations in clinicians' decisions about initiation and selection of acute somatic treatment for patients with major depression are then discussed. Current somatic therapies for nondelusional depression are described, with emphasis on the mechanisms of action of the drugs employed, the relationship between mechanism of action and side effect profile and the selection of a drug on the basis of its side effect profile. The three current strategies for the treatment of delusional depression-electroconvulsive therapy, the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic agent, and amoxapine alone-are then reviewed.

The decision trees are assumed to have a fixed number of stages and predefined possible states at every stage. The costs of traversing the tree are characterized as approximate and defined as fuzzy numbers. Two search methods, each drawing from an existing non-fuzzy search algorithm, are described. The first method is a dynamic programming search, where the principle of optimality with fuzzy costs is addressed. The second method is an A* search for which the notion of a lower bound estimate of costs is utilized to increase the efficiency of the search. Algorithms for each method are included. Theorems and proofs which complete the analytical development of these techniques are also included. Finally, a numerical example illustrating the procedure is given.

Their approach uses survival data to distinguish two attributes of utility: prolongation of life and quality of life (QOL). Health-state transition probabilities correspond to the prolongation of life and are modeled in a discrete-time transient semi-Markov process. Quality-of-life-state transition probabilities are derived from the assumptions of a simple recurrent Markov process. They reflect events within the health-state sojourn time that differentiate perceptions of pain and suffering over a short fixed time period. Outcomes for these two dimensions of utility are highly relevant to the assessment of medical technology that might prolong life at the cost of increased pain and suffering, implying a reduced QOL. The methods are demonstrated on a subset of follow-up data from the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT).

Together with the well-known O(n log n) upper bound for finding a closest pair, this settles an open problem of Lee and Preparata. We also extend this O(n log n) upper bound to the following problem: Given a collection of sets with a total of n points in the plane, find for each point a closest neighbor that does not belong to the same set.

We used the model to test the most likely effects of treatment (determined by averaging the values in reports of large studies) and the worst effects reported so far. The program begins by asking the patient's age, the hours from the onset of pain, and the probability of acute myocardial infarction. It then provides an opportunity to perform sensitivity analyses by changing the values for these variables and for the probability of death in the absence of thrombolytic therapy, as well as for the probability of major stroke and hemorrhage. The counterintuitive findings observed with this program are that the benefits of thrombolytic therapy increase with age and that young patients derive surprisingly little benefit from it.

This paper presents a polynomial-time approximate algorithm for designing a probabilistic decision tree. The obtained tree is near-optimal for the cost, defined as the weighted sum of the expected test execution time and expected loss. The algorithm is advantageous over other reported heuristics from the viewpoint that the goodness of the solution is theoretically guaranteed. That is, the relative deviation of the obtained tree cost from the exact optimum is not more than a positive constant epsilon, which can be set arbitrarily small. When the given loss function is Hamming metric, the time efficiency is further improved by using the information theoretical lower bound on the tree cost. The time efficiency of the algorithm and the accuracy of the solutions were evaluated through computational experiments. The results show that the computing time increases very slowly with an increase in problem size and the relative error of the obtained solution is much less than the upper bound epsilon for most problems.

J	SHAW, MJ; PARK, S; RAMAN, N				SHAW, MJ; PARK, S; RAMAN, N			INTELLIGENT SCHEDULING WITH MACHINE LEARNING CAPABILITIES - THE INDUCTION OF SCHEDULING KNOWLEDGE	IIE TRANSACTIONS			English	Article							EXPERT SYSTEMS	Dynamic scheduling of manufacturing systems has primarily involved the use of dispatching rules. In the context of conventional job shops, the relative performance of these rules has been found to depend upon the system attributes, and no single rule is dominant across all possible scenarios. This indicates the need for developing a scheduling approach which adopts a state-dependent dispatching rule selection policy. The importance of adapting the dispatching rule employed to the current state of the system is even more critical in a flexible manufacturing system because of alternative machine routing possibilities and the need for increased coordination among various machines. This study develops a framework for incorporating machine learning capabilities in intelligent scheduling. A pattern-directed method, with a built-in inductive learning module, is developed for heuristic acquisition and refinement. This method enables the scheduler to classify distinct manufacturing patterns and to generate a decision tree consisting of heuristic policies for dynamically selecting the dispatching rule appropriate for a given set of system attributes. Computational experience indicates that the learning-augmented approach leads to improved system performance. In addition, the process of generating the decision tree shows the efficacy of inductive learning in extracting and ranking the various system attributes relevant for deciding upon the appropriate dispatching rule to employ.

Whether to perform periodic rectal examinations in asymptomatic men as a screening test for prostatic cancer remains controversial. A randomized clinical trial that tests the efficacy of further evaluation and treatment of men who have been found to have asymptomatic prostate nodules may never be carried out. Decision analysis was therefore used to further investigate this clinical issue. Methods. A decision tree was developed to model the decision of whether to biopsy an asymptomatic prostate nodule found by digital rectal examination in a 65-year-old man by his primary care physician. Test operating characteristics, probabilities of disease at different stages, probabilities of side effects from various treatments, and average life expectancies were obtained from the medical literature. Utilities for the various possible health outcome states were obtained from ratings by two experienced primary care physicians using the Kaplan-Anderson Quality of Well-Being Scale. These were used to adjust the quality-of-life expectancies for each outcome state. Multiple sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the conclusions. Results. Disregarding patient utilities, the average survival benefit of evaluation and treatment is 1.1 months. When quality-of-life adjustments are included in the analysis, evaluation and treatment results in an average loss of 3.5 quality-adjusted months of life. Factors that shift the decision toward evaluation and treatment include a positive predictive value of a prostate nodule for cancer of 49% or greater, specificity of prostate biopsy of 98.3% or greater, and the availability of much more effective treatment for stage D cancers. Factors that do not substantially affect the decision are cancer-free life expectancy, the percentage of cancers that are stage B at time of discovery, the sensitivity of prostate biopsy, and more effective treatment for stage C cancer, assuming the same rate of adverse consequences from treatment. Conclusions. The evaluation and treatment of prostatic nodules found by digital rectal examination in asymptomatic men in the primary care setting does not lead to significant improvement in life expectancy and adversely affects quality of life. Digital rectal examination should not be performed by primary care physicians as a screening test for prostate cancer.

J	MACPHERSON, DW; TONKIN, M				MACPHERSON, DW; TONKIN, M			CHOLERA VACCINATION - A DECISION-ANALYSIS	CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; TRAVELERS	Objectives: To examine the clinical impact and financial cost of a vaccination program for the prevention of cholera in North Americans travelling to endemic and epidemic regions by means of the principles of decision analysis and a decision tree as well as to illustrate the effect of case attack rates on the cost per case prevented by vaccination. Design: Review of the scientific literature to establish the probabilities of each significant outcome as well as a decision analysis and partial economic evaluation. Outcome measures: Clinical impact (attack rates for cholera among vaccinated and nonvaccinated travellers), rates of death associated with cholera and vaccine-associated adverse events (VAAEs), and the number of VAAEs and the vaccine cost per case prevented. Main results: On the basis of our assumptions (including a rate of one case of cholera per 500 000 journeys to endemic regions), to prevent one case of cholera a vaccination program would cost $28.67 million and be associated with 105 VAAES. Conclusion: Routine vaccination of travellers to endemic areas cannot be recommended; however, for people travelling to regions with a high transmission rate vaccination should be considered.

As mortality and morbidity of liver biopsy are not negligible, and as this invasive procedure is unpleasant for the patient and urges clinical admission, we evaluated the possibility of ruling out severe liver pathology by means of ultrasonography, which we compared to liver biopsy. We made this comparison by means of a decision tree. The advantages of this analysis are the clear definition of the decision problem and its alternatives, and the possibility of calculating the risk of each alternative, thus being able to choose the best diagnostic method. In this study, the results of various research groups are discussed, in which liver biopsy and liver ultrasound were compared. In our decision tree we used some of these results and other assumptions, based on comparable studies. We varied the biopsy mortality and the sensitivity of ultrasound to show the change in the risk of each alternative. Our analysis shows that the differences of expected values between the liver biopsy branch and the ultrasonography branch are relatively small. Therefore, we advise each center, which has at its disposal a specialist in liver ultrasonography, to re-evaluate its guidelines with regard to the detection of severe liver pathology before starting methotrexate for the treatment of psoriasis.

Hypertext offered two characteristics that matched characteristics of cataloging decisions: the capability of providing multidimensional structure to a multidimensional task, and data richness. The rules, examples, sample title pages, and tutorial material were implemented in HyperCard, along with graphics that suggest the cataloging environment. Several data structures were developed, including a decision tree to provide an overview and ready access to particular rules or tutorials. The hypertext environment proved successful for structuring and teaching choice of main and added entry. Implications discussed include the potential of hypertext to support instruction and cataloging workstations, changes in organizational structures, and the opportunity to redefine classroom instruction in cataloging.

This was accomplished through the development of a decision tree designed to improve the clinical problem-solving process by identifying key decision points. Prior to this, staff responded emotionally either by prematurely discharging patients or by not recognizing the problem at all.

The model used morbidity and mortality assumptions derived from the infectious-disease literature and cost assumptions based on 1990-91 Medicare Part A and Part B reimbursement costs. This analysis suggests that if Medicare reimbursed pharmacists for advising 100,000 patients at risk to accept influenza vaccine through vaccine-advocacy messages, for an apparent expenditure of $110,000, the increased rate of influenza vaccinations would avert 139 hospitalizations and 63 deaths, and actually yield Medicare a net savings of $280,588. These calculations probably underestimate the benefit to society of a pharmacy-based vaccine-advocacy program, because only direct costs to the single government agency were computed and no cost was attributed to death or lost earnings.

J	SERGEANT, ESG				SERGEANT, ESG			LEPTOSPIROSIS VACCINATION IN BEEF-CATTLE - USE OF DECISION TREE ANALYSIS	NEW ZEALAND VETERINARY JOURNAL			English	Article							ECONOMIC DECISIONS	Decision tree analysis was used to evaluate the economic benefits of leptospirosis vaccination in beef cattle. The analysis used estimated values for the cost of vaccination, the probability of calf losses from leptospirosis and the economic losses resulting from calf mortality to calculate the expected value of vaccination. A computer spreadsheet was used to calculate the expected value of the vaccination programme over a wide range of estimated costs and probabilities and to determine the break-even point at which vaccination becomes economic. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the outcome of the analysis was most dependent on calf value and the probability of calf loss due to leptospirosis. The analysis was relatively insensitive to changes in vaccine cost, vaccine efficacy and herd fertility.

The first two rounds were aimed at developing a consensus of panelists' opinions about problems leading to the high infant mortality rate in the study area. From these opinions, an Infant Mortality Preventability Decision Tree and a Problem List was developed. Panelists used these in Rounds III and IV to evaluate the case summaries. There were significant differences in the preventability ratings between physicians and nurses, indicating the importance of assessing individuals' philosophies of preventability when working with an interdisciplinary team of health care providers.

The SCID is a semistructured interview for making the major Axis I DSM-III-R diagnoses. It is administered by a clinician and includes an introductory overview followed by nine modules, seven of which represent the major axis I diagnostic classes. Because of its modular construction, it can be adapted for use in studies in which particular diagnoses are not of interest. Using a decision tree approach, the SCID guides the clinician in testing diagnostic hypotheses as the interview is conducted. The output of the SCID is a record of the presence or absence of each of the disorders being considered, for current episode (past month) and for lifetime occurrence.

Hysteroscopy can be used in such cases to differentiate between ectopic pregnancy and non-viable uterine pregnancy when viable uterine pregnancy has been ruled out. General anaesthesia and laparoscopy are avoided. We performed 60 hysteroscopic procedures between January 1989 and December 1990 in patients with suspected ectopic pregnancies. The pregnancy had been located by means of vaginal ultrasonography in every case in which the hCG was above 1500 IU/ml and in 36% of cases in which the beta-hCG was below this level. Hysteroscopy was hindered by metrorrhagia in three cases and was inconclusive in one, necessitating laparoscopy. Diagnosis was possible in all the remaining cases, as follows: ectopic pregnancy in 41 cases, with an empty uterus and occasional bleeding from an ostium; non-viable uterine pregnancy in 18 cases, with the presence of material within the cavity. Hysteroscopy therefore confirmed the diagnosis in 55% of the cases and was itself diagnostic in a further 43% of cases. Its sensitivity for the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy was 100% and its specificity 95%. We propose a diagnostic decision tree.

Assuming k is fixed, we show how to implement an order-statistic deque so that inject(x, D), eject(D), push(x, D), and pop(D) take O(log k) amortized time and find(k, D) takes worst-case constant time; the time bounds can be made worst case using a technique of Gajewska and Tarjan. We also show our implementations are optimal in the algebraic decision tree model of computation. This deque is applied to three problems: computing order-statistic filters, finding a smallest area convex quadrilateral in the plane, and computing "batched" order statistics.

The subject of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was selected because of the existence of widespread controversy regarding first the classification, pathophysiology and methods of investigation; and secondly, the approach to the therapy of GERD. In relation to the first area, tour issues were discussed: definition of disease severity; methods of investigation; relative importance of acid and motility in the pathogenesis of GERD; and complications. Regarding the approach to therapy, four areas were considered: therapy with lifestyle modification and over-the-counter therapy; approach to initial therapy; maintenance therapy; and medical versus surgical therapy, including treatment of complications. Each section was introduced to the entire group of participants by prepared talks on background information. This was followed by discussion in small groups of seven to 12 participants each. The small group sessions were then summarized by the session Chairperson, and were presented for further discussion to the entire group of 40 participants. The Chairperson then prepared a written summary of the group discussion. Agreement was reached in most areas and a suggested decision tree for the management of patients with GERD was developed: the majority of persons with GERD symptoms have mild gastroesophageal reflux disease; most people with GERD do not see a physician, and most do well on self-administered over-the-counter therapy. When the person presents to his/her family physician, the suggested initial treatment for symptomatic GERD should consist of lifestyle modification, over-the-counter therapy and H-2-blockers. Prokinetics as initial treatment should be used only under special conditions. Probably about two persons in three will improve on lifestyle modification, over-the-counter therapy and H-2-blockers. If the patient with symptoms of GERD does not respond to this initial four to eight weeks of therapy, the physician has to suspect the presence of more serious disease such as erosive esophagitis, esophagitis with complications, or disease other than GERD. Therefore, before starting proton pump inhibitors, endoscopy is indicated. Diagnostic motility studies (24 h pH and/or motility and Bernstein test) are needed only under special conditions. GERD is a chronic relapsing disease and frequently maintenance therapy is needed, particularly when the patient has had endoscopically-proven erosive esophagitis. Maintenance therapy should be undertaken with the least potent drug that prevents relapse. To date, in severe disease the best data for maintenance therapy would favour the use of a proton pump inhibitor over standard doses of an H-2-blocker, but higher doses of H-2-blocker therapy may prove to be useful in some patients. Most patients with GERD (even those with complications) can be managed medically, but there are surgical indications to be considered in individual patients. A 'Decision Tree' for the suggested management of patients with GERD was developed to facilitate the clinical approach to this common clinical condition. The opinions expressed at this conference represent a consensus based on what we know today, and should not be taken as a definitive guide to practice for every patient and under all circumstances.									0	10	10	MEDICARE PUBL INC, PULSUS GROUP INC	OAKVILLE	2902 S SHERIDAN WAY, OAKVILLE ON L6J 7L6, CANADA	0835-7900		CAN J GASTROENTEROL	Can.

Often the problem is cast as a decision tree which is then translated into a set of rules. However, all decision-making problems cannot be cast into this mold. Decisions are usually based on a number of criteria (and possibly subcriteria) which are accepted or established as important to the particular decision. The experience, expertise and accuracy with which the criteria are rated and combined into an overall rating determine the success of the decision. Experts often find it difficult to express their decisions in clear-cut terms. Two experts may not completely agree on the answers to a given problem. The question then is how to capture and represent this uncertainty in decision-making? Current implementations of expert systems employ probability theory, certainty factors and fuzzy set theory. These methods are often found inadequate or unsuitable for the problem leading to less than satisfactory implementation and performance. Within the social science and business fields, a method called the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) has been utilized on a number of different problems. AHP offers a mathematical methodology based on pairwise comparisons which is well-suited for a variety of different problems in both the chemical engineering domain and the expert system domain and it is easily understood by the experts. The AHP structure is applicable to the chemical engineering domain and it is easily implemented in an expert system. This paper will present the AHP methodology and illustrate its use for the engineering problem of chemical laboratory reactor selection. Also, the results of the implementation of AHP into an expert system for laboratory reactor selection will be discussed.		HANRATTY, PJ (reprint author), WASHINGTON UNIV,ST LOUIS,MO 63130, USA.

The classification system, called morphology and timing intracardiac classifier [MATIC], follows a classification process similar to that used by cardiologists. Timing between the atrial and ventricular channels is examined using a decision tree and forms the primary criterion for arrhythmia classification. A neural network based morphology classifier is used for cases such as ventricular tachycardia with 1:1 retrograde conduction where timing alone cannot make a reliable decision. MATIC achieves 99.6% correct classification on a database of intracardiac electrogram [ICEG] signals containing 12,483 QRS complexes recorded from 67 patients during electrophysiological studies. Arrhythmias in this database include sinus tachycardia, normal sinus rhythm, normal sinus rhythm with bundle branch block, sinus tachycardia with bundle branch block, atrial fibrillation [AF], various supraventricular tachycardias, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia with 1:1 retrograde conduction, and ventricular fibrillation. Within these arrhythmias, there were numerous ventricular ectopic beats, fusion beats, noise, and other artifacts. MATIC addresses the classification problem from start to finish, inputs being raw intracardiac electrogram signals and the outputs being the recommended ICD therapy. Results achieved with MATIC were compared with a classifier used in the Telectronics Guardian ATP 4210, which achieved 75.9% correct classification on the same database. MATIC is simple and efficient, making it suitable for use in a low power implantable device.		LEONG, PHW (reprint author), UNIV SYDNEY,DEPT ELECT ENGN,SYDNEY,NSW 2006,AUSTRALIA.

J	SONNENBERG, A; TOWNSEND, WF				SONNENBERG, A; TOWNSEND, WF			PREOPERATIVE TESTING FOR FECAL OCCULT BLOOD - A QUESTIONABLE PRACTICE	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY			English	Article							COLORECTAL-CANCER; SENSITIVITY; PATTERNS	The benefit of fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) in patients without gastrointestinal symptoms who are hospitalized for an elective surgical procedure is uncertain. To resolve this issue, we analyzed the costs and benefits of preoperative FOBT by the model of a decision tree. In 2- and 3-way sensitivity analyses, the costs of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the probabilities of their various outcomes are varied simultaneously so that we might study their joint influence on the outcome of the decision analysis. The decision analysis shows that preoperative FOBT is associated with a smaller benefit than would be its omission. The higher cost and lower net benefit of preoperative FOBT reflect the impact of false-positive tests for occult blood. False-positive FOBT leads to expenditures for negative gastrointestinal work-ups, increased procedural costs, and a diminished rate of success for the elective surgical procedure, by delaying it. This outcome of the analysis is insensitive to large variations in the costs and probabilities built into the model. We conclude that screening for fecal occult blood provides no benefit if done routinely in patients who are hospitalized for any major surgical procedure.

The processing stages include image segmentation, feature extraction, object classification and slide classification. Mathematical morphology functions were implemented in hardware with custom-built gate array processors for image segmentation. There were 68 features used for classifier training. In object classification we combined the evidential supports of a binary decision tree classifier and a multilayer perceptron classifier to achieve an integrated decision. In this feasibility study, 449 conventionally prepared cervical Papanicolaou smears were tested in a prototype research system between January and May 1991. The 95% confidence interval for the slide false-negative rate was 1-9%, and the 95% confidence interval for the slide sort rate was 45-55%. The estimated sort rate for clearly normal slides is within the range required for a cost-efficient screening system, and the estimated false-negative rate for premalignant and malignant smears is an improvement over published false-negative rates for human performance. Several performance improvement efforts are still under way. We expect that they will result in a vastly reduced slide false-negative rate.

In order to achieve flexibility in experimentation, we have developed a software system for stating experimental protocols that involve decision-making based on experimental data. These decision-making capabilities enable strategic experimentation, where experiments are altered or terminated based on prior or newly acquired data. An experiment planner provides for experimentation in an automated chemistry workstation using the simplex algorithm or a decision-tree programming approach. The composite modified simplex algorithm is used for optimization experiments. Simplex experiments are planned through a series of menus. The simplex algorithm can be altered in sophistication by turning features on or off in software. The simplex algorithm is well-suited for optimizations but provides no general decision-making capabilities. A general decision-tree programming module enables the composition of diverse experimental protocols which capture the logic of experimentation. Experimental protocols written with a text editor are converted by an interpreter to a set of procedural events. Experimental protocols can be composed that execute incisive actions based on data from ongoing experiments. Protocols have been written for automatically matching samples with analytical instruments and performing an automated dye titration. Resource consumption cannot be predicted in advance in closed-loop experimentation, thus a static resource manager is used with each simplex cycle and a dynamic resource manager is used in decision-tree experimentation. The resource managers and strategic decision-making features empower the workstation to function autonomously in pursuit of the research objectives started by the scientist.

J	RAMANI, KV				RAMANI, KV			GRAPHICS BASED INSTRUCTIONAL SOFTWARE FOR DECISION TREE ANALYSIS USING BAYESIAN METHODOLOGY	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article								We have designed and developed a graphics based software package "BAYES" to demonstrate the Bayesian methodology (before and after sampling) for solving decision problems under uncertainty involving two decision alternatives. The user is guided through a step by step procedure in developing the decision tree and evaluating the consequences at each node of the tree. Consequences are evaluated by computing the expected "pay offs" and the "opportunity losses". Choosing the best decision after sampling involves computing various statistics such as EVSI (Expected Value of Sample Information), AMEOL (Average Minimum Expected Opportunity Loss), and ENGS (Expected Net Gain from Sampling). Detailed computations of these statistics are displayed only upon request. The users can thus focus more on the methodology and less on the computational aspects. This package has made a tremendous impact on classroom teaching for MBA and Executive Development Program participants in India and Singapore.

This approach utilizes a decision support system (DSS) for advising the production manager which machine to select. The DSS is of special kind: its machine selection rules are modified to ensure equal load on the machines. The basic structure of the decision tree is defined by process experts and the rules threshold values are dynamically evaluated. The implementation domain is the aluminum extrusion process, with the objective of aiding the manager in selecting the appropriate extrusion press machine from a set of similar machines. These machines are the most expensive equipment in the process, and are expected to be fully utilized.

A clinical decision analysis was performed to assess this new technique by quantitative comparison with other therapeutic modalities. A decision tree-based state transition model implemented to simulate a rive-year period of follow-up was constructed. Nonsurgical treatments were superior to surgical treatments in enhancing both life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy on the basis of the optimal indications; one radiolucent stone < 2 cm for extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy and multiple floating stones for oral dissolution therapy respectively, especially in the elderly. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was superior to open cholecystectomy in enhancing the quality of life for all eligible patients. Sensitivity analysis revealed that a higher incidence of the bile duct injury resulting from laparoscopic cholecystectomy would result in a poorer quality-adjusted life expectancy. The results of the analysis suggest the following. Nonsurgical treatments are acceptable alternatives to surgery on the basis of their optimal indications. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has an advantage over open cholecystectomy in enhancing the patient's utility, and appears to be an attractive therapeutic modality. A proper training program is necessary to ensure the quality of this procedure in order to maintain its advantage.

Of 815 children admitted, 749 (91.7%) were included in the study. Two different methods of case definition were applied: the first involved a theoretical model containing a decision tree. The physician recorded the child's signs and symptoms and rated the plausibility of the history given. At the end of the study period a "technical diagnosis" was made. With this approach 7 children (0.9%) were classified as abused or neglected. Cases were also defined by having the physician decide at the time of admission whether child abuse was possible or could be excluded ("clinical diagnosis"). With this procedure 10 children (1.3%) were judged to be abused or neglected; 13 children (1.7%) were found by combining both methods. The validity of these two diagnostic approaches was ascertained by comparing the results with the degree of certainty of the clinicians' assessment and by describing the type of injuries the children had. The decision tree appears to be a useful tool for identifying abused and neglected children. We recommend thorough assessment of all suspected cases.

The slides were de-stained and subsequently re-stained with Feulgen Thionin-SO2 stain. Images of the nuclei were then captured, recorded and processed employing an image cytometry device. Automated classification of the cells were carried out using three different methods - discriminant function analysis, a decision tree classifier and a neutral network classifier. The discriminant function analysis method, which combined all dysplastic cells into an abnormal group, achieved a combined error rate of less than 0.4% for moderate and severe dysplastic cells, and less than 40% for mildly dysplastic cells. All three methods yielded comparable results, which approached those of human performance.

The nature of the sample was found to be the principal parameter determining the selection of the dissolution method, while in some situations a distinction had to be made according to the type of analyte, the concentration of the analyte or the purpose of the analysis. The suitability of three tools which permit the presentation of this knowledge in a computer system was investigated. The application built with ToolBook software, a hypertext language for the personal computer, was found to be the most suitable, due to its attractive user interface, ease of implementation and the possibility given to the user to add his personal comments. The rule-based expert system and self-generating decision tree proved to be less suitable alternatives.

First, a large data bank was used to do the following: (1) describe temporal hemodynamic and oxygen transport patterns that interrelate cardiac, pulmonary, and tissue perfusion functions in survivors and nonsurvivors; (2) define optimal therapeutic goals based on the supranormal oxygen transport values of high-risk postoperative survivors; (3) compare the relative effectiveness of alternative therapies in a wide variety of clinical and physiologic conditions; and (4) to develop criteria for titration of therapy to the endpoints of the supranormal optimal goals using cardiac index (CI), oxygen delivery (DO2), and oxygen consumption (VO2) as proxy outcome measures. Second, a general purpose algorithm was generated from these data and tested in preoperatively randomized clinical trials of high-risk surgical patients. Improved outcome was demonstrated with this generalized algorithm. The concept that the supranormal values represent compensations that have survival value has been corroborated by several other groups. We now propose a unique approach to refine the generalized algorithm to develop customized algorithms and individualized decision analysis for each patient's unique problems.

The model automatically generates consistent and irredundant symbolic classification rules that mimic, in many aspects, the behavior of human subjects who solved similar problems during empirical studies. The OLM's performance is compared with those of regression analysis and with C4, a well-known symbolic learning-by-example decision tree building algorithm. The OLM uses mainly comparison operations and does not attempt to optimize the rule-bases it generates. Yet, the results show that the OLM's predictions are very accurate and the resulting nile-bases are relatively compact. The time required for constructing the rule-bases via the OLM was very competitive as well.		BENDAVID, A (reprint author), HEBREW UNIV JERUSALEM,SCH BUSINESS ADM,IL-91905 JERUSALEM,ISRAEL.

Data Sources.-We reviewed data from an earlier longitudinal study of patients with small AAAs to estimate incidence rates of rupture or acute expansion. Estimates for other parameters in the model were obtained by searching the medical literature (MEDLINE, 1966 to present). Data Synthesis.-We constructed a Markov decision tree to compare early surgery with watchful waiting in patients with asymptomatic AAAs less than 5 cm in diameter, with respect to long-term survival in quality-adjusted life years. The average annual rates of rupture or acute expansion for AAAs with a maximal transverse diameter of less than 4.0, 4.0 to 4.9, and at least 5.0 cm, are 0, 3.3, and 14.4 events per 100 patient-years of observation, respectively. At an average rupture rate of 3.3 events per 100 patient-years and an average operative risk for elective surgery (4.6%, 30-day mortality), our model predicts that early surgery improves survival in patients who present with a 4-cm AAA. The benefit of early surgery decreases with increased age at presentation. If the average rupture rate for AAAs less than 5 cm is assumed to be low (eg, 0.4 event per 100 patient-years), watchful waiting is favored, particularly as operative risk increases. The decision in this subgroup, however, is sensitive to possible future increases in operative risk. Conclusions.-In the majority of scenarios that we examined, early surgery is preferred to watchful waiting for patients with AAAs less than 5 cm in diameter. Watchful waiting is generally favored, however, for patients with a low risk of AAA rupture or acute expansion, including those patients who present with very small AAAs (eg, <4 cm). More accurate data concerning the rupture risk of AAAs less than 5 cm would improve clinical decision making.

A decision tree algorithm is developed for the global classification of snow cover and precipitation over large geographical regions. Potential problem areas like desert regions are also identified in the decision-tree process. Over 40 case studies of SSM/I data over small geographical regions (i.e., the Gulf Coast of the United States, African desert, etc.) were analysed to develop and test these algorithms. Case studies involving Manually Digitized Radar (MDR) data, NOAA weekly snow cover charts and surface weather charts were used to validate the algorithm.

Methods: Using a decision tree, mortality rates were estimated for all children, children born to mothers infected during pregnancy, and children born to mothers who were uninfected at delivery. Given various assumptions about child mortality rates, relative risks of mortality among children who are not breast-fed compared with those who are (R), rates of HIV transmission from breast-feeding, HIV prevalence, and HIV incidence, scenarios were created and sensitivity analysis used to delineate critical boundaries. Results. Our model shows that only in situations where R is approximately less-than-or-equal-to 1.5 and HIV incidence/prevalence is high (prevalence > 10%, incidence > 5%) would universal breast-feeding result in equal or higher mortality compared with non-breast-feeding. Among populations in many developing countries, where there is a high relative risk of mortality if breast-feeding is not practiced, if R > 3, overall mortality is almost always lower among children who are breast-fed, even by HIV-infected mothers. In situations where maternal HIV status is known, the decision whether to breast-feed is largely dependent on the magnitude of additional mortality risk if the child is not breast-fed. The model illustrates the importance of distinguishing between population and individual recommendations. Conclusions: Based on available data, the model supports current World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control recommendations on HIV infection and breast-feeding. Given the importance of breast-feeding and the global impact of HIV infection, more research is needed, especially to clarify the range of HIV transmission rates from breast-feeding and to expand specific assessments of relative risks for different areas of the world.

This system is important in the study of corrosion products formed on copper in aqueous or atmospheric sulfur-bearing environments. The materials studied included Cu, Cu2O, CuO, Cu(OH)2, Cu2S, CuS and CuSO4. Spectral features such as lineshape, peak energy and peak intensity for Cu2p, Cu(L3M4,5M4,5) Auger, O1s and S2p bands were examined. Relative atomic sensitivity factors for the ligands with respect to copper were determined. A chemical state plot and a diagnostic decision tree were prepared from the data.

To study this question we performed two analyses concerning the use of pelvic lymphadenectomy and pedal lymphography for staging prostate cancer. Both analyses yielded, similar results as far as the preferred strategy was concerned, yet the approach and set up of the two analyses were different. The first analysis was performed in accordance with the textbooks on decision analysis. However, using this traditional approach we encountered some difficulties: in structuring the decision tree, in eliciting values for the quality of life parameters, and in interpreting the results. These difficulties urged us to modify the approach, presented in the second analysis. In this second analysis, the decision problem was split into several consecutive decision problems which corresponded to the questions posed by the clinicians. Longevity and quality of life were considered separately and the consequences of treatment and testing, which affect the quality of life of the patients, were indicated by just two parameters. Finally, the result of the analysis was expressed in clinically meaningful terms. The second analysis is compared with different approaches presented in the literature for analyzing decision problems involving diagnostic tests. Despite some unresolved methodological problems it is concluded that decision analysis provides a good framework for clinicians to structure and analyze complex decision problems.

Our approach is based on the idea that different kinds of knowledge in a given domain, namely declarative, procedural and heuristic are supported by corresponding methods and software tools. A prototype knowledge-based system, called EXPERT-MM, for the maintenance activities in the Siam Gipsum Industry (Bangkok, Thailand) has been worked out as a case study and is described in the paper. EXPERT-MM supports three main functions: maintenance policy suggestions, machine diagnosis and maintenance scheduling. The maintenance policy deals with the three types of preventive maintenance. For each component of the equipment it analyses the historical failure data and recommends an appropriate policy with optimal preventive maintenance intervals. This is based on the experts' knowledge stored in a knowledge base. A rotary screw type air compressor is selected for a diagnosis. The knowledge representation scheme is rule-based and the inference strategy mechanism is backward chaining. The knowledge-acquisition process has been organized and realised using a decision tree diagram. The knowledge base contains 154 rules for the diagnosis and 54 rules for the maintenance model selection. The maintenance scheduling module is procedure based. EXPERT-MM development is based on the software tools dBase III Plus, TURBO PASCAL version 6.0 and expert system shell EXSYS, all integrated into a single software system with a user-friendly interface.

Data from a cost-effectiveness study conducted in the US, supplemented by other literature sources, were used to construct a clinical decision tree for likely clinical outcomes for such patients. A panel of UK psychiatrists provided consensus on how these patients would have been managed in the UK. The costs associated with each patient outcome were estimated, and a sensitivity analysis performed to test the assumptions made. For the patients themselves, clozapine would lead to a net gain of 5.87 years of life with no disability or only mild disability. The base cass analysis showed that the direct costs of using clozapine were 91 pounds less per annum (or 1333 pounds per lifetime) than for standard neuroleptic therapy, when the effect on all health-care resources was taken into account. In addition, the sensitivity analysis showed that clozapine would be cost-saving or cost-neutral under many different assumptions.

Searching for a pragmatic approach to the management of patients with clinical features suggestive of advanced a-PHC, we have performed a decision analysis and plotted a decision tree structure based on literature review with the focus on serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and the expected outcome from liver biopsy, and chemotherapy. We defined serum AFP of <40 ng/ml as negative, and, 40 ng/ml as positive. The results were as follows. The probability of such a patient having a-PHC would be 0.19 or 19% if his serum AFP is negative; conversely, a positive serum AFP confers a 0.84 or 84% probability of him having PHC. Put differently, the likelihood ratios of PHC are 0.24 and 5.33 for serum AFP negative and positive cases, respectively. Blind percutaneous liver biopsy in patients with a-PHC has a low accuracy, or it involves a high risk, or both. The decision tree structure showed that the average expected utility from chemotherapy (3.12) and supportive care only (3.2) would be similar. We conclude that, given the current impasse in the management of such patients, the following pragmatic approach is justifiable. Serum AFP should be done, but neither liver biopsy nor chemotherapy is worthwhile in patients with a-PHC. We suggest that, in Third World countries, greater emphasis should be placed on the prevention of PHC rather than on futile aggressive therapy.

Within this, in vitro toxicology is focused on local, systemic, and target-organ toxicity. It is becoming increasingly apparent that a step or decision-tree approach using input of a variety of experimental data (physicochemical properties, biokinetics, cytotoxicity) provides the most efficient system for predicting toxicity. Examples of the use of in vitro toxicity systems for prediction of systemic toxicity and target-organ (liver) toxicity are presented.

J	TUFEKCI, S				TUFEKCI, S			GENERALIZED DECISION TREES - METHODOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								The method of decision trees is a widely accepted decision tool for multistage decision problems. The classical decision tree methodology assumes that the future outcome, following a decision at a given stage, is a discrete random variable with known probability function. Moreover, with each decision, the resultant cash flows and their timings are assumed to be deterministic and constants. However, in many real life problems in a dynamic environment, in addition to the probabilistic nature of outcomes, there is also randomness in the size of cash flows as well as their timings. By generalized decision trees (GDTs) we mean decision trees with cash flows as well as their timings being random variables. Furthermore, the time between two consecutive decision points is also allowed to be a random variable in the dynamic decision process. The method which is widely used for these types of decision problems is the Monte Carlo simulation. In this paper we present an analytical method for obtaining optimal decisions in generalized decision trees. Applications of generalized decision trees to optimal recall time of defective products (e.g. cars), optimal software release time and decision of automation in a manufacturing environment are also presented.

These measures imply different types of economic evaluation. In all cases, the filgrastim therapy is compared with no filgrastim therapy. Since different therapeutic strategies are connected with uncertain consequences, decision trees are helpful analytical tools. The potential implications of different types of economic evaluations are illustrated with a simple decision tree.

Intelligent sensory decision-making for error identification in autonomous robotic systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						autonomous robotic systems; automatic error recovery; automatic assembly process; error identification tree		Successful automatic assembly of complex artefacts requires the robotic system to have the capability of detecting, identifying and recovering from various errors. Efficient error identification process is essential to ensure fast recovery and minimum loss of production time. It is not cost-effective to interrogate every sensor for every pass through the assembly process. This paper presents a machine-learning approach to identify error. The basic idea is to construct a decision tree based on some sensor and error attributes in the knowledge base.

Ethnographic tree decision modeling is a rigorous qualitative method used to understand and predict how and why people in certain groups do things the way they do. The model was developed from data collected from focus group and individual interviews and naturalistic observations. The research participants were White, African-American and Latino male and female IDUs. The model presents IDUs' needle-sharing routines or scripts based on several prioritized criteria. The model supports other researchers' findings that social roles play an important part in shaping IDUs' needle sharing. Yet, the model attempts to specify the different kinds of roles and relationships. The model suggests that social roles IDUs play and the status hierarchy between roles are the translation mechanisms that organize IDUs' social relationships into drug and HIV risky activities.

We introduce a decision tree whose nodes are labeled with regular patterns. As a hypothesis, the system produces such a decision tree for a small number of randomly chosen positive and negative examples from PIR. Experiments show that our system finds reasonable hypotheses very successfully. As a theoretical foundation, we show that the class of languages defined by decesion trees of depth at most d over k-variable regular patterns is polynomial-time learnable in the sense of probably approximately correct (PAC) learning for any fixed d, k greater-than-or-equal-to 0.

Such transient insomnia, often the result of stress or overstimulation, usually cures itself. However, long-term insomnia can impair daytime function and requires treatment. The authors provide a ''decision tree'' for assessing possible causes and offer recommendations for good sleep hygiene and stimulus control. They also review behavioral and pharmacological therapy and indicated when each is appropriate.		BECKER, PM (reprint author), SLEEP WAKE DISORDERS CTR,8200 WALNUT HILL LANE,DALLAS,TX 75231, USA.

In the area of acid-related diseases, much of the current interest is focused on comparisons between omeprazole and H2 receptor antagonists. After having discussed the basic methodology used in these analyses, viz. the decision-tree analysis, this paper presents an extension of this methodology, the Markov chain approach, which is more appropriate for analyses of longer time periods. Thereafter, this methodology is used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of omeprazole in intermittent versus maintenance treatment of reflux esophagitis. The cost data are from Sweden and the time period studied is one year. It is found that maintenance treatment provides 63 more healthy days per year at an extra direct cost of SEK 40 per day. From a sensitivity analysis it is concluded that the cost-effectiveness of intermittent versus maintenance treatment is mainly determined by the probability of relapse when off treatment, the severity of the symptoms in the case of a relapse and the value to the patient of a healthy day, i.e. a day free from reflux esophagitis.

The prototyping methods are wide used in IS design. This technique allows to build models of different information flows structures, but - usually - does not allow to differentiate a decision allocation structure in the management system. The paper presents a simulation shell system that enables to build more sophisticated models of information-decisions systems. The main idea is to depict the human determine process in form of decision table, which is automatically converted - by the knowledge acquisition module of the system - into a decision tree of production rules. This decision tree, as a knowledge base for inference engine, describes a behavior of decision-maker in real management system. Presented in this paper technique can be usable in solving some problems connected with research and design of information-decision structures of any socio-technical systems.

Read-once TC0 (RO-TC0) is the subclass of TC0 which restricts every variable to occur exactly once in the formula. Our main result is a (tight) linear lower bound on the randomized decision tree complexity of any function in RO-TC0. This relationship between threshold circuits and decision trees bears significance on both models of computation. Regarding decision trees, this is the first class of functions for which such a strong bound is known. Regarding threshold circuits, it may be considered as a possible first step towards proving TC0 not-equal NC1; generalizing our lower bound to all functions in TC0 would establish this separation. Another structural result we obtain is that a read-once threshold formula uniquely represents the function it computes.

Because approximately 90% of future cases will come from those who have no close relative with IDDM, prediction and intervention within the general population will become the main priority for the future. This review presents a decision tree analysis of risk of progression to IDDM, highlights the different prognosis of markers when applied to those with and without a family history of the disease, and proposes a strategy for disease prediction in the latter. Large collaborative studies in well-characterized populations will allow new predictive markers and models to be evaluated, and strategies of intervention to be tested with maximum efficiency and minimal delay.

The authors review research on pharmacological and behavioral treatments for aggressive patients and present a decision tree for use on behavioral units to direct treatment Of such patients. Methods: The empirical literature was searched for studies of pharmacological and behavioral interventions that have been shown to have some value for treating this Problem. Results and conclusions; Psychiatrists must proceed cautiously because no medication has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration specifically for treatment of aggression. Antipsychotics, lithium, antidepressants, sedatives, anxiolytics, anticonvulsants, opiate antagonists, and beta blockers have been used, often depending on the etiology of the aggression, such as head injury or dementia. Although some drugs such as buspirone and propranolol show promise, side effects must be monitored. Three behavioral strategies have effectively reduced aggression in the inpatient milieu. The token economy is perhaps the most comprehensive behavioral tool for producing a well-structured milieu, Aggression replacement strategies help patients learn alternative responses, Decelerative techniques teach strategies that enable the patient to reduce aggression quickly. The authors describe a decision tree to guide decisions about pharmacological and behavioral treatments of aggression depending on where in the course of the disorder patients exhibit difficulty.

J	MANGE, D				MANGE, D			TEACHING FIRMWARE AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION			English	Article							LANGUAGE PROGRAMMABLE CONTROLLER; BINARY-DECISION; MACHINES; TREES	The Electrical Engineering Department of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland, has recently introduced a new course for freshmen aimed to tie together both sides of computer science (hardware, such as logic and digital systems, and software, such as classic procedural PASCAL programming), to emphasize systematic and invariant methods rather than describing rapidly changing technologies and to give a faster and stronger introduction to the profession. This one-year course (with labs) is called an Introduction to firmware theory, the term firmware being comprehended as the art and the technique of transforming hardware (logic systems) into software (programs) and vice versa; the entire course is based on the central idea of equivalence between hardware and software which is exhibited by means of one preferred representation, the binary decision tree. In this paper, a very simple example is used to show the definition of a binary decision tree, its simplification and its decomposition. Hardware implementation is illustrated by a demultiplexer network, while software implementation is highlighted by the use of two structured languages: a high-level language called MICROPASCAL and a low-level language called L4, the latter being obtained by a compilation of the former. The conclusion gives a summary of the course, including laboratory sessions, as it is taught at present.

J	WEHENKEL, L; PAVELLA, M				WEHENKEL, L; PAVELLA, M			DECISION TREE APPROACH TO POWER-SYSTEMS SECURITY ASSESSMENT	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS			English	Article						DECISION TREES; POWER SYSTEM SECURITY ASSESSMENT; REAL TIME CONTROL; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; TRANSIENT STABILITY; VOLTAGE SECURITY		An overview of the general decision tree approach to power system security assessment is presented. The general decision tree methodology is outlined, modifications proposed in the context of transient stability assessment are embedded, and further refinements are considered. The approach is then suitably tailored to handle other specifics of power systems security, relating to both preventive and emergency voltage control, in addition to transient stability. Trees are accordingly built in these various application domains, and their salient features are explored, assessed, compared. Among attractive aspects of the trees, we mention their ability to uncover the intrinsic mechanism governing physical processes, and to provide a clear description in terms of tractable system parameters. Further, their dual, 'attribute space' representation is shown to have complementary possibilities for more refined analysis and, in addition, for sensitivity assessment and control. Overall, the approach is characterized by its great flexibility with respect to tree structure, types of physical parameters driving the phenomena, and classes of potential applications. To illustrate and support the developments, real-world examples are reported, relating to transient and voltage stability issues simulated on several power systems.

J	SCHAFFER, C				SCHAFFER, C			OVERFITTING AVOIDANCE AS BIAS	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						OVERFITTING AVOIDANCE; DECISION TREE PRUNING; INDUCTIVE BIAS	DECISION TREES; COMPLEXITY	Strategies for increasing predictive accuracy through selective pruning have been widely adopted by researchers in decision tree induction. It is easy to get the impression from research reports that there are statistical reasons for believing that these overfitting avoidance strategies do increase accuracy and that, as a research community, we are making progress toward developing powerful, general methods for guarding against overfitting in inducing decision trees. In fact, any overfitting avoidance strategy amounts to a form of bias and, as such, may degrade performance instead of improving it. If pruning methods have often proven successful in empirical tests, this is due, not to the methods, but to the choice of test problems. As examples in this article illustrate, overfitting avoidance strategies are not better or worse, but only more or less appropriate to specific application domains.

J	RUSZCZYNSKI, A				RUSZCZYNSKI, A			PARALLEL DECOMPOSITION OF MULTISTAGE STOCHASTIC-PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS	MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING			English	Article						STOCHASTIC PROGRAMMING; DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING; DECOMPOSITION; PARALLEL COMPUTING	STAIRCASE LINEAR-PROGRAMS	A new decomposition method for multistage stochastic linear programming problems is proposed. A multistage stochastic problem is represented in a tree-like form and with each node of the decision tree a certain linear or quadratic subproblem is associated. The subproblems generate proposals for their successors and some backward information for their predecessors. The subproblems can be solved in parallel and exchange information in an asynchronous way through special buffers. After a finite time the method either finds an optimal solution to the problem or discovers its inconsistency. An analytical illustrative example shows that parallelization can speed up computation over every sequential method. Computational experiments indicate that for large problems we can obtain substantial gains in efficiency with moderate numbers of processors.

The predictive value of other morphologic features is less well established. Therefore, in this study we assessed morphologic parameters in 82 Robson stage I renal cell carcinomas. Insufficient numbers of T1 lesions were present in this series to permit a confident comparison of Robson staging with the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer-American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging. Morphologic parameters-including size, character of cytoplasm, nuclear grade, and pelvic invasion-were studied. Both univariate survival analysis and multivariate or tree-structured survival analysis (TSSA) were employed, with disease-free survival and actuarial survival as end points. Nuclear grade was the most important predictor of prognosis in stage I neoplasms by TSSA. Nuclear grade greater than 2 correlated with significantly shorter survival (p = 0.018). Stage I tumors measuring less than 5.0 cm by survival analysis (or 6.0 cm by TSSA) were associated with improved disease-free survival (p = 0.040), although TSSA indicated that the effect was pronounced only in low-grade neoplasms. The character of cell cytoplasm was not independent of nuclear grade (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.028). The contingency table indicated disproportionate numbers of grade 4 mixed cell tumors, grade 3 granular cell tumors, and low-grade clear cell tumors. By TSSA, younger patients with low-grade but larger tumors had a poor clinical outcome. Elderly patients with high-grade tumors had the worst overall survival. None of the other clinical parameters or architectural pattern correlated with survival or disease-free survival. When nuclear grade was combined with tumor size and age at diagnosis in a decision tree, patients with stage I neoplasms were separated into favorable, intermediate, and poor prognosis groups.

The NTN consists of neural networks connected in a tree architecture. The neural networks are used to recursively partition the feature space into subregions. Each terminal subregion is assigned a class label which depends on the training data routed to it by the neural networks. In decision tree algorithms, the feature space is usually partitioned by using hyperplanes that are constrained to be perpendicular to the feature axes. The use of a neural network at each tree node, as in the NTN, results in better classification performance. The NTN is grown by a learning algorithm as opposed to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) where the architecture must be specified before learning can begin. This is a drawback of the MLP approach since, in many practical problems, numerous trials are needed before an appropriate architecture can be found. The NTN also provides an attractive tradeoff of classification speed versus hardware implementation as compared to MLP's. Growing the smallest NTN that will correctly classify the training data is an NP-complete problem as is the problem of training an MLP. In this paper, a heuristic learning algorithm based on minimizing the L1 norm of the error is used to grow the NTN. We show that this method has better performance in terms of minimizing the number of classification errors than the squared error minimization method used in backpropagation. An optimal pruning algorithm is given to enhance the generalization of the NTN. Simulation results are presented on Boolean function learning tasks and a speaker independent vowel recognition task. It is shown that the NTN compares favorably to both neural networks and decision trees.

J	SMITH, JE; HOLTZMAN, S; MATHESON, JE				SMITH, JE; HOLTZMAN, S; MATHESON, JE			STRUCTURING CONDITIONAL RELATIONSHIPS IN INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS	OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article							DECISION-ANALYSIS	An influence diagram is a graphical representation of a decision problem that is at once a formal description of a decision problem that can be treated by computers and a representation that is easily understood by decision makers who may be unskilled in the art of complex probabilistic modeling. The power of an influence diagram, both as an analysis tool and a communication tool, lies in its ability to concisely summarize the structure of a decision problem. However, when confronted with highly asymmetric problems in which particular acts or events lead to very different possibilities, many analysts prefer decision trees to influence diagrams. In this paper, we extend the definition of an influence diagram by introducing a new representation for its conditional probability distributions. This extended influence diagram representation, combining elements of the decision tree and influence diagram representations, allows one to clearly and efficiently represent asymmetric decision problems and provides an attractive alternative to both the decision tree and conventional influence diagram representations.

J	BOWSERCHAO, D; DZIALO, DL				BOWSERCHAO, D; DZIALO, DL			COMPARISON OF THE USE OF BINARY DECISION TREES AND NEURAL NETWORKS IN TOP-QUARK DETECTION	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								The use of neural networks for signal versus background discrimination in high-energy physics experiment has been investigated and has compared favorably with the efficiency of traditional kinematic cuts. Recent work in top-quark identification produced a neural network that, for a given top-quark mass, yielded a higher signal-to-background ratio in Monte Carlo simulation than a corresponding set of conventional cuts. In this article we discuss another pattern-recognition algorithm, the binary decision tree. We apply a binary decision tree to top-quark identification at the Fermilab Tevatron and find it to be comparable in performance to the neural network. Furthermore, reservations about the ''black box'' nature of neural network discriminators do not appy to binary decision trees; a binary decision tree may be reduced to a set of kinematic cuts subject to conventional error analysis.

We find that if an optimal control policy is used under uncertainty, the eventual resolution of uncertainty has high value relative to current research budgets, and resolving uncertainty about the costs of warming is nearly as important as resolving uncertainty about the extent of warming. In addition, we find that there is not a high premium on immediate resolution of uncertainty, if resolution would otherwise occur within, say, twenty years; this implies that time is available to plan and execute a carefully designed research program. On the other hand, we find that if the real world political process would result in a suboptimal control policy being chosen under uncertainty, and this choice could be prevented by early resolution of uncertainty; the benefit of early resolution may be as much as three orders of magnitude greater.

Of the techniques that have evolved, the ''French'' technique, in which the surgeon stands between the patient's legs, and the ''American'' technique, in which the surgeon stands on the patient's left side, are the most commonly used. In the former technique, the liver is retracted via the mid-clavicular cannula and the infundibulum of the gallbladder via the anterior axillary port. In the latter technique, the liver is retracted by axial traction on the gallbladder through the anterior axillary cannula and the infundibulum through the mid-clavicular cannula. This position may increase the risk of bile duct injury. The technique selected for operative cholangiography should be adapted to the problem at hand. Cystic duct cholangiography shows ductal calculi more reliably due to better filling of the common bile duct; direct puncture of the gallbladder is safer when the biliary anatomy is unclear. A number of European studies confirm the safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Mortality rates vary between 0% and 0.1%, and duct injury rates range between 0.2% and 0.6%. Conversion, which is done in 3% to 8% of cases, may be necessary in the case of uncontrollable hemorrhage, bile duct injury unsuitable for laparoscopic repair, or if the gallbladder is densely scarred (scleroatrophic). It can also be done for safety reasons, when the anatomy is unclear. Complications include bile collections due to accessory duct or cystic duct stump leaks or less commonly to common duct injury. The average postoperative stay is longer in Europe (3.2 days) than in the United States. A decision tree is presented for the management of common bile duct stones. In general, preoperatively identified ductal stones are removed by endoscopic sphincterotomy, which is then followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy to remove the source of the calculi. The techniques of laparoscopic choledochotomy and transcystic exploration for the removal of stones in the common bile duct are only beginning to be used, but they may well prove to be the most popular procedures. Results with these procedures will need to be evaluated against those obtained with endoscopic sphincterotomy.

A special effort is made to find a method of extracting reasonable descriptions of the individual sleep stages from sample measurements of EGG, EMG, EOG, etc., and from a classification of these measurements provided by an expert. The method should satisfy three requirements: classification accuracy, interpretability of the results, and the ability to select the relevant and discard the irrelevant variables. The solution suggested in this paper consists of a combination of the subsymbolic algorithm LVQ with the symbolic decision tree generator ID3. Results demonstrating the feasibility and utility of our approach are also presented.

The tree is constructed in stages. We start at the level which is furthest from the root and work our way to the root one level at a time. Phase I generates the outdegrees of an auxiliary decision tree. In Phase II the decision tree is constructed and we give a method of labelling the nodes in it. Phase III of the algorithm presents the technique to obtain the minimum-entropy tree. The algorithm incorporates a procedure called ''minimum entropy separation on k nodes''.

Our objective was to assess the cost effectiveness of hepatitis B vaccine in predialysis patients. Data Sources. Costs were calculated from estimated rates of health services use and unit costs of resource use. Efficacy data were based on probability estimates from the medical literature and included vaccination response rates, anticipated hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection rates, and outcomes from HBV. Study Design. Costs and effectiveness of HBV vaccination was modeled with a decision tree constructed to analyze three vaccination strategies for patients with renal insufficiency: vaccine given prior to dialysis, vaccine given at time of dialysis, and no vaccine. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the effect of varying important dinical and cost variables. Data Collection/Extraction Methods. All analyses were based on efficacy and cost estimates derived from the medical literature. Analyses were conducted with the aid of SMLTREE(R) software. Principal Findings. The number of patients requiring vaccination per case of HBV prevented was higher for dialysis patients (625 vaccinees/case prevented) than for predialysis patients (434 vaccinees/case prevented). The cost-effectiveness ratios were $25,313/case of HBV prevented for vaccination at the time of dialysis and $31,111 for the predialysis vaccine. When a higher HBV infection rate (based on clinical trial data) was substituted in the analysis, the cost effectiveness of a predialysis vaccination strategy improved to $856 per case prevented. Results were sensitive to the cost of the vaccine and the incidence of HBV infection in dialysis patients. For the predialysis strategy to become cost saving, the price of the vaccine would have to decrease from $114 to $1.50, or the incidence of infection would have to increase from 0.6 percent to 38 percent, holding all other variables constant. Conclusions. Additional HBV infection can be prevented by immunizing predialysis patients, but the cost is high. Decisions concerning vaccination policy should be influenced by local prevalence of HBV infection.

We show that there is an error in their derivation of message lengths, which fortunately has no effect on the final inference. We further suggest two improvements to their coding techniques, one removing an inefficiency in the description of non-binary trees, and one improving the coding of leaves. We argue that these improvements are superior to similarly motivated proposals in the original paper. Empirical tests confirm the good results reported by Quintan and Rivest, and show our coding proposals to lead to useful improvements in the performance of the method.

Bayes-Fisher linear discrimination and a decision tree based on the linear discriminant functions of the individual nodes. Only the two most discriminative variables obtained for differentiation of groups at individual nodes are used for the node subclassification. They are the four linguistic variables cough, character of dyspnea, physical examination of the chest, and x-ray examination of the chest obtained by conversion of discrete features. No laboratory finding is used. The tree classifier simulates a physician's thought process. Results with multigroup linear discrimination on the same four variables for both a reclassification and a cross-validation technique were comparable to the tree-scheme outcomes. The tree classifier lends itself to simple graphic presentation, the patient being created as a point in the plane of the two most discriminative variables without the need for mathematical formulas and posterior probabilities. The classification errors that appear in the chronic bronchitis group can be easily corrected using an additional variable, smoking index.

Several models, involving up to 17 symptoms, that led to a broad psychiatric diagnosis were then tested on a small validation sample of 53 patients. All methods, with the exception of CART used without any pruning, generated identical trees involving four items. Almost 90% of the validation sample was able to be correctly classified by all methods although poor classification performance was noted in the case of one particular diagnosis, Schizoaffective Psychosis. In contrast, stepwise linear discriminant analysis originally selected 17 items, although three out of the first four items selected were identical to those chosen by the tree-building methods. Although more research is required, there are indications that the latter methods may be usefully employed in constructing parsimonious decision trees.

The effect of erythrosine on the thyroid and the mechanism by which the effect is induced has been central to the discussion of the establishment of an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), or not, and a short account is given of the effect of erythrosine on the thyroid. The evaluation of erythrosine as a secondary tumorigenic agent was based on the evaluations of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) and the Scientific Committee for Food of the Commission of the European Communities (SCF). In the proposed decision tree scheme, three different possibilities were examined. One was based on the long-term data and the second on the hormone data in the rat; the third was based on the NOEL for hormonal changes in humans. The three approaches with different NOEL and default values resulted in the following ADIs: 0.25, 0.3 and 0.1 mg/kg bw. The cases are discussed and it is concluded that the ADI based on the NOEL in human studies seems most appropriate. As there is most uncertainty about the default value for human pharmacokinetic variability, it is suggested that further human studies might elucidate this point.									0	8	8	TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	LONDON	ONE GUNDPOWDER SQUARE, LONDON, ENGLAND EC4A 3DE	0265-203X		FOOD ADDIT CONTAM	Food Addit.

Based on available literature the nature of the most sensitive parameter of TBTO-toxicity was perceived to be on lymphoid organs and lymphoid function. Subsequently, safety factors were derived in relation to published data on inter-species and inter-individual differences in both kinetics and dynamics of TBTO. Lack of information on human data concerning the nature of toxicity as well as kinetics and dynamics of TBTO finally resulted in a safety factor of 100. A TDI of 5 or 0.25 mg/kg bw per day was assessed based on reductions of lymphoid organ weights (thymus) or lymphoid function (resistance to T. spiralis), respectively. In addition, based on available data in rodents on kinetics and dynamics of TBTO, it is suggested that a combined TDI value for both tri- and dibutyltin compounds might have to be considered.

Decision tree methodology in general consists of inferring information from a 'learning set of states', and of compressing while hierarchically organising this information in a tree fashion, in terms of salient parameters automatically selected by the method at its nodes. Subsequently, the tree may readily assess any already known or new state. For preventive voltage stability purposes, trees are built for a given contingency and the system robustness is assessed in terms of precontingency parameters. For emergency control purposes, on the other hand, each tree is built for a set of contingencies and the system robustness is assessed in terms of parameters observed just after a contingency occurrence. The proposed approaches are illustrated by means of two simulation studies: one carried out on the Brittany region of the EHV French system and the other on an academic type example. These studies explore feasibility aspects, highlight interesting features and suggest that the proposed approaches have indeed potential for real world applications.

This work proposes a more efficient technique to perform dynamic learning, which we call ''Oriented Dynamic Learning.'' Instead of performing learning for almost all signals in the circuit, we show that it is possible to determine a subset of these signals to which all learning operations can be restricted. It is shown that learning for this set of signals is sufficient to provide the same knowledge about the nonsolution areas in the decision tree, as gained by dynamic learning of SOCRATES. We will achieve high efficiency by limiting learning to certain ''Learning Lines'' that lie within a certain area of the circuit, called the ''Active Area.'' We present experimental results to show that oriented dynamic learning is far more efficient than dynamic learning in SOCRATES.

TRIDEC combines very simple yet effective features with the classification capabilities of inductive decision tree methods. The feature vector is a list of all similar triangles defined by connecting all combinations of three pixels in a coarse coded 127 x 127 pixel input field. The classification is accomplished by building a decision tree using the information provided from a limited number of translated, scaled, and rotated samples. Simulation results are presented which show that TRIDEC achieves 94% recognition accuracy in the two-dimensional (2D) invariant object recognition domain and 98% recognition accuracy in the 3D invariant object recognition domain after training on only a small sample of transformed views of the objects.

As part of its rulemaking efforts EPA must evaluate the potential hazards to human health and the environment that could result from exposure to compounds that may substitute for halons. The EPA bases health hazard assessment on data obtained in studies involving short-term and long-term exposures. The former are used to evaluate potential risks of acute or delayed effects potentially resulting from short exposures at high concentrations, such as might be experienced in episodic emissions in the workplace. Studies with long-term exposure are used to assess potential adverse effects from continued exposure to low ambient concentrations. In addition, reproductive and developmental hazards are evaluated in several animal species. About ten chlorinated-, brominated-, and/or fluorinated-hydrogen-containing hydrocarbons, to be used alone or in combination, have been proposed as halon substitutes. In addition to health and safety, environmental, efficacy, and marketability considerations (Table I) need to be addressed for the selection of proposed halon substitutes. This presentation will discuss current EPA/Office of Air and Radiation thinking on a decision-tree approach for testing the toxicity of halon substitutes under the Significant New Alternatives Policy program.

The paper considers the application to various shorthand gestures which are commonly used in the design of computer networks. Furthermore, the method incorporates a facility for automatic addition of new gestures and the deletion of unnecessary gestures so that the approach may be easily adapted to other sets of gestures. The proposed procedure utilizes certain characteristic shape features extracted from each gesture together with appropriate decision rules. This is backed up by a menu-based correction/confirmation utility. The problem is of particular interest since the gestures are subject to considerable internal rescaling and changes in orientation because of both the individual's drawing style and the nature of the application. The characteristic features are primitives chosen by inspection of the geometrical properties of the expected shapes backed up with a video-recorded psychological study of drawing style. We present some experimental results for a specific set of 'network design gestures' which indicate the potential for accurate gesture recognition.

J	BROWN, DE; CORRUBLE, V; PITTARD, CL				BROWN, DE; CORRUBLE, V; PITTARD, CL			A COMPARISON OF DECISION TREE CLASSIFIERS WITH BACKPROPAGATION NEURAL NETWORKS FOR MULTIMODAL CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						CLASSIFICATION TREES; BACKPROPAGATION NEURAL NETWORKS; EMITTER IDENTIFICATION; DIGIT RECOGNITION		Multi-modal classification problems involve the recognition of patterns where the patterns associated with each class can come from disjoint regions in feature space. Traditional linear discriminant methods cannot cope with these problems. While a number of approaches exist for classifying patterns with multiple modes, decision trees and backpropagation neural networks represent leading algorithms with special capabilities for dealing with this problem class. This paper provides a comparison of decision trees with backpropagation neural networks for three distinct multi-modal problems: two from emitter classification and one from digit recognition. These real-world problems provide an interesting range of problem characteristics for our comparison: one emitter classification problem has few features and a large data set; and the other has many features and a small data set. Additionally, both emitter classification problems have real-valued features, while the digit recognition problem has binary-valued features. The results show that both methods produce comparable error rates but that direct application of either method will not necessarily produce the lowest error rate. In particular, we improve decision tree results with multi-variable splits and we improve backpropagation neural networks with feature selection and mode identification.

Objects belonging to the same category are envisioned to share several shape characteristics, but they may have other dissimilarities in shape, size, color, and orientation. By identifying essential shape features for each category, objects satisfying these shape constraints are classified without the use of statistical and/or syntactical methods. A fast outer contour tracer and interior pixel labeler for extracting object contours are described.		HEBERT, TJ (reprint author), UNIV HOUSTON,DEPT ELECT ENGN,HOUSTON,TX 77204, USA.

These methods are based on modifying the existing codebook(s) by means of block or lattice codes. To achieve a reduced rate operation of the DDTC coder a novel technique based on a parity code is developed and up to 2 dB SNR improvement over conventional methods is demonstrated. For extended rate operation of the LD-CELP coder an approach based on a lattice code is used. The modified or additional lattice codebook has a geometrical (algebraic) structure, allowing the search procedure to be performed efficiently and with minimal additional memory. Simulation results of these VBR methods for a 16 kbit/s DDTC coder and for the 16 kbit/s LD-CELP coder proposed for the CCITT recommendation (G.728) are presented.

J	FELSCH, P; WHITLATCH, W				FELSCH, P; WHITLATCH, W			STRATUS SURGE PREDICTION ALONG THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA COAST	WEATHER AND FORECASTING			English	Article								A simple decision-tree forecast scheme to predict the south-north development or movement of stratus along the central California coast is developed and tested. Known as ''stratus surges,'' these mesoscale events are infrequently observed along the west coast of North America during the summer season. A subjective test involving inspection of visible image satellite photographs is successful in determining when the potential for surge development exists. Objective tests based on Oakland, California, radiosonde data and alongshore pressure gradients at 0000 UTC are developed to make ''surge'' and ''no surge'' forecasts for potential events. Skill scores show that forecasts based on the objective tests achieved a moderate level of accuracy. This technique is easy to apply and could serve as a basis for the development of other stratus surge forecast schemes along the coast.

The choice between the treatment alternatives is made difficult by significant complication rates, reoperation rates and perioperative mortality. Different alternatives are associated with different risks. The limited life expectancy for many of these patients increases the importance of considering risk when choosing the treatment. Rational decision making ought to be founded on an analysis of outcomes produced in routine clinical practice. Practices and beliefs may thus be challenged. In this study a very tentative decision analysis was performed. A decision tree was designed describing the three treatment options. The probabilities and the expected utilities of the various outcomes were calculated using data extract ed from recent Swedish medical publications and from the Vascular Registry in Southern Sweden (VRISS). Two different health indices were used in evaluating outcomes. The completed exercise showed that the results of the analyses were highly sensitive to the use of utility values, so no firm conclusions regarding the best treatment option could be made. Since there is not yet any international consensus as to the appropriate values to attach to health states, the need for more research into this area is emphazised.

Stochastic trees have advantages over Markov-cycle trees in graphic display and computational solution. Like the decision tree or Markov-cycle tree, stochastic tree models of complex medical decision problems can be too large for convenient graphic formulation and display. This paper introduces the notion of factoring a large stochastic tree into simpler components, each of which may be easily displayed. It also shows how the rollback solution procedure for unfactored stochastic trees may be conveniently adapted to solve factored trees. These concepts are illustrated using published examples from the medical literature.		HAZEN, GB (reprint author), NORTHWESTERN UNIV,DEPT IND ENGN & MANAGEMENT SCI,EVANSTON,IL 60208, USA.

We propose an optimal algorithm which takes O(m log m) computation time and uses O(m) space, where m is the number of edges of the plane graph. The optimality of our algorithm is established by proving an OMEGA(m log m) lower bound under the algebraic decision-tree model.

A decision tree was constructed using baseline probabilities derived from published data and expert opinion. The case scenario analyzed was that of a patient not currently receiving anti-Pneumocystis prophylaxis who presents with moderate pulmonary symptoms and fulfills the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria for presumptive P carinii pneumonia. Two strategies were compared: (1) early bronchoscopy with appropriate therapy based on the results, and (2) empiric treatment for P. carinii (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or pentamidine, and steroids) with delayed bronchoscopy in those not responding to 5 days of empiric therapy. The expected 1-month survival rate (with and without quality of life adjustment) was found to be essentially the same for the two strategies using the baseline probabilities, and the decision remained a toss-up within the clinically relevant range of published probabilities for P. carinii pneumonia in patients fulfilling the CDC criteria. Because early bronchoscopy does not offer any additional survival benefits and is associated with greater costs and disutility, empiric therapy would appear to be the superior management strategy in this scenario.

It is highly desirable to obtain a definitive tissue diagnosis but this requirement must be balanced against the risks inherent in invasive diagnostic procedures in these oft-times critically ill patients. In the past 5 years we have developed an algorithm that has been used successfully in 18 patients presenting with acute SVCO. The decision tree consists of scalene node biopsy, bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy with categorization into low and high risk groups in the latter. The gender distribution of the 18 patients was 12 male and 6 female with the ages being 58.3+/-16.3 and 64.2+/-11.2 years respectively. The duration of symptoms range from 1.5 to 12 weeks and averaged 4.5+/-3.2 weeks. Two patients had palpable scalene nodes which were positive at biopsy. Bronchoscopy was positive in 5 out of 11 examinations. In 5 instances it was not done. Twelve patients underwent various forms of mediastinal biopsy and one underwent sternotomy. Seven patients requiring mediastinoscopy were judged to be high risk as defined by severe airway and vascular obstruction. Perioperative difficulties occurred in two patients due to cardiorespiratory factors associated with the obstruction. Both patients were undergoing cervical mediastinoscopy under general anesthesia and no difficulties were encountered in high risk patients when local anesthesia was used to perform anterior mediastinotomy. Five patients that were considered low risk all underwent uncomplicated procedures under general anesthesia. Thirteen patients proved to have bronchogenic carcinoma and a specific tissue diagnosis was obtained in 12. The undetermined diagnosis was in a patient who had prior radiotherapy. In addition lymphoma, thymic carcinoma, seminoma, yolk sac carcinoma and thyroid goitre were established each in one instance. A specific diagnosis was therefore found in 95% of cases. Anterior mediastinotomy under local anesthesia is a safe and highly effective method of obtaining a tissue diagnosis in acute SVCO.

They endorse the use of niacin and/or sequestrants as the first line of therapy to achieve such target LDL-C level. This recommendation has not been compared with the use of lovastatin as initial therapy if multidrug regimens are required to achieve goal LDL-C. Methods: Prospectively collected data on tolerance and effectiveness for niacin, sequestrants, and lovastatin were obtained from a lipid clinic at a large midwestern Veterans Affairs medical center. We used a decision tree to compare the complexity and cost of three sequential drug algorithms used for the following initial LDL-C levels: 4.14, 4.91, 5.69, and 6.47 mmol/L (160, 190, 220, and 250 mg/dL). Algorithm was niacin followed by a sequestrant and then lovastatin; algorithm 2, a sequestrant followed by niacin and then lovastatin; and algorithm 3, lovastatin followed by niacin and a sequestrant. Drug and laboratory costs were obtained from the pharmacy and pathology services at the same institution. Sensitivity analyses were performed on the tolerance and effectiveness of each drug as well as drug and laboratory cost estimates. Results: The probability of achieving target LDL-C level (3.36 mmol/L 1130 mg(dL]) decreased as initial LDL-C level increased. As a rule, algorithm 3 required fewer drugs in combination to achieve the target level for all initial LDL-C levels modeled. In addition, the use of lovastatin was high across all algorithms at all initial LDL-C levels modeled. Algorithm 1 was less expensive than algorithm 2 or 3 at a low initial LDL-C level (4.14 mmol/L [160 mg/dL]), with an average cost of $375 vs $454 vs $585, respectively. At all other initial LDL-C levels (4.91, 5.69, and 6.47 mmol/L [ 190, 220, and 250 mg/dL]), algorithm 2 was slightly less expensive than algorithm 1. Algorithm 3 became relatively less expensive as initial LDL-C level increased: 56% more expensive than algorithm 1 at an initial LDL-C level of 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) as compared with 7% more expensive than algorithm 1 at an initial LDL-C level of 6.47 mmol/L (250 mg/dL). Conclusions: Fulfillment of the target LDL-C approach recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program often requires the use of multiple drugs. When lovastatin is used initially, the regimen becomes simpler, albeit more expensive. At initial LDL-C levels of 4.91 mmol/L (190 mg/dL) or higher, this difference in cost becomes progressively smaller (7% at 6.47 mmol/L [250 mg/dL]), making algorithm 3 the better alternative; at low initial LDL-C levels (4.14 mmol/L [160 mg/dL]), a niacin-first regimen is reasonably simple and substantially less expensive. At moderate and severe initial LDL-C levels (4.91 and 5.69 mmol/L [190 and 220 mg/dL]), the lovastatin-first regimen may be advantageous.

J	JAYARAMAN, LL; MIN, BK				JAYARAMAN, LL; MIN, BK			BUSINESS ETHICS - A DEVELOPMENTAL PERSPECTIVE - THE EVOLUTION OF THE FREE AND MATURE CORPORATION	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS			English	Article								Ethics in Business organizations is a multi-dimensional process involving decision-making, leadership and institution building. The relatively simpler ethics of day-to-day decisions has to be reflected upon in the context of corporate desire for continuity, embedded in the values of a progressive society. At the operating level, the multivalence of decision situations is emphasized in place of the simple good - bad or cost - benefit dichotomies. A decision tree framework is presented to reflect the richness of the decisions. At the corporate level, the concept of responsive strategy as a synthesis of vision, power, and responsibility is proposed. In this, the crucial role of leaders cannot be over-emphasized. Finally, at the societal level, the evolution of capitalism and its corporate forms is seen as a milestone in people's search for enlightened ways to achieve refined ends. As more businesses assert their rightful roles in society, progressive institutional forms more in tune with the values of the twenty-first century should emerge.

Traditionally, open biopsy has been considered the optimal procedure for the diagnosis of breast nodules. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) has been proposed as an alternate method for the diagnosis of many palpable breast lesions. Methods. The authors compared the diagnostic utility of open biopsy and FNAB using decision tree and cost-effectiveness analyses. Results. When compared with two-step excisional biopsy, FNAB achieved a savings of over $700 at the cost of 0.1% decrease in 10-year overall survival. Conclusions. These data indicate FNAB to be a reasonable alternative to open biopsy for the diagnosis of palpable breast lesions in many patients.

Such strokes can be classified into subpatterns to facilitate machine recognition of the characters. This paper describes a stroke analysis procedure which identifies corners within a given stroke and then classifies the stroke into a certain shape category according to the locus direction from a current corner to the next one and the global convex/concave properly of those corners. Thus, it can provide high level information about the constituent strokes of a Kanji character.		LI, X (reprint author), UNIV BIRMINGHAM,SCH COMP SCI,BIRMINGHAM B15 2TT,W MIDLANDS,ENGLAND.

Simulated annealing is a random search optimization algorithm. Other researchers have used the algorithm on similar types of combinatorial problems. For simple cost criteria, designs are obtained which match or improve upon those of an Information Theory greedy algorithm. Optimal solutions for several different cost functions are demonstrated along with cost efficient, robust designs that handle misclassification error.

Jack Martin's cognitive instructional counseling (CIC) is a learning or information-processing model of counseling. Richard Petty and John Cacioppo's elaboration likelihood model (ELM) is a model of attitude change processes that has been applied to counseling. These two models are compatible and complementary with respect to change processes in counseling. In addition to presenting the decision tree and an example of its use, this article describes basic points of comparison between the ELM and CIC, outlines each model, and describes relevant research.

J	SONNENBERG, FA; BECK, JR				SONNENBERG, FA; BECK, JR			MARKOV-MODELS IN MEDICAL DECISION-MAKING - A PRACTICAL GUIDE	MEDICAL DECISION MAKING			English	Article						MARKOV MODELS; MARKOV-CYCLE DECISION TREE; DECISION MAKING	COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS; VALVES	Markov models are useful when a decision problem involves risk that is continuous over time, when the timing of events is important, and when important events may happen more than once. Representing such clinical settings with conventional decision trees is difficult and may require unrealistic simplifying assumptions. Markov models assume that a patient is always in one of a finite number of discrete health states, called Markov states. All events are represented as transitions from one state to another. A Markov model may be evaluated by matrix algebra, as a cohort simulation, or as a Monte Carlo simulation. A newer representation of Markov models, the Markov-cycle tree, uses a tree representation of clinical events and may be evaluated either as a cohort simulation or as a Monte Carlo simulation. The ability of the Markov model to represent repetitive events and the time dependence of both probabilities and utilities allows for more accurate representation of clinical settings that involve these issues.

The knowledge about dissolution methods, available in an industrial quality assurance laboratory, was first structured in a decision tree. The tree was implemented in a knowledge-based computer system using Toolbook software, an object oriented language for the personal computer. Beside its user-friendliness and possibility to build an attractive user-interface, this language permits the extension of the system with some important options, which would be difficult or impossible to create with other tools. The most important options are: (a) a partial maintainability of the system that is given to the user, (b) the visualization of the strategy of the decision making by displaying the structure of the tree in combination with a list of consulted pages, and (c) a database which ensures the completeness of the presented information and can easily be separately consulted.

Because of that case, the photocopy industry currently requires that permission be granted by the copyright holders of the materials that are included. However, a careful reading of the Kinko's case shows that it does not bar all such nonconsensual photocopying. A 'decision tree' analysis of the fair use doctrine illustrates that course packets can be produced without copyright permission as long as reasonable limitations and caveats are observed.

Input are eight list mode data files acquired with a FACScan flow cytometer. For each cell, four parameters are measured: forward light scatter, orthogonal light scatter, fluorescein fluorescence, and phycoerythrin fluorescence. Eight data files are acquired in the following sequence: unstained, isotype controls, CD10/CD19, CD20/CD5, CD3/CD22, CD7/CD33, HLADR/CD13, and CD34/CD38. First, each of the data files 3 to 8 are clustered independently employing an algorithm based on nearest neighbors. Next, the clusters are associated across the data files to form cell populations, using the assumption of light scatter invariance across tubes for each population. The mean positions of each cell population are fed into a decision tree. The decision tree first identifies normal cell populations, i.e., monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, NK cells, T-lymphocytes, and B-lymphocytes. After elimination of the normal cell populations from the data space, the residual cell populations are classified as B-lineage ALL, T-lineage ALL, AML, AUL, B-CLL, or unknown.

The rules are inductively inferred from a lot of speech data by using two kinds of tree-based methods, the conventional decision tree and the SBR-tree methods. The rule sets automatically generated by two methods have almost the same performance and decrease the prediction error to about 14 Hz from 23 Hz of the accent component value. The rate of the correct reproduction of the change for adjacent bunsetsu pairs is also used as a measure for evaluating the generated rule sets and they correctly reproduce the change of about 80%. The effectiveness of the rule sets is verified through the listening test. And, with regard to the comprehensiveness of the generated rules, the rules by the SBR-tree methods are very compact and easy to human experts to interpret and matches the former studies.

The Canadian Climate-Vegetation Model (CCVM) relies on climatic parameters with an inferred mechanistic relationship to the distribution of vegetation. Model inputs are monthly temperature, precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, from which degree-days, absolute minimum temperature, snowpack, actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture deficit are calculated. Splitting rules in a binary decision tree classify the potential natural vegetation at grid cells in a spatially distributed data base. The rules are critical climatic thresholds which physiologically constrain the distributions of different vegetation life-forms. Under current climatic conditions, CCVM produces an accurate simulation of Canadian vegetation as determined by comparisons with regional to continental scale vegetation maps. When compared with the Holdridge (1947, 1967) and Box (1981) models, CCVM predicted the vegetation of Canada in greater detail and with more accuracy. A comparison with the BIOME model (Prentice et al., 1992) showed a similar level of overall predictive accuracy under the current climate, but the two models are known to generate different responses under doubled-CO2 climatic scenarios. The physiological basis of the rules in CCVM will lend a robustness to the model when used to assess the potential impact of climatic change on Canadian vegetation at the level of the formation, the scale at which vegetation most directly interacts with the atmosphere.

In this study, it is shown that the wavelet transform is capable of providing features that may be used to discriminate between eight different cloth textures. The effectiveness of using wavelet transform features to classify texture was compared with that of a commonly used method that extracts features from spatial gray-level dependency matrices called co-occurrence matrices. Texture features were input to a decision tree classification algorithm to discriminate different textures. The wavelet transform features correctly identified 86% of 64 cloth textures. The co-occurrence features correctly classified 76% of the cloth samples.

J	SUGIURA, Y				SUGIURA, Y			SPATIAL DIFFUSION OF JAPANESE ELECTRIC-POWER COMPANIES, 1887-1906 - A DISCRETE-CHOICE MODELING	ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article						SPATIAL DIFFUSION; INNOVATION; NESTED LOGIT MODEL; SEQUENTIAL RECURSIVE CHOICE; ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY; JAPAN	LOCATION CHOICE; BEHAVIOR	In adopting an innovation, an individual or firm usually makes successive decisions about adoption, adoption timing and innovation alternatives. Innovation diffusion is produced from such sequential decision making. Using the nested logit model, I confirm the sequential decision making embedded in the process of diffusion of electric power companies in Japan from 1887-1906. These companies spread overwhelmingly in a hierarchical fashion, and the diffusion was dependent in large part on city size and mode of power generation. I hypothesize a decision tree whose upper nest is concerned with choosing opening time and whose lower nest is concerned with choosing the power-generation mode. The model reveals that accessibility to water resources accounted for the choice of mode and that the maximized utility in this choice, as well as population, explained the choice of opening time.

J	ACHENBACH, TM				ACHENBACH, TM			IMPLICATIONS OF MULTIAXIAL EMPIRICALLY BASED ASSESSMENT FOR BEHAVIOR-THERAPY WITH CHILDREN	BEHAVIOR THERAPY			English	Article							CONVERGENCE; RELIABILITY; CHECKLIST; DIAGNOSES; SELECTION	Comprehensive assessment of children requires multiple sources, such as parents, teachers, clinicians, observers, and children themselves. Agreement is limited by situational variations in children's behavior and by informant differences. Multiaxial empirically based assessment (MEBA) employs multiple sources relevant to most children. Parallel instruments obtain data from parents, teachers, self-reports, direct observations, and clinical interviews in terms of empirically derived syndromes. Children are compared with normative samples of peers. Multisource data can be coordinated via a cross-informant computer program, taxonomic decision tree, multisource composite scores, and selective weighting. MEBA can facilitate behavior therapy by documenting problems reported by different informants; by identifying problems as cross-situationally consistent or inconsistent; by aggregating problems in terms of empirically derived syndromes scorable by multiple informants; by concisely communicating and linking assessment with nosological and administrative criteria and with previous knowledge; and by indicating whether reported functioning is in the clinical versus normal range at pre- and posttreatment.

It has been developed in a specific image analysis environment (IBAS 2.0), but the algorithms and the methods can be employed elsewhere. The program is versatile and allows the analysis of histological preparations of different quality on the basis of different levels of evaluation and image extraction. Some significant algorithms have been implemented (i.e. one for multiple focus image acquisition and one for automatic cell body shape recognition and classification). A wide set of specific morphological parameters has been defined to allow a better mathematical characterization of neuronal morphology as regards both dendrite trees and cell bodies. Cell bodies' shapes can be classified automatically, defining different neuronal populations. This is done by evaluating the number of main dendrites and perykaria shapes through a multi-valued-decision-tree based method, tested on somatostatin-positive cells in mouse brain. The methods presented have been applied to analysis of neurons, but they can well be used for any quantitative morphological study of other cell populations.

Tree induction algorithms of two types, total branching and subset elimination, used in the generation of rules, are reviewed,vith respect to their treatment of the issue of quality. Based upon this assessment, a hybrid approach, Probabilistic Inductive Learning (PrIL), is presented that provides a probabilistic measure of goodness for an individual rule, enabling the user to set maximum misclassification levels, or minimum reliability levels, with predetermined confidence that each and every rule will satisfy this criterion. The user is able to quantify the reliability of the decision process, i.e., the invoking of the rules, which is of crucial importance in automated decision processes. PrIL is described with its associated algorithm. An illustrative example based upon the claims process at a workers' compensation board is also presented.

This paper addresses the problem concerning the distributive aspect of access to superior knowledge. Decision tree analysis and probability models appear to be appropriate tools for assessing the values of an intermediate result and patent reward of a firm's R&D decision in an environment of perfect information and oligopolistic competition. The assessed values are used as minimum prices acceptable to the firm when the knowledge is disseminated to the public. This paper will attempt to resolve this problem through the determination of the appropriate values of the reservation price of the first-stage invention in terms of the final reward and of a patent reward for which the inventor is willing to apply.

J	VENTA, I				VENTA, I			PREDICTIVE MODEL FOR IMPACTION OF LOWER 3RD MOLARS	ORAL SURGERY ORAL MEDICINE ORAL PATHOLOGY ORAL RADIOLOGY AND ENDODONTICS			English	Article							MANDIBULAR 3RD MOLAR; ERUPTION	The study was carried out to create and test a model for predicting impaction of lower third molars on the basis of radiographic findings at age 20 years. Fifty-six initially unerupted lower third molars were followed up for 6 years. Five radiographic findings in panoramic tomograms at age 20 were taken as variables. Clinical status at age 26 was taken as response. The radiographic features studied were angulation of tooth, development of root, state of impaction, depth in bone, and relation of the tooth to the ramus of the mandible and the second molar. With the use of logistic regression, univariate and bivariate analyses, and clustering techniques, a decision tree was constructed that indicated accuracies of prediction on the basis of single variables or pairs of variables. The most important predictor was the type of impaction. The model predictions and test teeth findings were in agreement in 94% of instances. It was concluded that the model is suitable for predicting lower third molar impaction at age 20.

(This algorithm uses membership queries.) The decision tree model that is considered is an extension of the traditional boolean decision tree model that allows linear operations in each node (i.e., summation of a subset of the input variables over GF(2)). This paper shows how to learn in polynomial time any function that can be approximated (in norm L(2)) by a polynomially sparse function (i.e., a function with only polynomially many nonzero Fourier coefficients). The authors demonstrate that any function f whose L(1)-norm (i.e., the sum of absolute value of the Fourier coefficients) is polynomial can be approximated by a polynomially sparse function, and prove that boolean decision trees with linear operations are a subset of this class of functions. Moreover, it is shown that the functions with polynomial L(1)-norm can be learned deterministically. The algorithm can also exactly identify a decision tree of depth d in time polynomial in 2(d) and n. This result implies that trees of logarithmic depth can be identified in polynomial time.

The land utilization type (LUT) was continuous corn, using three varieties with different growing periods. Ten experts identified the same land qualities but thee different types of land characteristics, as derived from survey data, field observations and simulation modelling. differences could be explained by the backgrounds of the experts. A land evaluation procedure according to framework criteria using decision trees rather than matching tables was more accessible and transparent. Simulation of the soil-water regime provided quantitative data for all land qualities considered, and this procedure was preferred to qualitative estimates based on poorly defined procedures. When some land qualities cannot be characterized byt simulation, however, a mix of qualitative and quantitative decision tree branches may be considered. The standard sheme of land evaluation, which is scale independent, provides irrelevant results at farm level because farmers' questions are different from those of regional planners who are served by the traditional land evaluation procedure. For the farmer, development of decision support systems should be focused on optimal management decisions.

Dynamic test schedules are decision tree-like protocols for cost-efficient management of analytical production in a clinical laboratory. The present analysis is based on previous practical experience and concludes that it is not feasible to introduce dynamic test scheduling on a large scale without computer-based support, because of the increase in complexity of the laboratory work processes. Further, our experience is that it is extremely complex to incorporate the dynamic test scheduling functionality into an existing Laboratory Information System (LIS). The approach pursued in the OpenLabs (A2028) AIM Project for implementing dynamic test scheduling is to provide the necessary functionality as a stand-alone module interconnected with a LIS in an open systems solution.

The ability to use a decision tree with probabilities together with intuitive modeling for the derivation of a plant growth function through the use of expert systems provided a flexible and adaptable model. The model was assembled using a decision tree as the core with three rulebases providing inputs into the tree. The decision tree was comprised of a decision node (which nutrients?), a chance node (probabilities of solar irradiance ranges) and an outcome (plant growth function). The rulebase for the plant growth function was derived by growing a cucumber crop in a greenhouse at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center, Wooster, Ohio. The expected value of each recipe was determined by computing the cross-products of the probabilities of irradiance levels and the plant growth function.

Research in Claveria, the Philippines, facilitated and monitored farmers' adaptation of contour hedgerows to fit their particular needs. Farmers tested diffeent establishment methods and many hedgerow species. They initially planted a combination of Gliricidia sepium (a legume tree) and Pennisetum purpureum. (grass). Later adoptors chose fodder grasses (especially Setaria spp.) or naturally occuring vegetation in their hedgerows-either solely or in combination with other species, including weeds such as Rottboellia cochinchinensis identified as crop problems. Upland rice and maize farmers who adopted contour hedgerows from 1987 through 1991 were interviewed in 1992. Although hedgerow-crop competition, grazing by neighbors' cattle, and added labor were problems, farmers viewed hedgerows as a way to reduce soil erosion and provide fodder. Farmers planting mulberry were disappointed after a silkworm project folded. Farmers now face the problem of soil nutrient depletion, leading to fallowing of fields with hedgerows and shifting to other parcels. A farmer decision tree model of the minimum necessary criteria for sustainable adoption of contour hedgerows is hypothesized.

Today, our ability to collect data outstrips our ability to interpret it, a situation called ''information input overload.'' Information input overload is known to have a deleterious effect on decision makers. Full use of data, knowledge, and other information requires a system that can extract the critical decision factors and follow a decision tree to find related pieces of information. A knowledge-based system was built to aid the project management team responsible for identifying cotton fields at risk to pink bollworm and releasing sterile pink bollworm to help control the native pink bollworm population. The system uses object-oriented design, expert system techniques, a link to simulation models, and database management in an integrated system to optimize, improve, and ease the decision-making process. The system made significantly fewer mistakes than did human decision makers, while assigning treatments to high and low risk areas. In addition, the system thoroughly documents the decisionmaking process and the resulting recommendations, thus allowing use of adjuncts such as a GIS and simulation models of pest and crop populations.

Forty-five patients treated with cervical headgear/tandem mechanics and 50 patients treated with a bionator appliance were compared with 95 control subjects from the Bolton Study. Treatment differences were determined using a cephalometric analysis that isolated vertical changes in overbite as the composite result of 6 variables: maxillary skeletal change, tipping of the upper incisors, bodily movement of the upper incisors, mandibular skeletal change, lower incisor tipping, and bodily movement of the lower incisors. The interaction of treatment type with facial type was also examined. In the headgear/tandem group, overbite was corrected by a combination of intrusion of the upper incisors and increases in mandibular skeletal change. Treatment with the bionator resulted in correction of the overbite by relative intrusion of the upper and lower incisors and increases in mandibular skeletal change. There were no significant interactions with facial type in the headgear group. Gonial angle and lower tipping were influenced by facial type in the bionator group. These results demonstrate that fixed and removable appliances produce both qualitative and quantitative differences in treatment response. Further studies are planned to create a rational decision tree that can be used to aid the clinician in the differential diagnosis and treatment of deep overbite.

Neural network analysis provides a non-algorithmic approach to information processing, which results in the ability of the computer to form associations and to recognize patterns or classes among data. It belongs to die machine learning techniques which also include probabilistic techniques such as discriminant function analysis and logistic regression and information theoretical techniques. These techniques may be used to extract knowledge from example patients to optimize decision limits and identify clinically important laboratory quantities. An expert system may be defined as a computer program that can give advice in a well-defined area of expertise and is able to explain its reasoning. Declarative knowledge consists of statements about logical or empirical relationships between things. Expert systems typically separate declarative knowledge residing in a knowledge base from the inference engine: an algorithm that dynamically directs and controls the system when it searches its knowledge base. A tool is an expert system without a knowledge base. The developer of an expert system uses a tool by entering knowledge into the system. Many, if not the majority of problems encountered at the laboratory level are procedural. A problem is procedural if it is possible to write up a step-by-step description of the expert's work or if it can be represented by a decision tree. To solve problems of this type only small expert system tools and/or conventional programming are required. Expert systems should probably be combined with methods such as machine learning methods, time series analysis, and mathematical models of biochemical systems which may be used to extract knowledge at a high level of abstraction.

Building on our experience with the Machine Learning Toolbox, we propose a set of taxonomies that allow a domain expert, with little or no knowledge of machine learning, to choose a suitable tool for his particular application. Unlike previous classifications of learning systems, which were based on technical characteristics of these systems, ours relies on features of the applications that can be solved, such as the user's goal, available data and background knowledge, and interaction between the system and its user.

J	RIDDLE, P; SEGAL, R; ETZIONI, O				RIDDLE, P; SEGAL, R; ETZIONI, O			REPRESENTATION DESIGN AND BRUTE-FORCE INDUCTION IN A BOEING MANUFACTURING DOMAIN	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								We applied inductive classification techniques to data collected in a Boeing plant with the goal of uncovering possible flaws in the manufacturing process. This application led us to explore two aspects of classical decision tree induction: (1) preprocessing and postprocessing and (2) brute-force induction. For preprocessing and postprocessing, much of our effort was focused on the preprocessing of raw data to make it suitable for induction and the postprocessing of learned rules to make them useful to factory personnel. For brute-force induction, in contrast with standard methods, which perform a greedy search of the space of decision trees, we formulated an algorithm that conducts an exhaustive, depth-bounded search for accurate predictive rules. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with specific examples of learned rules and by quantitative comparisons with decision tree algorithms (C4 and CART).

The system classifies and matches catalogs from multiple, overlapping plate scans as well as CCD calibration sequences; and it can be used for the scientific analysis of the resulting catalogs. It incorporates a number of novel machine-learning and AI tools, including the star/galaxy classification using decision tree algorithms. This results: in star/galaxy separation accurate to 90% or better down to B-J similar to 21(m), i.e. similar to 1(m) above the plate limit. The final catalog is expected to contain at least 5 x 10(7) galaxies and > 2 x 10(9) stars. We present preliminary results on galaxy counts from a test region near the NGP. We find a mild excess over the no-evolution models, smaller than previously found by the APM group. A search for z > 4 quasars and the two-point correlation analysis of this data set are in progress.

These compounds were prepared by the treatment of oxazolo[5,4-d] pyrimidine intermediates with potassium carbonate in a 1-pot reaction. All compounds were evaluated for PNP inhibitory activity using an in vitro enzyme inhibition assay. The extent of binding to PNP appeared to be influenced by the presence of-electron donating substituents on the phenyl ring of the benzyl group. None of the tested compounds were more active than the parent compound, 8-amino-9-benzylguanine. The inhibitory activity seems to be most likely-sigma-dependent.

We further prove a similar result for the average case complexity. We give applications of this result to various fundamental problems in computational geometry like convex-hull construction and trapezoidal decomposition and also present algorithms with matching upper bounds.

Schedule modification is done using a least impact heuristic beam search which proceeds in two levels: creation of a decision tree which makes use of possible reroutings of the product that is causing a conflict, and heuristic pruning of the search space to contain the combinatorial complexity. The heuristic chooses a path among all possible reroutings for a product such that the impact of each decision on the rest of the schedule is kept as small as possible. This approach has been implemented and tested on a number of simulated deviations in a MBP case study with three products. The proposed least impact heuristic was found to perform better than the earliest finishing unit heuristic in all the cases considered.

These systems will provide rapid second opinions to physicians in a clinical setting as well as assist them in the analysis of large sets of patient descriptions for research purposes. This paper presents INC2.5 as such a decision-support system. INC2.5 extracts information from databases of previously seen patients to build a decision tree which is used to predict the outcome of new patients on a chosen variable. The concept of matching new patients with the most similar previously seen patient, on which INC2.5 is based, can be easily understood by its users. Further adding to INC2.5's ease of use is its flexibility in allowing users to customize decisions trees to their liking. In order to convey the uncertainty of the environment, INC2.5 presents all decisions with a confidence factor.	UNC,CHARLOTTE,NC							Fisher D.

Nevertheless, one of the most important problems faced by practitioners of pharmaco-EEG is the difficulty in evaluating drug-specific effects. In this article, a methodology for comparing two time sequences of pharmacodynamic measurements, the Statistical Decision Tree (SDT), is proposed. This methodology, based on one- and multi-dimensional Wilcoxon signed-rank tests on EEG variables, takes into account vigilance fluctuations and placebo effects in order to pick out effects specifically due to the drug.

Findings of a meta-analysis of the results of 3 large, randomised clinical trials were employed in the construction of a decision tree used in the economic analysis. For the intended target population, the primary clinical and economic outcomes of gel pretreatment were shortening of the treatment-to-delivery interval, an increase in the percentage of patients achieving labour and a decrease in the percentage of patients requiring delivery by caesarean section. Application of cost factors associated with these and other variables led to a finding of net savings associated with use of the dinoprostone gel pretreatment, compared with no gel pretreatment, of $US159 to $US214 (1993 prices) per treated patient, corresponding to the maximum and minimum duration of the pre-induction treatment period, respectively.

The estimate is typically made up of several pieces, each piece being obtained by fitting a polynomial regression to the observations in a subregion of the data space. Partitioning is carried out recursively as in a tree-structured method. If the estimate is required to be smooth, the polynomial pieces may be glued together by means of weighted averaging. The smoothed estimate is thus obtained in three steps. In the first step, the regressor space is recursively partitioned until the data in each piece are adequately fitted by a polynomial of a fixed order. Partitioning is guided by analysis of the distributions of residuals and cross-validation estimates of prediction mean square error. In the second step, the data within a neighborhood of each partition are fitted by a polynomial. The final estimate of the regression function is obtained by averaging the polynomial pieces, using smooth weight functions each of which diminishes rapidly to zero outside its associated partition. Estimates of derivatives of the regression function may be obtained by similar averaging of the derivatives of the polynomial pieces. The advantages of the proposed estimate are that it possesses a smooth analytic form, is as many times differentiable as the family of weight functions are, and has a decision tree representation. The asymptotic properties of the smoothed and unsmoothed estimates are explored under appropriate regularity conditions. Examples comparing the accuracy of SUPPORT to other methods are given.

In this situation, flexibility is valuable. A flexible plan is one that enables the utility to quickly and inexpensively change the system's configuration or operation in response to varying market and regulatory conditions. We present a decision tree-based method for quantifying the economic value of flexibility. The method is then used to compare the relative flexibility of natural gas cofiring with other strategies to comply with the acid rain control requirements of the 1990 U.S. Clean Air Act Amendments. For the utility studied, we conclude that cofiring gives the system significantly more flexibility than flue gas desulfurization or switching to low sulfur coal. The reason is that cofiring enables the utility to take advantage of low gas prices or high emissions allowance prices by burning more gas at those times. The value of this flexibility is approximately $0.05 to $0.35 per million BTU of natural gas, or $0.03 to $0.26/MWh of plant output. These values are significant compared to other types of benefits that have been previously quantified for cofiring. We also compare our measure of flexibility with one based on the standard deviation of present worth. The latter perversely finds the least flexible technology (scrubbing) to be the most ''flexible.''

In short, the method consists of building off-line decision trees, able to subsequently assess the system transient behavior in terms of precontingency parameters (or ''attributes'') of it, likely to drive the stability phenomena. This case study aims at investigating practical feasibility aspects and features of the trees, at enhancing their reliability to the extent possible, and at generalizing them. Feasibility aspects encompass data base generation, candidate attributes, stability classes; tree features concern in particular complexity in terms of their size and interpretability capabilitities, robustness with respect to both their building and use. Reliability is enhanced by defining and exploiting pragmatic quality measures. Generalization concerns multicontingency, instead of single-contingency trees. The results obtained show real promise for the method to meet practical needs of electric power utilities.

J	WNEK, J; MICHALSKI, RS				WNEK, J; MICHALSKI, RS			HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN CONSTRUCTIVE INDUCTION IN AQ17-HCI - A METHOD AND EXPERIMENTS	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						CONCEPT LEARNING; CONSTRUCTIVE INDUCTION; DECISION RULES; DECISION TREES; DECISION LISTS; DIAGRAMMATIC VISUALIZATION		The proposed method for constructive induction searches for concept descriptions in a representation space that is being iteratively improved. In each iteration, the system learns concept description from training examples projected into a newly constructed representation space, using an Aq algorithm-based inductive learning system (AQ15). The learned description is analyzed to determine desirable problem-oriented modifications of the representation space. These modifications include generating new attributes, removing redundant or insignificant ones, and/or agglomerating attribute values into larger units. New attributes are constructed by assigning names to groups of the best-performing characteristic rules for each decision class, and then are used to define the representation space for the next iteration. This iterative process repeats until the created hypotheses satisfy a stopping criterion. In several experiments on learning discrete functions, the developed AQ17-HCI system consistently outperformed, in terms of the prediction accuracy on new examples, all systems that it was compared to, including the AQ15 rule learning system, GREEDY3 and GROVE decision-list learning systems, and RED-WOOD and FRINGE decision-tree learning systems. Although the proposed method was developed for the A(q)-based rule learning system, it can potentially be adapted to any other inductive learning system. In this sense, it represents a universal new approach to constructive induction.		WNEK, J (reprint author), GEORGE MASON UNIV,CTR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,FAIRFAX,VA 22030, USA.

J	WOODRUFF, SB				WOODRUFF, SB			SOME COMPUTATIONAL CHALLENGES OF DEVELOPING EFFICIENT PARALLEL ALGORITHMS FOR DATA-DEPENDENT COMPUTATIONS IN THERMAL-HYDRAULICS SUPERCOMPUTER APPLICATIONS	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Topical Meeting on Nuclear Reactor Thermal Hydraulics: Toward the Next Generation of Nuclear Power Reactors	SEP 21-24, 1992	SALT LAKE CITY, UT					The Transient Reactor Analysis Code (TRAC), which features a two-fluid treatment of thermal-hydraulics, is designed to model transients in water reactors and related facilities. One of the major computational costs associated with TRAC and similar codes is calculating constitutive coefficients. Although the formulations for these coefficients are local, the costs are flow-regime- or data-dependent; i.e., the computations needed for a given spatial node often vary widely as a function of time. Consequently, a fixed, uniform assignment of nodes to parallel processors will result in degraded computational efficiency due to the poor load balancing. A standard method for treating data-dependent models on vector architectures has been to use gather operations (or indirect addressing) to sort the nodes into subsets that (temporarily) share a common computational model. However, this method is not effective on distributed memory data parallel architectures, where indirect addressing involves expensive communication overhead. Another serious problem with this method involves software engineering challenges in the areas of maintainability and extensibility. For example, an implementation that was hand-tuned to achieve good computational efficiency would have to be rewritten whenever the decision tree governing the sorting was modified. Using an example based on the calculation of the wall-to-liquid and wall-to-vapor heat-transfer coefficients for three nonboiling flow regimes, we describe how the use of the Fortran 90 WHERE construct and automatic inlining of functions can be used to ameliorate this problem while improving both efficiency and software engineering. Unfortunately, a general automatic solution to the load-balancing problem associated with data-dependent computations is not yet available for massively parallel architectures. We discuss why developers should either wait for such solutions or consider alternative numerical algorithms, such as a neural network representation, that do not exhibit load-balancing problems.

Methods: With the bibliographic information available and the help of decision tree, an analysis of the effectiveness and of the consequences of drug costs of CP with INH in those patients is performed. Results: Overall, the HIV+ IVDU benefit from CP is an increase in survival of 80 days, with a savings of 7,252 pesetas per patient. The intradermal reaction with PPD and the retarded hypersensitivity tests (HCR) allow us to classify them in three subgroups: a) PPD+ where CP is universally admitted and thus corroborates our study; b) PPD-/HCR- where CP increases survival 201 days and saves 20,616 pesetas per patient; and c) PPD-/HCR+ where survival is increased 33 days and the pharmacological costs increase 1,536 pesetas per patient under CP. Conclusions: For the present situation in Spain, CP with INH is effective in HIV+ IVDU patients, independent of the results of the intradermal reation skin tests.

DESIGN: Retrospective, pharmacoeconomic decision analysis of two consecutively conducted prospective clinical studies. PATIENTS: Patients with documented gram-negative nosocomial pneumonia were evaluated. Thirty-three patients received cefmenoxime at standard dosing and 28 patients received doses according to dual individualization methodology. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Antibiotic and infection-related costs were compared between groups. The number of hospital antibiotic days and costs incurred on those days were also evaluated. A decision model was constructed to characterize differences in treatment outcome. Probabilities within the decision tree were derived from 61 evaluable patients. Cost-effectiveness and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. Sensitivity analysis was performed by varying outcome probabilities, antibiotic prices, and hospital room costs. RESULTS: Antibiotic and infection-related costs (mean +/- SEM) were $848 +/- 78 for standard cefmenoxime dosing and $1123 +/- 128 for dual individualization (p<0.05). Total hospital costs were $10 660 +/- 1432 for standard dosing and $11 709 +/- 1900 for dual individualization (p>0.05). Median antibiotic length of stay (ALOS) was 15.2 and 12.7 days for standard and dual individualization methodologies, respectively (p>0.05). Incremental analysis of cost effectiveness indicated that a similar reduction in length of stay for 259 dual individualization patients would save $321 808 annually. CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity analysis indicates that, by reducing ALOS, dual individualization could be a cost-effective method of betalactam dosing for patients with pneumonia. A prospective study should be conducted to validate these findings.

A study of 64 composite resection patients was performed to determine which variables in the patient's history, physical exam, and diagnostic workup had a predictive association with carcinomatous mandibular invasion. Four postoperative variables were included in this analysis. Thirty-nine percent of the mandibular specimens demonstrated cancerous involvement. A multivariate recursive partitioning statistical analysis was performed to create a decision tree. Branching was based on the two statistically predictive variables: computed tomographic (CT) scan results and primary tumor location. The guide provides improved predictive accuracy with a 100% negative predictive value (NPV) and a 46% positive predictive value (PPV). This decision guide should help the surgeon provide accurate patient counseling, anticipate reconstructive needs, and maximize surgical oncologic effectiveness.

The success of a given classification algorithm is dependent upon pattern familiarity, background, and the image acquisition process. Thus, with the inaccuracies in the acquisition process, as well as incomplete or incorrect knowledge about the pattern classes, one cannot place complete confidence in the classifier outcome. There has been increasing success in making decisions under such uncertain conditions by using a rule-based approach with effective uncertainty management, which involves identifying the causes of uncertainty and developing mathematical models for the same. These are incorporated into the rule structure so that the result would be a set of choices or decisions, with a set of associated certainty values or confidences. This paper proposes a ''unified'' methodology to combine the uncertainties associated with evidence for a given proposition, which is then systematically propagated down the decision tree. The relative importance of propositions as well as the rules themselves have also been considered. Finally, the methodology has been applied to an ATR problem and the results, when compared to some existing methods, show the overall effectiveness of this approach.

This article assesses the adequacy of the overall accuracy measure and demonstrates that it can give misleading and contradictory results. The Kappa test statistic assesses interclassifier agreement and is applied in assessing the classification accuracy of two classifiers, a neural network and a decision tree model on the same data set. The Kappa statistic is shown to be a more discerning statistical tool for assessing the classification accuracy of different classifiers and has the added advantage of being statistically testable against the standard normal distribution. It gives the analyst better interclass discrimination that the overall accuracy measure. The authors recommend that the Kappa statistic be used in preference to the overall accuracy as a means of assessing classification accuracy.

J	TROENG, T				TROENG, T			STRATEGIES IN THE TREATMENT OF CRITICAL LEG ISCHEMIA - A DECISION TREE APPROACH	CHIRURG			German	Article						DECISION ANALYSIS; DECISION TREE APPROACH; PERIPHERAL VASCULAR SURGERY; CRITICAL LEG ISCHEMIA		In critical leg ischemia the main treatment options are reconstructive vascular surgery and primary amputation but in some cases conservative treatment can be considered. The choice between the alternatives is difficult as a large number of factors must be considered. Among these are significant complication rates, reoperation rates and perioperative mortality as well as medical riskfactors. This paper demonstrates how formal decision analysis using special computer software can contribute by structuring of the decision situation and by quantification of risks and gains. Important is also the possibility of sensitivity analysis, i.e. to examine the effect of varying values of pertinent variables. The explicite structure and the quantification makes a formal decision analysis open for critique, discussion and improvement. This is a distinct advantage over the usual spontaneous clinical decision making.

J	SHAFIR, E				SHAFIR, E			UNCERTAINTY AND THE DIFFICULTY OF THINKING THROUGH DISJUNCTIONS	COGNITION			English	Article							WASON SELECTION TASK; NATURAL-SELECTION; PROSPECT-THEORY; REASONING TASK; PROBABILITY; JUDGMENT; CHOICE; REPRESENTATION; PSYCHOLOGY; DECISION	This paper considers the relationship between decision under uncertainty and thinking through disjunctions. Decision situations that lead to violations of Savage's sure-thing principle are examined, and a variety of simple reasoning problems that often generate confusion and error are reviewed. The common difficulty is attributed to people's reluctance to think through disjunctions. Instead of hypothetically traveling through the branches of a decision tree, it is suggested, people suspend judgement and remain at the node. This interpretation is applied to instances of decision making, information search, deductive and inductive reasoning, probabilistic judgement, games, puzzles and paradoxes. Some implications of the reluctance to think through disjunctions, as well as potential corrective procedures, are discussed.

INDUCTION OF REAL-TIME PATTERNS FROM OPERATING DATA FOR DIAGNOSIS AND SUPERVISORY CONTROL	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							NEURAL NETWORKS; DECISION TREES; RECOGNITION; CLASSIFIERS; DESIGN	A methodology for pattern-based supervisory control and fault diagonsis is presented, based on the multi-scale extraction of trends from process data described in Part III of this series (Bakshi and Stephanopoulos, Computers Chem. Engng 17, 1993). An explicit mapping is learned between the features extracted at multiple scales, and the corresponding process conditions, using the technique of induction by decision trees. Simple rules may be derived from the induced decision tree, to relate the relevant qualitative or quantitative features in the measured process data to process conditions. These rules are often physically interpretable and provide physical insight into the process. Industrial case studies from fine chemicals manufacturing, reactive crystallization and fed-batch fermentation are used to illustrate the characteristics of the pattern-based learning methodology and its application to process supervision and diagnosis.

The comparison is based on seven datasets with different characteristics, four being real, and three artificially created. Analysis of variance was used to detect any significant differences between the performance of the methods. There is also some discussion of the problems involved with using neural networks and, in particular, on overfitting of the training data. A comparison-between two methods to prevent overfitting is presented: finding the most appropriate network size, and the use of an independent validation set to determine when to stop training the network.

J	LIU, WZ; WHITE, AP				LIU, WZ; WHITE, AP			THE IMPORTANCE OF ATTRIBUTE SELECTION MEASURES IN DECISION TREE INDUCTION	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						DECISION TREES; NOISY DATA; INDUCTION; ATTRIBUTE SELECTION		Recent work by Mingers and by Buntine and Niblett on the performance of various attribute selection measures has addressed the topic of random selection of attributes in the construction of decision trees. This article is concerned with the mechanisms underlying the relative performance of conventional and random attribute selection measures. The three experiments reported here employed synthetic data sets, constructed so as to have the precise properties required to test specific hypotheses. The principal underlying idea was that the performance decrement typical of random attribute selection is due to two factors. First, there is a greater chance that informative attributes will be omitted from the subset selected for the final tree. Second, there is a greater risk of overfitting, which is caused by attributes of little or no value in discriminating between classes being ''locked in'' to the tree structure, near the root. The first experiment showed that the performance decrement increased with the number of available pure-noise attributes. The second experiment indicated that there was little decrement when all the attributes were of equal importance in discriminating between classes. The third experiment showed that a rather greater performance decrement (than in the second experiment) could be expected if the attributes were all informative, but to different degrees.

Design: A meta-analysis of short-term survival was combined with a simple decision tree to determine marginal cost-effectiveness ratios for different infarct locations and different likelihoods of AMI (pMI). Setting: Six randomized trials comparing IVSK with conservative treatment. Patients: 31,940 patients with onset of symptoms of AMI from four to 24 hours earlier and, with the exception of one trial, electrocardiographic abnormalities. Patients with contraindications to thrombolytic treatment such as uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. Main results: If AMI is certain, treatment with IVSK has marginal cost-effectiveness ratios for each additional life saved of $9,900, $56,600, and $28,400, respectively, for patients with anterior, inferior, and other locations of AMI. If pMI is 50%, treatment with IVSK has marginal cost-effectiveness ratios for each additional life saved of $22,700, $131,800, and $63,100, respectively, for patients with anterior, inferior, and other locations of AMI. Conclusions: The marginal cost-effectiveness ratio for IVSK therapy of inferior infarction is six times that for anterior infarction and rises steeply as the presence of AMI becomes less certain. Assuming society is willing to pay $250,000 per life saved, IVSK therapy should be given if the chance of acute anterior infarction exceeds 7%, if the chance of inferior infarction exceeds 32%, or if the chance of infarction in other locations exceeds 17%. In patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction, IVSK saves lives and is a reasonable use of societal resources.

Among the statistical procedures proposed to solve this problem, recursive partitioning is appealing for the easily-used and intuitive nature of the rules it produces. The rules have the form of classification trees, in which each node of the tree represents a simple question about one of the predictor variables, and the branch taken depends on the answer. The authors consider the role of misclassification costs in developing classification trees. By varying the ratio of costs assigned to false negatives and false positives, a series of classification trees are generated, each optimal for some range of cost ratios, and each with a different sensitivity and specificity. The set of sensitivity-specificity combinations define a curve that can be used like an ROC curve.

The different SPE steps can be performed automatically on disposable extraction cartridges (DECs) by means of a sample processor. A knowledge-based system was developed to facilitate the development of fully automated methods for the solid-phase extraction of relatively hydrophobic basic drugs from plasma, coupled with their determination by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The DEC filled with 50 mg of cyanopropyl-bonded silica phase is first conditioned with methanol and buffer solution (pH 7.4). After sample application, the DEC sorbent is washed with the same buffer. The analytes are then desorbed with an appropriate eluent and the eluate is finally diluted with the same buffer as used in the HPLC mobile phase before injection. Under these conditions, only three variables are still to be optimized: the composition and volume of the elution solvent and the volume of buffer to be added to the eluate. On the basis of this general strategy, a decision tree providing information about suggested starting conditions and guidelines for the optimization of the three variables was developed and implemented by use of a hypermedia software. This didactic expert system was evaluated using several P-receptor blocking agents as model compounds and the operating conditions obtained for the automated SPE of these compounds are presented. A method for the determination of propranolol in plasma using the SPE conditions deduced from the knowledge-based system was validated. The absolute recovery of propranolol is ca. 93% and the limit of detection is 1.3 ng ml(-1). The mean within-day and between-day reproducibilities are 2.3 and 3.6%, respectively.

J	TELIAN, SA				TELIAN, SA			MANAGEMENT OF THE SMALL ACOUSTIC NEUROMA - A DECISION-ANALYSIS	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OTOLOGY			English	Article							HEARING PRESERVATION; POSTERIOR-FOSSA; TUMOR SURGERY; CONSERVATION; EXPERIENCE; REMOVAL	Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium may detect small acoustic neuromas before significant symptoms have developed. In this situation, the patient and surgeon may question whether the tumor requires treatment, especially if the tumor was discovered incidentally. A computerized clinical decision analysis was undertaken to model the decision to observe such tumors or proceed to immediate surgery. The decision tree was constructed with flexibility to account for tumor size, hearing level, and other critical variables such as the individual's aversion to unilateral hearing loss and facila paralysis. Unless life expectancy is short, the analysis suggests that surgery at the time of diagnosis is appropriate, assuming that growth of the tumor is anticipated. Variations in surgical proficiency and patient risk aversion within expected ranges do not influence the decision to operate. The most critical variable appears to be the probability that the tumor will remain stable in size. This finding suggests that better data regarding the growth rate of small acoustic neuromas is needed.

Model development and validation data sets contained 100 and 34 stand observations, respectively. The final decision-tree structure yielded seven possible hazard outcomes based on total stand basal area, percentage of total basal area composed of spruce, percentage of spruce basal area composed of trees with diameter >25 cm, stand elevation, and stand aspect. Three paths in the decision tree led to low-hazard outcomes (spruce basal area loss less-than-or-equal-to 10%); one path led to a high-hazard outcome (spruce basal area loss >40%). No paths through the decision tree led to a medium-hazard outcome (spruce basal area loss >10%, but less-than-or-equal-to 40%), but three less precise outcomes of low-medium and medium-high hazard were considered useful and retained in the final model. Results of model verification were considered very acceptable; in the worst case, predictions of high hazard were correct for 73% of the observations. Model validation results were also considered very acceptable considering the small number of observations available for this phase of analysis.

This is significant because technical, cost, and schedule risk should and can be addressed within the context of a single analytical methodology. Technical, cost, and schedule preference are represented as the project manager's utility function, u(TCS). The expected value of the utility function is calculated for various alternatives, in the context of a decision tree. The Analytic Hierarchy Process is used to elicit the utility functions and to assign probabilities to the decision tree. The alternative with the maximum E[u(TCS)] is the implied alternative of choice.	UNIV ALABAMA,HUNTSVILLE,AL 35899	RIGGS, JL (reprint author), QUANTITECH INC,HUNTSVILLE,AL, USA.

For each contingency a number of decision rules in the form of a Decision Tree (DT) is built off-line from a preclassified Learning Set (LS) consisting of operating points (OP) of the system. For the real time application of the method the DTs corresponding to the foreseen contingencies are searched on-line to provide optimal guidelines for preventive control of the system. The algorithm developed is applied to the steady state security assessment of a realistic model of the Hellenic Interconnected power system comprising 240 busbars, 270 branches, 57 transformers and 30 equivalent generators.

From this experiment we find that Humans. Neural Nets, and the Pao-Hu procedure favour a decision tree different from that preferred by the ID3 machine learning algorithm. Implications for the 'strong convergence hypothesis' between neural network and machine learning are discussed, with emphasis here on a 'stronger convergence hypothesis' between neural networks and humans. We further compare the generalization properties of the four approaches, and we introduce a method of 'backprediction' as a measure of the relative quality of generalizations. The relationships of our findings to other recent investigations comparing symbolic and neural learning algorithms are discussed.

Recalling different emotional dispositions of the volunteers biography, we make use of an imagination exercise. The psychophysiological information was analyzed according to the following scheme: 12-s-synchronization between EEG parameters and rating variables. The statistical interpretation was performed by nonparametrical tests (Mann-Whitney with an alpha-risk adjustment in multiple tests), correlation analysis and a parametrical and a nonparametrical (decision tree) discriminance analysis. Results: the EEG is specifically modulated by the emotions in order of 20% to 60% (power parameters) and between 2% and 20% (site parameters). Physiologically caused hemisphere differences are lying between 10% to 30%. Emotionally caused lateralization effects are interindividually different and in order of 1% to 5%. The discriminance analysis shows that power of distinction increases with the intensity of emotions. The results confirm the trends, which were proposed by Machleidt and co-workers and they oppose various physiological theories of emotion.

Methods: We used a Markov decision tree to compute the expected survival in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for each strategy, based on literature-derived estimates for the probabilities of different outcomes in this model. We determined hospital costs for patients undergoing elective and emergency AAA repair at our center. With standard methods of cost accounting, we then calculated the additional cost per year of life saved by early surgery compared with watchful waiting (cost-effectiveness ratio, dollars/QALY). Results: Mean hospital costs for elective and emergency AAA repair were $24,020 and $43,208, respectively (1992 dollars). for our base-case analysis (60-year-old men with 4 cm diameter AAAs, with 5% elective operative mortality rate and 3.3% annual rupture rate), early surgery improved survival by 0.34 QALYs compared with watchful waiting, at an incremental cost of $17,404/QALY. Increased elective surgical mortality rate, decreased AAA rupture risk, and increased patient age all reduced the cost-effectiveness of early surgery. Future increases in elective operative risk, noncompliance with ultrasound follow-up and increased threshold size for elective AAA repair during watchful waiting ah improved the cost-effectiveness of early surgery. future increases in elective operative risk, noncompliance with ultrasound follow-up and increased threshold size for elective AAA repair during watchful waiting ah improved the cost-effectiveness of early surgery. Conclusions: The cost effectiveness of early surgery for 4 cm diameter AAAs in carefully selected patients compares favorably with that of other commonly accepted preventive interventions such as hypertension screening and treatment. With an upper limit of $40,000/QALY as and ''acceptable'' cost-effectiveness ratio, early surgery appears to be justified for patients 70 years old or younger, if the AAA rupture risk is 3%/year or more and the elective operative mortality rate is 5% or less. Although not a substitute for clinical judgment, this cost-effectiveness analysis delineates the essential tradeoffs and uncertainties in treating patients with small AAAs.

J	BOHANEC, M; BRATKO, I				BOHANEC, M; BRATKO, I			TRADING ACCURACY FOR SIMPLICITY IN DECISION TREES	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						DECISION TREES; KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION; PRUNING; DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING		When communicating concepts, it is often convenient or even necessary to define a concept approximately. A simple, although only approximately accurate concept definition may be more useful than a completely accurate definition which involves a lot of detail. This paper addresses the problem: given a completely accurate, but complex, definition of a concept, simplify the definition, possibly at the expense of accuracy, so that the simplified definition still corresponds to the concept ''sufficiently'' well. Concepts are represented by decision trees, and the method of simplification is tree pruning. Given a decision tree that accurately specifies a concept, the problem is to find a smallest pruned tree that still represents the concept within some specified accuracy. A pruning algorithm is presented that finds an optimal solution by generating a dense sequence of pruned trees, decreasing in size, such that each tree has the highest accuracy among all the possible pruned trees of the same size. An efficient implementation of the algorithm, based on dynamic programming, is presented and empirically compared with three progressive pruning algorithms using both artificial and real-world data. An interesting empirical finding is that the real-world data generally allow significantly greater simplification at equal loss of accuracy.

The approach uses statistical simulation techniques to demonstrate that the usual measures such as information gain, gain ratio, and a new measure recently proposed by Lopez de Mantaras (1991) are all biased in favour of attributes with large numbers of values. It is concluded that approaches which utilise the chi-square distribution are preferable because they compensate automatically for differences between attributes in the number of levels they take.

A meta-analysis of the literature was performed to synthesize the results of clinical trials of ondansetron and metoclopramide for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving high-dose cisplatin therapy. A cost-benefit analysis was performed by constructing a decision tree of the possible outcomes of treatment with ondansetron or metoclopramide. Clinical outcomes were measured by counting the emesis episodes occurring within 24 hours after the antiemetic was given and the extrapyramidal reactions occurring after metoclopramide was given. The improvement in quality of life was transformed to an increase in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in order to conduct a cost-utility analysis. Only direct costs of drug, materials, and labor were included in the cost calculations. The meta-analysis, combined with empirical observations, yielded expected emesis rates of 2.03 and 2.69 per patient for ondansetron and metoclopramide, respectively. The rate of extrapyramidal symptoms for metoclopramide recipients was 6.8%. The cost-benefit analysis yielded estimated total costs of $139 ($211) and $116 ($154) per 40-kg (70-kg) patient receiving ondansetron and metoclopramide, respectively. The cost-utility analysis yielded an incremental cost of ondansetron of $168,391 ($407,667) per QALY in 40-kg (70-kg) patients. Sensitivity analysis showed robustness of the expected outcomes except in a best-case scenario. A cost-utility analysis suggested that, compared with metoclopramide, ondansetron provides a small antiemetic benefit at a large additional cost.

Based on a single-centre retrospective personal study of 248 multiple pregnancies, 10 of which presented a monofetal intrauterine death, the authors observed the type of placentation, the age and cause of the death, the way in which pregnancy continued and the outcome of the surviving twin. This investigation also includes a review of published documents. Monochorial pregnancies were more frequently encountered in the case of monofetal death in utero. The etiology of the death was not always found and one surviving twin presented lesions as microcephaly convulsions and was retarded on a psychomotor level. In this series these complications did not exist when the pregnancy was bichorial. The authors conclude by demonstrating the major risk of fetal contamination for a live twin coexisting with a dead twin in the case on monochorial pregnancy. Other parameters (cause of death, gestational age at death, delay and duration of cohabitation), do not seem to be significant. It would appear to be of fundamental importance to establish an accurate diagnosis of placentation and to implement specific surveillance of monochorial pregnancies. A decision tree is suggested for use in the case of monofetal death.		GAUCHERAND, P (reprint author), HOP CROIX ROUSSE,DEPT OBSTET & GYNAECOL,93 GDE RUE CROIX ROUSSE,F-69004 LYON,FRANCE.

Each has appropriate salvage strategies in the event of local recurrence. We used decision analysis to determine the optimal strategy for neck treatment as a function of the probability of occult cervical metastasis. Data Sources: We used the bibliographies of current articles and books to access clinical studies of patients with stage NO neck cancer. Study Selection: Studies that included large numbers of patients and contained a minimum 2-year follow-up, with results analyzed in terms of outcome as a function of stage of neck disease, were included. Data Extraction: Specific data points were extracted from the studies independently by multiple observers, and mean values were used in the decision analysis. Data Synthesis: A decision tree was constructed with use of a computer model to compare the three management strategies. Probabilities of each of the possible events depicted in the trees were inserted into the tree structure. These probabilities were gleaned from the literature as described above. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the optimal threshold for treatment of the neck. Conclusion: A patient with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and stage NO neck status should be observed if the probability of occult cervical metastasis is less than 20%. If the probability is greater than 20%, treatment of the neck is warranted. The treatment plan should ideally involve a single modality of therapy; both neck dissection and radiation therapy are quite efficacious in the clinical context, and the decision of which one to employ should be driven by the treatment of the primary lesion. Decision analysis is useful in complex clinical situations.

Most of the existing top-down decision tree design methods make use of single feature splits at successive stages of the tree design. While computationally attractive, single feature splits generally lead to large trees and inferior performance. This paper presents a new top-down decision tree design method that generates compact trees of superior performance by using multifeature splits in place of single feature splits at successive stages of the tree development. The multifeature splits in the proposed method are obtained by combining the concept of information measure of a partition with perceptron learning. Several decision tree induction results for a broad range of classification problems are presented to demonstrate the strengths of the proposed decision tree design methods.

Since the performance of these methods is a function of the environment in which they are implemented, it is the responsibility of the manager to select the method best suited for a particular application. In this paper we present a methodology for assisting managers in the selection process. Specifically, three classes of procurement methods are considered, these are: demand based, reorder, and JIT methods. The selection methodology is structured as a decision tree, which considers the annual usage value, lead time ratio, holding cost, vendor location, vendor delivery performance, and material supply value. Each factor is evaluated on a three level scale, and on the basis of these evaluations the tree makes a selection. The application of the methodology is illustrated via some examples.

With reference to the situation in The Netherlands, recommendations for overcoming these three shortcomings are presented. For priority species it is proposed that a population decline of more than 5% is unacceptable in target areas having ''general environmental quality.'' Populations should have recovered after one year. Outside the target area and in areas having ''special environmental quality'' there should be no decline at all in population densities. An integral decision tree is presented with which to incorporate assessment of indirect side effects in the registration procedure, achieving a better balance relative to direct side effects. Spectrum of action, scale of use, overlap of habitats, and compound efficacy are employed as criteria for assessing in direct side effects. The decision tree prescribes field trials in cases where lab testing indicates a moderate hazard or uncertainty. Finally, guidelines are presented for selecting appropriate pesticide field trials.

A longest common subsequence of two strings is a common subsequence of both that is as long as any other common subsequences. The longest common subsequence problem is to find the longest common subsequence of two given strings. The bound on the complexity of this problem under the decision tree model is known as mn if the number of distinct symbols that can appear in strings is infinite, where m and n are the lengths of the two strings, respectively, and m less-than-or-equal-to n. In this paper, we propose two parallel algorithms for this problem on the CREW-PRAM model. One takes O(log2 m + log n) time with mn/log m processors, which is faster than all the existing algorithms on the same model. The other takes O(log2 m log log m) time with mn/ log2 m log log m processors when log2 m log log m > log n, or otherwise O(log n) time with mn/ log n processors, which is optimal in the sense that the time x processors bound matches the complexity bound of the problem. Both algorithms exploit nice properties of the LCS problem that are discovered in this paper.		LU, M (reprint author), TEXAS A&M UNIV,DEPT ELECT ENGN,COLLEGE STN,TX 77843, USA.

A decision tree which is capable of generating the desired line flows and bus voltages are created using the training patterns which are compiled from the historical operating records of Taiwan power system. The established decision tree contains the knowledge which are essential for line flow and bus voltage prediction. Thus, it can be applied to estimate line flows and bus voltages of a system in an efficient manner. The effectiveness of the proposed ID3 approach is demonstrated by security assessment of Taiwan power system which contains 170 buses and 207 lines.

However, a disadvantage with this approach is that the knowledge embedded in the neural network is opaque. In this paper, we show how to interpret neural network knowledge in symbolic form. We lay down required definitions for this treatment, formulate the interpretation algorithm, and formally verify its soundness. The main result is a formalized relationship between a neural network and a rule-based system. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the neural network generates rules of better performance than the decision tree approach in noisy conditions.

We have assessed the importance of the distinction between classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that recognize the presence of currently active disease from those that, in addition, incorporate evidence of past disease activity in ascertaining disease occurrence. We applied 7 classification schemes to a population of twins with inflammatory arthritis to determine (a) the number of individuals classified as RA positive by each scheme and hence the effect on the estimate of disease concordance in the twins and (b) their performance in correctly assigning a diagnosis compared with a physician's opinion. Methods. The schemes assessed were the 1958 ARA (Rome) criteria which detect active disease, the 1966 New York (using both the 214 and 314 published cutoffs) which detect ''ever'' disease and 4 variants of the 1987 ARA criteria. These were the 417 and decision tree approaches applied on the basis of the relevant features (1) being present at the time of the study and (2) being present ever and allowing current joint deformity to substitute for absent joint swelling. Results. In all, 283 individuals with a history of joint swelling were assessed, 255 of whom were considered to have RA by their physician. Criteria used to recognize ''current'' RA identified only about 70 % of those which recognized RA ever. These differences in ascertainment level produced a marked effect on the monozygotic twin RA concordance estimates with percentages ranging from 10 to 18 %. The results from receiver operating curves confirmed that criteria used to assess only current RA were too insensitive to be of value. Of the criteria that recognized RA status ever the 1987 ARA performed best overall. Conclusion, The use of classification methods that incorporate past as well as current evidence of disease activity is essential to avoid important misclassification in epidemiological and family studies. The 1987 criteria, applied retrospectively and allowing joint deformity to substitute for swelling, are of enhanced value over other existing schemes.

This technique is then used to obtain a tight OMEGA (n log n) lower bound for a problem of finding a minimum cost triangulation of a convex polygon with weighted vertices. This problem is similar to the problem of finding an optimal order of computing a matrix chain product. If the lower bound technique could be extended to bounded degree algebraic decision trees, a tight Q(n log n) lower bound for this latter problem would be obtained.

Without collecting a new set of diagnosis examples, the presented algorithm reconstructs a decision tree preserving the error rate of diagnosis from an original tree and a frequency of diagnoses, which is counted at reaching the corresponding terminal node of that tree when applied to a real domain. The new tree has a shorter path length to diagnose and a logically same meaning with the original tree because of generating a set of pseudo-examples whose unobserved attribute values uniformly distribute in the value range. To reduce the computational cost, a method to avoid a generation of a pseudoexample set also is presented. The context dependencies between attributes are considered by introducing an attribute concatenation. The experiments show that an average path length will be reduced by 6 to 10 percent after reconstruction of a randomly generated decision tree with nonoptimized diagnosis frequencies.

In this design scheme, a binary decision tree is constructed at first by using fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm. At each node, a representative subset of features which can split best the labelled data into two dissimilar groups is selected from all the available features on the base of cluster validity. The cluster validity is evaluated under the two criteria. The one is the polarization degree, and the other is whether all the samples of a class belong to the same cluster or not. Then, a hierarchical cluster structure for the HFPMC is reconstructed by combining the successive nodes formed by the same representative subset of features. As the hierarchical classifier, is used a fuzzy pattern matching classifier in which the designer's intuitive knowledges about the pattern recognition problem can be easily incorporated. At each subhierarchy, the reference fuzzy sets and prototypes for the HFPMC are defined based on the cluster centers of the corresponding subhierarchy. The proposed design scheme is applied to the design of a HFPMC for the tire tread pattern recognition. The design procedure including feature extraction is described in detail. Experimental results show the usefulness of the proposed design scheme.	KOREA UNIV,KOSF,ADV CONTROL & INSTRUMENT RES CTR,DEPT ELECT ENGN,SEOUL 136701,SOUTH KOREA							Bezdek J.

A recent result identified conditions under which pruning techniques increase prediction accuracy. However, this result is based on samples of size three. This paper provides a generalization of previous results and investigates conditions where pruning is beneficial for concept accuracy as well as concept simplification.

Knowledge acquisition is the main bottleneck in the knowledge engineer's work. Machine-learning tools have contributed positively to the process of trying to eliminate or open up this bottleneck, but how do we know whether the field is progressing? How can we determine the progress made in any of its branches? How can we be sure of an advance and take advantage of it? This article proposes a benchmark as a classificatory, comparative, and metric criterion for machine-learning tools. The benchmark centers on the knowledge engineering viewpoint, covering some of the characteristics the knowledge engineer wants to find in a machine-learning tool. The proposed model has been applied to a set of machine-learning tools, comparing expected and obtained results. Experimentation validated the model and led to interesting results.

J	DALLAIRE, SM				DALLAIRE, SM			A METHODOLOGY FOR HANDLING EXPLORATION RISK AND CONSTRUCTING SUPPLY CURVES FOR OIL AND GAS PLAYS WHEN RESOURCES ARE STACKED	BULLETIN OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM GEOLOGY			English	Article								The use of project economics to estimate full-cycle supply prices for undiscovered oil and gas resources is a straightforward exercise for those regions where oil and gas plays are not vertically superimposed on one another, that is, they are not stacked. Exploration risk is incorporated into such an analysis by using a simple two-outcome decision tree model to include the costs of dry and abandoned wells. The decision tree model can be expanded to include multiple targets or discoveries, but this expansion requires additional drilling statistics and resource assessment data. This paper suggests a methodology to include exploration risk in the preparation of supply curves when stacked resources are expected and little or no information on uphole resources is available. In this method, all exploration costs for wells drilled to targets in the play being evaluated are assigned to that play, rather than prorated among the multiple targets or discoveries. Undiscovered pools are assumed to either bear all exploration costs (full-cycle discoveries) or no exploration costs (half-cycle discoveries). The weighted full- and half-cycle supply price is shown to be a more realistic estimate of the supply price of undiscovered pools in a play when stacked resources exist. The statistics required for this methodology are minimal, and resource estimates for prospects in other zones are not required. The equation relating the average pool finding cost to the discovery record is applicable to different scenarios regarding the presence of shallower and deeper resources. The equation derived for the two-outcome decision-tree model is shown to be a special case of the general expression.

This paper introduces a method to make numerous data in hierarchy for concentrated knowledge. In order to make knowledge concentrated in a simple form. There are many methods to come up this purpose. A method called interpretive structural modeling (ISM) can be used to decide the factors with affect the subject, and know how strong the factors affect to the object. Decision tree can be represented the knowledge briefly by information theory, it use the data elevated by ISM. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to show the order of the results. Knowledge concentrated method can be achieved in integration these methods for knowledge acquisition. We proposed a new method for knowledge concentration. Concentrated knowledge is compound with the tree main methods. This method is easily applied to the knowledge base in expert system. Here is shown a suggestion for metal making technology knowledge.

We hypothesized that martens would rest in sites that minimized energetic costs, and that the relative thermal efficiency of sites would vary as a function of snow depth and weather. By measuring heat loss from a heated model and calculating operative temperature, we found that equivalent marten metabolic rates were inversely related to operative temperatures. Operative temperatures were generally higher outside resting cavities than inside, except when snow was >15 cm, outside air temperature was less than or equal to-5 degrees C, and wind was greater than or equal to 0.3 m s(-1). For the models lying on a snowy substrate, total body conductance was 0.32 W degrees C-1, 23% higher than with the models lying on dry wood chips. The microenvironments of resting sites and the preferences of martens generally are consistent with our hypothesis of behavioural thermoregulation. Conductance contributed strongly to total thermal losses and to explaining selection of resting sites. We propose a decision tree to predict where American martens should rest under a range of environmental conditions.

By recursively calling certain learning functions, it is possible to extract all logic dependencies between signals in a circuit and to perform precise implications for a given set of value assignments. This is of fundamental importance because it represents a new solution to the Boolean satisfiability problem. Thus, what we present is a new and uniform conceptual framework for a wide range of CAD problems including, but not limited to, test pattern generation, design verification, as well as logic optimization problems. Previous test generators for combinational and sequential circuits use a decision tree to systematically explore the search space when trying to generate a test vector. Recursive learning represents an attractive alternative. Using recursive learning with sufficient depth of recursion during the test generation process guarantees that implications are performed precisely; i.e., all necessary assignments for fault detection are identified at every stage of the algorithm so that no backtracks can occur. Consequently, no decision tree is needed to guarantee the completeness of the test generation algorithm. Recursive learning is not restricted to a particular logic alphabet and can be combined with most test generators for combinational and sequential circuits. Experimental results that demonstrate the efficiency of recursive learning are compared with the conventional branch-and-bound technique for test generation in combinational circuits. In particular, redundancy identification by recursive learning is demonstrated to be much more efficient than by previously reported techniques. In an important recent development, recursive learning has been shown to provide significent progress in design verification problems [22]. Also importantly, recursive learning-based techniques have already been shown to be useful for logic optimization. Specifically, techniques based on recursive learning have already yielded better optimized circuits than the well known MIS-II.

The inference algorithms for training these techniques, however, are designed to maximize the accuracy of the classifier, with all errors weighted equally. In many applications, certain errors are far more costly than others, and the need arises for nonparametric classification techniques that can be trained to optimize task-specific cost functions. This correspondence reviews the Linear Machine Decision Tree (LMDT) algorithm for inducing multivariate decision trees, and shows how LMDT can be altered to induce decision trees that minimize arbitrary misclassification cost functions (MCF's). Demonstrations of pixel classification in outdoor scenes show how MCF's can optimize the performance of embedded classifiers within the context of larger image understanding systems.

J	WATERS, H				WATERS, H			DECISION-MAKING AND RACE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERCULTURAL RELATIONS			English	Article							META-ANALYSIS; DISCRIMINATION; BLACK	The argument is presented that managers in organizations characterized by a high degree of diversity are not well prepared to deal with problems that are race based. Part of the problem stems from a lack of understanding as to what constitutes a ''racist'' event or incident. Current management textbooks offer little guidance to the decision processes minority individuals may use to conclude that discrimination has occurred or that racism is operating. To assist managers, a decision tree model is offered. The model delineates those factors hypothesized to influence the minority individual's cognitive processes and the potential problems that can result.

This study examined the implications of annual screening mammography for cost and mortality in American Indian populations with differing baseline breast cancer rates. Methods. A decision tree compared annual screening mammography and screening clinical breast examination with referral for diagnostic mammography when appropriate. The decision tree was constructed to examine the effect of different base-line cancer rates, stage at diagnosis, and stage-specific survival. Outcomes included 5-year relative survival, deaths prevented at 5 years, cost per death prevented, and total costs. Results. The findings suggest that the total cost of breast cancer is 3.6 times higher with the screening mammography program hut results in a 27.9% reduction in breast cancer deaths over the first 5 years of the program. Both costs and deaths prevented are sensitive to the incidence of breast cancer in the population and are less favorable in the range of incidence seen in American Indians. Conclusions. The cost and impact of a given strategy for cancer screening vary among communities with different disease incidence, stage at diagnosis, and stage-specific survival, as seen in American Indian populations.

Therefore, we have constructed a decision tree to determine outcome probabilities between performing abdominal aortic surgery alone or to perform preoperative testing which may lead to coronary revascularization before noncardiac surgery. Sensitivity analyses were performed in which the assigned probabilities, obtained from the literature, were varied within a reported range to determine its influence on the optimal decision pathway. The optimal decision whether to perform preoperative testing and coronary revascularization prior to abdominal aortic reconstruction is dependent on both the mortality associated with coronary revascularization and the mortality of the surgical procedure performed without preoperative interventions. Within the range of mortality reported in the literature, strategies of either selective preoperative testing or no preoperative testing can be justified.

DEVELOPMENT OF A STATISTICAL STRATEGY	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						ADVISORY SYSTEMS; DATA ANALYSIS; ESTIMATION; KNOWLEDGE-BASED INTERFACES; OBJECT-ORIENTED PARADIGM; SIGNIFICANCE TESTING; STATISTICAL STRATEGY; TREE STRUCTURES		The goal of a computerized statistical advisory system is to incorporate into software specific and sound advice on appropriately applying statistical techniques and interpreting their results for a given set of data. At the heart of such a system is the statistical strategy, the conceptual model used to represent the reasoning of an expert statistician, this paper presents our experience in developing a statistical strategy for a prototype knowledge-based advisory system. The statistical strategy was conceived in two stages. First, a hierarchical structure of decision trees at different levels of abstraction, together with rules for traversing the structure, was developed as a vehicle for eliciting the strategy from expert statisticians. In the second stage, the underlying objects and essential modes of decision-making implicitly incorporated in the decision-tree structure were extracted and a specific taxonomy for the problem was developed. A more general, object-oriented paradigm based on the results of this second stage was used to implement the prototype model. The statistical strategy was developed with a specific user audience in mind and focused on a well-defined subset of statistical techniques often used by that audience.

Decisionmakers can gain insight on these difficult budgeting decisions by using economic evaluation techniques. To aid in the economic evaluation, a conceptual framework based on a decision-tree model was developed. The framework describes substance abuse addiction and treatment dynamics and highlights important therapeutic and economic endpoints. Within this framework, the authors describe how cost-effectiveness and benefit-cost analyses can be used to compare the costs and outcomes of alternative substance abuse intervention programs. Implementation of the conceptual framework requires detailed information on the parameters of the substance abuse addiction and treatment process that does not yet exist. But the paper includes a detailed example of how the conceptual framework can be used to perform economic evaluation of alternative substance abuse intervention programs.

The frequency of low birthweight decreases when women quit smoking in the first trimester of pregnancy. This analysis examines the cost-effectiveness of smoking-cessation programs during pregnancy for the prevention of low birthweight. Methods. Using data from the 1988 National Health Interview Survey and estimated costs of care for low birthweight and normal birthweight infants, a decision tree was constructed to estimate break-even costs for smoking-cessation programs, assuming a success rate of 18%. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine how program effectiveness and changes in the population affected the break-even costs. Results. For a population similar to that which participated in the 1988 National Health Interview Survey, smoking-cessation programs would be cost-effective if the program cost $80 or less. In general, to be cost-effective, a smoking-cessation program has to decrease smoking rates by 2.15% to justify every $10 in program costs. Sensitivity analyses showed that as the baseline spontaneous quit rate in the smoking population decreases, smoking-cessation programs of higher cost become more cost-effective. Conclusions. Smoking cessation programs during pregnancy may be cost-effective for preventing low birthweight if their cost is $80 or less and they achieve success rates of at least 18%.

Analyses were done from the viewpoints of a third-party payer and society using data from a randomized trial and the literature. Assuming low-osmolality media reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, the incremental cost per QALY gained with these media is $17,264 in high-risk or $47,874 in low-risk patients for a third-party payer. From a societal viewpoint, the corresponding costs are $649 and $35,509. These estimates are sensitive to the cost and volume of the contrast medium employed and to the estimate of reduction in severe adverse events with low-osmolality media. The authors conclude that, in the context of restricted budgets, limiting the use of low-osmolality media to high-risk patients is justifiable, as the incremental cost per QALY in high-risk patients may be reasonable and it is not certain that low-osmolality media prevent severe or fatal events. A considerable reduction in the cost per QALY gained is possible by minimizing the volume of contrast medium used.

Suitably expanded, it may cover other more complex types of refrigerating machine. The system could also be suitable for education and training. In the version described here, SRMES is intended to demonstrate that the use of expert system tools in the refrigeration industry may lead to higher efficiency and better performance. Although the version described in the paper has been optimized for off-line performance, its extension to on-line application may be justified by relevant experience gained through its practical operation. Particular attention is devoted in the paper to the development of the decision tree. It is shown that with computer hardware of limited capacity knowledge-based rules can be used to reach specific diagnoses of the performance of small refrigerating machines.

The study was performed in eight Danish dairy herds with outbreaks of mucosal disease. The calculations were made for three alternative control strategies referring to different test and slaughter policies after the initial case of mucosal disease: (1) no blood testing, (2) blood testing of all animals in a risk group defined as animals that are within 3 months of age of the first mucosal disease case and (3) blood testing of all animals in the herds. Sensitivity analyses were made on test price for virological examination, loss from an animal dying, loss due to an animal being slaughtered and the probability of persistently infected cattle dying if they were not blood tested. Under the assumptions used, the blood testing of animals in the defined risk group resulted in the lowest immediate loss and expenses when calculations were made on all eight herds together. However, on an individual-farm basis the recommended control strategy showed some mild sensitivity to the incorporated variables, though testing the defined risk group was always most beneficial to the greatest number of farms.

A decision tree was constructed so as to set out the initial procedure costs of both techniques and possible subsequent costs due to treatment failure or complications. The computations were based on figures from the University Clinic, Erlangen, in 1993. The direct (medical) costs of laparoscopic cholecystectomy amounted to DM 3556, to which must be added further indirect costs of DM 3152 arising from loss of working capacity and premature death. The direct expenses for lithotripsy including outpatient aftercare were DM 6708 and the indirect expenses DM 1858. The overall costs per patient for lithotripsy are hence DM 1858 higher than those of laporoscopic cholecystectomy. This cost difference remained substantially unaltered even when the success rates of the two techniques were varied over a wide range. When lithotripsy is performed entirely as an outpatient procedure and inpatient costs hence disappear, the expected overall cost drops from DM 8567 to DM 6381. Omission of the lump sum charge for lithotripsy effects a similar drop in overall costs to DM 6379. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is hence cheaper than lithotripsy. Only if lithotripsy can be performed at very low cost can it compete with laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

PERCOLATION AND SEEPAGE LOSSES	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						RICE; WATER USE EFFICIENCY; SIMULATION MODELING	SOILS	The concept of a constant seepage and percolation (SP) rate in monitoring the water balance of flooded rice fields, as often used in e.g. irrigation system design and management, was investigated. First, magnitude and variability of percolation rate were studied for different combinations of soil-hydraulic properties and hydrologic conditions using the validated water balance model SAWAH. Percolation losses from fields with relatively low subsoil permeability (k(s,sub) < 10(-1) cm d-1) are either limited by a poorly permeable plow sole (k(s,top) < 10(-2) cm d-1) or by the low hydraulic conductivity of the subsoil itself. Typical percolation losses of 0-0.5 and 1-1.5 cm.d-1 respectively are hardly affected by ponded water depth, subsurface water content and depth of ground water table. Percolation losses from fields with relatively high subsoil permeability (k(s,sub) > 10(1) cm.d-1) may vary from 0-0.5 cm d-1 with a poorly permeable plow sole, to 1-5 cm.d-1 or more for a relatively permeable plow sole (k(s,top) > 10(-2) cm d-1). Only in the latter case, percolation rates are largely affected by the depth of ponded water. Next, the constancy of combined SP rates was studied in a field experiment on a permeable subsoil. Simple book-keeping of the water balance using a fixed SP rate proved accurate to predict the depth of ponded water in time in case of a poorly permeable plow sole and a small seepage component. A decision tree was suggested based on soil-hydraulic properties and characteristics of bunds to estimate the magnitude and variation of SP rates, and to decide whether book-keeping with a fixed SP rate is an appropriate tool in monitoring the water balance of paddy fields.

The basic idea of using decision-tree induction in process optimization and development of the domain model of electrochemical machining (ECM) is presented. How decision-tree induction is used to build and refine the knowledge base of the process is also discussed. The idea of developing an intelligent supervisory system with a learning component [Intelligent MAnufacturing FOreman (IMAFO)] that is already implemented is briefly introduced. The results of applying IMAFO for analyzing data from the ECM process are presented. How the domain model of the process (electrochemical machining) is built from the initial known information, and how the results of decision-tree induction can be used to optimize the model of the process and further refine the knowledge base are shown. Two examples are given to demonstrate how new rules (to be included in the knowledge base of an expert system) are generated from the rules induced by IMAFO. The procedure to refine these types of rules is also explained.

Data was collected in two geographically and culturally different sites. We found out that mothers do not generally panic when a child is struck by a diarrheal episode, especially when such cases are associated with developmental stages of the child (teething, walking and crawling). Our findings indicate that most mothers do not seek treatment outside the home until the third day. The decision making process is influenced by cultural nosography, distance to health facilities, access to ORS (Oral Rehidration Solution), availability of other pharmaceutical products and of financial resources. However, treatment outside home is sought only when the episode persists and is resistant to home management techniques. Mothers' decision to seek health care in modern facilities comes after a complicated process of choices or alternatives.		NKWI, PN (reprint author), UNIV YAOUNDE,BP 1862,YAOUNDE,CAMEROON.

In this study, we investigated whether texture features could be used to distinguish between mass and non-mass regions in clinical mammograms. Forty-five regions of interest (ROIs) containing true masses with various degrees of visibility and 135 ROIs containing normal breast parenchyma were extracted manually from digitized mammograms as case samples. Spatial-grey-level-dependence (SGLD) matrices of each ROI were calculated and eight texture features were calculated from the SGLD matrices. The correlation and class-distance properties of extracted texture features were analysed. Selected texture features were input into a modified decision-tree classification scheme. The performance of the classifier was evaluated for different feature combinations and orders of features on the tree. A classification accuracy of about 89% sensitivity and 76% specificity was obtained for ordered features, sum average, correlation, and energy, during the training procedure. With a leave-one-out method, the test result was about 76% sensitivity and 64% specificity. The results of this preliminary study demonstrate the feasibility of using texture information for classification of mass and normal breast tissue, which will be likely to be useful for classifying true and false detections in computer-aided diagnosis programmes.

They are claimed to handle a wide range of problems, including questions of reliability, reproducibility and validity. It is shown that care must be taken in choosing a suitable ICC with respect to the underlying sampling theory. For this purpose a decision tree is developed. It may be used to choose a coefficient which is appropriate for a specific study setting. We demonstrate that different ICC's may result in quite different values for the same data set, even under the same sampling theory. Other general limitations of ICC's are also addressed. Potential alternatives are presented and discussed, and some recommendations are given for the use of an appropriate method.

However, appropriate pre- and post-processors have to be prepared to achieve continuous input/output mapping, because the decision trees basically deal with symbolic knowledge. On the other hand, an artificial neural network is suitable for such a purpose, however, its initial structure is difficult to constitute. The authors' research goal is to develop a sophisticated knowledge acquisition system integrating decision tree induction for identifying the fundamental structure of the knowledge and neural network generation for realizing an adaptive processor based on the knowledge structure obtained as a decision tree. This paper reports an experimental approach to this goal by constructing a neural network based on the result of decision tree induction from symbolic examples, and analysing the network to elicit hidden knowledge in numerical examples.

We propose an idea of constructing initial neural network configurations by making use of decision trees and threshold logic. First, a decision tree is constructed from the given set of training patterns. Then the decision tree is translated into a neural network. Initial values for the weights and thresholds of the neural network are determined. Finally, the obtained neural network is trained by the back-propagation algorithm. Experimental results have shown that a neural network constructed in this manner learns fast and performs efficiently.

Thus, a schedule is generated capable of accepting certain degree of variability during batch production. But, in most cases an on-line adjustment to the real conditions is required. In this paper, it is presented a reactive scheduling algorithm, which adapts the current schedule to real time disturbances, integrated to a supervisory system capable of handling the new schedule generated thus, filling the existing gap between high production scheduling and low sequential control levels in the Chemical Process Industries. Changes of tasks start times and units reassignment are considered in a decision tree level based on heuristic rules.

The classifier consisted of a multilayer feed-forward network window in which the center pixel was classified using gray-scale information within the window. The network was trained by using the back-propagation algorithm with the momentum term. Based on this image segmentation problem, the effect of changing network configuration on the classification performance was also characterized. Factors including topology, rate parameters, training sample set, and initial weights were systematically analyzed. The training set consisted of 75 selected points from a 256 x 256 digitized cineangiogram. While different network topologies showed no significant effect on performance, both the learning process and the classification performance were sensitive to the rate parameters. The best result was obtained with a small learning rate (0.05) and a medium momentum rate (0.5). The three-layer (121-17-2) network was adequate for the problem and showed good generalization to the entire cineangiogram and other images including-direct video angiograms and digital subtraction angiograms. In a comparative study, the network demonstrated its superiority in classification performance; its classification accuracy was 92%, as compared to 68% from a maximum likelihood estimation method and 83% from a method based on iterative ternary classification. It was also shown that the trained neural-network classifier was equivalent to a generalized matched filter with a nonlinear decision tree.

The distributed processing alleviates the burden of communication between the control center and local substations, and increases the reliability and flexibility of the diagnosis system. Besides, by using the algorithms of data-driven decision tree induction and direct mapping from the decision tree into neural net, the proposed diagnosis system features parallel processing and easy implementation, overcoming the limitations of overly large and complex system. The approach has been practically tested on a typical Taiwan Power (Taipower) T & D system. The feasibility of such a diagnosis system is presented.

During this data analysis phase, the data model is further refined so that it obeys certain rules of good behavior. Normalization is the process of grouping data into such well refined structures. Determining an appropriate normal form has not been clear to database systems analysts. This paper proposes an effective methodology for determining normal forms by employing a cost/benefit model coupled with a decision tree. Three primary variables that impact the benefits and costs of normalization are addressed.

J	Ramanan, P; Ngan, TP				Ramanan, P; Ngan, TP			On lower bounds for constructing heaps	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER MATHEMATICS			English	Article						heaps; comparison tree model; linear decision tree model; time-complexity; worst-case performance; lower bound		A heap is an elegant and important data structure for representing a priority queue, and it has bern widely studied. Based on two analogous conjectures, we prove lower bounds on the worst-ca se time-complexity of constructing heaps, in the comparison tree and the linear decision tree models. The conjectures roughly state the following: For any positive integer k, given a set of 2(k) - 2 real numbers, constructing two disjoint heaps of 2(k-1) - 1 real numbers each can be done most efficiently by splitting the given set into two subsets of equal size, and then independently constructing a heap on each subset. Based on these conjectures, we show that any comparison tree (respectively, linear decision tree) for constructing a heap must perform at least 1.4922n - o(n) (respectively, 1.4681n - o(n)) comparisons in the worst case. Our lower bound for comparison trees is slightly inferior to the previously known lower bound of 1.5n - O(lg n) comparisons; but our proof is based on the structure of comparison trees, and is much easier to understand. Our lower bound for linear decision trees is significantly better than the previously known lower bound of 1.3644n - o(n).

The results are of interest to a range of specialist and non-specialist groups, including regulators, operators, environmental organizations, and local residents. In order that these groups can be well-informed, it is important to develop clear and consistent procedures for presenting and evaluating dispersion calculations. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution regulates the most potentially polluting industrial plants in England and Wales. Examples are given of how practical regulatory decisions can be clarified by good design and presentation of dispersion calculations. The examples cover (a) graphical comparisons of 'new' and 'old' generation models, (b) development of a flowsheet for evaluating discharge stack heights, and (c) use of decision-tree charts to plan a control strategy for multiple-source impacts of nitrogen dioxide.

We ask this question because resources are always limited, i.e., we never have enough money to do all the things we would like to do. Three types of economic evaluations are used: cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-utility analysis, and cost-benefit analysis. Although all involve a monetary and outcome comparison of two or more courses of action, the methodologies and outcomes of each type vary, making each one particularly suited for specific and different indications. Although the performance of an EE may be complex, its concept is intuitively simple. Understanding the basic elements of economic analysis is more and more important to all health-care providers because health-care policy makers at all levels are increasingly using EE for allocating resources.

The responses of onset units in the cochlear nucleus of the anesthetized guinea pig have been measured to single tones, two-tone complexes, and broadband noise (BBN; 20-kHz bandwidth). The onset units were subdivided into three groups, onset-I(On(l)), onset-L (On(L)), and onset-C (On(C)), on the basis of a decision tree using their peristimulus lime histogram (PSTH) shape and discharge rate in response to suprathreshold best-frequency (BF) tone bursts. 2. PSTHs were constructed from responses either to single tones at a unit's BF or to BBN as a function of level. When sufficient sustained activity could be elicited from the unit, arbitrarily defined as >100 spikes/s, a coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated; the majority were characterized by a CV that was similar to transient chopper units (0.35 < CV < 0.5). First spike latency decreased monotonically with increasing sound level. For the majority of onset units, the first spike timing was very precise. 3. BF rate-level functions recorded from On(L) and On, units did not show any signs of discharge rate saturation at the highest sound levels we have used (100-115 dB SPL). No systematic relationship was observed between the threshold at BF and the shape of the rate-level function. BBN rate-level functions were typically characterized by higher discharge rates than in response to BF tones. However, for On(l) units and a minority of other onset units, there was little difference in the shape of their rate-level functions in response to BF tones or BBN. 4. The threshold of most onset units to BBN was similar to the threshold to a BF tone that had similar overall root-mean-square (RMS) energy. The BBN threshold was on average, 5.5 dB greater than the BF threshold. This result contrasts with that found in auditory-nerve fibers recorded in the same species, with the use of an identical sound system, where the threshold to BBN was, on average, 19.4 dB higher. The mean threshold difference between BBN and BF tones for a population of chopper units recorded in the same series of experiments was 17.7 dB. The relative thresholds to BBN and BF tones indicated that the bandwidths near the onset units' BF threshold were broader than could be estimated with the use of single tones. Tell units were characterized by bimodal response areas. 5. When the stimulus was two tones, one varying in level at the units' BF and the other fixed in level at a frequency/intensity combination that was nonexcitatory by itself, the response was greater than the response to a single BF tone. For some units the threshold to the two-tone complex was lower than the threshold to the BF tone alone. If the tone was within 0.5 octaves of BF, this threshold shift was on average 7.6 dB. Not all frequency/intensity combinations were capable of reducing the BF threshold. 6. These results show that the input to the onset units is from auditory-nerve fibers with a range of characteristic frequencies even wider than chat implied by response areas defined with single tones. This is consistent with their enhanced temporal response to the pitch of complex sounds and suggests that they have sacrificed high resolution in the frequency domain for enhancement in the temporal domain.

So, outcome, prognostic factors and therapeutical indications are poorly defined. A retrospective study of 141 adults patients suffering ordinary low grade astrocytoma diagnosed in our unit between 1978 and 1988 was conducted. A follow up of 5 years or more, since neuropathological diagnosis, was mandatory for inclusion. Endpoint of statistical analysis was duration of survival. Results were expressed after uni and multivariates analysis. Clinical and morphological features of our series were comparable to those previously reported in the literature. Median survival time was 52 months. Considering age at diagnosis, survival curve analysis showed highly significant differences (p<0.0001) and established three prognostic classes of age (before 50, between 50 and 60, and after 60 years of age). Comparisons of survival curves showed significant statistical differences (p<0.0001) according to pretreatment functionnal status. Analysis of a clinical condition using a functionnal scale is more powerfull, from a statistical point of view, than an individual analysis of each constituting parameters. In this series a good correlation was found between functionnal status and age at diagnosis. Neurological deficit was more correlated to age than to tumor location. Multivariate analysis, using the Cox model, defined some parameters acting independantly on duration of survival : fronto-parietal location (p<0.0001), pre-therapeutical functionnal status (p<0.001), age at diagnosis (p=0.001), deepseated or multicentric tumor, mass effect (p<0.01), frontal location (p<0.02), total surgical removal (p<0.05). Non significant parameters were : radiotherapy, time before diagnosis, age of onset, sex, contrast enhancement on CT scan. Our results are in agreement with previously reported data confirmed literature data concerning prognostic factors characteristics of the host (age), characteristics of the tumor (location) and expressing the influence of the tumor on the host (functionnal status). Our series documented prognostic clinical forms of these tumors (function of age, of performance status, and of tumor location). Our results confirm the relative inefficacy of therapeutic weapons, considering the population as a whole, on duration of survival. Based on our results and on recently published data, a decision tree analysis was proposed for management of grade II astrocytomas. Two differents tools appear to provide pertinent informations on heterogeneity of patients suffering low grade astrocytomas : in one hand. works on tumor biology, and in other hand proper statistical analysis of very large groups of patients with a sufficient follow-up, and homogenous in term of clinical, neuroradiological, and histological evaluations. Randomized prospective studies are probably over difficult because of logistical and ethical reasons.

We compared ILP theories with those constructed using standard linear regression and a decision-tree learner on a series of progressively more difficult problems. When a propositional encoding is feasible for the feature-based algorithms, we show that such algorithms are capable of matching the predictive accuracies of an ILP theory. However, as the complexity of the compounds considered increased, propositional encodings becomes intractable. In such cases, our results show that ILP programs can still continue to construct accurate, understandable theories. Based on this evidence, we propose future work to realise fully the potential of ILP in structure-activity problem.

J	SANTHA, M				SANTHA, M			ON THE MONTE-CARLO BOOLEAN DECISION TREE COMPLEXITY OF READ-ONCE FORMULAS	RANDOM STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS			English	Article						BOOLEAN DECISION TREE; RANDOMIZED ALGORITHM; READ-ONCE FORMULA; LOWER BOUND		In the boolean decision tree model there is at least a linear gap between the Monte Carlo and the Las Vegas complexity of a function depending on the error probability. We prove for a large class of read-once formulae that this trivial speed-up is the best that a Monte Carlo algorithm can achieve. For every formula F belonging to that class we show that the Monte Carlo complexity of F with two-sided error p is (1 - 2p)R(F), and with one-sided error p is (1 - p)R(F), where R(F) denotes the Las Vegas complexity of F. The result follows from a general lower bound that we derive on the Monte Carlo complexity of these formulae. This bound is analoguous to the lower bound due to Saks and Wigderson on their Las Vegas complexity. (C) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

J	DUBROVSKY, M				DUBROVSKY, M			THE BINARY DECISION TREE - THE GROWING ALGORITHM AND APPLICATION TO THUNDERSTORM FORECASTING	STUDIA GEOPHYSICA ET GEODAETICA			English	Article								The paper deals with the probabilistic prediction of event occurrence with use of the binary decision tree which is grown from the learning sample. The tree growing algorithm consists in recursive partition of the predictor space by either single-predictor-based (SP) splits or by hyperplanes perpendicular to the best linear discriminant function (BLDF), and is intended to maximally effectively discriminate the elements of the learning sample with event occurrence from the elements without event occurrence. The predictand is the thunderstorm occurrence in the afternoon in Prague, the set of predictors includes variables derived from a midday single-station TEMP-A data (Perfect Frog approach), persistence predictors and predictors related to passages of the fronts across Prague. The experiments are designed to test the performance of the tree growing algorithm - with a stress upon indeterminateness following from the limited size of the learning sample - and to evaluate the predictive potential of the predictors for thunderstorm forecasting. The stability of the tree structure, the optimal size of the tree and the related prognostic skill score increase with increasing size of the learning sample. Employment of the BLDF splits allows quicker and more effective partition of the predictor space on the assumption, that the predictor vector has lower dimension and is ''well behaved'' (preferably normally distributed). The stability indices of Faust, Showalter and Adedokun were found to be the most effective predictors. Persistence and frontal predictors only slightly contribute to the total prediction skill of the decision tree. The optimally sized tree has only five splitting nodes and employs three thermodynamical predictors, one frontal and one persistence predictor.

We introduce a sublanguage of FOPL and use it to provide a first-order version of dynamic belief networks. We show that this language is expressive enough to enable reasoning over time and to allow procedural representations of conditional probability tables. In particular, we define decision tree representations of conditional probability tables that can be used to decrease the size of the created belief networks. We provide an inference algorithm for our sublanguage using the paradigm of knowledge-based model construction. Given a FOPL knowledge base and a particular situation, our algorithm constructs a propositional dynamic belief network, which can be solved using standard belief network inference algorithms. In contrast to common dynamic belief networks, the structure of our networks is more flexible and better adapted to the given situation. We demonstrate the expressive power of our language and the flexibility of the resulting belief networks using a simple knowledge base modeling the propagation of infectious diseases.

In the WHO European Region, which has a total population of 839 million inhabitants, the aver-age number of acute hepatitis B cases reported in 1991 was approximately 160 000, giving an incidence of 19 per 100 000 population. This incidence rate varies from 5 per 100 000 in western Europe to 22 per 100 000 in central Europe and 92 per 100 000 in eastern Europe. Because of under-reporting and the fact that two-thirds Of infections are asymptomatic, the reported incidence rate considerably underestimates the true incidence of HBV in Europe. For this reason, we may multiply the number of reported cases by a factor of 6 (by 2 for under-reporting and by 3 for the symptomatic/asymptomatic ratio): an estimated 900 000 to 1 000 000 infections of HBV occur in Europe each year. Approximately 90 000 chronic infections will develop from these new, cases. The spread of HBV can be controlled by universal infant or adolescent vaccination. A decision-tree-based analytical model was wed to assess the clinical and economic impact of these two interventions. The model took into account incidence and prevalence rates of HBV natural history of infection, compliance and effectiveness of vaccination, and direct and indirect costs. Data were obtained from the literature and from a WHO European survey. The cost-effectiveness ratio amounts to pound 6443 and pound 4745 per infection prevented for neonatal and adolescent vaccination, respectively. The results from these calculations show that neither vaccination of neonates ol of adolescents is cost-saving. However, the cost-effectiveness - i.e. the cost incurred to prevent an HBV infection is of an acceptable magnitude for both strategies.

This review discusses only the crystalline stoichiometric hydrates in which the environment of the water molecules exhibits various defined patterns, and emphasizes pharmaceutical hydrates and their behavior. The presence of the water molecules influences the intermolecular interactions (affecting the internal energy and enthalpy) and the crystalline disorder (entropy), and hence influences the free energy, thermodynamic activity, solubility, dissolution rate, stability, and bioavailability. In addition, many solid-state properties are altered, including mechanical behavior, such as tableting, grinding, and product performance. The physicochemical characterization of hydrates is included in a flow chart of questions to be answered as part of a ''decision tree'' during the process of product development. Pharmaceutical hydrates may be characterized by a variety of complementary physicochemical methods most of which are well-known. This review details the characterization of hydrates by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and isothermal microcalorimetry, and considers a variety of pharmaceutical examples.

In this paper cognitive uncertainties involved in classification problems are explicitly represented, measured, and incorporated into the knowledge induction process. A fuzzy decision tree induction method, which is based on the reduction of classification ambiguity with fuzzy evidence, is developed. Fuzzy decision trees represent classification knowledge more naturally to the way of human thinking and are more robust in tolerating imprecise, conflict, and missing information.

J	RONTOGIANNIS, A; DIMOPOULOS, NJ				RONTOGIANNIS, A; DIMOPOULOS, NJ			A PROBABILISTIC APPROACH FOR REDUCING THE SEARCH COST IN BINARY DECISION TREES	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS			English	Letter							MACHINE	In many complex problems a particular decision making procedure is often required in order for a final solution to he found. Such a procedure may consist of a large number of intermediate steps where ''local'' decisions must be taken and can be sometimes represented as a decision tree. When that structure is used the final solutions obtained vary depending on the available information. However, if the same model is applied many times, experimental data can be collected and observations on the acquired knowledge can be made. In this work, we present a probabilistic approach for reducing the number of decisions (tests) that are required in a particular decision making situation. Specifically, we consider that a problem is structured as a complete binary balanced decision tree the interior nodes of which correspond to decision points; the paths of the tree represent different decision making processes. By assuming that there exists sufficient probabilistic information concerning the decisions at the interior nodes, we propose techniques in order to minimize the average number of these decisions when eve search for a final solution.

Specifically we wish to distinguish between changes in mean, variance and lag one autocorrelation. Because these change structures yield significant similarities in their corresponding output, a multistage decision tree is necessary. A multistage classification system with a neural network and quadratic discriminant functions is used, where neural network output is an a priori distribution for the Bayesian quadratic discriminant function. Experimental results show that this multistage decision strategy performs significantly better than its single stage counterpart, with an overall success rate of 84%.

To avoid the multiple meanings of diagnosis, the term assessment is used in reference to identifying the distinguishing features of individual cases, while taxonomy is used to designate the grouping of cases according to their distinguishing features. Treatment research requires clear specification of the behavioral/emotional problems and competencies targeted for intervention. Artifactual comorbidity can be avoided by specifying treatment targets at several levels, including competencies, specific problems, syndromes, profiles of syndrome scores, and global problem scores. To select subjects for treatment research and to evaluate outcomes, multisource data can be coordinated by using a cross-informant computer program, taxonomic decision tree, and averaging of multisource standard scores.

A Petri Net is a powerful and a highly versatile modeling tool that possesses meta-model capability to replace alternative decision-making frameworks and model complex management decision problems or situations. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: (1) to review the properties of Petri Net models in view of management perspectives; and (2) to illustrate their power to describe various decision-making frameworks including decision trees, network models, Markov decision problems and time-table problems. Thus, we illustrate how Petri Net models possess meta-model capability to replace alternative decision-making frameworks.

J	ROSE, SR				ROSE, SR			ARE WE OVERTREATING CHILDREN WITH GROWTH-HORMONE	ENDOCRINOLOGIST			English	Article							SHORT STATURE; DEFICIENT CHILDREN; SECRETION; LEUKEMIA; DIAGNOSIS; THERAPY; PUBERTY; BOYS	Until recently, shortness of stature was viewed merely as an individual attribute, with no ''therapy'' available or imagined. In this article, historical perspective is provided for diagnosis of conditions causing short stature, development of methods for diagnosis of insufficient growth hormone secretion, controversies in diagnosis, and trends in growth hormone therapy. A decision tree is offered for current evaluation of short children for possible classic or subtle disorders of growth hormone release. Guidelines for administration of growth hormone, for choices about who should be treated versus who should be studied, and benefits and risks of growth hormone therapy are discussed. Participation of very short but non-growth hormone deficient children in controlled trials may finally resolve the questions of whether growth hormone therapy alters final adult height or adult psychosocial adjustment and may help to evaluate the benefit risk balance of such treatment. Pragmatic use of growth hormone in short normal children outside of controlled trials is not currently appropriate.

A 3-phase approach was used. In phase I, experts were assembled to identify the standard approach for management of fungal infections and a decision tree was constructed to model the process; in phase II, meta-analysis was used to determine success, failure, and relapse rates; and in phase III, economic analyses were performed including cost of regimen, total expected cost and cost-effectiveness analysis. Sensitivity analyses (robustness analyses) were also performed in phase III. It was found that while TER was successful following 1 week of administration for minor infections and after 2 weeks for major infections, duration of drug treatment was usually twice that time. Other comparators (CIC, CLO, KET and MIG) took 4 weeks to achieve a successful outcome. In addition, an extra 2 weeks were often needed to clear both types of infections because the comparators are fungistatic, whereas TER is fungicidal. In the total expected cost analysis, TER had the lowest overall cost of treating patients for both infection categories. It was also responsible for the highest number of disease-free days and, consequently, the lowest cost per disease-free day. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that TER was the most cost-effective topical agent for treating dermatophytosis major (excluding onychomycosis) and dermatophytosis minor.

These algorithms have been used to label stars, galaxies, cosmic rays, plate defects, and other types of objects in sky surveys and other image databases. Our primary goal has been to develop techniques that classify with high accuracy, in order to ensure that celestial objects are not stored in the wrong catalogs. In addition, classification time must be fast due to the large number of classifications and to future needs for on-line classification systems. This paper reports on our results from using decision-tree classifiers to identify cosmic-ray hits in Hubble Space Telescope images. This method produces classifiers with over 95% accuracy using data from a single, unpaired image. Our experiments indicate that this accuracy will get even higher if methods for eliminating background noise improve.

A prototype decision support system for eligibility determination is described for Food Stamps, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), Medicaid, and Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) based on rules and regulations for programs in the Department of Health and Human Services Division (HSD) and the West Virginia Division of Rehabilitation Services (DRS). The decision-tree structures for analysis and synthesis of client information are illustrated as they apply to determination of eligibility for benefits and services. These structures for conceptual knowledge and practical interpretations were built primarily from a bottom-up information strategy, with the use of input from frontline caseworkers.
