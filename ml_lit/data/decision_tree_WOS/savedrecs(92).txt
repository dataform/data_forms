We present a set of discriminant functions that can recognize structural and compositional features such as CpG islands, promoter regions and first splice-donor sites. We explain the implementation of the discriminant functions into a decision tree that constitutes a new program called FirstEF. By using different models to predict CpG-related and non-CpG-related first exons, we showed by cross-validation that the program could predict 86% of the first exons with 17% false positives. We also demonstrated the prediction accuracy of FirstEF at the genome level by applying it to the finished sequences of human chromosomes 21 and 22 as well as by comparing the predictions with the locations of the experimentally verified first exons. Finally, we present the analysis of the predicted first exons for all of the 24 chromosomes of the human genome.

J	Setiono, R				Setiono, R			Feedforward neural network construction using cross validation	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							LEARNING ALGORITHMS	This article presents an algorithm that constructs feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer for pattern classification. The algorithm starts with a small number of hidden units in the network and adds more hidden units as needed to improve the network's predictive accuracy. To determine when to stop adding new hidden units, the algorithm makes use of a subset of the available training samples for cross validation. New hidden units are added to the network only if they improve the classification accuracy of the network on the training samples and on the cross-validation samples. Extensive experimental results show that the algorithm is effective in obtaining networks with predictive accuracy rates that are better than those obtained by state-of-the-art decision tree methods.

J	Beynon, MJ; Peel, MJ				Beynon, MJ; Peel, MJ			Variable precision rough set theory and data discretisation: an application to corporate failure prediction	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						data mining; failure prediction; FUSINTER data discretisation; rough set theory; variable precision rough set theory	CONTINUOUS ATTRIBUTES; NEURAL NETWORKS; DISCRETIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; DISTRESS; RULES	Since the seminal work of Pawlak (international Journal of Information and Computer Science, 11 (1982) 341-356) rough set theory (RST) has evolved into a rule-based decision-making technique. To date, however, relatively little empirical research has been conducted on the efficacy of the rough set approach in the context of business and finance applications. This paper extends previous research by employing a development of RST, namely the variable precision rough sets (VPRS) model, in an experiment to predict between failed and non-failed UK companies. It also utilizes the FUSINTER discretisation method which neglates the influence of an 'expert' opinion. The results of the VPRS analysis are compared to those generated by the classical logit and multivariate discriminant analysis, together with more closely related non-parametric decision tree methods. It is concluded that VPRS is a promising addition to existing methods in that it is a practical tool, which generates explicit probabilistic rules from a given information system, with the rules offering the decision maker informative insights into classification problems.

J	Huebner, S; Reed, MH				Huebner, S; Reed, MH			Analysis of the value of imaging as part of the follow-up of splenic injury in children	PEDIATRIC RADIOLOGY			English	Article							BLUNT ABDOMINAL-TRAUMA; NONOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; DECISION-ANALYSIS; SPLEEN; CT; SPLENECTOMY; CRITERIA; RUPTURE	Objective. A recent article suggested that routine follow-up imaging is still frequently used in the conservative management of splenic trauma in children. The purpose of this study was to use decision analysis to assess the value of routine imaging, as part of the long-term follow-up of splenic injury in children managed nonoperatively. Methods. A literature review (1970-1999) on the management of blunt splenic trauma in children was performed. Data, including the use of follow-up imaging and the occurrence of delayed splenic rupture and death, on those patients managed nonoperatively were collected. The data were used to construct a decision tree. A Poisson distribution was used to determine the risk of delayed splenic rupture. Results. Information was extracted from 26 cohort studies. Nineteen of these studies were retrospective and six were prospective. One study had both retrospective and prospective arms. The study population consisted of 1,083 children. Of these patients, 920 (85 %) underwent routine follow-up imaging (US, CT, or scintigraphy). Follow-up imaging was either not performed or selectively performed in 163 patients (15 %). No cases of post-discharge splenic rupture or death were encountered in any of these groups. The maximum risk of delayed splenic rupture in the entire group was 0.3 % (0-3.7 cases). Conclusion. The risk of delayed splenic rupture following blunt injury in children is very low, and is apparently unaffected by imaging protocols. No deaths, even in cases of delayed presentation, were identified in our study. These findings do not support the use of routine follow-up imaging of children with blunt splenic trauma.

J	Polikar, R; Shinar, R; Udpa, L; Porter, MD				Polikar, R; Shinar, R; Udpa, L; Porter, MD			Artificial intelligence methods for selection of an optimized sensor array for identification of volatile organic compounds	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL			English	Article						optimum coating selection; decision tree; wrapper search; neural network classification	ACOUSTIC-WAVE SENSORS; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; VAPOR RECOGNITION; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; MIXTURES; CLASSIFICATION; RESPONSES; DESIGN	We have investigated two artificial intelligence (Al)-based approaches for the optimum selection of a sensor array for the identification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The array consists of quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs), each coated with a different polymeric material. The first approach uses a decision tree classification algorithm to determine the minimum number of features that are required to classify the training data correctly. The second approach employs the hill-climb search algorithm to search the feature space for the optimal minimum feature set that maximizes the performance of a neural network classifier. We also examined the value of simple statistical procedures that could be integrated into the search algorithm in order to reduce computation time. The strengths and limitations of each approach are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Pomorski, D; Desrousseaux, C				Pomorski, D; Desrousseaux, C			Improving performance of distributed detection networks: an entropy-based optimization	SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						centralized/distributed detection; Shannon's entropy; decision tree; distributed quantization	DECISION FUSION; SENSOR SYSTEMS	The reduction of communication costs is the key focus of distributed detection networks. On the contrary, their performance is lower compared to centralized networks, because the fusion center does not receive all the available information to make the final decision. The optimization of a parallel distributed network with N sensors leads to a set of 2(N) + N nonlinear equations, that can only be solved in particular cases, assuming statistical independence of the local observations, and for small-sized networks. In order to reduce the number of equations to solve, Shannon's entropy is used to select relevant sensors for the decision process. Once the relevant sensors are selected, an entropy-based criterion is used to optimize the network: local thresholds are determined, and a binary decision tree represents the fusion rule. This approach provides a fusion center using efficient and simple procedures. These optimization techniques are applied to the distributed quantization problem: we consider a compromise between the broadcast bandwidth of the fusion center and quality of the decision system, in order to approximate centralized detection performance.

While in-orbit servicing has extended Hubble's lifetime, the expense of servicing missions is extremely high. If mission lifetime is to be extended beyond the servicing mission era, innovative mission extension concepts must be employed. One such concept to accomplishing this is data mining of historical Hubble engineering data to increase the success rate of Hubble's science data collection. A critical component of successful science data collection is the Fixed Head Star Tracker (FHST) subsystem. This subsystem performs the first step, known as an update, in the telescope pointing process and has a failure rate of approximately 0.015. The NASA's Hubble Project initiated a data mining effort on this subsystem, which was undertaken by the Institute for Scientific Research Inc. (ISR). Previous failure analyses indicated that many of the past failures could be attributed to the distribution of stars within the tracker's field of view. A dataset was constructed of FHST data from the following sources: Telemetry, Command, and Star data. This data was processed using a recursive-partitioning algorithm implemented in S-Plus. The resulting decision tree indicates that pre-event FHST data supports failure prediction. Using this tree to select guide stars could reduce the tracker failure rate to 0.002. The decision tree has been validated using mission planning software. Data on the actual performance using this technique is being collected. This effort demonstrates how data mining can uncover operational deficiencies and provide cost-efficient solutions for improving subsystem performance.								Venables W.

The advantage is that in problem-solving applications of the induced decision tree, the relevance of an attribute or test can be explained in terms of the strategy it was selected to support, such as confirming a target outcome class or eliminating a competing outcome class. However, it is possible that an alternative approach to attribute selection may produce a decision tree with greater predictive accuracy from a given set of training data. The structure of the decision trees that an algorithm produces may also be an important factor in terms of problem-solving efficiency. We present a new algorithm for strategic induction of decision trees in which Strategist's multiple-strategy approach to attribute selection is replaced by the single strategy of increasing the probability of a target outcome class. While sharing Strategist's ability to explain the relevance of attributes in strategic terms, the new algorithm often produces more efficient decision trees than Strategist and matches the accuracy of ID3 on some data sets.

The algorithm gives us a desirable behavior of the information entropy of partitioning. The efficiency of the learning algorithm is improved by analyzing the non-stable cut point and the experiment result shows that the number of leaves in decision tree generation is reduced with the raising of level alpha. Thus, the scale of decision tree and the recognition rate of classification using the proposed algorithm are improved with the raising of level alpha. To the unknown-classified sample data, the algorithm offers a rapid matching speed.

Therefore, a single tree may lead to unnecessary tests of attributes and may not represent rules that are best for some substantial subset or collection of the objects in the database. To compensate the weak points of decision trees and make them more useful, a decision tree with satellite rules of association is suggested. The resulting decision tree produces more reliable decisions and a saving in test costs, by using shorter rules in the satellite rule set.

Since the codebook of the SOTM encoder is organized as a decision tree, it can be searched quickly to find a matching pattern for a new input vector. Compared to the well-known LBG (Linde-Buzo-Gray) algorithm, the codebooks produced by the SOTM algorithm have large dynamic ranges that fully and uniformly span the entire vector space. In addition, since the SOTM algorithm randomly creates the first codeword, it does not need the initialization of the complete set of the codebook vectors. It is robust compared to the LBG algorithm. The experimental results show that the SOTM algorithm achieves better codebooks than LBG's.

The focus is on machine learning applications for which the individuals that are the subject of learning have complex structure. To represent such individuals, a rich knowledge representation language based on higher-order logic is introduced. The logic is also employed to construct comprehensible hypotheses that one might want to learn about the individuals. The tutorial introduces the main ideas of this approach to knowledge representation in a mostly informal way and gives a number of illustrations. The application of the ideas to decision-tree learning is also illustrated with an example.

Accuracy can be improved by ensemble methods which combine the predictions of a set of different trees. However, a large amount of resources is necessary to generate the ensemble. In this paper, we introduce a new ensemble method that minimises the usage of resources by sharing the common parts of the components of the ensemble. For this purpose, we learn a decision multi-tree instead of a decision tree. We call this new approach shared ensembles. The use of a multi-tree produces an exponential number of hypotheses to be combined, which provides better results than boosting/bagging. We performed several experiments, showing that the technique allows us to obtain accurate models and improves the use of resources with respect to classical ensemble methods.

We propose a multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) based on the wrapper approach to discover the best subset of attributes for a given classification algorithm, namely C4.5, a well-known decision-tree algorithm. The two objectives to be minimized are the error rate and the size of the tree produced by C4.5. The proposed GA is a multi-objective method in the sense that it discovers a set of non-dominated solutions (attribute subsets), according to the concept of Pareto dominance.

A metric, predictive value, is used extensively in clinical diagnosis and medical decision making, and is easily adapted to the LCS to facilitate assessing the ability of individual classifiers used as rules to predict class membership. This metric can also be used to assess the ability of a trained LCS to predict the class of unseen cases. Positive and predictive values were incorporated into an existing LCS model, EpiCS, and applied to 6-Multiplexer data and a sample data set drawn from a large hospitalization survey. The predictive performance of EpiCS on the hospitalization data was shown to be comparable to that of logistic regression and decision tree induction.

We have proposed a graphical visualization method where the structure and separability of classes in the original feature space are almost correctly preserved. This method is especially effective for knowing which groups of classes are close and which groups are not. In this paper, we propose a method to group classes on the basis of this graphical analysis. Such a grouping. is exploited to design a decision tree in which a sample is classified into groups of classes at each node with a different feature subset, and is further divided into smaller groups, and finally reaches at one of the leaves consisting of single classes. The main characteristics of this method is to use different feature subsets in different nodes. This way is most effective to solve multi-class problems. An experiment with 30 characters (30 classes) was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

It allows the geomatics community to take advantage of the growing availability of geographically referenced data and benefit from this rich information resource. This article addresses spatial data classification for using decision trees. A new method called SCART which differs from conventional decision trees by considering the specifics of geographical data, namely their organisation in thematic layers, and their spatial relationships is proposed. SCART is an extension of CART methods in two ways. On the one hand, the algorithm considers several thematic layers as in the so-called relational data mining area, and on the other hand, it extends discriminating criteria to address concerns about the neighbourhood. As such, the algorithm determines which combination of attribute values and spatial relationships of neighbouring objects provide the best criterion.

But in the area of supervised learning, decision trees have their limitations. Two notable problems are those of replication and fragmentation. One way of solving these problems is to introduce decision graphs, a generalization of the decision tree, which address the above problems by allowing for disjunctions, or joins. While various decision graph systems are available, all of these systems impose some forms of restriction on the proposed representations, often leading to either a new redundancy or the original redundancy not being removed. In this paper, we propose an unrestricted representation called the decision graph with multi-way joins, which has improved representative power and is able to use training data efficiently. An algorithm to infer these decision graphs with multi-way joins using the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle is also introduced. On both real-world and artificial data with only discrete attributes (including at least five UCI data-sets), and in terms of both "right"/"wrong" classification accuracy and I.J. Good's logarithm of probability "bit-costing" predictive accuracy, our novel multi-way join decision graph program significantly out-performs both C4.5 and C5.0. Our program also out-performs the Oliver and Wallace binary join decision graph program on the only data-set available for comparison.

We give results that show adaptive complexity in terms of k or X: when k or X is small compared to n, we achieve time bounds that approach the linear-time (O(n)) bounds known for the corresponding problems on simple polygonal chains. In particular, we show that the convex hull of C can be computed in O(n log(X + 2)) time, and prove a matching lower bound of Omega(n log(X + 2)) in the algebraic decision tree model. We also prove a lower bound of Omega(n log(k/n)) for k > n in the algebraic decision tree model; since X less than or equal to k, the upper bound of O(n log(k + 2)) follows. We also show that a polygonal chain with k proper inter sections can be transformed into a polygonal chain without proper intersections by adding at most 2k new vertices in time O(n (.) min{rootk, log n} + k). This yields O(n (.) min{rootk, log n} + k)-time algorithms for triangulation, in particular the constrained Delaunay triangulation of a polygonal chain where the proper intersection points are also regarded as vertices.

The primary goal of this study was to develop machine learning models that classify non-small Lung Cancers according to histopathology types and to compare several machine learning methods in this learning task. DNA from tumors of 37 patients (21 squamous carcinomas, and 16 adenocarcinomas) were extracted and hybridized onto a 452 BAC clone array. The following algorithms were used: KNN, Decision Tree Induction, Support Vector Machines and Feed-Forward Neural Networks. Performance was measured via leave-one-out classification accuracy. The best multi-gene model found had a leave-one-out accuracy of 89.2%. Decision Trees performed poorer than the other methods in this learning task and dataset. We conclude that gene copy numbers as measured by array CGH are, collectively, an excellent indicator of histological subtype. Several interesting research directions are discussed.

We explored how an existing validated knowledge base (KB) represented by a decision tree could be automatically processed to infer a higher level domain-specific task model. Oncodoc is a guideline-based decision support system applied to breast cancer therapy. Assuming task identity and ontological proximity between breast and lung cancer domains, the generalization of the breast cancer KB should allow to build a metamodel to serve as a guide for the elaboration of a new specific KB on lung cancer Two types of parametrized generalization methods based on tree structure simplification and ontological abstraction were used. We defined a similarity distance and a generalization coefficient to select the best metamodel identified as the closest to the original decision tree of the most generalized metamodels.

Knowledge discovery algorithms generate models directly from databases, minimizing such limitations. Our objective was to generate a mortality model from a PICU database utilizing knowledge discovery techniques. The database contained 5067 records with 192 clinically relevant variables. It was randomly split into training (75%) and validation (25%) groups. We used decision tree induction to generate a mortality model from the training data, and validated its performance on the validation data. The original PRISM algorithm(1) was used for comparison, The decision tree model contained 25 variables and predicted 53/88 deaths; 29 correctly (Sens:33%, Spec:98%, PPV:54%). PRISM predicted 27/88 deaths correctly (Sens:30%, Spec:98%, PPV:515). Performance difference between models was not significant. We conclude that knowledge discovery algorithms can generate a mortality model from a PICU database, helping establish validity of such tools in the clinical medical domain.

Two texture classification methods, Directional Steganogaphy Histogram (DSH) method and Texture Decision Tree(TDY) method, are presented for texture analysis and classification. Experiments show that the proposed methods can achieve high accuracy rate and also work well even the query textures are distorted by noise corruption or compression.

In this paper, we analytically derive distinctive features for Thai-English language classification. Decision tree diagram based on distinctive features derivedi s then build to use in practical applications. In addition, a language classifier has been used as the front-end recognizer in order to improve the performance of the recognition in terms of complexity reduction and recognition accuracy, From the experimental results, our implemented system can recognize an input as Thai or English character with an accuracy of 86.34% and 95.42% respectively. These numbers can be translated into an overall language classification accuracy of 90.21%.

The efficiency of optimization directly depends on the compiler heuristics. These heuristics must be target-specific and each new processor generation requires heuristics reengineering. In this paper, we address the automatic generation of optimization heuristics for a target processor by machine learning. We evaluate the potential of this method on an always legal and simple transformation: loop unrolling. Though simple to implement, this transformation may have strong effects on program execution (good or bad). However deciding to perform the transformation or not is difficult since many interacting parameters must be taken into account. So we propose a machine learning approach. We try to answer the following questions: is it possible to devise a learning process that captures the relevant parameters involved in loop unrolling performance? Does the Machine Learning Based Heuristics achieve better performance than existing ones?.	Univ Rennes, IRISA, Rennes, France	Monsifrot, A (reprint author), Univ Rennes, IRISA, Rennes, France.

We use a hierarchical approach that builds upon the use of any given (user-defined) clustering algorithm to produce a decision tree that returns the number of clusters. The decision rule takes advantage of the ability of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to detect both density gaps and high-density regions in data sets. The method has been successfuly applied on a variety of artificial and real data sets, covering a broad range of structures, group densities, data dimensionalities and number of groups.

Published practice guidelines recommend routine chest computed tomography (CT) scanning as part of the staging evaluation for patients with T2 soft tissue sarcomas (STS), although there is no direct evidence to support this practice. The objective of this study was to determine the yield and cost-effectiveness of routine versus selective chest CT scanning for the staging of patients with T2 STS and to identify any subgroups for whom a more selective approach to chest CT scanning could be considered. METHODS. Six hundred consecutive patients with primary, nonthoracic, T2 (> 5 cm) STS underwent both chest X-ray (CXR) and chest CT scanning to evaluate the presence of pulmonary metastatic disease (MI). The authors constructed a decision tree that modeled the outcomes of diagnostic testing for two hypothetical diagnostic strategies: 1) routine chest CT (rCT or 2) CXR and selective chest CT (sCT). The yield and cost of each strategy were determined; the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as the cost per additional patient with pulmonary metastases identified by rCT versus sCT. RESULTS. The yield of rCT was higher than that of sCT (MI disease identified in 19.2% vs. 16.0% of patients, respectively), but rCT was more costly ($1301 vs. $418 per patient, respectively). The ICER of rCT compared with sCT was $27,594 per patient identified with pulmonary metastasis. The expected yields, costs, and ICERs of the diagnostic strategies varied across patient subgroups based on grade, anatomic site, and tumor size. CONCLUSIONS. For patients with T2 STS, rCT was most cost-effective in patients with high-grade lesions or extremity lesions. The findings of this study do not support the routine use of chest CT scanning in all patients with T2 STS. (C) 2002 American Cancer Society.

CLINICAL DRUG INVESTIGATION			English	Article							INITIAL TREATMENT; FOLLOW-UP	Objective: To compare the cost effectiveness of different therapeutic strategies C using the combination of interferon and ribavirin in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C. Design and setting: This was a cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the Spanish healthcare system. Methods: Six different therapeutic strategies were compared using a decision-tree analysis and a Markov model. These strategies, using combination therapy for 24 or 48 weeks depending on viral genotype and hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA, were compared on the basis of incremental cost per additional life year saved (LYS) and additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved. Clinical data were derived from major clinical trials and costs from the Spanish healthcare system. Results: For a base-case patient with chronic hepatitis C, the most effective strategy was combination therapy for 24 weeks for genotype non-1 and for 48 weeks for genotype 1 patients who cleared HCV RNA before week 24. Using this strategy, life expectancy increased by 0.07 to 0.38 years vs other strategies and QALY increased 0.15 to 0.84 vs other strategies. The incremental cost per LYS ranged from cost saving to euros (EUR) 1363, and per QALY from cost saving to EUR610 vs other strategies (2000 values, converted to EUR at the official rate of 1EUR = 166.386 pesetas). The cost per LYS and QALY compared with no therapy was EUR2368 and EUR1060, respectively. This strategy perm its the treatment of more patients with the same budget than those strategies based only on HCV genotyping or HCV RNA testing.

These process nitoring data contain useful information on the behavior of a process or a product. After semiconductor fabrication is completed, dies on a wafer are classified into bins in the EDS (Electrical Die Sorting) process. Quality engineers in semiconductor industry are interested in relating those bin data to the historical monitoring data to identify those process variables that,are critical to the quality of the final product. Data mining techniques can be effectively used for this purpose. In this article, a framework for analyzing semiconductor process monitoring and bin data is developed using the data mining and other statistical techniques.

Irrespective of the way the transformation of knowledge, the developed methods usuallyfall into two classes: methods with high rate of transformed knowledge is done, but with a lot of restrictions concerning the type of data in the training sets, training methods, and the size of data sets; and methods with moderate rate of transformed knowledge, but with less restrictions. Our main interest was to find or develop a technique that would possess the knowledge acquisition power of neural networks and explanation power of decision trees. That is why we developed a NN-DT Cascade method, which is capable of transforming a part of knowledge from the neural network into a decision tree.

Once a solution is found, the construction of the tree goes on in order to obtain more solutions ordered as well by description length. The result is a multi-tree which is populated taking into consideration computational resources according to a Levin search. Some experiments show that the method pays off in practice.

This decay channel is considered as a discovery channel for Higgs scenarios for Higgs boson masses in the range 80 - 130 GeV. Neural network model with a special type of data flow is used to separate t (t) over bar jj background from H --> b (b) over bar events. Used neural network combine together a classical neural network approach and linear decision tree separation process. Parameters of these neural networks are randomly generated and population of predefined size of those networks is learned to get initial generation for the following genetic algorithm optimization process. A genetic algorithm principles are used to tune parameters of further neural network individuals derived from previous neural networks by GA operations of crossover and mutation. The goal of this GA process is optimization of the final neural network performance. Our results show that NN approach is applicable to the problem of Higgs boson detection. Neural network filters can be used to emphasize difference Of M-bb distribution for events accepted by filter (with better signal/background rate) and M-bb distribution for original events (with original signal/background rate) under condition that there is no loss of significance. This improvement of the shape Of Mbb distribution can be used as a criterion of existence of Higgs boson decay in considered discovery channel.

It differs from eager classifiers, such as decision tree induction, which build a general model (such as a decision tree) before receiving new samples. K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification is a typical lazy classifier. Given a set of training data, a k-nearest neighbor classifier predicts the class value for an unknown tuple X by searching the training set for the k nearest neighbors to X and then assigning to X the most common class among its k nearest neighbors. Lazy classifiers are faster at training time than eager classifiers, but slower at predicating time since all computation is delayed to that time. In this paper, we introduce approaches to efficient construction of lazy classifiers, using a data structure, Peano Count Tree (P-tree)*. P-tree is a lossless and compressed representation of the original data that records the count information to facilitate efficient data mining. With P-tree structure, we introduced two classifiers, P-tree based k-nearest neighbor classifier (PKNN), and Podium Incremental Neighbor Evaluator (PINE). Performance analysis shows that our algorithms outperform classical KNN methods.

In this paper we examine its computational complexity. We give an efficient algorithm for the binomial case and indeed for any SMML problem that is essentially one-dimensional in character. The problem in general is shown to be NP-hard. A heuristic is discussed which gives good results for binomial and trinomial SMML inference. The complexity of the trinomial case remains open and is worth further investigation.

This paper presents an visualization method and tool for interactive learning of large decision trees, that includes a new visualization technique called T2.5D (stands for Trees 2.5 Dimensions). After a brief discussion on requirements for tree visualizers and related work, the paper focuses on presenting developing techniques for the issues (1) how to visualize efficiently large decision trees; and (2) how to visualize decision trees in the learning process.

However, scalability, accuracy and efficiency are significant concerns regarding how to effectively deal with large and complex data sets in the implementation. In this paper, we propose an innovative machine learning approach (we call our approach GAIT), combining genetic algorithm, statistical sampling, and decision tree, to develop intelligent decision trees that can alleviate some of these problems. We design our computational experiments and run GAIT on three different data sets (namely Socio-Olympic data, Westinghouse data, and FAA data) to test its performance against standard decision tree algorithm, neural network classifier, and statistical discriminant technique, respectively. The computational results show that our approach outperforms standard decision tree algorithm profoundly at lower sampling levels, and achieves significantly better results with less effort than both neural network and discriminant classifiers.

They are widely used in many domains, where information about species, products, customers, publications, etc. needs to be organized. In the absence of standards, many taxonomies of the same entities can co-exist. A problem arises when data categorized in a particular taxonomy needs to be used by a procedure (methodology or algorithm) that uses a different taxonomy. Usually, a labor-intensive manual approach is used to solve this problem. This paper describes a machine learning approach which aids domain experts in changing taxonomies. It allows learning relationships between two taxonomies and mapping the data from one taxonomy into another. The proposed approach uses decision trees and bootstrapping for learning mappings of instances from the source to the target taxonomies. A C4.5 decision tree classifier is trained on a small manually labeled training set and applied to a randomly selected sample from the unlabeled data. The classification results are analyzed and the misclassified items are corrected and all items are added to the training set. This procedure is iterated until unlabeled data is available or an acceptable error rate is reached. In the latter case the last classifier is used to label all the remaining data. We test our approach on a database of products obtained from as grocery store chain and find that it performs well, reaching 92.6% accuracy while requiring the human expert to explicitly label only 18% of the entire data.

Two different data mining algorithms have been developed to determine rules, strategies, and fuzzy decision tree structure. The first data mining algorithm uses a genetic algorithm as a data mining function and is called from an electronic game. The game allows a human expert to play against the resource manager in a simulated battlespace with each of the defending platforms being exclusively directed by the fuzzy resource manager and the attacking platforms being controlled by the human expert or operating autonomously under their own logic. This approach automates the data mining problem. The game automatically creates a database reflecting the domain expert's knowledge. It calls a data mining function, a genetic algorithm, for data mining of the database as required and allows easy evaluation of the information mined in the second step. The criterion for reoptimization is discussed as well as experimental results. Then a second data mining algorithm that uses a genetic program as a data mining function is introduced to automatically discover fuzzy decision tree structures. Finally, a fuzzy decision tree generated through this process is discussed.	USN, Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA	Smith, JF (reprint author), USN, Res Lab, Code 5741, Washington, DC 20375 USA.

Decision tree algorithms are computationally intensive, yet do not capture the evolutionary trends from incremental data repository. In conventional mining approaches, if two or more datasets arc to be merged to get a single target dataset, the, entire computation for constructing a classifier has to be carried out all over again. Previous work in this field has been to construct individual decision tree classifiers and merge them by taking a voted arbitration or by merging the corresponding decision rules. We have attempted a new approach by data-preproccssing the individual windows of the growing database and we call them as Knowledge Concentrates-KC of the respective database windows.ie we propose to extract information from the different windows of the evolving database and store the different windows as Knowledge Concentrates KC. The formation of the KCs is done in the off-line mode. In the mining operations we use the KCs, instead of using the entire past data, thereby reducing the time and space complexity of the mining process. The user dynamically selects the target dataset by identifying the windows of interest. The mining requirement is satisfied by merging the respective KCs and running the decision tree algorithm on the merged KC. The proposed system operates in three phases. The first phase is the planning phase wherein the dataset domain information is gathered and the datamining goals are defined. The second phase makes a single scan on a Window in the database and generates a summary of this window as a Knowledge Concentrate (KC). In our work we have used an efficient dynamic Trie structure to store the KCs. The third phase merges the desired windows(KCs) and applies the Classification algorithm on the aggregate of the KCs to give the final required classifier. The salient issues addressed in the work are to form a condensed form of the database which enables in the extraction of the patterns in the database that are input to a decision making algorithm to form the required decision tree. The entire scheme is decision tree algorithm independent, in the sense that a user has flexibility to use any standard decision tree algorithm.

Ensemble learning techniques such as bagging have been applied successfully to improve accuracy of classification models by generating multiple models, from replicate training sets, and aggregating them to form a composite model. In this paper, we adapt the bagging approach for scaling up and also study effects of data partitioning, sampling, and aggregation techniques for mining very large databases. Our recent work developed SORCER, a learning system that induces a near minimal rule set from a data set represented as a second-order decision table (a database relation in which rows have sets of atomic values as components). Despite its simplicity, experiments show that SORCER is competitive to other, state-of-the-art induction systems. Here we apply SORCER using two instance subset selection procedures (random partitioning and sampling with replacement) and two aggregation procedures (majority voting and selecting the model that performs best on a validation set). We experiment with the GIS data set, from the UCI KDD Repository, which contains 581,012 instances of 30x30 meter cells with 54 attributes for classifying forest cover types. Performance results are reported including results from mining the entire training data set using different compression algorithms in SORCER and published results from neural net and decision tree learners.

Having a single tool that supports the user in the selection of data, their preprocessing and transformation, as well as their mining, is an important requirement of KDD practitioners. Moreover, it is important to assist the user of a KDD system in the selection of the right parameters or methods. This paper describes KDB2000, a tool that integrates database access, data preprocessing and transformation techniques, a full range of data mining algorithms as well as pattern validation and visualization. This integration aims to support the user in the entire KDD process enabling him/her to see the same problem from many different angles for a thorough investigation. In addition, KDB2000 makes use of the agent technology to assist the user in some data mining tasks, such as choosing the best pruning strategy for induced decision tree in accordance to both data features and used needs.

The performance of NB suffers in domains that involve correlated features. C4.5 decision trees, on the other hand, typically perform better than the Naive Bayesian algorithm on such domains. This paper describes a Selective Bayesian classifier (SBC) that simply uses only those features that C4.5 would use in its decision tree when learning a small example of a training set, a combination of the two different natures of classifiers. Experiments conducted on eleven datasets indicate that SBC performs reliably better than NB on all domains, and SBC outperforms C4.5 on many datasets of which C4.5 outperform NB. SBC also can eliminate, on most cases, more than half of the original attributes, which can greatly reduce the size of the training and test data, as well as the running time. Further, the SBC algorithm typically teams faster than both C4.5 and NB, needing fewer training examples to reach high accuracy of classification.

In order to find the variables that most influenced condom usage on the last coital episode, data mining techniques were applied using the SAS Enterprise Miner program. Various decision tree algorithms were implemented and the results with various program option settings showed that a variable called 'construct availability' (namely either talking about condoms with a sexual partner or thinking about condoms) most consistently distinguished between condom users and non-users. Other variables shown to distinguish between condom users and non-users. were intention to use condoms, self-efficacy, self-standards, condom availability, attitudes, AIDS worry, norms, race and gender. These variables need to inform both the marketing of condoms to young people as well as life-skills programmes in schools.

A new optical monitor provides images of contaminant particles in molten plastic flowing through processing equipment. The product, plastic film, is extremely intolerant of particle contaminants: even very low concentrations of particles may cause packaging film defects. Thus, this initial work was aimed at developing the ability to automatically distinguish between images containing detectable contaminant particles from those that do not. A total of approximately six thousand images was obtained from the in-line monitoring of three different lots of low-density polyethylene during processing in a 3.8 cm. diameter single screw extruder. Several different data mining techniques including One-R, Decision Tree, Bayesian and k-Nearest Neighbour classifiers were applied to image datasets and the overall success rates were as high as 99.9% for some models. The Decision Tree method (C4.5) was the most accurate technique for the image classification, and the Bayesian classifier showed the minimum false negative prediction. Selection of threshold grey level was critical. Two new automated image thresholding techniques were developed and assessed.

We use three dimensional data obtained through X-ray microtomography at greater than one micron resolution per voxel at five times in the hydration process: powder, after 4 hours, 7 hours, 15.5 hours, and after 6 days of hydration. Using statistics based on locality, we create vectors containing eight attributes for subsets of size 100(3) of the data and use the autoclass unsupervised classification system to label the attribute vectors into three separate classes. Following this, we use the C5 decision tree software to separate the three classes into two parts: class 0 and 1, and class 0 and 2. We use our locally developed procedural genetic programming system, GPP, to create simple rules for these. The resulting collection of simple rules are tested on a separate 100(3) subset of the plaster datasets that had been labeled with their autoclass predictions. The rules were found to have both high sensitivity and high positive predictive value. The classes accurately identify important structural comonents in the hydrating plaster. Morover, the rules identify the center of the local distribution as a critical factor in separating the classes.

Attribute-efficient learning algorithms can tolerate irrelevant attributes without their performance being affected too much. Valiant's projection learning is a way to combine such algorithms so that this desired property is maintained. The archetype attribute-efficient learning algorithm Winnow and, especially, combinations of Winnow have turned out empirically successful in domains containing many attributes. However, projection learning as proposed by Valiant has not yet been evaluated empirically. We study how projection learning relates to using Winnow as such and with an extended set of attributes. We also compare projection learning with decision tree learning and Naive Bayes on UCI data sets. Projection learning systematically enhances the classification accuracy of Winnow, but the cost in time and space consumption can be high. Balanced Winnow seems to be a better alternative than the basic algorithm for learning the projection hypotheses. However, Balanced Winnow is not well suited for learning the second level (projective disjunction) hypothesis. The on-line approach projection learning does not fall far behind in classification accuracy from batch algorithms such as decision tree learning and Naive Bayes on the UCI data sets that we used.

The main idea is to capture the characteristics of dataset from the structural shape and size of decision tree induced from the dataset. Totally 15 measures are proposed to describe the structure of a decision tree. Their effectiveness is illustrated through extensive experiments, by comparing to the results obtained by the existing data characteristics techniques, including data characteristics tool (DCT) that is the most wide used technique in meta-learning, and Landmarking that is the most recently developed method.

However, scalability, accuracy and efficiency are significant concerns regarding how to effectively deal with large and complex data sets in the implementation. In this paper, we propose an innovative machine learning approach (we call our approach GAIT), combining genetic algorithm, statistical sampling, and decision tree, to develop intelligent decision trees that can alleviate some of these problems. We design our computational experiments and run GAIT on three different data sets (namely Socio-Olympic data, Westinghouse data, and FAA data) to test its performance against standard decision tree algorithm, neural network classifier, and statistical discriminant technique, respectively. The computational results show that our approach outperforms standard decision tree algorithm profoundly at lower sampling levels, and achieves significantly better results with less effort than both neural network and discriminant classifiers.

For example, a zone can be either text or non-text. Given the segmented document zones, correctly determining the zone content type is very important for the subsequent processes within any document image understanding system. This paper describes an algorithm for the determination of zone type of a given zone within an input document image. In our zone classification algorithm, zones are represented as feature vectors. Each feature vector consists of a set of 25 measurements of pre-defined properties. A probabilistic model, decision tree, is used to classify each zone on the basis of its feature vector. Two methods are used to optimize the decision tree classifier to eliminate the data over-fitting problem. To enrich our probabilistic model, we incorporate context constraints for certain zones within their neighboring zones. We also model zone class context constraints as a Hidden Markov Model and used Viterbi algorithm to obtain optimal classification results. The training, pruning and testing data set for the algorithm include 1, 600 images drawn from the LTWCDROM-III document image database. With a total of 24, 177 zones within the data set, the cross-validation method was used in the performance evaluation of the classifier. The classifier is able to classify each given scientific and technical document zone into one of the nine classes, 2 text classes (of font size 4 - 18pt and font size 19 - 32 pt), math, table, halftone, map/drawing, ruling, logo, and others. A zone content classification performance evaluation protocol is proposed. Using this protocol, our algorithm accuracy is 98.45% with a mean false alarm rate of 0.50%.

The models are build based on three levels of features: 1) pixel level, 2) region level, and 3) scene level features. We developed a Bayesian algorithm and a decision tree algorithm for interactive training. The Bayesian algorithm enables training based on pixel features. The scene level summaries of pixel features are used for fast retrieval of scenes with high/low content of features and scenes with low confidence of classification. The decision tree algorithm is based on region level features that are extracted based on 1) spectral and textural characteristics of the image, 2) shape descriptors of regions that are created through segmentation process, and 3) auxiliary information such as elevation data. The initial model can be created based on a database of ground truth and than be refined based on the feedback supplied by a data analyst who interactively trains the model using the system output and/or additional scenes. The combination of supervised and unsupervised methods provides a more complete exploration of model space. A user may detect the inadequacy of the model space and add additional features to the model. The graphical tools for the exploration of decision trees allow insight into the interaction of features used in the construction of models. The preliminary experiments show that accurate models can be build in a short time for a variety of land covers. The scalable classification techniques allow for fast searches for a specific label over a large area.

The development of realistic models represents a critical and labour intensive phase. Automatic terminology acquisition (TA) has been proposed as the task of automatically extracting specialized dictionaries from raw texts useful for application purposes like precise information retrieval and machine translation. In this paper we argue that TA provides a significant contribution in the development of ontological components of a knowledge bases. We therefore propose an automatic knowledge acquisition architecture for the TA process based on robust methods for text processing and on algorithms for learning decision trees. An incremental semiautomatic approach is proposed to enable the first steps in the development of a domain ontology. The novel aspects of the method rely on the use of syntagmatic and lexical properties of terms combined with analogous (negative) evidences observable for non-terms. The underlying assumptions as well as the different adopted linguistic representations have been extensively investigated over a large test set. The scale of the target test data provides empirical evidence of the superiority of the method over more quantitative approaches. The proposed architecture is thus a viable approach to the development of conceptual domain dictionaries.

One recent class of methods involves linear value function approximation, where the optimal value function is assumed to be a linear combination of some set of basis functions, with the aim of finding suitable weights. While sophisticated techniques have been developed for finding the best approximation within this constrained space, few methods have been proposed for choosing a suitable basis set, or modifying it if solution quality is found wanting. We propose a general framework, and specific proposals, that address. both of,these questions. In particular, we examine weakly coupled MDPS where a number of subtasks can be viewed independently modulo resource constraints. We then describe. methods for constructing a piecewise linear combination of the subtask value. functions, using greedy decision tree techniques. We argue that this architecture is suitable for many types of MDPs whose combinatorics are determined largely by the existence multiple conflicting objectives.

It is equivalent to relation and information extraction problems in English. This paper presents a hybrid rule induction approach to extract NEs in Chinese. The method induces rules and names and their context, and generalizes these rules using linguistic lexical chaining. In order to handle the ambiguities and other contextual problems peculiar to Chinese, we supplement the basic method with other approaches such as the default-exception tree and decision tree. We tested our method on the MET2 test set and the method has been found to out-perform all reported methods with an overall F, measure of over 91%.

J	Terek, M				Terek, M			Decision trees, influence diagrams and decision analysis	EKONOMICKY CASOPIS			Slovak	Article								The article deals with the basic principles of decision analysis. Two tools of decision analysis - decision trees and influence diagrams are compared. Decision analysis provides the structure and methods for systematic analysis of the decision problems. Decision analysis provides along with the framework for thinking about the decision problems also analytical tools, which are able to simplify the decision analysis process. The decision problems of choosing one activity (variant of solution of a real problem) from a finite set of all considerable activities are considered in the article. Decision analysis simplifies the orientation in the decision problems. Decision analysis can be defined as a prescriptive approach, which enables people of average intelligence to think systematically about some complicated, important real problems. Decision analysis provides a certain structural framework and the instructions for systematic thinking in the solution of complicated decision problems. In the application process of the decision analysis often subjective opinions about the uncertainty and about values of some problem parameters are important input data. Accordingly the methods of decision analysis allow to include also subjective opinions into the formal analysis. Decision analysis offers also procedures, which facilitate orientation and a certain self-control of the person, his own subjective opinions. Decision analysis is based on knowledge of the statistical decision theory, which deals with decision theory in uncertainty conditions when statistic information is provided, which allows to include some uncertainty aspects into the formal decision problem analysis. Decision analysis can then be defined as the summary of decision methods, which arc based on the statistic decision theory. In statistical decision theory the experimental information is combined with other relevant problem aspects with purpose to find the best solution. Several tools for structuralization of decision problems are known. The suitability of application of any of them depends on the character of the particular problem. Some decision problems can be structuralized by payoff table or loss table. This problem and other ones with similar structure can be structuralized by help of the decision tree or the so-called influence diagram. In. the article mainly the influence diagrams are mentioned (less presented in our literature so far) and compared with decision trees on the example of the decision problem known as "prospector problem". The influence diagram enables a simple graphic projection of the decision problem. It consists of value nodes, decision nodes, chance nodes and arrows, which connect them. In the influence diagram there are mentioned also all options related to the corresponding decision nodes, also all results related to chance nodes together with probabilities of their coming and yields related to value nodes. The conditional Bayes decision principle is being used by solving decision problems. In our literature you can find the most known decision trees solution algorithm called the decision tree reduction, it is not mentioned in our article. One of the solution algorithms of influence diagrams is mentioned in detail. Generally, every decision problem which could be structuralized and solved by decision tree, can be structuralized and solved by the influence diagram as well, and the same results are obtained, and also the other way round. Decision trees and influence diagrams suitably supplement each other. The most suitable application of influence diagrams is in the problem structuralization stage, to describe the structure of large decision problems. Decision trees are very suitable to describe the problem in details. Often we begin with the construction of influence diagram to easier understand the basic problem items. Then follows the conversion into the decision tree with the goal to better understand the problem details. The influence diagram can be more effective by presenting the problem, decision trees can be more effective e. g. in sensitivity analysis. It depends only on the character of the solved problem, which of these techniques. will be dominant for a concrete problem solution. These techniques are complementary, not competitive. Excepting the conditional Bayes decision principle also other decision principles exist. The majority of them have only theoretical importance. There are the decision problems in which the set of all possible states of nature is the finite interval, equal to the set of all possible actions. The decision problems exist in which the set of all possible states of nature is the finite interval and the set of all possible actions is the finite set. In the given example both the set of all possible states of nature and the set of all possible actions are finite sets and the making of the sequence of decisions is necessary. The decision problems of this type are the most frequent in practice.

Data mining research has made much effort to apply various mining algorithms efficiently on large databases. However, a serious problem in their practical application is the long processing time of such algorithms. Nowadays, one of the key challenges is to integrate data mining methods within the framework of traditional database systems. Indeed, such implementations can take advantage of the efficiency provided by SQL engines. In this paper, we propose an integrating approach for decision trees within a classical database system. In other words, we try to discover knowledge from relational databases, in the form of production rules, via a procedure embedding SQL queries. The obtained decision tree is defined by successive, related relational views. Each view corresponds to a given population in the underlying decision tree. We selected the classical Induction Decision Tree (ID3) algorithm to build the decision tree. To prove that our implementation of ID3 works properly, we successfully compared the output of our procedure with the output of an existing and validated data mining software, SIPINA. Furthermore, since our approach is tuneable, it can be generalized to any other similar decision tree-based method.

Stability to digestion has been proposed as one of the steps in the decision tree approach to assess the allergenic potential of transgenic proteins. The validity of digestion stability as a criterion for protein allergenicity assessment, however, has encountered some criticism in recent years. This chapter gives an overview of the rationale behind the use of digestion stability as a criterion for protein allergenicity assessment and reviews the available data that may or may not support its use. The application of in vitro digestion assays for the assessment of allergenic potential of novel proteins and the factors that affect the assay results are also discussed. There is a need to establish standardized assay conditions so that direct comparison of results from different laboratories can be made. Consensus also needs to be reached on relating the measured digestibility to the allergenic potential of proteins.

Large differences in allergenic potential may be obtained by altering the route of administration of an allergen. Because an inhalation allergen can induce symptoms at different threshold doses depending on whether it is introduced via the inhalation or oral route, we propose that double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges be performed in all cases of inhalation allergens being present in foods. Even proteins never previously ingested may cause IgE binding and elicit clinically relevant symptoms.

In this paper, we present our work on applying machine learning to be automated generation of information graphics. Our approach is embodied in a hybrid graphics generation system, IMPROVISE*, which uses both rule-based and example-based generation engines. We discuss the use of machine learning to support such systems from three aspects. First, we introduce an object-oriented, integrated hierarchical feature representation for annotating information graphics. Second, we describe how to use decision-tree learning to automatically extract design rules from a set of annotated graphic examples. Our results demonstrate that we can acquire, with quantitative confidence, concise rules that are difficult to obtain in handcrafted rules. Third, we present a case-based learning method to retrieve matched graphic examples based on user requests. Specifically, we use a semantics-based, quantitative visual similarity measuring algorithm to retrieve the top-k matched examples from a visual database. To help users browse a graphics database and understand the inherent relations among different examples, we combined our similarity measuring model with a hierarchical clustering algorithm to dynamically organize our graphic examples based on user interests.

In training, at the top node, we determine the hyperplane that separates a class (or some classes) from the others. If the separated classes include plural classes, at the node connected to the top node, we determine the hyperplane that separates the classes. We repeat this procedure until only one class remains in the separated region. This can resolve the unclassifiable regions that exist in the conventional SVMs, but a new problem arises. Namely, the division of the feature space depends on the structure of a decision tree. To maintain high generalization ability, the most separable classes should be separated at the upper nodes of a decision tree. For this, we propose four types of decision trees based on separability measured by the Euclidean distances between class centers and Mahalanobis-distance-based classifiers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods over conventional SVMs using benchmark data sets.

Irrespective of the way the transformation of knowledge, the developed methods usually fall into two classes: methods with high rate of transformed knowledge is done, but with a lot of restrictions concerning the type of data in the training sets, training methods, and the size of data sets; and methods with moderate rate of transformed knowledge, but with less restrictions. Our main interest was to find or develop a technique that would possess the knowledge acquisition power of neural networks and explanation power of decision trees That is why we developed a NN-DT Cascade methods an embedded hybrid of neural networks and decision trees, which is capable of transforming a part of knowledge from the neural network into a decision tree.

In this paper we propose a new feature selection method based on the discriminative perspective of improving the classification accuracy. The feature selection method is developed for a classification model for text chunking. For effective feature selection, we utilize a decision tree as an intermediate feature space inducer. To select a more compact feature set with less computational load, we organized a partially ordered feature space according to the IGR distribution of features. Experimental results show that (1) the computational complexity on high-dimensional feature space can be reduced by selecting features based on the decision tree decomposition; (2) the text chunking system using the proposed feature selection can significantly improve the performance compared with a decision tree classifier.

The hypothesis that market sentiment and IPO specific attributes are equally responsible for first-day IPO returns in the US stock market is tested. Machine learning methods used are Bayesian classifications, support vector machines, decision tree techniques, rule learners and artificial neural networks. The outcomes of the research are predictions and rules associated with first-day returns of Technology IPOs. The hypothesis that first-day returns of Technology IPOs are equally determined by IPO specific and market sentiment is rejected. Instead tower yielding IPOs are determined by IPO specific and market sentiment attributes, while higher yielding IPOs are largely dependent on IPO specific attributes.

This research proposes a two-level, multi-modal framework to tackle this problem. The video is analyzed at the shot and story unit (or scene) levels using a variety of features and techniques. At the shot level, we employ a Decision Tree to classify the shot into one of 13 predefined categories. At the scene level, we perform the HMM (Hidden Markov Models) analysis to locate the story boundaries. We test the performance of our system using two days of news video obtained from the MediaCorp of Singapore Our initial results indicate that we could achieve a high accuracy of over 95% for shot classification, and over 89% in F-1 measure on scene/story boundary detection.

Then we map the semantic clips to semantic concepts by neural network and decision-tree at the second layer. Finally, semantic inference toward events recognition is performed on the predefined finite-state machine models at the top layer. The effectiveness and efficiency of our approach are demonstrated by the experimental results on events recognition in track and field videos.

These techniques have substantial advantages for land use classification problems because of there flexibility, nonparametric nature, and ability to handle non-linear relations between features and classes. This paper compares classification results obtained by using a backpropagation neural network and decision tree classifier. It is shown by a number of studies that neural classifiers depends on a range of user defined factors, that ultimately limits their use. This study show that there are fewer number of user defined factor affecting the accuracy of a decision tree classifier. Further, this study highlight that training a decision tree classifier is much faster and these classifiers are easy to read and interpret as compared to a neural classifier which is a "black box". The performance of these two classification system is compared using ETM+ and interferometric SAR data.

Imagery from both sensors exhibited strong topographic effects, with AVIRIS also having a view-angle dependent brightness gradient across the image swath. A DEM-based empirical adjustment to reflectance levels was implemented to reduce apparent topographic effects in the imagery. In general, classification accuracy improved using the topographically normalized imagery, although it is possible that the adjustments to the AVIRIS imagery diminished the superior signal:noise performance of the AVIRIS imagery. Subtle distinctions in forest composition were detectable from both AVIRIS and Hyperion imagery, and despite the superior S:N and spatial resolution of AVIRIS, classification of Hyperion images was as accurate or more accurate than AVIRIS for most species. We therefore demonstrate the utility of Hyperion imagery, but note that further comparisons are still required. In particular, the effects of sensor artifacts (such as striping and "smile") must still be addressed when using Hyperion data.

One area in which such techniques are particularly useful is classification of remotely sensed data for land cover and vegetation mapping applications. In this paper, we describe new methods to include available information (domain knowledge) in supervised classification of land cover using high dimensional remote sensing observations. specifically, land cover and vegetation classification schemes are generally designed for ecological or land use applications. As a result, the classes of interest are often poorly separable in the multi-spectral or multi-temporal feature space provided by remote sensing. In many cases, ancillary data sources can provide useful information to help distinguish between problematic classes. However, available methods for including ancillary data sources, such as the use of prior probabilities in maximum likelihood classification, are often problematic in practice. This paper presents a method for incorporating prior probabilities in remote sensing-based land cover classification using a supervised decision tree classification algorithm. The method exploits recent theory from the domain of statistics and machine learning that allows robust estimates of class membership to be estimated using a technique known as boosting. This approach allows poorly separable classes to be distinguished based on ancillary information, but does not penalize rare classes. Further, the proposed approach can incorporate incomplete or flawed prior knowledge using a confidence estimate that weights the influence of outside information relative to its quality. To demonstrate the utility of this method, we show how it is being used to help map land cover using multi-temporal MODIS data.

According to the spectrum-reflecting characteristic, identifying and extracting methods are correspondingly used in order that the remote sensing data are drawn on maximally. At first, the non-desertification lands can be extracted from TM image by characteristics of Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Digital Numbers (DNs). Then the major research focuses on the multi-layer information discernment and extraction of three types of desertification land-covers and their respondent grades. Each grade is an object and is processed to yield a layer. Overlaying can create a complete map of desertification (SC), geometry and texture properties analysis and NDVI have been respectively utilized for distinguishing and classifying the different land types. The results show the application of decision tree and multi-layer technology could decrease the possibility of interaction and impact with others message and make target simplified in pixel identification. Meanwhile, the investigation and adjustment in the fields is quite important for analyzing the land-cover distribution and comparing the difference between grades.

Their usage with high spatial resolution data, however, has not yet been fully explored. In support of the National Park Service Vegetation Mapping Program, we have examined the feasibility of using a commercially available decision tree classifier with multi-temporal satellite data from the Enhanced Thematic Mapper-Plus instrument to map 11 land cover types at the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area near Milford, PA. Using land cover classes as specified by the National Vegetation Classification Standard at the Formation level, the final land cover map has an overall accuracy of 83.6% when tested against a validation data set acquired on the ground. This same accuracy is 98.6% when considering only forest vs. non-forest classes. Usage of multiple dates improves the accuracy over the use of a single date, particularly for the different forest types. These results demonstrate the potential applicability of such an approach to the entire National Park system and to high spatial resolution land cover and forest mapping applications.

We now have several decades of experience with thematic mapping from spectral data alone. We also have experience with the analysis of radar imagery, while hyperspectral thematic mapping techniques are now also becoming feasible. However, successful machine-assisted analysis of mixed optical and radar data is not straightforward, and is complicated further when categorical data is also involved. Often simplistic methods involving stacked vectors of all the available data are used, but the incommensurate data types means that a single analytical procedure, even if acceptable, will often yield poor results. Methods commonly used for mixed image data analysis are reviewed and a set of desirable criteria for an operational method for thematic mapping from disparate data types are presented. Finally we propose a fusion strategy based on (i) analysing each data type with procedures most suited to its particular characteristics and (ii) fusing at the class level, involving combination rules that work with labels rather than measurement vectors. The method is proposed as suited to GIS analysis, particularly when the data sets are distributed and thus accessed over a network.

These features find application in classification, segmentation and estimation. Design of classifiers has been a primary goal of most pattern recognition problems. Small sample design is often a constraint when designing classifiers. We use a recently proposed small sample design method in which the sample observations are spread with a probability mass and the classifiers designed on the spread mass. The designed classifiers are more reliability for relative to the population. Two issues are addressed: design of granulometric classifiers using a small sample, and granulometric classification based oil a very small number of features.

The development of this philosophy resulted from a number of unique circumstances, both biological and historical, that encouraged the incorporation of stochastic approaches and risk evaluation to the assessment and management process. The progression from simple discrete decision tree analysis to delta methods to Monte Carlo/bootstrap methods was due not only to advances in assessment technology but also to changing requirements for management. The current method for mackerel stock assessment is a tuned virtual population analysis with uncertainty incorporated via a mixed Monte Carlo/bootstrap algorithm. Through this procedure, uncertainty in the tuning indices, catch-at-age and natural mortality rate are directly incorporated into the advice provided to management. The management advice is given in terms of probability statements, as opposed to point estimates, to reflect this uncertainty in the stock assessments. This approach is a result of the evolution of the assessment and management and provides a pragmatic alternative in the "frequentist versus Bayesian" debate.

The aim of the study was to use decision support algorithm for the differential diagnosis of intraocular tumors using parameters from eye images obtained by the ultrasound examination. Application of predictive modeling algorithm. for decision tree formation using See.5.0/C5.0 data mining system is presented. The decision tree was build using tumor geometry and microstructure parameters. The use of decision tree allows to differentiate tumors from other tumor-like formations. Low percentage of diagnostic errors shows that decision tree is reliable enough to offer it as "second opinion" for physician's decision support.

They defined a two-level MHE typology, namely generic types and specific equipment, to describe the numerous available systems. Based on this description, the system identifies the most suitable equipment in two stages. At the primary stage the performances of basic types are evaluated for the considered problem. Having chosen one (or more) generic equipment, specific information is used to evaluate and select the appropriate specific one. The main originality of this work is the application of a multicriteria decision-aid method, called PROMETHEE II, embedded into a decision tree. At each selection stage (node of the tree), eligible solutions are ranked according to a global evaluation of their performance for the considered parameters. The ranking is computed thanks to criteria and weights, allowing the user to accurately describe the selection process. Industrial case studies, which validate the approach, are presented.

The RM automatically allocates resources in real-time over many dissimilar agents. A new data mining algorithm that uses a genetic program, an algorithm that evolves other computer programs, as a data mining function has been developed to evolve fuzzy decision trees for the resource manager. It not only determines the fuzzy decision tree structure it also creates fuzzy rules while mining scenario databases. The genetic program's structure is discussed as well as the terminal set, function set, the operations of cross-over and mutation, and the construction of the database used for data mining. Finally, an example of a fuzzy decision tree generated by this algorithm is discussed.

Genetic algorithm based optimization is conducted to determine the form of the membership functions for the fuzzy root concepts. The resource manager is made up of four trees, the isolated platform tree, the multi-platform tree, the fuzzy parameter selection tree and the fuzzy strategy tree. The isolated platform tree provides a fuzzy decision tree that allows an individual platform to respond to a threat. The multi-platform tree allows a group of platforms to respond to a threat in a collaborative self-organizing fashion. The fuzzy parameter selection tree is designed to make optimal selections of root concept parameters. The strategy tree is a fuzzy tree that an agent uses to try to predict the behavior of an enemy. Finally, the five approaches to validating the expert system are discussed.	USN, Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA	Smith, JF (reprint author), USN, Res Lab, Code 5741, Washington, DC 20375 USA.

One of such applications can be found in automatic speech recognition using hidden Markov models (HMMs). Due to the insufficient amount of training data, similar states of triphone HMMs are grouped together using a decision tree to share a common probability distribution. At the same time, in order to predict the statistics of unseen triphones, the decision tree is used as a classifier as well. In this paper, we study several cluster split criteria in decision tree building algorithms for the case where the instances to be clustered are probability density functions. Especially, when Gaussian probability distributions are to be clustered, we have found that the Bhattacharyya distance based measures are more consistent than the conventional log likelihood based measure.

Fundamental benefits are: a significant decreasing of learning time, a possible improvement of knowledge quality in case of noisy data, an increasing of knowledge legibility. In this paper we show analysis of a multidiscretizer which allows to apply a wide range of supervised discretization algorithms and which has very good abilities of tuning. Designed multidiscretizer allows to generate new supervised discretization algorithms and also variants similar to well known classic discretization algorithms such as e.g., ChiMerge. The multidiscretizer is based on top-down method and bottom-up one. It uses many measures which are mainly used in induction of decision trees and a few stop criterions. In this paper we study quality of the discretization generated by the multidiscretizer through evaluation of decision trees' accuracy. We focus on comparison of top-down method with bottom-up one and also the measures for the configuration presented below. For discretization research we use decision tree induction algorithms C4.5 and ID3.

The most important advantage of decision tree methods are based on compactness and clearness of presented knowledge and high accuracy of classification. In case of large data tables, the existing decision tree induction methods often show to be inefficient in both computation and description aspects. The disadvantage of standard decision tree methods is also their instability, i.e., small deviation of data perhaps cause a total change of decision tree. We present the novel "soft discretization" methods using "soft cuts" instead of traditional "crisp" (or sharp) cuts. This new concept allows to generate more compact and stable decision trees with high classification accuracy. We also present an efficient method for soft cut generation from large data bases.

If one can indeed do such prediction, then how accurately can he do so? The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that (i) there are different ways of computationally predicting functional categories of proteins, and (ii) some computational methods could be more effective than others. We report the results of applying two distinctive families of data mining methods to three protein groups: Yeast, E. Coli, and Membrane proteins. The data mining methods we used are statistical methods and decision tree algorithm (C4.5). We discover that C4.5 generally outperforms statistical methods. We hypothesize that the information gain measure of C4.5 may provide additional information beyond what is obtained when merely computing the frequency of amino acid composition, which is the basis of statistical methods. We conclude that the generally poor classification accuracies suggest that the amino acid composition as the primary measure to discern functional categories may be insufficient. Future study should focus on investigating what additional features of proteins should be used to enhance the classification accuracy.

In general, the goal of these models is to predict a quality factor starting from a set of direct measures. The lack of data behind these models makes it hard to generalize, to cross-validate, and to reuse existing models. As a consequence, for a company, selecting an appropriate quality model is a difficult, non-trivial decision. In this paper, we propose a general approach and a particular solution to this problem. The main idea is to combine and adapt existing models (experts) in such way that the combined model works well on the particular system or in the particular type of organization. In our particular solution, the experts are assumed to be decision tree or rule-based classifiers and the combination is done by a genetic algorithm. The result is a white-box model: for each software component, not only the model gives the prediction of the software quality factor but it also provides the expert that was used to obtain the prediction. Test results indicate that the proposed model performs significantly better than individual experts in the pool.

J	Wu, CH; Kao, SC				Wu, CH; Kao, SC			Induction-based approach to rule generation using membership function	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING			English	Article							KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION; SYSTEMS	Most intelligent manufacturing systems involve gained information. Inference knowledge (or rules) can be elicited through the gained information that is usually modelled as a set of data with a numeric type or semantic form. While the induction groups of algorithm are being used to acquire knowledge automatically, with respect to decision tree generation, the technique that deals with the representation of numeric data in the dataset may strongly affect the outputs. In this paper, we present a mechanism that combines the utilization of membership function and the ID3 algorithm to generate decision rules from a set of data. Based on the presented mechanism, the research also develops an ID3 Rule Generation System (ID3RGS) that can be used in any domain to support the generation of a decision tree and correspondingly exact/approximate rules. An example used to demonstrate the prototype system is also delineated.

J	Nock, R				Nock, R			Inducing interpretable voting classifiers without trading accuracy for simplicity: Theoretical results, approximation algorithms, and experiments	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							RULES	Recent advances in the study of voting classification algorithms have brought empirical and theoretical results clearly showing the discrimination power of ensemble classifiers. It has been previously argued that the search of this classification power in the design of the algorithms has marginalized the need to obtain interpretable classifiers. Therefore, the question of whether one might have to dispense with interpretability in order to keep classification strength is being rased in a growing number of machine learning or data mining papers. The purpose of this paper is to study both theroetically and empirically the problem. First, we provide numerous results giving insight into the hardness of the simplicity-accuracy tradeoff for voting classifiers. then we provide an efficient "top-down and prune" induction heuristic, WIDC, mainly derived from recent results on the weak learning and boosting frameworks. It is to our knowledge the first attempt to build a voting classifier as a base formula using the weak learning framework (the one which was previously highly successful for decision tree induction), and not the strong learning framework (as usual for such classifiers with boosting-like approaches). While it uses a well-known induction scheme previously successful in other classes of concept representations, thus making it easy to implement and compare, WIDC also relies on recent or new results we give about particular cases of boosting known as partition boosting and ranking loss boosting. Experimental results on thirty-one domains, most of which readily available, tend to display the ability of WIDC to produce small, accurate, and interpretable decision committees.

The decision trees built by most of the existing classification algorithms commonly feature over-branching, which will lead to poor efficiency in the subsequent classification period. In this paper, we present a new value-oriented classification method, which aims at building accurately proper-sized decision trees while reducing over-branching as much as possible, based on the concepts of frequent-pattern-node and exceptive-child-node. The experiments show that while using relevant analysis as pre-processing, our classification method, without loss of accuracy, can eliminate the over-branching greatly in decision trees more effectively and efficiently than other algorithms do.

J	Samal, A; Peterson, B; Holliday, DJ				Samal, A; Peterson, B; Holliday, DJ			Recognition of plants using a stochastic L-system model	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING			English	Article							STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; FRACTAL GEOMETRY; NATURAL SCENES	Recognition of natural shapes like leaves, plants, and trees, has proven to be a challenging problem in computer vision. The members of a class of natural objects are not identical to each other They are similar, have similar features, but are not exactly the same. Most existing techniques have not succeeded in effectively recognizing these objects. One of the main reasons is that the models used to represent them are inadequate themselves. In this research we use a fractal model, which has been very effective in modeling natural shapes, to represent and then guide the recognition of a class of natural objects, namely plants, Variation in plants is accommodated by using the stochastic L-systems, A learning system is then used to generate a decision tree that can be used for classification. Results show that the approach is successful for a large class of synthetic plants and provides the basis for further research into recognition of natural plants. (C) 2002 SPIE and IST.

J	Pettie, S; Ramachandran, V				Pettie, S; Ramachandran, V			An optimal minimum spanning tree algorithm	JOURNAL OF THE ACM			English	Article						algorithms; theory; graph algorithms; minimum spanning tree; optimal complexity	LINEAR-TIME; VERIFICATION; COMPLEXITY	We establish that the algorithmic complexity of the minimum spanning tree problem is equal to its decision-tree complexity. Specifically. we present a deterministic algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree of a graph within vertices and m edges that runs in time O(T*(m, n)) where T* is the minimum number of edge-weight comparisons needed to determine the solution. The algorithm is quite simple and can be implemented on a pointer machine. Although our time bound is optimal, the exact function describing it is not known at present. The current best bounds known for T* are T*(m, n) = Omega(m) and T*(m, n) = O(m - alpha(m, n)), where alpha is a certain natural inverse of Ackermann's function, Even under the assumption that T(-) is superlinear, we show that if the input graph is selected front G(n,m), our algorithm runs in linear time with high probability, regardless of n, in, or the permutation of edge weights. The analysis uses a new martingale for G(n,m), similar to the edge-exposure martingale for G(n,p).

We present the approach TRITOP/MATCHBOX combining the relational decision tree algorithm TRITOP with the connectionist approach MATCHBOX. TRITOP constructs efficiently a relational decision tree for the fast discrimination of classes of relational descriptions, while MATCHBOX is used for constructing class prototypes. Although TRITOP's decision trees perform very well in the classification task, they are difficult to understand and to explain. In order to overcome this disadvantage of decision trees in general, in a second step the decision tree is supplemented by prototypes. Prototypes are generalised graphtheoretic descriptions of common substructures of those subclasses of the training set that are defined by the leaves of the decision tree. Such prototypes give a comprehensive and understandable description of the subclasses. In the prototype construction, the connectionist approach MATCHBOX is used to perform fast graph matching and graph generalisation, which are originally NP-complete tasks.

J	Fournier, D; Cremilleux, B				Fournier, D; Cremilleux, B			A quality index for decision tree pruning	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Engineering Intelligent Systems Conference	JUN, 2000	PAISLEY, SCOTLAND		UNIV PAISLEY	decision tree; quality; pruning; uncertain data		Decision tree is a divide and conquer classification method used in machine learning. Most pruning methods for decision trees minimize a classification error rate. In uncertain domains, some sub-trees that do not decrease the error rate can be relevant in pointing out some populations of specific interest or to give a representation of a large data file. A new pruning method (called DI pruning) is presented here. It takes into account the complexity of sub-trees and is able to keep sub-trees with leaves yielding to determine relevant decision rules, although they do not increase the classification efficiency. DI pruning allows to assess the quality of the data used for the knowledge discovery task. In practice, this method is implemented in the UnDeT software. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This investigation reports on the effects of the various types of missing data, present in varying densities in a group of simulated datasets, on learning classifier system performance. It was found that missing data have an adverse effect on learning classifier system (LCS) learning and classification performance, the latter of which is not seen in See5, a robust decision tree inducer. Specific adverse effects include decreased learning rate, decreased accuracy of classification of novel data on testing, increased proportions of testing cases that cannot be classified, and increased variability in these metrics. In addition, the effects are correlated with the density of missing values in a dataset, as well as the type of missing data, whether it is random and ignorable, or systematically missing and therefore non-ignorable.

RBMNs extend Bayesian networks (BNs) as well as partitional clustering systems. Briefly, a RBMN is a decision tree with component BNs at the leaves. A RBMN is learnt using a greedy, heuristic approach akin to that used by many supervised decision tree learners, but where BNs are learnt at leaves using constructive induction. A key idea is to treat expected data as real data. This allows us to complete the database and to take advantage of a closed form for the marginal likelihood of the expected complete data that factorizes into separate marginal likelihoods for each family (a node and its parents). Our approach is evaluated on synthetic and real-world databases.

In particular, we show that the use of round robin ensembles will also increase the classification performance of decision tree learners, even though they can directly handle multi-class problems. The performance gain is not as large as for bagging and boosting, but on the other hand round robin ensembles have a clearly defined semantics. Furthermore, we show that the advantage of pairwise classification over direct multi-class classification and one-against-all binarization increases with the number of classes, and that round robin ensembles form an interesting alternative for problems with ordered class values.

The original formulation of the tree induction algorithm restricted attention to binary classification problems. This paper empirically evaluates several wrapper methods for extending the algorithm to the multiclass case by splitting the problem into several two-class problems. Seeking a more natural solution we then adapt the multiclass LogitBoost and AdaBoost.MH procedures to induce alternating decision trees directly. Experimental results confirm that these procedures are comparable with wrapper methods that are based on the original ADTree formulation in accuracy, while inducing much smaller trees.

This generalization intends to capture the aspect of uncertainty involved in inductive reasoning. To this end, Ockham's razor is formalized within the framework of possibility theory: It is not simply used for identifying a single, apparently optimal model, but rather for concluding on the possibility of various candidate models. The possibilistic version of Ockham's razor is applied to (lazy) decision tree learning.

Each DM technique has a specific background theory; therefore, different results are expected when applying multiple methods. The purpose of this study is to find the data format appropriate for each DM classification technique for wider applications, and efficiently to obtain trustworthy results. Considering the nature of medical data, categorical variables are sometimes useful for making decisions and can make it easier to extrapolate knowledge. In this study, three mathematical data categorization methods (Fusinter, minimum description length principle [MDLPC] and Chi-merge) were applied to accommodate five data mining classification techniques (statistics discriminant analysis, supervised classification with Neural Networks, Decision trees, Genetic supervised clustering and Bayesian classification [probability neural networks; PNN]) using a heart disease database with four types of data (continuous data, binary data, nominal data, and ordinal data). Compared with original or normalized data, data categorized by the MDLPC categorization method was found to perform better in most of the DM classification techniques used in this study. Categorical data is good for most DM classification techniques (e. g. classification of disease and non-disease groups) and is relatively easy to use for extracting medical knowledge.

This paper introduces a new method, called the transition fuzzy probability. it begins with an introduction on the theory of transition fuzzy probability. Then, a computation procedure is given. The new method is validated using a practical TCM application in boring. Using the means of the main spindle motor current and the feed motor current, the new method achieved a success rate about 95%. This result is better than the compared methods. Its success may be attributed to the fact that the new method uses the available information to the maximum extent, while the existing methods use only partial information. A number of future research topics are also given.	Univ Miami, Dept Ind Engn, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA	Du, R (reprint author), Univ Miami, Dept Ind Engn, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.

The main goal is to achieve a better understanding of different settings of process parameters and to be able to predict more accurately the effect of different parameters on the final product quality. This paper also presents results from the application of the combined decision tree - neural network method to the transformer manufacturing industry. In the environment considered, quality improvement is achieved by increasing the classification success rate of transformer iron losses. The results from the application of the proposed method on a transformer industry demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of this approach for the quality improvement of industrial processes.

The paper compares the classification accuracy of three data mining, techniques such as decision trees, neural networks, and logit regression for loan payment prediction. The initial simulation results show that the difference in the classification accuracy between the three methods appears to be insignificant. We recommend using, the three techniques in tandem and using the majority voting to achieve a more reliable decision. The decision tree approach might be preferable to the other ones because it can produce understandable rules that allow one to explain the rationale behind the decision.

J	Chapurlat, RD; Cummings, SR				Chapurlat, RD; Cummings, SR			Does follow-up of osteoporotic women treated with antiresorptive therapies improve effectiveness?	OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						antiresorptive therapies; decision analysis; markers of bone turnover; osteoporosis	BONE-MINERAL DENSITY; POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS; VERTEBRAL FRACTURES; BIOCHEMICAL MARKERS; RANDOMIZED TRIAL; ALENDRONATE; RISK; RISEDRONATE; TURNOVER; PREDICT	The use of biochemical markers of bone turnover has been advocated to improve follow-up of women receiving antiresorptive therapies for osteoporosis, but this strategy is not yet supported by trials showing it improves effectiveness of treatments. To explore the potential value of markers of bone turnover to monitor antiresorptive treatments of osteoporosis, we conducted a decision analysis using a decision tree and Markov modeling. We have compared two strategies: treatment of a woman without specific monitoring; and treatment of this woman with measurement of a serum marker of bone resorption after 3 months of treatment, with change of treatment if response to treatment assessed by this marker was not satisfactory. The base case is the treatment of a 60-year-old osteoporotic woman with a total hip T-score of -3, using a second generation bisphosphonate during 5 years. We found that follow-up produced slightly greater quality adjusted life years (QALYs) than no follow-up (8.1560 vs 8.1532, i.e. a one day difference). In a two-way sensitivity analysis, the follow-up option produced higher QALYs so long as adherence rate with follow-up was equal or superior to the proportion of women who adhered without follow-up. For example, if the proportion of women adherent to treatment was increased from 50% to 60% by follow-up, then the expected value of the follow-up branch was increased from 8.1560 QALYs to 8.1800 QALYs (i.e. a difference of 9 days). In addition, the higher the non-response rate, the greater the benefit from monitoring with a biochemical marker. In conclusion, our decision analysis model suggests that follow-up of osteoporotic women treated with a second generation bisphosphonate during a 5-year period using an early measurement of a serum marker of bone resorption may increase effectiveness of the treatment on quality of life, but the effect is very small. So, the use of follow-up measures of bone turnover may be based on patient and physician preferences.

Each classifier in the sequence uses a smaller subset of features than the subsequent classifier. The classification provided by a classifier is rejected only if its decision is below a predefined confidence level. The approach is tested on a two-stage combination of k-Nearest Neighbour classifiers.. The features to be used by the first classifier in the combination are selected by two stand-alone algorithms (Relief and Info-Fuzzy Network, or IFN) and a hybrid method, called 'IFN + Relief. The feature-based approach is shown empirically to provide a substantial decrease in the computational complexity, while maintaining the accuracy level of a single-stage classifier or even improving it.

J	Zhang, P; Chen, LH				Zhang, P; Chen, LH			A novel feature extraction method and hybrid tree classification for handwritten numeral recognition	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						handwritten numeral recognition; feature extraction; decision tree classifier; neural networks	CHARACTER-RECOGNITION; NEURAL-NETWORK; DIGIT RECOGNITION; CLASSIFIERS; ALGORITHM; DESIGN; INFORMATION	A hybrid classification system with neural network and decision tree as the classifiers for handwritten numeral recognition is proposed. Firstly a variety of stable and reliable global features are defined and extracted based on the character geometric structures, a novel floating detector is then proposed to detect segments along the left and right profiles of a character image used as local features. The recognition system consists of a hierarchical coarse classification and fine classification. For the coarse classifier: a three-layer feed forward neural network with back propagation learning algorithm is employed to distinguish six subsets {0}, {6}, {8}, {1,7}, {2, 3,5}, {4,9} based on the feature similarity of characters extracted. Three character classes namely {0}, {6} and {8} are directly recognized from artificial neural network (ANN). For each of characters in the latter three subsets, a decision tree classifier is built for further fine classification as follows: Firstly, the specific feature-class relationship is heuristically and empirically deduced between the feature primitives and corresponding semantic class. Then, an iterative growing and pruning algorithm is used to form a tree classifier. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed recognition system is robust and flexible and a high recognition rate is reported. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Objective: Our aim was to compare both health-related quality of life and costs for hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) in a defined population. . Design: Decision-tree modeling to estimate total costs and effects for two treatment strategies, HD and PD, among patients with chronic kidney failure, for 5 years following the start of treatment. Courses of events and health-care consumption were mapped in a retrospective matched-record study. Data on health status were obtained from a matched population by a quality-of-life questionnaire (EuroQol). The study has a societal perspective. . Setting: All dialysis departments in the southeastern health-care region of Sweden. . Patients: 136 patients with kidney failure, comprising 68 matched pairs, were included in a retrospective record study; 81 patients with kidney failure, comprising 27 matched triplets, were included in a prospective questionnaire study. . Main Outcome Measures: Cost per life year and cost per quality-adjusted life year. . Results: The cost per quality-adjusted life year for PD was lower in all analyzed age groups. There was a 12% difference in the age group 21 - 40 years, a 31% difference in the age group 41 - 60 years, and an 11% difference in the age group 61+ years. Peritoneal dialysis and HD resulted in similar frequencies of transplantation (50% and 41%, respectively) and expected survival (3.58 years and 3.56 years, respectively) during the first 5 years after the initiation of treatment. . Conclusion:The cost-utility ratio is most favorable for PD as the primary method of treatment for patients eligible for both PD and HD.

J	Das Gupta, R; Guest, JF				Das Gupta, R; Guest, JF			A model to estimate the cost benefit of an occupational vaccination programme for influenza with Influvac (R) in the UK	PHARMACOECONOMICS			English	Article							GENERAL-PRACTICE; CONTROLLED TRIAL; IMPACT; HEALTHY; ILLNESS; NETHERLANDS; POPULATION; EPIDEMIC	Objectives: To model the economic impact of introducing an occupational vaccination programme for influenza with an inactivated influenza subunit vaccine (Influvac(R)) in the UK. Design and setting: Using published sources, a decision tree was constructed which modelled the costs and benefits of introducing an influenza vaccine in a business in the UK from the perspective of an employer. Study participants and interventions: The model considered the implementation of an occupational vaccination programme with Influvac(R) in a business employing 1000 normal healthy adults earning the national average wage in the UK. The model assumed that 95% of employees would be absent from work after contracting influenza for a mean of 5 days and that the level of productivity would be reduced by 60% for one day by 85% of sick employees returning to work. Main outcome measures and results: The expected probability of an employee being absent from work following an influenza vaccination would be reduced from 5.7 to 1.8% when the incidence of influenza in the community is 6%. Accordingly, if all 1000 employees were vaccinated, a business would be expected to reduce absenteeism from work attributable to an influenza outbreak by 220 days. Moreover, the expected return on every pound invested by an employer would be pound1.03, pound3.09 and pound5.15 (2000 values) when the annual incidence of influenza in the community is 2, 6 and 10%, respectively. Conclusions: Implementation of an occupational vaccination programme with Influvac(R) would be expected to reduce the incidence of influenza among a work-force leading to less absenteeism from work and averted lost productivity. Even if the incidence of influenza was as low as 2% it may be a worthwhile investment for UK employers to vaccinate their employees with Influvac(R).

J	Rushton, DN; Lloyd, AC; Anderson, PM				Rushton, DN; Lloyd, AC; Anderson, PM			Cost-effectiveness comparison of tizanidine and baclofen in the management of spasticity	PHARMACOECONOMICS			English	Article							MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; DOUBLE-BLIND; EFFICACY; TRIAL	Objective: Baclofen and tizanidine are both used for the treatment of muscle spasticity of spinal origin. Their effectiveness, cost and adverse-effect profiles differ. This paper sets out to estimate the cost effectiveness of each drug, and the impact of changing from baclofen to tizanidine. Design: A simplified but realistic model of physician behaviour and patient response was developed as a decision tree and populated with data derived from the available published clinical comparative trials. We considered patients with spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury. The outcome measure used was 'cost per successfully treated day' (STD). Costs were estimated from the perspective of the UK National Health Service at 2000 values. Results: Expected cost for a cohort of 100 patients over 1 year was estimated to be pound181 545 with baclofen and pound211 930 with tizanidine. The estimated number of STDs was 20 192 with tizanidine and 17 289 with baclofen. The overall cost effectiveness of managing spasticity using baclofen and tizanidine was very similar (pound10.50 and pound10.49 per STD respectively). The incremental cost effectiveness (ICE) of using tinzanidine as an alternative to baclofen for first-line treatment was pound10.47 per STD. Sensitivity analysis found the model to be robust to changes in key parameters Conclusion: Drug cost should not be a determining factor in making this treatment choice, as the cost effectiveness ratios are similar for both products.

PROCEEDING OF THE 2002 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS, VOLS 1-3	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 02)	MAY 12-17, 2002	HONOLULU, HI	IEEE, IEEE Neural Networks Soc, Int Neural Network Soc				Most adaptive systems are homogenous, i.e. they are built from processing elements of the same type. MLP neural networks and decision trees use nodes that partition the input space by hyperplanes. Other types of neural networks use nodes that provide spherical or ellipsoidal decision borders. This may not be the best inductive bias for a given data, frequently requiring large number of processing elements even in cases when simple solutions exist. In heterogeneous adaptive systems (HAS) different types of decision borders are used at each stage, enabling discovery of a most appropriate bias for the data. Neural, decision tree and similarity-based systems of this sort are described here. Results from a novel heterogeneous decision tree algorithm are presented as an example of this approach.

However, lacking the approach of information management such as mining the valuable knowledge from the tremendous amount of data lead to a data rich but information poor situation and made post industry lose many commercial opportunities in the past. In order to make full use of this fast-growing amount of data and reinforce the commercial competition of post industry, the need for CRM (Client Relationship Management) system is imminent. In this paper, we mainly discuss the data mining for post industry including the designing issues of data mining module in CRM system, the data mining objects and algorithms for the specific post services.

In our research we addressed the problem of finding new knowledge in the form of rules in the diabetes database using a combination of decision trees and association rates. The first question we wanted to answer was, if there are significant differences in sets of rules both approaches produce, and how rules, produced by decision trees behave, after being a subject of filtering and reduction, normally used in association rate approaches. fit order to accomplish that, we had to make some modifications to both the decision tree approach and association rule approach. From the first results we can conclude, that the sets of rules, built by decision trees are much smaller than the sets created by association rules. We could also establish, that filtering and reduction did not effect the rules derived from decision trees in the same scale as association rules.

Our knowledge sources include the part-of-speech of neighboring words, single words in the surrounding context, local collocations, and syntactic relations. The learning algorithms evaluated include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, and decision tree algorithms. We present empirical results showing the relative contribution of the component knowledge sources and the different learning algorithms. In particular, using all of these knowledge sources and SVM (i.e., a single learning algorithm) achieves accuracy higher than the best official scores on both SENSEVAL-2 and SENSEVAL-1 test data.

We started with a standard feature set used in previous work, which led to moderate results. A closer examination of the performance of the features for different forms of anaphoric expressions showed good results for pronouns, moderate results for proper names, and poor results for definite noun phrases. We then included a cheap, language and domain independent feature based on the minimum edit distance between strings. This feature yielded a significant improvement for data sets consisting of definite noun phrases and proper names, respectively.

Such systems often extract a set of features such as color, texture and shape from the raw multimedia data automatically and store them as content descriptors. This content-based metadata supports a wider variety of queries than text-based metadata and thus provides a promising approach for efficient database access and management. When the size of the database becomes large and the number of clients connected to the server increases, the feature data requires a significant amount of storage space and transmission bandwidth. Thus it is useful to devise techniques to compress the features. In this paper, we propose an optimal design of a classified quantizer in a rate-distortion-complexity optimization framework. A Decision Tree Classifier (DTC) is applied to classify the compressed data. We employ the Generalized Breiman, Freidman, Olshen, and Stone (G-BFOS) algorithm to design the optimal pre-classifier, which is a pruned sub-tree of the decision tree, and to perform the optimal bit allocation among classes. The optimization is carried out based not only on a rate budget, but also on a coding complexity constraint. We illustrate this framework by showing a texture classification example. Our results show that by using a classified quantizer to encode the features, we are able to improve the percentage of correct classification by 11%, as compared to using a quantizer without pre-classification at the same rate. This improvement in classification also leads to a reduction of the number of images transmitted between server and client.

One important step in construction of a decision tree is how to select appropriate attributes as nodes of the tree. There are many approaches to selection of attributes. In this paper, we present a new approach to selection of attributes for construction of decision tree based on rough set theory. Decision trees constructed by the presented approach tend to have simpler structure and higher classification accuracy from statistical point of view than entropy-based method under some conditions. Some data sets from UCI machine learning database repository are then used to test the two methods, which from application perspective instantiates the performance of rough set-based method. In the paper we also give an algorithm in a recursive form for construction of decision tree.

Fabrizio Sebastiani et al. provided another idea to improve these base classifiers: combining two or more weak hypothesis as a single base classifier. Its main problem is that the amount of hypothesis selected to combine is determined not by their importance, but by the boosting iteration times already performed. This paper proposes two dynamical ways for combining any number of hypotheses according to their importance. Experimental results show that the new ideas do improve the performance of boosting.

This method is able to capture regularities that can be described in terms of presence or absence of arbitrary combinations of motifs. A training set of peptidase sequences labeled with the corresponding MEROPS functional families or clans is used to automatically construct decision trees that capture regularities that are sufficient to assign the sequences to their respective functional families. The performance of the resulting decision tree classifiers is then evaluated. on an independent test set. We compared the rules constructed using motifs generated by a multiple sequence alignment based motif discovery tool (MEME) with rules constructed using expert annotated PROSITE motifs (patterns and profiles). Our results indicate that the former provide a potentially powerful high throughput technique for constructing protein function classifiers when adequate training data are available. Examination of the, generated rules in the case of a Caspase (C14) family suggests that the proposed technique may be able to identify combinations of sequence motifs that charactetize functionally significant 3-dimensional structural, features of proteins.

The platforms can be very general, e.g., ships, planes, etc. Potential foes can also be general. The resource manager has been embedded in an electronic game environment. This co-evolutionary, game fully automates the data mining problem allowing determination of parameters essential to the resource manager. Pie game allows the resource manager to learn from human experts or computerized enemies. The game does not determine the structure of fuzzy, decision trees. A new data mining algorithm that uses a genetic program, an algorithm that evolves other computer programs, as a data mining function has been developed to solve this problem. It not only, determines the fuzzy decision tree structure it also creates fuzzy, rules while mining scenario data bases. Finally, experimental results are discussed related to both data mining algorithms.

One of tile problems encountered is the overfitting of rules to training data. In some cases this can lead to an excessively large number of rules. many of which have very little predictive value for unseen data. This paper is concerned with the reduction of overfitting during decision tree generation. It introduces a technique known as J-pruning, based on the J-measure, an information theoretic means of quantifying the information content of a rule.

This is, in part, due to difficulties associated with porting expert system shell environments to the world wide web. For instance, many real world applications require shell environments that do more than make mere inferences with rules. However, integrating rule based reasoning with other approaches exacerbate the difficulties in placing hybrid, systems on the World Wide Web. In this paper, we present a knowledge based system shell, WebShell that enables knowledge based systems to be developed and executed on the World Wide Web. WebShell models knowledge using two distinct techniques; decision trees for procedural type tasks and argument trees for tasks that are more complex, ambiguous or uncertain. Rather than translate decision tree knowledge into rules, we map the decision trees into sets we call sequenced transition networks. These sets can readily be stored in a relational database format in a way that simplifies the inference engine design. The inference engines for both the argument tree and the decision tree models execute on the server side and have been implemented using a very small (30K) PHP program.

The data concern a set of situations (objects, states, examples) described by a set of attributes (properties, features, characteristics). The attributes are, in general, divided into condition and decision attributes, corresponding to input and output of a situation. The situations are partitioned by decision attributes into decision classes. A pattern discovered from the data has a symbolic form of decision rule or decision tree. In many practical problems, some condition attributes are defined on preference-ordered scales and the decision classes are also preference-ordered. The known methods of knowledge discovery ignore, unfortunately, this preference information, taking thus a risk of drawing wrong patterns. To deal with preference-ordered data we propose to use a new approach called Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA). Given a set of situations described by at least one condition attribute with preference-ordered scale and partitioned into preference-ordered classes, the new rough set approach is able to approximate this partition by means of dominance relations. The rough approximation of this partition is a starting point for induction of "if..., then..." decision rules. The syntax of these rules is adapted to represent preference orders. The DRSA analyses only facts present in data and possible inconsistencies are identified. It preserves the concept of granular computing, however, the granules are dominance cones in evaluation space, and not bounded sets. It is also concordant with the paradigm of computing with words, as it exploits ordinal, and not necessarily cardinal, character of data.

An information system is called compressible relatively to a weight function if for each problem with enough big weight (total weight of attributes in problem description) there exists a decision tree which solves this problem and which weighted depth is less than the problem weight. In the paper all pairs of information systems and weight functions are described such that the information system is compressible relatively to the weight function.

Given the data in form of an information table including some sorting examples, we propose to induce a decision tree using an inductive learning algorithm. The decision tree can be considered as a preference model of a decision maker who supplied the sorting examples. Moreover, a partial violation of the dominance principle is admitted and controlled by an index called consistency level. The monotonic decision trees with variable consistency can be applied to a wide range of possible applications, for instance, financial rating, bank creditworthiness, medical diagnosis, and the like.

The main method utilised in this paper is the Variable Precision Rough Sets (VPRS) model, which constructs a set of decision 'if... then...' rules. These rules are easily readable by non-specialists and predict the proportion of low paid employees in an establishment. Through a 'leave n out' approach a standard error on the predictive accuracy of the sets of rules is calculated, also the importance of the descriptive characteristics is exposited based on their use. To gauge the effectiveness of the VPRS analysis, comparisons are made to a series of decision tree analyses.

The sharing of information measured by local sensors via communication links across the battlegroup should allow for optimal or near optimal decisions. A fuzzy logic algorithm has been developed that automatically allocates electronic attack (EA) resources in real-time. The fuzzy logic approach allows the direct incorporation of expertise allowing decisions to be made based on these rules. Genetic algorithm based optimization is conducted to determine the form of the membership functions for the fuzzy root concepts. The resource manager is made up of five parts, the isolated platform model, the multi-platform model, the communication model, the fuzzy parameter selection tree and the fuzzy strategy tree. Automatic determination of fuzzy decision tree structure using a genetic program, an algorithm that creates other computer programs is discussed. A comparison to a tree obtained using a genetic program and one constructed based on expertise is made. The automatic discovery through genetic algorithms of mufti-platform techniques, rules and strategies is discussed. Two new multi-platform power allocation algorithms based on fuzzy number theory and linear and nonlinear programming are introduced. Methods of validating the algorithms are examined.

In contrast to existing algorithms that claim to be incremental, INC-DT uses only a fixed amount of memory during the whole learning process. It bases its hypotheses exclusively on the last one computed, its assessment, and a fixed number of seen examples. So, it is able to deal with initial knowledge and concept drift, e.g.	Tech Univ Darmstadt, D-64283 Darmstadt, Germany	Grieser, G (reprint author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Alexanderstr 10, D-64283 Darmstadt, Germany.							0	0	0	I O S PRESS	AMSTERDAM	NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS	0922-6389	1-58603-259-3	FR ART INT			2002	78						105	106				2	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Computer Science	BV48D	WOS:000179109100013

At the beginning of this paper, a general introduction of popular methods for data mining is presented, including statistical analysis method, decision tree, neural network, genetic algorithm, rough sets theory and visualization technology. Then the simulation system, which is an application environment for the study, is described briefly. After that, the combined method based on rough sets theory is presented. For given condition attributes and decision attributes in a universe, a 2-dimensional data view is constructed through building a basic simulation model of the system concerned and collecting useful data. Then select effective attributes and reductions with maximum weights for rules, and then take combination of reductions with the biggest weight. As such, a practical and effective reduced knowledge rule set can be obtained. Experimental simulation results show that these knowledge rules used for optimization control of the simulation system are promising.

These methods have an advantage over artificial neural networks, another data mining method often used in analysis of travel behavior: they facilitate determination of the relationships between the explanatory variables and the choice. Specifically, the C4.5 algorithm, which produces a decision tree and a set of production rules from the tree, is applied here. Two surveys were carried out to collect data on drivers' route choice behavior between two alternative routes on expressway networks. The two data sets include the expected minimum, maximum, and average travel times along each alternative route, as indicated by the respondent as well as his or her sociodemographic attributes. The results of the analyses suggest that different expected travel times influence route choice in different cases and that a maximum or average travel time determines route choice in some cases regardless of other attributes. The results of a comparison analysis between the C4.5 algorithm and discrete choice models indicate the superior ability offered by the former in representing drivers' route choice.

This technique is at the core of justifications for wildlife damage management efforts. BCA has been noticeably absent from the study of vertebrate pest management problems, and in the few studies where a BCA has been included, the analysis is incomplete. This paper provides an overview of the steps in a BCA, using specific wildlife damage examples to highlight and expand the technique for researchers interested in documenting these effects.

An interdisciplinary team of environmentally focused professionals spent two days during the EcoSummit to tackle semantics, present case studies, and share perspective on the importance of ecosystem services towards understanding and solving environmental problems in the 21st century. Solutions to environmental problems will be both technical and social in nature. Ecosystem services define the natural processes of the biosphere that are responsible for sustaining human life. In a world where the scale of human activity has become truly global, the significance and role of ecosystem services for assessing and managing human activity are becoming universally self evident. This chapter presents ecosystem services in terms of definitions and connotations along with discussion of the road to follow in order to explicitly build ecosystem services into the structure of future human existence. Such a road needs to be taken if humankind is to escape the current self-destructive path with the biosphere. Key outcomes of the working group were the recognition of the interplay between (1) global concerns and local initiatives, (2) thinkers, doers, and stakeholders, and (3) central authority and distributed activity. A first draft of a decision tree interrelating needs of ecosystem services with wants of human development is presented to the reader for adaptation towards evolving best practices for sustainability in the future.

However, for a given data set, it is often not clear beforehand which machine learning method will yield the best prediction performance. This study compares the variable selection and prediction performance of four machine-learning methods of different complexity: logistic regression, decision tree, multivariate adaptive regression splines and neural network. The methods are applied to the task of predicting the exceedance of the European PM10 daily average objective of 50 mug m(-3) for a station in Helsinki, Finland. Our study shows that some predictors were selected by all models but that the different models also picked different variables. The performance of three of the four methods investigated was very similar, however, performance of the decision tree method was significantly inferior. Performance was sensitive to the learning sample size and time period used.

This paper aims at improving the performance of the SLIQ decision tree algorithm (Mehta et. al, 1996) for classification in data mining The drawback of this algorithm is that large number of gini indices have to be computed at each node of the decision tree. In order to decide which attribute is to be split at each node, the gini indices have to be computed for all the attributes and for each successive pair of values for all patterns which have not been classified. An improvement over the SLIQ algorithm has been proposed to reduce the computational complexity. In this algorithm, the gini index is computed not for every successive pair of values of an attribute but over different ranges of attribute values. Classification accuracy of this technique was compared with the existing SLIQ and the Neural Network technique on three real life datasets consisting of the effect of different chemicals on water pollution, Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data and Image data It was observed that the decision tree constructed using the proposed decision tree algorithm gave far better classification accuracy than the classification accuracy obtained using the SLIQ algorithm irrespective of the dataset under consideration. The classification accuracy of this algorithm was even better compared to the neural network classification technique. Overall, it was observed that this decision tree algorithm not only reduces the number of computations of gini indices but also leads to better classification accuracy.

IEEE Comp Soc, Informat Technol Res Inst, Wright State Univ				It has been asserted that, using traditional pruning methods, growing decision trees with increasingly larger amounts of training data will result in larger tree sizes even when accuracy does not increase. With regard to error-based pruning, the experimental data used to illustrate this assertion have apparently been obtained using the default setting for pruning strength; in particular; using the default certainty factor of 25 in the C4.5 decision tree implementation. We show that, in generals, an appropriate setting of the certainty factor for error-based pruning will cause decision tree size to plateau when accuracy is not increasing with more training. data.

In the 21st century, the problem no longer lies in writing the learner, but in choosing which learners to run on a given data set. In this paper, we argue that the final choice of learners should not be exclusive; in fact, there are distinct advantages in running data sets through multiple learners. To illustrate our point, we perform a case study on a reuse data set using three different styles of learners: association rule, decision tree induction, and treatment Software reuse is a topic of avid debate in the professional and academic arena; it has proven that it can be both a blessing and a curse. Although there is much debate over where and when reuse should be instituted into a project, our learners found some procedures which should significantly improve the odds of a reuse program succeeding.

Such a timely reliability estimation can be used to direct cost-effective quality improvement efforts to the high-risk modules. Tree-based software quality classification models based on software metrics are used to predict whether a software module is fault-prone or not fault-prone. They are white box quality estimation models with good accuracy, and are simple and easy to interpret. This paper presents an in-depth study of calibrating classification trees for software quality estimation using the SPRINT decision tree algorithm. Many classification algorithms have memory limitations including the requirement that data sets be memory resident. SPRINT removes all of these limitations and provides a fast and scalable analysis. It is an extension of a commonly used decision tree algorithm, CART, and provides a unique tree-pruning technique based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. Combining the MDL pruning technique and the modified classification algorithm, SPRINT yields classification trees with useful prediction accuracy. The case study used comprises of software metrics and fault data collected over four releases from a very large telecommunications system. It is observed that classification trees built by SPRINT are more balanced and demonstrate better stability in comparison to those built by CART.

IEEE Comp Soc, Informat Technol Res Inst, Wright State Univ				Discovering causal and temporal relations in a system is essential to understanding how it works, and to learning to control the behaviour of the system. TimeSleuth is a causality miner that uses association relations as the basis for the discovery of causal and temporal relations. It does so by introducing time into the observed data. TimeSleuth uses C4.5 as its association discoverer, and by using a series of preprocessing and post-processing techniques to enable the user to try different scenarios for mining causality. The data to be mined should originate sequentially from a single system. TimeSleuth's use of a standard decision tree builder such as C4.5 puts it outside the current mainstream method of discovering causality, which is based on conditional independencies and causal Bayesian Networks. This paper introduces TimeSleuth as a tool, and describes its functionality. TimeSleuth expands the abilities of C4.5 in some important ways. It is an unsupervised tool that can handle and interpret temporal data. It also helps the user in analyzing the relationships among the attributes by enabling him/her to see the rules, and statistics about them, in tabular form. There is also a mechanism to distinguish between causality and acausal relations. The user is thus encouraged to perform experiments and discover the nature of relationships among the data.

The main theme of this paper is the automatic recognition of hand-printed Arabic characters using machine learning. Conventional methods have relied on hand-constructed dictionaries which are tedious to construct and difficult to make tolerant to variation in writing styles. The advantages of machine learning are that it can generalize over the large degree of variation between writing styles and recognition rules can be constructed by example. The system was tested on a sample of handwritten characters from several individuals whose writing ranged from acceptable to poor in quality and the correct average recognition rate obtained using cross-validation was 87.23%.

Like other ensemble methods, its performance depends on the accuracy and diversity of base classifiers. If a decision tree is chosen as base classifier the issue of tree pruning needs to be addressed. In this paper we investigate the effect of six methods of pruning on ensembles of trees generated by Error-Correcting Output Code (ECOC). Our results show that Error-Based Pruning outperforms on most datasets but it is better not to prune than to select a single pruning strategy for all datasets.

Drawing guidance from production knowledge in instructional media, we propose six main narrative structures employed in education and training videos for both motivation and demonstration during learning and practical training. We devise a powerful audio visual feature set, accompanied by a hierarchical decision tree-based classification system to determine and discriminate between these structures. Based on a two-tiered hierarchical model, we demonstrate that we can achieve an accuracy of 84.7% on a comprehensive set of education and training video data.

Sensorless vector control of induction motor drives has attracted researchers' attention for a long One. Nits paper describes a new sensor fault detection method for UPS current and voltage feedback systems. Once a certain sensor fails, then its influence propagates through the whole system and may cause a fatal situation. It is usually difficult to identify a failed sensor observing other sensors' outputs. The proposed detection method uses a fast fuzzy neural network and an immune network. The fast fuzzy neural network roughly but very quickly calculates failure rate of each sensor. Each sensor is represented by an antibody in the immune network and receives the stimulation and suppression from the adjacent sensors (antibodies). The immune network is decomposed into decision tree structure, which has only the forward passes in parallel. The density of each antibody, called as failure origin ratio, is calculated by nonlinear differential equation driven by stimulation, suppression, failure rate and dispassion, presented by Farmer et al. The sensor that shows the highest failure origin ratio is considered as the failed sensor The proposed method is applicable to fault diagnosis for large-scale and complex systems such as multi-UPSs operated in parallel.

In particular, we apply a decision tree learning and a recently developed inductive technique called second-order table compression to generate predictive models of future water inflows of Lake Okeechobee, a primary source of water supply for south Florida. We describe SORCER, a second-order table compression learning system and compares its results with those obtained from a well-established decision tree learner, C4.5. On the average of ten 10-fold cross validations, SORCER obtained a slightly lower error rate than C4.5. We discuss the implication of these results.

Here we present a multi-strategy signal pattern classifier MSPC that can differentiate among large numbers of signal pattern classes with low classification cost. MSPC combines decision tree concepts, fuzzy rules, genetic algorithms and neural networks to achieve its goal. This combination provides powerful classification capabilities with great tuning flexibility for either performance or cost-efficiency. Fuzzy rules measure similarities between signal patterns. A genetic algorithm finds the best fuzzy classification rule. Neural networks are used in the final classification step and in noise elimination. Machine learning concepts are applied to set the overall algorithm parameters.

The approach suggested is to utilize decision tree(s) that capitalize on past experience of probabilistic fault/event tree analysis developed in nuclear industry. A mission concept is formalized in terms of a sequence of event trees linkages and alternatives with probabilities/figures of merit of success and associated R&D costs ascribed at each link. For example, a search for life mission on Europa would involve site reconnaissance, site selection, landing, deep drilling through ice, small autonomous submersibles traversing the purported sea under ice, and in-situ life detection. Many advanced technologies not currently available would be required including long duration survivable systems (power, thermal, radiation), minimal mass autonomous systems (systems-on-a-chip, autonomous safe precision landing), life detection (including planetary protection) and communication of science data (ocean/ice/surface/orbiter/earth). For the Europa case, as an example, an event tree has been prepared in software (which means it is easily manipulated) with a variety of alternative technologies expressed. Mission objectives have been iterated with science teams; technology probabilities and costs at each link have been deduced and documented using information from Office of Space Science databases. These numbers are assumed to be the best estimates at present, which need to be reviewed and updated by NASA domain experts. Once the decision tree has been formulated with associated probabilities/figures of merit and costs at each link, it is easy to show that the proper metric for prioritization per dollar is the derivative which represents the relative change in probability of success at a given link, per change in investment dollar at that link, then divided by the current probability/figure of merit of that link. This is intuitively plausible since one seeks to maximize the change in probability for a unit change in R&D investment, and the smaller the probability of a given link, the more room there is to improve. In this model wherein the mission probability is multiplicative of the probability of all links (i.e. uncorrelated events), the percentage change in any one link propagates linearly to the percentage change in the overall mission probability. Using this metric, one can then prioritize and explain the technology investment strategy to potential R&D sponsors, and have a systematic method for continuing to improve the overall database and gain community consensus. The decision tree approach described, developed for an example long term (e.g. 2025) mission, is amenable to the introduction of time dependence if one is to consider investment strategies for nearer term endeavors, or Programs comprised of time sequences of several projects.

It must realize when it doesn't understand the user and interact to correct the problem. To this end, most systems have some form of confidence assessment mechanism. These algorithms generally estimate confidence on a word-by-word basis and sometimes use these estimates to accept or reject an utterance as a whole. This paper presents the confidence assessment mechanism developed for the CU Communicator spoken dialogue system. The focus of this mechanism is to assess confidence in the semantic representation extracted from an utterance by the system rather than in the string of words produced by the recognizer. We use a decision tree classifier with features based on acoustic models, language models, word lattice density, parser output and dialogue context. The classification performance is evaluated on a test set from the CU Communicator data. CU Communicator is a telephone based spoken dialogue system for getting information on air travel, hotels and rental cars.

We also show that automatic question generation can be used to completely eliminate any manual effort. We present experimental results on four corpora with different languages, namely the Dutch ARISE corpus, the Italian EUTRANS EVAL00 evaluation corpus, the German VERBMOBIL '00 development corpus and the English North American Business '94 20k and 64k development corpora. For all experiments, the acoustic models are trained from scratch in order not to use any prior phonetic knowledge. Complete training procedures have been iterated to simulate the long optimization history used for the phonemic acoustic models. With minimal manual effort we show that for the Dutch, German and Italian corpora, the presented approach works surprisingly well and increases the word error rate by not more than 2% relative. On the English NAB task the error rate is about 20% higher compared to experiments using a pronunciation lexicon.

To prevent over-large tree models, the stopping criterion is required to suppress tree growing. It is crucial to exploit the goodness-of-split criteria to choose the best questions for node splitting and test if the hypothesis of splitting should be terminated, The robust tree models could be established. In this study, we apply the Hubert's Gamma statistic as the node splitting criterion and the T-2-statistic as the stopping criterion. Hubert's Gamma statistic is a cluster validity measure, which characterizes the degree of clustering in the available data. This measure is useful to select the best questions to unravel tree nodes. Further, we examine the population closeness of two child nodes with a significant level. T-2-statistic is determined to validate whether the corresponding mean vectors are close together. The splitting is stopped when validated. In continuous speech recognition experiments, the proposed methods achieve better recognition rates with smaller tree models compared to the maximum likelihood and minimum description length criteria.

The loss of significant rules leads to a loss in accuracy. On the other hand, the fragmentation problem causes a decision tree to contain too many minor rules. The presence of minor rules decreases accuracy. We propose to use emerging patterns to solve these problems. In our approach, many globally significant rules can be discovered. Extensive experimental results on gene expression datasets show that our approach are more accurate than single C4.5 trees, and are also better than bagged or boosted C4.5 trees.

Motivated from the success of wavelet denoising techniques in image data, we explore a general solution to alleviate the effect of noisy data by wavelet preprocessing for medical/biological data classification. Our experiments are divided into two categories: one is of different classification algorithms on a specific database (Ecoli [6]) and the other is of a specific classification algorithm (decision tree) on different databases. The experiment results show that the wavelet denoising of noisy data is able to improve the accuracies of those classification methods, if the localities of the attributes are strong enough.

Methods have been proposed for visual attention control based on information criterion[3, 4]. However, the robot had to stop walking for observation and decision. This paper presents a method which enables observation and decision more efficiently and adaptively while it is walking. The method uses the expected information gain from future observations for attention control and action decision. It also proposes an image compensation method to handle the image changes due to the robot motion. Both are used to estimate observation probabilities from the observation while it is walking and then action probabilities are estimated from a decision tree based on the information criterion. The Method is applied to a four legged robot. Discussions on the visual attention control in the method and the future issues are given.

A mobile robot plans its sensor actions to localize itself using Bayesian network inference. The system differs from traditional methods such as simple Bayesian decision or top-down action selection based on a decision tree. In contrast, we represent the contextual relation between the local sensing results and beliefs about the global localization using Bayesian networks. Inference of the Bayesian network allows us to classify ambiguous positions of the mobile robot when the local sensing evidences are obtained. By taking into account the trade-off between the global localization belief degree and local sensing cost, we define an integrated utility function to decide the local sensing range, and obtain an optimal sensing plan and an optimal Bayesian network structure based on this function. We have conducted simulation and real robot experiments to validate our planning concept.	Chuo Univ, Tokyo 112, Japan	Zhou, H (reprint author), Chuo Univ, Tokyo 112, Japan.

We choose the battle position though training support vector machine (SVM). We give firstly the method of two-class classification by means of SVM. Choosing of battle position is a problem of multi-class classification, so we adopt "divide and conquer" approach to train the data set. We use recursivly SVM until the result meets the condition of battle position. In the course of training the data, we use one-against-one and the decision tree methods. Using the schemes, we select the suited battle position and get better effect.

In this paper, we present a multisplitting algorithm, RCAT, for continuous attributes based on statistic information. When calculating information gain for a continuous attribute, it splits the value range of the attribute into some initial intervals at first; secondly it computes the probability estimation of every class at each interval, and finds the best threshold in the probability space; thirdly this threshold separates the initial intervals into two sets, combines adjacent intervals in the same set, then optimizes the boundary of every combined interval, and gets the information gain of the continuous attribute in the end. We also provide a pruning method to simplify the decision trees; empirical results show that RCAT algorithm can get decision trees with much higher intelligibility than C4.5 while retaining their accuracy.

During these years, ID3 algorithm has been in the highest flight in decision tree. ID3 makes use of information entropy as heuristic to select "excellent attribution" at each node, so it can get smaller depth but not the proper width of the tree. That is to say that if the width is large, no matter what small of decision tree is, the leaf node will not be small. It is very important that smaller nodes get higher classify precision for decision tree. This paper provides two algorithms, which can avoid the deficiency of ID3 and reduce the width of the tree to get the better result, the one is PID based on probability, and the other one is EMID based on entropy.

The entire process of building FDT is based on a specified parameter (called significant level) which seriously affects the computation of fuzzy entropy and classification result of FDT. Since the value of this parameter is usually given in terms of human experience while building a FDT, it is very difficult to determine its optimal value. This paper makes an attempt to give some guidelines for how to automatically choose the optimal value of this parameter by analyzing analytic expression between this parameter an fuzzy entropy and further by investigating the decision tree's sensitivity to the parameter perturbation.

The traditional decision tree, which is represented by ID3 proposed by Quinlan in 1986, can solve the classification problems very well. But when the number of class increases, the single decision tree produced by ID3 turns to be complicated and less general. This paper uses the hierarchical decomposition method to deal with multi-class problems by producing the multi-level decision trees. Compared with the single decision tree, the decision tree based on hierarchical decomposition has more advantages in handling the multi-class problems.

In this article, we introduce a new heuristic algorithm for decision tree generation based on the importance of attribute contributing to the classification, and apply the algorithm to several crisp databases. When the expanded attribute is selected in a specified node, we may have two choices, i.e., sensitive and insensitive attribute. Usually the sensitive attribute is selected for branching the node, but the insensitive attribute is ignored. We compare the two methods from robustness aspects by conducting experiments on several databases, in which the ID3's robustness is included too. Them result indicates the insensitive method is the most robust one.

Fuzzy decision tree is popular in dealing with the ambiguity and vagueness associated with human thinking. The generalization capability of decision tree, which is also called the predictive capability, is one of the most important indexes to judge whether a decision tree generation algorithm is good. The stronger the generalization is, the higher the prediction accuracy is. In practical applications, the generalization capability of decision tree algorithm directly affects the accuracy of decision-making. However, so far, nobody gives a comparison study between the generalization capabilities of fuzzy and crisp decision tree algorithms. This paper makes an attempt to compare the generalization capability of fuzzy and crisp decision trees in three aspects. It aims to provide some useful guidelines for selecting either a crisp or a fuzzy algorithm while decision tree induction is applicable to real problems.

In the viseme Hidden Markov Model (HMM) training, the instances of a viseme with different contexts are formulated as trisemes. Based on the mouth shape parameters Liprounding and the defined viseme similarity weight (VSW) from the 3D viseme facial models, 166 questions concerning the viseme contexts are designed to build triseme decision trees to tie the states of the trisemes with similar contexts, so that they can share the same parameters. To evaluate the system performance, the image related measurements are also taken to evaluate the resulting viseme sequences, with 'jerky instances' in Liprounding and VSW graphs evaluating their smoothness. Results show that compared to the phoneme based system, the tied-state triseme based speech recognition system gives talking head animation with smoother and more plausible mouth shapes.

The fundamental objective of ordinal classification is to create an ordering in the universe of discourse. As such, a decision tree for ordinal classification should aim at producing an ordering which is most consistent with the implicit ordering in the input data. Ordinal classification problems are often dealt with by treating ordinal classes as nominal classes, or by representing the classes as values on a quantitative scale. Such approaches may not lead to the most desirable results since the methods do not fit the type of data, viz. ordinal data, concerned. In this paper, we propose a new measure for assessing the quality of output from an ordinal classification approach. We also propose an induction method to generate an ordinal decision tree for ordinal classification based on this quality perspective. We demonstrate the advantage of our method using results from a set of experiments.

These methods are applied to discover meaningful knowledge from large databases, which shows they, are useful. However since there has been no formal approach proposed to treat these methods, efficiency, of each method is only, compared empirically. In this paper, we introduce matroid theory, and rough sets to construct a common framework for empirical machine learning methods which induce the combination of attribute-value pairs from databases. Combination of the concepts of rough sets and matroid theory gives us an excellent set-theoretical framework and enables its to understand the differences and the similarities between these methods from the viewpoint of partitions of the universe.

We cast the problem of learning the contexts for the linguistic operations as classification tasks, and apply straightforward machine learning techniques, such as decision tree learning. The training data consist of linguistic features extracted from syntactic and semantic representations produced by a linguistic analysis system. The target features are extracted from links to surface syntax trees. Our evidence consists of four examples from the German sentence realization system code-named Amalgam: case assignment, assignment of verb position features, extraposition, and syntactic aggregation.

In particular, we explore the use of probabilistic decision tree within the clustering framework to account for the variation as well as regularity in human created summaries. The corpus of human created extracts is created from a newspaper corpus and used as a test set. We build probabilistic decision trees of different flavors and integrate each of them with the clustering framework. Experiments with the corpus demonstrate that the mixture of the two paradigms generally gives a significant boost in performance compared to cases where either of the two is considered alone.

Each product requires several kinds of raw materials and normally the precise ingredients are not known. The scientific process for finding the relationship between raw materials and product qualities increase production costs. Laboratory tests for checking these relationships in any low cost products may not be cost effective. Instead, many SMEs use their experiences in production. So, they generally have a few experts whose experiences are not transferable, mainly because of the recipe secrecy and its complexities. Thus, to help find a recipe, this project has used the decision tree approach to classify and extract knowledge from existing data in a sample factory. We built a prototype and cross checked with the factory expert and found that most recipes from the model are acceptable for production. Keywords.

This decay channel is considered as a discovery channel for Higgs scenarios for Higgs boson masses in the range 80 - 130 GeV.

Parameters of these neural networks are randomly generated and population of predefined size of those networks is learned to get initial generation for the following genetic algorithm optimization process. A genetic algorithm principles are used to tune parameters of further neural network individuals derived from previous neural networks by GA operations of crossover and mutation. The goal of this GA process is optimization of the final neural network performance. Our results show that NN approach is applicable to the problem of Higgs boson detection. Neural network filters can be used to emphasize difference of M-bb distribution for events accepted by filter (with better (signal)/(background) rate) and M-bb distribution for original events (with original (signal)/(background) rate). This improvement of the shape of M-bb distribution can be used as a criterion of existence of Higgs boson decay in considered discovery channel.

Association rule mining has been used for anomaly detection and decision tree learning has been used for misuse detection. While association rule mining tries to derive multi-feature correlations from a database table, decision tree learning partitions class-labelled training instances with a tree to build a learning model. Intrusion detection systems employing these techniques have their own limitations. The goal of this work is to propose a new framework for intrusion detection that will combine association rule mining and the decision tree learning. The new framework, is implemented and tested with the DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Data. Experimental results are reported to compare its performance With a misuse detection system built with decision trees only.

Word frequencies change due to time-series variation over given periods of time. An early method estimated automatically stability classes (increasing, relatively constant, and decreasing) that indicate word popularity due to time-series variation based on frequency changes in text data over given periods using a decision tree. At first, learning data was produced by defining five attributes to measure frequency change of word quantitatively, these five attributes were extracted automatically from electronic texts. These learning data was manually (Human) classified into three stability classes. Then, these data was subjected to a decision tree to determine automatically stability classes of analysis data (test data). But, The estimation precision of the decision tree decreases when there is scattering of data number among classes. So, this paper suggests a new way to use Random Sampling Method and proposes new Data Copying Method to improve the estimation precision of decision tree. By using this new Data Copying Method, F-measures have improved than previous method in the three stability classes and it has become: Increasing Class = 0.937, Relatively Constant Class = 0.944, and Decreasing Class = 0.943.

Each product requires several kinds of raw materials and normally the precise ingredients are not known. The scientific process for finding the relationship between raw materials and product qualities increase production costs. Laboratory tests for checking these relationships in any low cost products may not be cost effective. Instead, many SMEs use their experiences in production. So, they generally have a few experts whose experiences are not transferable, mainly because of the recipe secrecy and its complexities. Thus, to help find a recipe, this project has used the decision tree approach to classify and extract knowledge from existing data in a sample factory. We built a prototype and cross checked with the factory expert and found that most recipes from the model are acceptable for production. Keywords.

Each team consists of three players, one of them is the goalkeeper. Robots have to be controlled remotely from the host computer. The color camera connected to the computer is used for gaining the information about the position of individual players and the orange golf ball. The match between two teams (each having its own camera and computer) is running without human intervence, with the exception of foul or stalemate situations, when the game is interrupted and a standard situation, such as free kick or penalty kick is called. Paper discusses micro robot control electronics based on single-chip microcontroller with specialized DC motor controllers. Algorithms for fast image processing and object recognition are presented, A real time vector field based path planning for attack and defense robot is described. Artificial intelligence is realized using the decision tree algorithm.

J	Mehta, D; Raghavan, V				Mehta, D; Raghavan, V			Decision tree approximations of Boolean functions	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						decision trees; representations of Boolean functions; learning theory; algorithms	RAZOR	Decision trees are popular representations of Boolean functions. We show that, given an alternative representation of a Boolean function f, say as a read-once branching program, one can find a decision tree T which approximates f to any desired amount of accuracy. Moreover, the size of the decision tree is at most that of the smallest decision tree which can represent f and this construction can be obtained in quasi-polynomial time. We also extend this result to the case where one has access only to a source of random evaluations of the Boolean function f instead of a complete representation. In this case, we show that a similar approximation can be obtained with any specified amount of confidence (as opposed to the absolute certainty of the former case.) This latter result implies proper PAC-learnability of decision trees under the uniform distribution without using membership queries. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper focuses on the adoption of production rules produced by decision tree techniques to the cognitive model of expert's control practice. The applied algorithms to obtain a quasi-optimal rule set as a model of the intentional representation of the expert knowledge is presented and tested on real world applications (printed circuit board, foil and brake pad production).

We regard decision tree computation as a communication process in which the oracle and the computer exchange several rounds of messages, each round consisting of O(log n) bits. Let E(f) be the Shannon entropy of the random variable f (X), where X is taken uniformly random in f's domain. Our main result is that it takes n (E (f)) queries to compute any total function f. It is interesting to contrast this bound with the Omega (E (f)/log n) bound, which is tight for some partial functions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: A computational model (kinetically tailored treatment, or KITT model) is developed to predict drug combinations, doses, and schedules likely to be effective in reducing tumor size and prolonging patient life. Treatment strategies may be tailored to individuals based on tumor cell kinetics. The model incorporates intra-tumor heterogeneity and evolution of drug resistance, apoptotic rates, and cell division rates. Tumor growth may follow an exponential or a Gompertzian trajectory. Drug pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic models are used. Toxicity is modeled in several ways. Results: A key prediction of KITT is that including cytostatic drugs like tamoxifen and herceptin during treatment with cytotoxic drugs substantially increases the probability of cure and prolongs patient life. Results also suggest that altering drug scheduling may be more effective but not more toxic than dose escalation. CAF chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, and 5-fluorouracil) is predicted to be more effective than CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil). KITT also suggests that tumors with a high proliferative index (PI) may respond better to drug combinations incorporating two cell-cycle phase-specific drugs than do tumors with a low PI. Tumors with a low PI, in contrast, are predicted to respond better to regimens involving two cell-cycle phase-non-specific drugs than do tumors with a high PI. These predictions are borne out by clinical trial results published in the literature, which are discussed. Simulated predictions of the model match well with results from a clinical trial by Silvestrini et al. (2000. Int. J. Cancer 87, 405). The results of simulating the growth of 26 896 tumors are used to construct a decision tree for prognosis to identify the key tumor and treatment variables. Conclusion: Additional tests of the model are needed in which physicians collect information on apoptotic and proliferative indices, cell-cycle times, and drug resistance from biopsies of each individual's tumor. Computational models may become important tools to help optimize and tailor cancer treatments. (C) 2002 Academic Press.

STUDY DESIGN: A decision-tree model was constructed that used the probabilities and patient outcomes (the results of a trial in Argentina), resource use, cost, and local epidemiologic data from interviews with obstetricians in the selected provinces and from literature reviews. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted, which provided 90% confidence ranges for the cost data. RESULTS: For each low-risk vaginal delivery, there is a potential reduction in provider cost of $20.21 (range, $19.36-$21.09) with a restrictive policy of episiotomy in Santa Fe province and a reduction of $11.63 (range, $10.89-$12.42) in Salta province. CONCLUSION: The more effective policy of restrictive episiotomy is also less costly than that of routine episiotomy. The results are robust and consistent in both provinces. Further research is required to confirm the appropriate indications for episiotomy and the impact on outcomes of variations in epislotomy cost rates.

METHODS: A MEDLINE literature search from 1966 to July 2000 was performed to identify relevant randomized, controlled trials (RCTs), as well as cohort and retrospective case-control studies. A decision tree was built representing the choice to use or not use indomethacin, and the potential outcome costs. Probabilities of being in each chance node were obtained from this search. Where data probabilities were not clear, a sensitivity analysis was conducted. RESULTS: There was no difference in the expected survival per year; however, there was a significant difference when effectiveness was measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), resulting in 11 and 10 years for the indomethacin and control groups, respectively. The indomethacin treatment cost was $95 157 and that of the control groups was $99 955. The cost effectiveness per life expectancy of being in the indomethacin and control groups was $7142 and $7727, respectively. The sensitivity analysis for PDA closure and prevention of IVH for infants eventually developing PDA versus those without PDA showed no difference. The cost-effectiveness analysis per QALY was $8443 for the indomethacin treatment and $9168 for the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The prophylactic use of indomethacin is less costly and more effective within an important range of certainty. However, this analysis does not include several potentially confounding factors, such as antenatal steroid use or indomethacin-induced renal toxicity.

Of the 100 10-mer random primers and 100 intersimple-sequence repeat (ISSR) primers screened, five provided markers specific to the Super Shrimp population and three provided markers specific to the wild caught population. The two populations were further characterized for relative viral load (reported as cycle threshold, C-T) using real-time quantitative PCR with primers specific to the IHHNV genome. The beta-actin gene was amplified to serve as a control for normalization of the IHHNV viral load. The mean viral load was significantly lower (C-T = 34.58; equivalent to 3.3 x 10(1) copies of IHHNV genome/ng DNA) in Super Shrimp than in the wild caught population (C-T = 23.49; equivalent to 4.2 x 10(4) copies/ng DNA; P < 0.001; C-T values are inversely related to viral load). A preliminary prediction model was created with Classification and Regression Tree (CART) software (Salford Systems, San Diego, Calif.), where the resultant decision tree uses the presence or absence of seven RAPD markers as predictors of the relative viral load.

J	Braha, D; Shmilovici, A				Braha, D; Shmilovici, A			Data mining for improving a cleaning process in the semiconductor industry	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING			English	Article						composite classifiers; data mining; laser cleaning; machine learning	YIELD	As device geometry continues to shrink, micro-contaminants have an increasingly negative impact on yield. By diminishing the contamination problem, semiconductor manufacturers will significantly improve the wafer yield. This paper presents a comprehensive and successful application of data mining methodologies to the refinement of a new dry cleaning technology that utilizes a laser beam for the removal of micro-contaminants. Experiments with three classification-based data mining methods (decision tree induction, neural networks, and composite classifiers) have been conducted. The composite classifier architecture has been shown to yield higher accuracy than the accuracy of each individual classifier on its own. The paper suggests that data mining methodologies may be particularly useful when data is scarce, and the various physical and chemical parameters that affect the process exhibit highly complex interactions. Another implication is that on-line monitoring of the cleaning process using data mining may be highly effective.

It was found competitive with the best available machine learning algorithms in classifying high-dimensional data sets. This paper gives an introduction to the theoretical development of the SVM and an experimental evaluation of its accuracy, stability and training speed in deriving land cover classifications from satellite images. The SVM was compared to three other popular classifiers, including the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), neural network classifiers (NNC) and decision tree classifiers (DTC). The impacts of kernel configuration on the performance of the SVM and of the selection of training data and input variables on the four classifiers were also evaluated in this experiment.

J	Mansour, Y; McAllester, D				Mansour, Y; McAllester, D			Boosting using branching programs	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER AND SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th Annual Conference on Computational Learning Theory (COLT 2000)	JUN 28-JUL 01, 2000	PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA					It is known that decision tree learning can be viewed as a form of boosting. Given a weak learning hypothesis one can show that the training error of a decision tree declines as \T\(-beta) where \T\ is the size of the decision tree and beta is a constant determined by the weak learning hypothesis. Here we consider the case of decision DAGs-decision trees in which a given node can be shared by different branches of the tree, also called branching programs (BP). Node sharing allows a branching program to be exponentially more compact than the corresponding decision tree. We show that under the same weak learning assumption used for decision tree learning there exists a greedy BP-growth algorithm whose training error is guaranteed to decline as 2(-beta root\T\), where \T\ is the size of the branching program and beta is a constant determined by the weak learning hypothesis. Therefore, from the perspective of boosting theory, branching programs are exponentially more efficient than decision trees, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

This study estimates clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of lamivudine compared with other treatment scenarios for CHB, from an Australian health-care provider perspective. Methods: A two-step modeling approach depicted clinical progression of hepatitis B in hypothetical patient cohorts using three different treatment scenarios: scenario A, lamivudine and alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha) available; scenario B, IFN-alpha available only; and scenario C, no treatment available. Assumptions were based on clinical trials, published studies, a hepatologist's questionnaire and an expert panel follow up. One-year clinical outcomes and costs were estimated using a decision tree, while lifetime costs and outcomes were estimated using available clinical trial data for lamivudine (up to 4 years therapy duration) and a Markov model. Results: The analysis considered only patients with pretreatment elevated alanine aminotransferase levels greater than or equal to 2 x upper limit of normal. In the short term, the introduction of lamivudine is expected to result in almost 3.5 times more CHB patients receiving therapy (lamivudine or IFN-alpha) compared to IFN-alpha only (67% compared to 20%, respectively). Hence, scenario A subsequently doubled the seroconversion rate. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $A3341 per additional seroconversion. Also, non-seroconverted lamivudine patients are less likely to progress to cirrhosis than those receiving IFN-alpha/no treatment. One-year progression to cirrhosis was estimated at 5.1% with scenario A, compared to 12.2% and 12.7%, scenarios B and C, respectively. From the long-term analysis, lamivudine is expected to increase life expectancy by years and reduce the lifetime risk of compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma by 6%, 12% and 12%, respectively. Additionally, the introduction of lamivudine decreases lifetime costs by $548, thus making it a cost-saving and life-extending strategy. In both short- and long-term models, worst case scenarios in sensitivity analyses still associate lamivudine with a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio. Conclusion: Introduction of lamivudine is expected to improve health outcomes in CHB patients, resulting in overall savings in health-care costs. In this model, compared with IFN-alpha only and no treatment, lamivudine allowed more CHB patients to be treated, increased the seroconversion rate, delayed disease progression and prolonged life expectancy.

Growing evidence indicates that appropriate incorporation of PET into the clinical work-up can improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy with respect to Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the geriatric population. The precise diagnostic role of PET and its economic impact in this context, however, have not been systematically examined previously. Methods: We compared the relative value of 2 strategies for assessing whether early AD is responsible for cognitive symptoms in geriatric patients: (a) a conventional approach, based largely on establishing clinical criteria for the presence of dementia and excluding non-AD etiologies that could contribute to the patient's symptoms, and (b) a proposed approach using PET to examine regional cerebral metabolism and look for characteristic patterns of abnormal metabolism. The total costs (measured in dollars) and benefits (measured in number of accurate diagnoses) of diagnostic testing and clinical outcomes accruing to each strategy were calculated using formalized tools of decision analysis. The primary outcome measure by which the strategies were compared was the ratio of costs to benefits obtained following each approach. Results: Following the proposed approach led to improved accuracy in identifying early AD, without adding to the overall costs of diagnosis and treatment ($3,433 vs. $3,564 per patient approached by the proposed or conventional algorithm, respectively). The strategy making use of PET was associated with a reduced rate of false-negative and false-positive findings compared with the conventional approach (3.1% vs. 8.2% and 12.0% vs. 23.0%, respectively, at a prevalence of 51.6% in the studied symptomatic population) and a cost savings of $1,138 per correct diagnosis rendered ($4,047 vs. $5,185). The lower cost per unit benefit for the proposed strategy was maintained over a wide range of tested values for variables of sensitivity, specificity, costs of PET and long-term care, and varying approaches to the use of structural neuroimaging. Conclusion: Appropriate use of PET for evaluating early dementia in geriatric patients can add valuable information to the clinical work-up, without adding to the overall costs of evaluation and management, resulting in a greater number of patients being accurately diagnosed for the same level of financial expenditure. Thus, the opportunity exists for diminishing the morbidity of dementia economically, with earlier institution of more appropriate management in evaluated patients.

The objective of the current study was to assess rigorously whether serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) determination can eliminate the need for bone scans in Japanese patients with newly diagnosed prostate carcinoma with serum PSA levels less than or equal to 10 ng/mL. METHODS. A retrospective assessment of 1294 patients with newly diagnosed, untreated prostate carcinoma was conducted at the authors' institutions. All patients underwent a bone scan, serum PSA measurement, and core needle biopsy the prostate. The receiver operating characteristic curve for identifying a positive bone scan based on serum PSA levels and a decision tree were analyzed to determine the expected 10-year cumulative cost and disease specific survival rate. Two. competing strategies were used: PSA alone and PSA plus baseline bone scan. For the PSA-alone strategy, a baseline bone scan was performed only when the patient had a serum PSA level > 10 ng/mL. RESULTS. The proportion of positive bone scans in patients with serum PSA levels less than or equal to 10.0 ng/mL was 1.33%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.870. Patients with a Gleason Grade greater than or equal to 3 tumors or with a Gleason score 7 had a higher proportion of positive bone scans. The 10-year disease specific survival rates with the PSA-alone strategy and the PSA-plus-bone-scan strategy were the same. The PSA-alone strategy was minimally cost effective, with a savings. of $16.00 (U.S.) in the cumulative net cost per patient over the PSA-plus-bone-scan strategy. CONCLUSIONS. The current results suggest that baseline bone scans can be eliminated in patients with newly diagnosed prostate carcinoma in Japan who have serum PSA levels less than or equal to 10 ng/mL.

For the property of containing a subgraph isomorphic to a fixed graph, and a fairly large class of related n-vertex graph properties, we show evasiveness for an arithmetic progression of values of n. This implies a 1/2n(2)-O (n) lower bound on the decision tree complexity of these properties. We prove that properties that are preserved under taking graph minors are evasive for all sufficiently large n. This greatly generalizes a theorem due to Best, van Emde Boas, and Lenstra [A Sharpened Version of the Aanderaa-Rosenberg Conjecture, Report ZW 30/74, Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 1974] which states that planarity is evasive. We prove a similar result for bipartite subgraph containment.

One design decision is whether to use simple "weak learners" such as decision tree stumps or more complicated weak learners such as large decision trees or neural networks. Another design decision is the training algorithm for the constituent weak learners. Here we concentrate on binary decision trees and show that the best results are obtained using the Z-criterion to build the trees without pruning. In using neural networks, early stopping is recommended as an approach to lower the training time. In examining the multi-class boosting algorithms, the jury is still out on whether using the all-pairs binary learning algorithm or pseudo-loss is better. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Design: Twenty-two volunteer subjects with spinal cord injuries at a tertiary care outpatient and inpatient spinal cord injury rehabilitation center affiliated with a university were recruited for this study. Results: A decision tree in which V-MAS scores were obtained was developed. The data obtained from three independent raters, when adjusted by means of the V-MAS, showed an excellent interrater reliability. Conclusions: Results indicated that the V-MAS is a more reliable measure. In addition, the resulting units of the V-MAS, ranging from 0 to 1, are of the same form as pendulum test data. The V-MAS method is quite simple to use because the rater need only measure the angular range and duration of the passive movement to calculate average velocity during the MAS assessment in addition to the normal MAS rating of muscle tone.

Design: Correlational analyses and chi-squares were used to examine the influence of demographic variables on MLDT performance and the test-retest reliability of its cognitive and affective components. Setting: Rehabilitation unit of a large, freestanding, urban hospital. Participants: In study 1, 39 older, medical rehabilitation patients consecutively referred to the neuropsychology service. In study 2, 57 older, consecutively admitted medical rehabilitation patients. Interventions: In study 1, patients underwent testing with the MLDT by a novice examiner. In study 2, patients were tested by trained examiners. Both sets of results were compared with those obtained by experienced examiners. Main Outcome Measures: The temporal stability of participants' performance on the cognitive and affective components of the MLDT was compared between the 2 studies. Results: Training was associated with high test-retest reliability on both the cognitive and affective components. A lack of training was associated with reduced reliability in depression screening. Conclusion: These findings support the use of the MLDT as a mental health triage tool for older adults in inpatient medical settings. Its use is dependent on training and accurate administration.

An algorithm of decision-tree (DT) classification which includes several classifiers based on the spectral responding characteristics of water bodies and other objects, was developed and put forward to delineate water bodies. Another algorithm of decision-tree classification based on both spectral characteristics and auxiliary information of DEM and slope (DTDS) was also designed for water bodies extraction. In addition, supervised classification method of maximum-likelyhood classification (MLC), and unsupervised method of interactive self-organizing dada analysis technique (ISODATA) were used to extract waterbodies for comparison purpose. An index was designed and used to assess the accuracy of different methods adopted in the research. Results have shown that water extraction accuracy was variable with respect to the various techniques applied. It was low using ISODATA, very high using DT algorithm and much higher using both DTDS and MLC.

We study time complexity of decision trees which compute values of all observable variables from BN. We consider (1,2)-BN in which each node has at most I entering edge, and each variable has at most 2 values. For an arbitrary (1,2)-BN we obtain lower and upper bounds on minimal depth of decision tree that differ not more than by a factor of 4, and can be computed by an algorithm which has polynomial time complexity. The number of nodes in considered decision trees can grow as exponential on number of observable variables in BN. We develop an polynomial algorithm for simulation of the work of decision trees which depth lies between the obtained bounds.

J	Atlam, ES; Okada, M; Shishibori, M; Aoe, J				Atlam, ES; Okada, M; Shishibori, M; Aoe, J			An evaluation method of words tendency depending on time-series variation and its improvements	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						time-series variation; words popularity; decision tree; CNN newspaper		In every text, some words have frequency appearance and are considered as keywords because they have a strong relationship with the subjects of their texts, these words' frequencies change with time-series variation in a given period. However, in traditional text dealing methods and text search techniques, the importance of frequency change with time-series variation is not considered. Therefore, traditional methods could not correctly determine the index of word's popularity in a given period. In this paper, a new method is proposed to estimate automatically the stability classes (increasing, relatively constant, and decreasing) that indicate word's popularity with time-series variation based on the frequency change in past text data. At first, learning data were produced by defining five attributes to measure the frequency change of a word quantitatively. These five attributes were extracted automatically from electronic texts. These learning data were manual (human) classified into three stability classes. Then, these data were subjected to a decision tree to determine automatically stability classes of analysis data (test data). For learning data, we obtained the attribute values of 443 proper nouns that were extracted from 2216 articles of CNN newspapers (19971999) that discussed professional baseball. For testing data, 472 proper nouns that were extracted from 972 articles of CNN newspaper (1997-2000) then classified them automatically using decision tree. According to the comparison between the evaluation of the decision tree results and manually (human) results, F-measures of increasing, relatively constant and decreasing classes were 0.847, 0.851, and 0.768, respectively, and the effectiveness of this method is achieved.

Both accuracy and stability can be improved by learning multiple models from boot-strap samples of training data, but the "meta-learner" approach makes the extracted knowledge hardly interpretable. In the following paper, we present the Info-Fuzzy Network (IFN), a novel information-theoretic method for building stable and comprehensible decision-tree models. The stability of the IFN algorithm is ensured by restricting the tree structure to using the same feature for all nodes of the same tree level and by the built-in statistical significance tests. The IFN method is shown empirically to produce more compact and stable models than the "meta-learner" techniques, while preserving a reasonable level of predictive accuracy.

By use of sample processors, like the ASTED system, such bioanalytical methods can be fully automated, the dialysis and trace enrichment steps being directly coupled to LC. In order to facilitate the development of such automated methods, a strategy based on a decision tree has been elaborated. After the selection of appropriate conditions for the LC analysis, the decision tree provides information about suggested starting conditions and guidelines for the optimisation of the most important parameters likely to influence analyte recovery and method selectivity. The plasma samples are dialysed on a cellulose acetate membrane in the static-pulsed mode and the dialysate is enriched on a trace enrichment pre-column packed with octadecyl silica or with a strong cation-exchange material. This decision tree is until now restricted to the analysis of basic drugs in plasma. In order to demonstrate the applicability of this method development strategy, an automated procedure based on the coupling of dialysis with trace enrichment has been developed for the LC determination of antifungal agents (clotrimazole, econazole and miconazole) in plasma.

Patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) have a high risk for rethrombosis. Anticoagulation with warfarin and aspirin reduces the frequency of recurrences. No universally accepted approach regarding the duration and intensity of antithrombotic therapy exists. We investigated the best antithrombotic regimen for patients with APS after the first deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Methods. We identified 6 anticoagulation regimens used in such patients, the rates of morbidity and mortality associated with bleeding, and the rates of recurrent thrombosis associated with APS by literature search. A decision tree was developed and the expected risks and benefits of each anticoagulation regimen were assessed at 2 different dine points: at one year and again 4 years after the initial thrombosis. Results. Based on the decision analysis, longterm warfarin alone at an international normalization ratio (INR) between 3.0 and 4.0 had the highest expected utility of the 6 antithrombotic regimens, both one year and 4 years after the initial venous thrombotic event. Short term anticoagulation for only 6 months is less beneficial. Combination therapy of warfarin and aspirin (ASA) does not offer an improvement in the expected utility over warfarin alone. Conclusion. Although the applicability of this analysis to clinical decision-making is not entirely clear, patients with APS presenting with DVT appear to benefit from longterm warfarin (INR 3.0-4.0) that may be superior to warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0). Short term warfarin therapy seems to be less beneficial and the use of ASA does not offer a clear additional benefit. Randomized controlled trials are needed to provide a better basis for recommendations for the treatment APS.

Materials and Methods: Five patients underwent retroperitoneoscopic management of a symptomatic, stone bearing caliceal diverticulum. Techniques for intraoperative localization of the stone bearing diverticulum included retrograde injection of indigo carmine, fluoroscopy and/or laparoscopic ultrasound. In 2 cases the patent neck of the diverticulum was sutured via laparoscopy. Results: Complete stone clearance and obliteration of the diverticular cavity was achieved in all cases without any open conversion. Mean operative time was 133.8 minutes. Mean estimated blood loss was less than 50 cc in 4 cases and 150 cc in 1. Mean hospital stay was 36 hours. There were no laparoscopic or postoperative complications. Conclusions: The laparoscopic approach to symptomatic caliceal diverticula represents an effective and minimally invasive modality for complete clearance of the stone burden and definitive management of the anatomical abnormality. However, patient selection is paramount. We reserve the laparoscopic approach for symptomatic caliceal diverticula with thin overlying renal parenchyma, or for anterior lesions inaccessible to or unsuccessfully managed by endourological techniques. A decision tree algorithm for managing symptomatic caliceal diverticular calculi is proposed.

J	Liao, SY; Wang, HQ; Liao, LJ				Liao, SY; Wang, HQ; Liao, LJ			An extended formalism to constraint logic programming for decision analysis	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						constraint logic programming; decision support systems; decision tree analysis; decision analysis	OPTIMIZATION; LANGUAGE; FRAMEWORK; NEWTON; TREES; RISK; CLP	While constraint logic programming (CLP) is becoming a favorite tool for decision support systems (DSS), its utility to DSS is limited due to the lack of decision theoretic analysis capability. The combination of CLP with decision theoretic analysis is therefore necessary for more fruitful CLP applications to DSS. In this paper, we propose a framework which embeds decision tree analysis into CLP. The framework provides an integrated representation of decision problems with logic, constraints, probability, and utility. The benefits are threefold. The first is to offer an integrated representation and reasoning mechanism for general knowledge-based decision analysis problems. The second is to provide support to automatic or computer-aided construction of decision trees from the declarative representation of decision problems so that a decision maker can get an intuitive decision scenario from decision trees without manual labor. Last of all, the mechanism of constraint propagation provided by CLP significantly reduces the complexity of decision trees by removing infeasible solutions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, as uncertainties in the data and missing values existed, a fuzzy rule extraction algorithm based on a fuzzy min-max neural network (FMMNN) was used. The performance of a multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) trained with the error back-propagation algorithm (BP), the decision tree algorithm ID3, nearest neighbour and the original fuzzy min-max neural network were also evaluated. The results showed that two fuzzy decision rules on only six features achieved an accuracy of 84.6% (89.9% for low-grade and 76.6% for high-grade cases). Investigations with the proposed algorithm revealed that age, mass effect, oedema, post-contrast enhancement, blood supply, calcification, haemorrhage and the signal intensity of the T1-weighted image were important diagnostic factors.

Currently, this evaluation is largely subjective and is dependent on the quality of the judgement of the individual assessor or expert group. In this paper some general guidelines are presented for a quality assessment procedure. Such a predetermined procedure potentially enhances the consistency among different assessors and assessments and facilitates harmonization of assessment procedures. The guidelines are presented in the context of a decision tree with four decision rules for data quality, i.e. 'availability of occupational hygiene information', 'variability and precision issues', 'internal validity' and 'external validity'. These methodological issues are considered to be the most important aspects of data quality, and will be discussed in this paper. The decision tree eventually results in three quality classes, i.e. exposure data providing sufficient information, supplementary information and data which should be excluded from the exposure assessment process.

Class measurements associated with the Korean yield grade and quality grade were also obtained. Residual standard deviation between ultrasonic estimates and carcass measurements of BFT, LMA were 1.49 nun and 0.96 cm(2). The linear correlation coefficients (p<0.01) between ultrasonic estimates and carcass measurements of BFT, LMA and IF were 0.75, 0.57 and 0.67, respectively Results for improving predictions of yield grade by four methods-the Korean yield grade index equation, fat depth alone, regression and decision tree methods were 75.4%, 79.6%, 64.3% and 81.4%, respectively. We conclude that the decision tree method can easily predict yield grade and is also useful for increasing prediction accuracy rate.

Accurate selection of nuclei for DNA measurement is an important prerequisite for obtaining reliable data. Traditionally, manual selection of nuclei of diagnostic and reference cells is performed by an experienced cytotechnologist. In the present study, a method for the fully automated identification of nuclei of diploid epithelial reference cells in Feulgen- restained Papanicolaou (PAP) smears is described. Methods: The automated procedure consists of a decision tree implemented on the measurement device, containing nodes with feature threshold values and multivariate discriminant functions. Nodes were constructed to recognize debris and inflammatory cells, as well as diploid and nondiploid epithelial cells of the uterine cervix. Evaluation of the classifier was performed by comparing resulting diploid integrated optical densities with those from manually selected reference cells. Results and Conclusion: On average, automatically acquired values deviated 2.4% from manually acquired values, indicating that the method described in this paper may be useful in cytometric practice.

J	Perner, P				Perner, P			Image mining: issues, framework, a generic tool and its application to medical-image diagnosis	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						data mining; image mining; decision-tree induction; knowledge engineering; interactive image analysis; medical image mining; image classification	KNOWLEDGE	A tool and a methodology for data mining in picture-archiving systems are presented. It is intended to discover the relevant knowledge for picture analysis and diagnosis from the data base of image descriptions. Knowledge-engineering methods are used to obtain a list of attributes for symbolic image descriptions. An expert describes images according to this list and stores descriptions in the data base. Digital-image processing can be applied to improve imaging of specific image features, or to get expert-independent feature evaluation. Decision-tree induction is used to learn the expert knowledge, presented in the form of image descriptions in the data base. A constructed decision tree presents effective models of decision-making, which can be learned to support image classification by the expert. A tool for data mining and image processing is presented and its application to image mining is shown on the task of Hep-2 cell-image classification. However, the tool and the methodology are generic and can be used for other image-mining tasks. We applied the developed methodology of data mining in other medical tasks, such as in lung-nodule diagnosis in X-ray images, lymph-node diagnosis in MRI and investigation of breast MRI.

In order to work in the dynamically changing environment, the decision-making system of a soccer robot system should have the features of flexibility and on-line adaptation. This paper proposed a strategy-based decision-making system for a soccer robot system, The decision system is based on the proposed self-organizing fuzzy decision tree (SOFDT). Due to event-driven strategies, the proposed decision-making system has the advantage of flexibility. The proposed SOFDT possesses simple, apparent, and fast generation/reasoning processes. The resultant system is a self-organizing strategy-based decision-making system. According to decision results, SOFDT can on-line modify its parameters and structure for achieving better adaptability and improvement. The performance of the proposed systems was verified by applying them to the simulation and experiment of 3-to-3 robot soccer games. The results are satisfactory. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Tsai, CM; Lee, HJ				Tsai, CM; Lee, HJ			Binarization of color document images via luminance and saturation color features	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						color document; color feature; decision-tree; luminance; name-card; saturation; uniform invoice	THRESHOLDING TECHNIQUES; SEGMENTATION; HISTOGRAMS	This paper presents a novel binarization algorithm for color document images. Conventional thresholding methods do not produce satisfactory binarization results for documents with close or mixed foreground colors and background colors. Initially, statistical image features are extracted from the luminance distribution. Then, a decision-tree based binarization method is proposed, which selects various color features to binarize color document images. First, if the document image colors are concentrated within a limited range, saturation is employed. Second, if the image foreground colors are significant, luminance is adopted. Third, if the image background colors are concentrated within a limited range, luminance is also applied. Fourth, if the total number of pixels with low luminance (less than 60) is limited, saturation is applied; else both luminance and saturation are employed. Our experiments include 519 color images, most of which are uniform invoice and name-card document images. The proposed binarization method generates better results than other available methods in shape and connected-component measurements.

The method is based upon a minimalistic Geometric Probing strategy that hypothesizes the intersection of the object with some selected image point, and searches for additional surface data at locations relative to that point. The strategy is implemented in the discrete domain as a binary decision tree classifier. The tree leaf nodes represent individual voxel templates of the model, with one template per distinct model pose. The internal nodes represent the union of the templates of their descendant leaf nodes. The union of all leaf node templates is the complete template set of the model over its discrete pose space. Each internal node also encodes a single voxel which is the most common element of its child node templates. Traversing the tree is equivalent to efficiently matching the large set of templates at a selected image seed location. The method was implemented and extensive experiments were conducted for a variety of combinations of tree designs and traversals under isolated, cluttered, and occluded scene conditions. The results demonstrated a tradeoff between efficiency and reliability. It was concluded that there exist combinations of tree design and traversal which are both highly efficient and reliable.

The decisions of these rules can be straight-forwardly explained as the conclusions drawn by a case-based reasoner. Our system is named FAN, an acronym for finding accurate inductions. It starts from a collection of training examples and produces propositional rules able to classify unseen cases following a minimum-distance criterion in their evaluation procedure. In this way, we combine the advantages of instance-based algorithms and the conciseness of rule (or decision-tree) inducers, The algorithm followed by FAN can be seen as the result of successive steps of pruning heuristics. The main tool employed is that of the impurity level, a measure of the classification quality of a rule, inspired by a similar measure used in IB3. Finally, a number of experiments were conducted with standard benchmark datasets of the UCI repository to test the performance of our system, successfully comparing FAN with a wide collection of machine-learning algorithms.

We use a decision tree classifier to classify a coastal region of Gabon and describe the feature contribution using the decision tree diagram. The JERS-1 Global Rain Forest Mapping (GRFM) and ERS-1 Central Africa Mosaic Project (CAMP) datasets are used. The result is a land cover map of the west coast of Gabon. The analysis explicitly shows the complementary characteristics of the L- and C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instruments. We demonstrate the usefulness of combined use of L- and C-band data for large area mapping of coastal regions, especially in flooded areas for discrimination of high and low mangroves as well as grasses and tree swamps. The overall classification accuracy increases by 18% over single band classification.

Materials and Methods: A comprehensive literature review was performed to determine the average success rate of each of 3 treatment modalities, namely observation, ureteroscopy and shock wave lithotripsy. Using these success rates decision analysis models were constructed using Data 3.5 software (TreeAge Software, Inc., Williamstown, Massachusetts) to estimate the cost of treatment and followup for each of the 3 treatments. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of varying individual probabilities of success and costs, and 2-way sensitivity analysis was done to evaluate the model for a wide range of potential costs and success rates of ureteroscopy and shock wave lithotripsy. In addition, a table was constructed to enable individual surgeons and institutions to determine the cost impact of ureteroscopy and shock wave lithotripsy in their unique clinical scenarios. Results: Observation was the least costly pathway if no financial cost, such as emergency room visits, was incurred by failed observation. Ureteroscopy was less costly than shock wave lithotripsy for stones at all ureteral locations. A cost difference between the 2 modalities of approximately $1,440, $1,670 and $1,750 was noted for proximal, mid and distal ureteral calculi, respectively. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that the cost of ureteroscopy would have to increase by more than $1,400, $1,700 and $1,850, and the success rate would have to decrease by 28%, 36% and 39% for proximal, mid and distal stones, respectively, before reaching cost equivalence with shock wave lithotripsy. Likewise, the cost of shock wave lithotripsy would have to decrease by more than $1,489 to achieve cost equivalence with ureteroscopy. Overall ureteroscopy was more cost-effective at all stone sites regardless of the success rate of shock wave lithotripsy. Conclusions: Ureteroscopy is the most cost-effective treatment strategy for ureteral stones at all locations after observation fails. The high cost of purchasing and maintaining a lithotriptor is responsible for the high treatment cost associated with shock wave lithotripsy.

J	Faust, MA				Faust, MA			New feeds from genetically modified plants: the US approach to safety for animals and the food chain	LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION SCIENCE			English	Article						biotechnology; feed crops; safety; animal nutrition	CORN; KERNELS	The US regulatory review process for novel crops is accomplished jointly by three federal agencies through a science-based, integrated and multidisciplinary approach, This process assesses safety for inserted genes and recipient plants, potential for allergenicity, integrity for genes, functionality for novel proteins, agronomic characteristics and environmental safety for novel crops, and composition for key nutrients and toxicants for crops and important products. To date, more than 50 crops produced through biotechnology have been approved for commercialization and the vast majority of these have been compositionally comparable to conventional counterparts for nutrient content and known toxicants. Experimental data that are required for the process are clearly defined by a decision-tree approach, and for crops approved to date, feeding studies using livestock have not been required as part of the regulatory process. Further, the United States Food and Drug Administration considers the consumption of DNA to be "Generally Regarded as Safe." Findings from independently conducted studies have indicated no differences for nutrient composition, digestibilities, and animal performance when livestock were fed feedstuffs from conventional and biotech crops. In addition, in independent studies conducted to determine whether transgenic DNA and proteins can be detected in animal products, no transgenic plant-source DNA and proteins have been found in milk, meat, and eggs.

J	Mjahed, M				Mjahed, M			Multivariate decision tree designing for the classification of multi-jet topologies in e(+)e(-) collisions	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						multivariate decision tree; discriminant function; minimal distance; number of jets tagging; efficiency-purity	NEURAL NETWORKS; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; HIGGS-BOSON; SEARCH; QUARK; CLASSIFIERS; PHYSICS; EVENTS; NUMBER; TAG	The binary decision tree method is used to separate between several multi-jet topologies in e(+)e(-) collisions. Instead of the univariate process usually taken, a new design procedure for constructing multivariate decision trees is proposed. The segmentation is obtained by considering some features functions, where linear and non-linear discriminant functions and a minimal distance method are used. The classification focuses on ALEPH simulated events, with multijet topologies. Compared to a standard univariate tree, the multivariate decision trees offer significantly better performance.

Change detection is a remote sensing technique used to monitor and map landcover change between two or more time periods and is now an essential tool in forest management activities. We compared the ability of two linear change enhancement techniques, the Multitemporal Kauth Thomas (MKT) and Multitemporal Spectral Mixture Analysis (MSMA), and two classification techniques, maximum likelihood (NIL) and decision tree (DT), to accurately identify changes in vegetation cover in a southern California study area between 1990 and 1996. Supervised classification accuracy results were high (>70% correct classification for four vegetation change classes and one no-change class) and showed that (1) the DT classification approach outperformed the ML classification approach by similar to 10%, regardless of the enhancement technique used, and (2) using DT classification, MSMA change fractions [i.e., green vegetation (GV), nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), shade, and soil] outperformed MKT change features (i.e., change in brightness, greenness, and wetness) by similar to 5%.

J	Heemskerk, M				Heemskerk, M			Livelihood decision making and environmental degradation: Small-scale gold mining in the Suriname Amazon	SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES			English	Article						Amazon conservation; ethnographic decision-tree modeling; Maroons; rationality; small-scale gold mining; Suriname	MERCURY; EXPOSURE	This study examines why mining booms occur and why some people participate in them while others, living in comparable conditions, do not. Ethnographic data were collected among the Ndjuka Maroons, forest peoples in the Suriname Amazon. The occupational justifications of 41 gold miners and 34 nonminers generated a decision-tree model with a 95.5% prediction rate. The results suggest that decisions about mining are rational given the present economic conditions of both Ndjuka households and of Suriname as a whole. The author argues that environmental awareness campaigns and stricter law enforcement are not likely to encourage more sustainable resource use in Suriname, and probably not in other parts of the Amazon rainforest. Rather, more effective conservation policy would be to promote people-centered development in rural regions through improved public education and health care, while stabilizing national economies.

J	Waggoner, JR				Waggoner, JR			Quantifying the economic impact of 4D seismic projects	SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION & ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2000 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition	OCT 01-04, 2000	DALLAS, TEXAS	Soc Petr Engineers				Time-lapse 3D, or 4D, seismic imaging has been analyzed by the industry for more than a decade, with a growing number of successful cases being reported in the literature. Two of the most recent 4D case studies' reporting success are Draugen in the Norwegian North Sea and Gannet-C on the U.K. continental shelf. Both have been technical successes, providing good images of time-lapse changes in the reservoir. These 4D results have changed drilling locations and reduced the risk associated with costly field-development decisions. (Note: from this point forward, "4D" is used to refer to time-lapse seismic imaging.) The focus of this paper is quantifying the economic impact of 4D. After reviewing some ways that 4D can impact reservoir management. an economic model is developed that can quantify that impact. The decision tree model uses Bayes' theorem to compute the modified probabilities resulting from 4D. The model indicates that, for the case of drilling an infill well, 4D information adds considerable value to the project, even considering that the 4D information is not perfect.

J	Sonnenerg, A; Gavin, MW				Sonnenerg, A; Gavin, MW			General principles to enhance practice patterns in gastrointestinal endoscopy	ALIMENTARY PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							ANNOTATED ALGORITHMIC APPROACH; BLEEDING PEPTIC-ULCERS; INJECTION THERAPY; RANDOMIZED TRIAL; HEMORRHAGE; MANAGEMENT; LIGATION; DISEASE; SURGERY; PREVENT	Aim: To develop general rules on how to pursue a therapeutic goal of interventional endoscopy without getting lost in abundant details. Methods: The influences of various medical interventions on the survival of a patient with gastrointestinal haemorrhage are modelled by an influence diagram. Survival is the focal point of multiple influences affecting its overall strength. Any downstream influence can represent the focal point of other preceding upstream influences. The mathematics underlying the influence diagram are similar to those of a decision tree with some notable exceptions. Its formalism allows one to consider inhibitory and additive influences and to include in the same analysis non-commensurable qualities, such as correct diagnosis, haemostasis or survival. Results: The analysis reveals five general rules. First, the large number of factors involved in successful endoscopy render the influence of each individual factor less important. Second, a single factor that exerts its influence on many subsequent factors tends to be associated with an overall greater relevance. Third, remote influences are of lesser relevance than those directly linked to the final outcome. Fourth, factors multiplied by several consecutive probabilities lose their influence. Fifth, endoscopists need to assess the relevance of individual factors with respect to the immediate goals of endoscopy, as well as the general goals of patient well-being. Conclusions: The influence model of endoscopic haemostasis reveals several general principles that can be utilized as tools in endoscopy training.

J	Bordley, RF				Bordley, RF			Representing trees using Microsoft doughnut charts	AMERICAN STATISTICIAN			English	Article						decision trees; excel modeling; fault trees; Markov chains; value trees	DECISION-ANALYSIS	Trees are widely used to represent and solve problems in Bayesian statistics, risk analysis, marketing statistics, reliability theory, and Markov chains. But they have three limitations: (1) for moderately sized problems, the tree becomes unwieldy; (2) while the tree is very good at visually representing qualitative relationships, it does not allow visual representation of quantitative information; and (3) the tree is not easily represented on a PC without special software. In the spirit of Tufte, this article presents an alternative, the circular decision tree, which visually represents all the information-problem structure, strengths of relationship, and values of nodes-using colors and are lengths. Mathematical computations in the tree are accomplished by "mixing colors" from adjacent segments. Furthermore, it is easily programmable in Excel. Hence it is especially suitable for presenting problems to students and nontechnical audiences.

Methods: We analyzed the National Automotive Sampling System database, a national probability sample, using pediatric patients up to 15 years old (occupants only) involved in motor vehicle crashes from January 1993 to December 1999. The National Automotive Sampling System database includes patients from regions throughout the country, weighted to represent a nationwide sample. Twelve out-of-hospital variables were used in classification and regression tree analysis to create a decision rule separating children with severe injuries (Injury Severity Score [ISS] greater than or equal to 6) from those with minor injuries (ISS<16). Misclassification costs and complexity parameters were selected to yield a decision tree with appropriate sensitivity and specificity for the identification of severely injured patients, while also being simple and practical for out-of-hospital use. Probability weights were used throughout the analysis to account for the sampling design and sampling weights Results: Using a sample size of 8,392 children, we constructed a decision rule using 3 out-of-hospital variables (Glasgow Coma Scale score, passenger space intrusion greater than or equal to6 in [greater than or equal to15 cm], and restraint use) to predict those patients with an ISS of 18 or more. Internal cross-validation was used to determine the sensitivity and specificity, yielding values of 92% and 73%, respectively, for the prediction of patients with an ISS of 16 or more. Conclusion: Out-of-hospital variables available to field personnel could be used to effectively triage pediatric motor vehicle crash patients using the decision rule developed here.

J	Chikalov, I				Chikalov, I			On average depth of decision trees implementing Boolean functions	FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE			English	Article						Boolean function; decision tree; average time complexity		The article considers the representation of Boolean functions in the form of decision trees. It presents the bounds on average time complexity of decision trees for all classes of Boolean functions that are closed over substitution, and the insertion and deletion of unessential variables (the structure of these classes is described in the book by Jablonsky, Gavrilov and Kudriavtzev [5]). The obtained results are compared with the results developed by Moshkov in [6] that describe the worst case time complexity of decision trees.

J	Steiner, M; Smith, JA				Steiner, M; Smith, JA			Use of three-dimensional reflectivity structure for automated detection and removal of nonprecipitating echoes in radar data	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							ANOMALOUS PROPAGATION ECHOES; VERTICAL PROFILES; BOUNDARY-LAYER; RAINFALL ESTIMATION; POLARIZATION RADAR; NEURAL NETWORKS; QUALITY-CONTROL; INVERSE METHOD; PRECIPITATION; IDENTIFICATION	This study aims at assessing the potential of anomalous propagation conditions to occur, reviews past attempts to mitigate ground clutter contamination of radar data resulting from anomalous signal propagation, and presents a new algorithm for radar data quality control. Based on a 16-yr record of operational sounding data, the likelihood of atmospheric conditions to occur across the United States that potentially lead to anomalous propagation of radar signals is estimated. Anomalous signal propagation may lead to a significant contamination of radar data from ground echoes normally not seen by the radar, which could result in serious rainfall overestimates, if not recognized and treated appropriately. Many different approaches have been proposed to eliminate the problem of regular ground clutter close to the radar and temporary clutter resulting from anomalous signal propagation. None of the reported approaches, however, satisfactorily succeeds in the case of anomalous propagation ground returns embedded in precipitation echoes, a problem that remains a challenge today for radar data quality control. Taking strengths and weaknesses of past approaches into consideration, a new automated procedure has been developed that makes use of the three-dimensional reflectivity structure. In particular, the vertical extent of radar echoes, their spatial variability, and vertical gradient of intensity are evaluated by means of a decision tree. The new algorithm appears to work equally well in situations where anomalous propagation ground returns are either separated from or embedded within precipitation echoes. Moreover, sea clutter echoes are identified as not raining and successfully removed.

We develop a framework for quantifying the difference, called the deviation, between two datasets in terms of the models they induce, In addition to being a quantitative, intuitively interpretable measure of difference, the deviation between two datasets can also be computed very fast, Our framework covers a wide variety of models including frequent itemsets, decision tree classifiers. and clusters, and captures standard measures of deviation such as the misclassification rate and the chi-squared metric as special cases. We also show how statistical techniques can be applied to the deviation measure to assess whether the difference between two models is significant (i.e., whether the underlying datasets have statistically significant differences in their characteristics), and discuss several practical applications.

We analyze the structural patterns common to these applications, looking at application performance and software engineering efficiency. Our aim is to clearly state what features a SPP environment should have to be useful for parallel DM. Within the skeleton-based PPE SHE that we have developed, we study the different patterns of data access of parallel implementations of Apriori, C4.5 and DBSCAN. We need to address large partitions reads, frequent and sparse access to small blocks, as well as an irregular mix of small and large transfers, to allow efficient development of applications on huge databases. We examine the addition of an object/component interface to the skeleton structured model, to simplify the development of environment-integrated, parallel DM applications.

Methods: The cost-effectiveness of WB-PET for the management of Japanese patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) was assessed. Decision-tree sensitivity analysis was designed, based on the two competing strategies of WB-PET vs. CI. WB-PET was assumed to have a sensitivity and specificity for detecting metastases, of 90% to 100% and CI of 80% to 90%. The prevalences of M1 disease were 34% and 20%. One thousand patients suspected of having NSCLC were simulated in each strategy. We surveyed the relevant literature for the choice of variables. Expected cost saving (CS) and expected life expectancy (LE) for NSCLC patients were calculated. Results: The WB-PET strategy yielded an expected CS of $951 US to $1,493US per patient and an expected LE of minus 0.0246 years to minus 0.0136 years per patient for the 71.4% NSCLC and 34% M1 disease prevalence at our hospital. PET avoided unnecessary bronchoscopies and thoracotomies for incurable and benign diseases. Overall, the CS for each patient was $833US to $2,010US at NSCLC prevalences ranging from 10% to 90%. The LE of the WB-PET strategy was similar to that of the CI strategy. The CS and LE minimally varied in the two situations of 34% and 20% M I disease prevalence. Conclusions: The introduction of a WB-PET strategy in place of CI for managing NSCLC patients is potentially cost-effective in Japan.

J	Browne, A; Blake, M; Donnelly, M; Herbert, D				Browne, A; Blake, M; Donnelly, M; Herbert, D			On liberty for the old	CANADIAN JOURNAL ON AGING-REVUE CANADIENNE DU VIEILLISSEMENT			English	Article						decision-making; ethics; liberty; mental status; paternalism; risk		Elderly adults often pose, or are perceived to pose, a risk to themselves or others. Others often also have the will, and sometimes the ability, to intervene in their lives: to take them from their homes, force medical treatment on them, and prevent them from spending their money as they see fit. Thus the question "To what extent, and for what purposes, can others interfere with the liberty of the individual?" takes on particular relevance for elderly adults. This is the question John Stuart Mill addressed in his essay On Liberty, and our aim is to adapt his theory of liberty to guide those who must make decisions about the old. We argue that individuals can be interfered with in their own interest and in the interest of others. It is apt to interfere in their own interest if and only if they are putting themselves at significant risk, are encumbered, i.e. are incompetent or subject to some other judgement-distorting condition, and interference will be: (a) effective, (b) not generative of evils greater than those it prevents, (c) the mildest possible to curb the evil, (d) not discriminatory, and (e), unless the interference has utility approaching absolute necessity, thought justified. It is apt to interfere in the interest of others if and only if they are putting others at significant risk and the same five conditions are satisfied.

The method is based on the combination of two different approaches. One is the multi-branching decision tree and the second is Kohonen neural network. The new method allows a retrieval of similar or identical objects from a number of N objects (N being in the order of 10(6) and more) in a number of comparisons proportional to log(9)N. The method was developed in the connection with the question much greater thanhow to map millions of multi-dimensional objects like spectra, structures, time-series of process variables, multi-component analyses of food or pharmaceutical products, etc.?much less than.

While adopting the rule extraction method to develop different algorithms, many researchers normally simplify a network's structure and then extract rules from the simplified networks, This type of data limits such conventional approaches when attempting to remove the unnecessary connections. In addition to developing network pruning and extraction algorithms, this work attempts to determine the important input nodes. In the proposed algorithms, the type of input data is not limited to binary, discrete or continuous. Moreover, two numerical examples are analyzed. Comparing the results from the proposed algorithms with those from See5 demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

J	Lindell, Y; Pinkas, B				Lindell, Y; Pinkas, B			Privacy preserving data mining	JOURNAL OF CRYPTOLOGY			English	Article						secure two-party computation; oblivious transfer; oblivious polynomial evaluation; data mining; decision trees	INFORMATION	In this paper we address the issue of privacy preserving data mining. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which two parties owning confidential databases wish to run a data mining algorithm on the union of their databases, without revealing any unnecessary information. Our work is motivated by the need both to protect privileged information and to enable its use for research or other purposes. The above problem is a specific example of secure multi-party computation and, as such, can be solved using known generic protocols. However, data mining algorithms are typically complex and, furthermore, the input usually consists of massive data sets. The generic protocols in such a case are of no practical use and therefore more efficient protocols are required. We focus on the problem of decision tree learning with the popular ID3 algorithm. Our protocol is considerably more efficient than generic solutions and demands both very few rounds of communication and reasonable bandwidth.

The Web provides access to an enormous amount of information in the medical area, and in particular enables troubleshooting of new techniques in the medical laboratory, Currently it is possible to find textual information but it is not always easy to find hypermedia information, In many cases authors change only the means of dissemination of a book or paper to the Web, but do not adapt the information to the features of this ne medium. The prototype of our hypermedia application was developed using Director and Flash programs (Macromedia), the application as developed from a decision tree built as a result of information compiled from expert PCR users and the existing literature, It was implemented on a website using Dreamweaver (Macromedia), The usefulness and possibilities of this application have been tested with physicians, medical laboratory technicians, and health science students, and have been proven to be more effective than traditional methods, both in education processes and in helping researchers and medical laboratory technicians in their daily work, The advance and popularization of the Internet in the medical profession requires information on the Web to adapt to the advantages offered by hypermedia, This new step must be taken, and the Web must offer medical users not only a different medium of information distribution but also a new way of handling and obtaining information.

We investigated a collection of 392 two-class problems from the UCI depository, and observed that there are strong correlations between the classifier accuracies and measures of length of class boundaries, thickness of the class manifolds, and nonlinearities of decision boundaries. We found characteristics of both difficult and easy cases where combination methods are no better than single classifiers. Also, we observed that the bootstrapping method is better when the training samples are sparse, and the subspace method is better when the classes are compact and the boundaries are smooth.

In the present paper, we focus on learning set sampling (Breiman's Bagging) and random feature subset selections (Ho's Random Subspaces). We present a combination scheme labelled 'Bagfs', in which new learning sets are generated on the basis of both bootstrap replicates and random subspaces. The performances of the three methods (Bagging, Random Subspaces and Bagfs) are compared to the standard Adaboost algorithm. All four methods are assessed by means of a decision-tree inducer (C4.5). In addition, we also study whether the number and the way in which they are created has a significant influence on the performance of their combination. To answer these two questions, we undertook the application of the McNemar test of significance and the Kappa degree-of-agreement. The results, obtained on 23 conventional databases, show that on average, Bagfs exhibits the best agreement between prediction and supervision.

We investigated varicella cases reported to a surveillance project between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1999- with more extensive investigation of cases reporting previous varicella with onset between January 1, 1998, and September 30, 1998- to provide a more detailed description of first and second varicella infections. A simple decision tree was used to assess the likelihood that reported first and second infections were varicella. Results. Among varicella cases reported to the surveillance project, 4.5% of cases in 1995 and 13.3% of cases in 1999 reported previous varicella. More than 95% of first infections were physician diagnosed, epidemiologically linked to another case, or had a rash description consistent with varicella; the same was true for reported second infections. People who reported reinfections were generally healthy. There was a family history of repeat infections in 45% of people who reported reinfections. Conclusions. Clinical varicella reinfections may occur more commonly than previously thought. Additional studies of the predictive value of a positive varicella history and laboratory studies of reported reinfections are indicated to guide varicella vaccination policy.

Three classification techniques were compared, which can be divided into two groups: single classifiers (a five-nearest neighbor and the C4.5 decision tree classifier) and multiple classifier systems (BAGFs). Textural and contextual features (roads, hydrology, relief, etc.) were introduced during the classification process. Eleven land-cover categories, in a Belgian varied landscape, were analyzed and classified using Landsat Thematic Mapper data. The accuracy assessment increased with the introduction of textural features and contextual data, between 0.60 and 0.82 for the Kappa coefficient. The best kappa value was achieved using numerous textural and contextual features with the multiple classifier system (BAGFS).

It is a long-standing conjecture that every nontrivial monotone weakly symmetric Boolean function is elusive. In this paper, we prove this conjecture for Boolean functions with twelve variables.

Our approach is systematic in the sense that we perform the analysis in a manner which minimizes a priori theoretical assumptions as to the nature of the scalar particle. For instance, we do not immediately make the common assumption that a new scalar particle is a Higgs boson, and so must interact with a strength proportional to the mass of the particles with which it couples. We show how to compare different observables, and so to develop a decision tree from which the nature of the new particle may be discerned. We define several categories of models, which summarize the kinds of distinctions which the first experiments can make.

Whereas phenotypic assays directly measure drug resistance, the commonly used genotypic assays provide only indirect evidence of drug resistance, the major challenge being the interpretation of the sequence information. We analyzed the significance of sequence variations in the protease and reverse transcriptase genes for drug resistance and derived models that predict phenotypic resistance from genotypes. For 14 antiretroviral drugs, both genotypic and phenotypic resistance data from 471 clinical isolates were analyzed with a machine learning approach. Information profiles were obtained that quantify the statistical significance of each sequence position for drug resistance. For the different drugs, patterns of varying complexity were observed, including between one and nine sequence positions with substantial information content. Based on these information profiles, decision tree classifiers were generated to identify genotypic patterns characteristic of resistance or susceptibility to the different drugs. We obtained concise and easily interpretable models to predict drug resistance from sequence information. The prediction quality of the models was assessed in leave-one-out experiments in terms of the prediction error. We found prediction errors of 9.6-15.5% for all drugs except for zalcitabine, didanosine, and stavudine, with prediction errors between 25.4% and 32.0%.

The authors performed this study to determine whether a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system was suitable from one ultrasound (US) unit to another after parameters were adjusted by using intelligent selection algorithms. Materials and Methods. The authors used texture analysis and data mining with a decision tree model to classify breast tumors with different US systems. The databases of training cases from one unit and testing cases from another were collected from different countries. Regions of interest on US scans and co-variance texture parameters were used in the diagnosis system. Proposed adjustment schemes for different US systems were used to transform the information needed for a differential diagnosis. Results. Comparison of the diagnostic system with and without adjustment, respectively, yielded the following results: accuracy, 89.9% and 82.2%; sensitivity, 94.6% and 92.2%; specificity, 85.4% and 72.3%; positive predictive value, 86.5% and 76.8%; and negative predictive value, 94.1% and 90.4%. The improvement in accuracy, specificity, and positive predictive value was statistically significant. Diagnostic performance was improved after the adjustment. Conclusion. After parameters were adjusted by using intelligent selection algorithms, the performance of the proposed CAD system was better both with the same and with different systems. Different resolutions, different setting conditions, and different scanner ages are no longer obstacles to the application of such a CAD system.

We evaluated strategies for detecting LA, in three clinical settings, with decision-modeling techniques. A decision tree was constructed with 12 strategies, using a combination of aPTT and dilute Russell viper venom times (dRVVT) with confirmatory tests, tissue thromboplastin time (TTI), platelet neutralization procedures, and mixing studies. Probabilities and costs of adverse events and test costs were obtained from the literature. Patient preference for each strategy was evaluated by assigning utilities to each outcome. On the basis of assay results in 90 healthy people and 77 patients, we calculated sensitivities and specificities for each strategy, with true positives defined as suggested by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. The least costly strategy for evaluation of patients with a prolonged aPTT, or with thrombosis, is not to test and to assume that LA is absent. For patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), it is least expensive not to test, although testing with TTI alone can also be considered an efficient strategy. The strategy of highest utility to patients with SLE is testing with TTI, followed by dRVVT. On the basis of these cost and utility results, clinicians' strategies for detecting LA may need modification. These strategies would then optimally be tested in clinical trials. Am. J.

J	Knight, K; Marcu, D				Knight, K; Marcu, D			Summarization beyond sentence extraction: A probabilistic approach to sentence compression	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						summarization; compression; noisy-channel model		When humans produce summaries of documents, they do not simply extract sentences and concatenate them. Rather, they create new sentences that are grammatical, that cohere with one another, and that capture the most salient pieces of information in the original document. Given that large collections of text/abstract pairs are available online, it is now possible to envision algorithms that are trained to mimic this process. In this paper, we focus on sentence compression, a simpler version of this larger challenge. We aim to achieve two goals simultaneously: our compressions should be grammatical, and they should retain the most important pieces of information. These two goals can conflict. We devise both a noisy-channel and a decision-tree approach to the problem, and we evaluate results against manual compressions and a simple baseline. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The objective of our studies is to identify better biomarkers for early detection of PCA using protein profiling technologies that can simultaneously resolve and analyze multiple proteins. Evaluating multiple proteins will be essential to establishing signature proteomic patterns that distinguish cancer from noncancer as well as identify all genetic subtypes of the cancer and their biological activity. In this study, we used a protein biochip surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry approach coupled with an artificial intelligence learning algorithm to differentiate PCA from noncancer cohorts. Surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry protein profiles of serum from 167 PCA patients, 77 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia, and 82 age-matched unaffected healthy men were used to train and develop a decision tree classification algorithm that used a nine-protein mass pattern that correctly classified 96% of the samples. A blinded test set, separated from the training set by a stratified random sampling before the analysis, was used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the classification system. A sensitivity of 83%, a specificity of 97%, and a positive predictive value of 96% for the study population and 91% for the general population were obtained when comparing the PCA versus noncancer (benign prostate hyperplasia/healthy men) groups. This high-throughput proteomic classification system will provide a highly accurate and innovative approach for the early detection/diagnosis of PCA.

Methods: A decision tree model was constructed to find the total expected cost per patient for a 4-month time period following an initial angioplasty. The model used clinical data from the Coronary Angioplasty Amlodipine Restenosis Study (CAPARES), a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted to investigate the effects of amlodipine on restenosis and clinical events in patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Outcomes of interest to this analysis included MI, repeat PTCA, CABG, and all-cause mortality. Clinical experts from Canada and Norway were enlisted and a modified Delphi study approach was used to quantify healthcare resources consumed for each clinical outcome. Results: The use of amlodipine decreased the rates of MI, PTCA, and CABG by 2.0, 4.7, and 2.7%, respectively. The total expected cost per patient using amlodipine was $6,398.30 (US$4,323) in Canada and kr 59,993.27 (US$6,846) in Norway. The total expected cost per patient not using amlodipine was $6,519.37 (US$4,405) in Canada and kr 64,292.17 (US$7,337) in Norway. The model demonstrated potential cost-savings over a 4-month follow up period resulting from the improved clinical outcomes for patients using amlodipine with PTCA-$121,071 (US$81,844) per 1000 patients in Canada and kr 4,298,899 (US$490,074) per 1000 patients in Norway. Conclusions: The adjunctive use of amlodipine is a cost-effective therapeutic strategy to achieve more favorable clinical outcomes in patients undergoing PTCAs in Canada and Norway.

Patients and methods: Clinical and surgical outcomes attributable to managing a chronic anal fissure were obtained from published literature, supplemented with information about resource utilisation derived from interviews with a panel of colorectal surgeons and general practitioners. Using this information, a decision tree modelling the management of a chronic anal fissure by a colorectal surgeon was constructed. Unit resource costs at 1999/2000 prices were applied to the resource utilisation estimates in the model to estimate the expected NHS cost of managing a chronic anal fissure. Consensus on the information contained within the model was reached at a meeting with an expert panel comprising five of the interviewees and one other colorectal surgeon. Results: The expected NHS cost of a colorectal surgeon initially managing a chronic anal fissure with GTN was estimated to be pound616, compared to pound840 when a lateral internal sphincterotomy is the first-line treatment. Moreover, the expected probability of successful healing following initial treatment with either intervention is 99-100%, taking into account all subsequent treatments. Conclusion: The initial use of GTN compared to lateral internal sphincterotomy to treat a chronic anal fissure affords a potential cost reduction to the NHS of pound224 per patient without any loss in effectiveness.

We compare different nonparametric machine learning techniques with parametric likelihood estimations commonly employed in population genetics for purposes of assigning individuals to their population of origin ("assignment tests"). Classifier accuracy was compared across simulated data sets representing different levels of population differentiation (low and high F-ST), number of loci surveyed (5 and 10), and allelic diversity (average of three or eight alleles per locus). Empirical data for the lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) exhibiting levels of population differentiation comparable to those used in simulations were examined to further evaluate and compare classification methods. Classification error rates associated with artificial neural networks and likelihood estimators were lower for simulated data sets compared to k-nearest neighbor and decision tree classifiers over the entire range of parameters considered. Artificial neural networks only marginally outperformed the likelihood method for simulated data (0-2.8% lower error rates). The relative performance of each machine learning classifier improved relative likelihood estimators for empirical data sets, suggesting an ability to "learn" and utilize properties of empirical genotypic arrays intrinsic to each population. Likelihood-based estimation methods provide a more accessible option for reliable assignment of individuals to the population of origin due to the intricacies in development and evaluation of artificial neural networks.

J	Chen, YQ; Gao, W; Zhu, TS; Ling, C				Chen, YQ; Gao, W; Zhu, TS; Ling, C			Learning prosodic patterns for mandarin speech synthesis	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						TTS; clustering; Rough Set; ANN; Decision tree; Beyesian network	TEXT-TO-SPEECH; SYSTEM	Higher quality synthesized speech is required for widespread use of text-to-speech (TTS) technology, and the prosodic pattern is the key feature that makes synthetic speech sound unnatural and monotonous, which mainly describes the variation of pitch. The rules used in most Chinese TTS systems are constructed by experts, with weak quality control and low precision. In this paper, we propose a combination of clustering and machine learning techniques to extract prosodic patterns from actual large mandarin speech databases to improve the naturalness and intelligibility of synthesized speech. Typical prosody models are found by clustering analysis. Some machine learning techniques, including Rough Set, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Decision tree, are trained for fundamental frequency and energy contours, which can be directly used in a pitch-synchronous-overlap-add-based (PSOLA-based) TTS system. The experimental results showed that synthesized prosodic features greatly resembled their original counterparts for most syllables.

J	Bramer, M				Bramer, M			Using J-pruning to reduce overfitting in classification trees	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	21st SGES International Conference on Knowledge Based Systems and Applied Artificial Intelligence	DEC, 2001	CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND	Specialist Grp Knowledge Based Syst & Appl Artificial Intelligence		classification; data mining; rule induction	RULES	The automatic induction of classification rules from examples in the form of a decision tree is an important technique used in data mining. One of the problems encountered is the overfitting of rules to training data. In some cases this can lead to an excessively large number of rules, many of which have very little predictive value for unseen data. This paper is concerned with the reduction of overfitting during decision tree generation.

J	Schreffler, RT; Schreffler, AJ; Wittler, RR				Schreffler, RT; Schreffler, AJ; Wittler, RR			Treatment of cerebrospinal fluid shunt infections: a decision analysis	PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE JOURNAL			English	Article						cerebrospinal fluid shunt; ventriculoperitoneal shunt; infection/therapy	THERAPY; MANAGEMENT	Background. Cerebrospinal fluid shunts transfer cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the lateral ventricles in the brain to the peritoneum (ventriculoperitoneal shunt) or the right atrium (ventriculoatrial shunt) via subcutaneous Silastic tubing. As with any implanted foreign body, infection is a serious complication. Although there are several therapeutic modalities currently used for the treatment of shunt infections, controversy remains as to which is best given that there has been only one randomized trial comparing their effectiveness. Objective. To determine which treatment modality is most effective by using decision analysis to compare three approaches with regard to cure rate, morbidity and mortality. Methods. We constructed a decision tree to map out the different treatment modalities and assigned probability values obtained from previously published studies. A utility value was assigned to each treatment outcome, ranging from 0 to 1.0, with a higher score indicating a more favorable outcome. Calculations were performed using Decision Analysis TreeAge computer software. Results. The removal of an infected shunt with establishment of external ventricular drainage or ventricular taps and administration of antibiotics leads to the highest expected value, 0.86. Removal of an infected shunt followed by immediate replacement and administration of antibiotics is less effective, with an expected value of 0.76. The use of antibiotics alone results in the lowest expected value, 0.61. Sensitivity analysis showed the above findings to be robust with respect to clinically relevant changes for the baseline probabilities and utility values. Conclusion. A protocol of shunt removal, external ventricular drainage placement or ventricular taps and antibiotics, followed by creation of a new shunt when CSF sterility is achieved, is the most effective method of treatment for CSF shunt infection.

A total of 263 sonographic images of solid breast nodules, including 129 malignancies and 134 benign nodules, were evaluated by using a bootstrap technique with 10 original training samples. Texture parameters of a region-of-interest (ROI) were resampled with a bootstrap technique and a decision-tree model was used to classify the tumor as benign or malignant. The accuracy was 87.07% (229 of 263 tumors), the sensitivity was 95.35% (123 of 129), the specificity was 79.10% (106 of 134), the positive predictive value was 81.46% (123 of 151), and the negative predictive value was 94.64% (106 of 112). This analysis method provides a second opinion for physicians with high accuracy. The new method shows a potential to be useful in future application of CAD, especially when a large database cannot be obtained for training or a newly developed ultrasonic system has smaller sets of samples.

J	Buhlmann, P; Yu, B				Buhlmann, P; Yu, B			Analyzing bagging	ANNALS OF STATISTICS			English	Article						bootstrap; classification; decision tree; MARS; model selection; multiple predictions; nonparametric regression	REGRESSION; SELECTION; TREES; MODEL	Bagging is one of the most effective computationally intensive procedures to improve on unstable estimators or classifiers, useful especially for high dimensional data set problems. Here we formalize the notion of instability and derive theoretical results to analyze the variance reduction effect of bagging (or variants thereof) in mainly hard decision problems, which include estimation after testing in regression and decision trees for regression functions and classifiers. Hard decisions create instability, and bagging is shown to smooth such hard decisions. yielding smaller variance and mean squared error. With theoretical explanations, we motivate subagging based on subsampling as an alternative aggregation scheme. It is computationally cheaper but still shows approximately the same accuracy as bagging. Moreover, our theory reveals improvements in first order and in line with simulation studies. In particular, we obtain an asymptotic limiting distribution at the cube-root rate for the split point when fitting piecewise constant functions. Denoting sample size by n. it follows that in a cylindric neighborhood of diameter n(-1/3) of the theoretically optimal split point. the variance and mean squared error reduction of subagging can be characterized analytically. Because of the slow rate, our reasoning also provides an explanation on the global scale for the whole covariate space in a decision tree with finitely many splits.

Ninety-two patients from two Australian hospitals in different states underwent FDG-PET for evaluation of an SPN. Observed values for prior probability of malignancy and diagnostic accuracy of PET were applied to previously published decision tree models using published Australian health care costs. The accuracy of FDG-PET was 93% with a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 95%. The prior probability of malignancy (0.54), PET sensitivity and PET specificity indicated cost savings per patient of up to EUR 455 (A$ 774) based on a PET cost of EUR 706 (A$ 1,200). PET would remain cost-effective for levels of prior probability up to 0.8-0.9 and a PET cost of EUR 736-1,161 (A$ 1,252-A$ 1,974). It is concluded that Nal PET is accurate, cost saving and cost-effective for the characterisation of indeterminate pulmonary nodules in Australia. Comparison with previous reports from the United States confirms that FDG-PET can remain cost-effective despite population differences in medical costs, disease prevalence and PET diagnostic performance.

J	Wei, CP; Chiu, IT				Wei, CP; Chiu, IT			Turning telecommunications call details to churn prediction: a data mining approach	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						data mining; telecommunications data mining; churn prediction; churn management; classification analysis; decision tree induction; multi-classifier class-combiner approach	FRAUD	As deregulation, stew technologies, and new competitors open up the mobile telecommunications industry, churn prediction and management has become of great concern to mobile service providers: A mobile service provider wishing to retain its subscribers needs to be able to predict which of them may be at-risk of changing services and will make those subscribers the focus of customer retention efforts. In response to the limitations of existing churn-prediction systems and the unavailability of customer demographics in the mobile telecommunications provider investigated, we propose, design, and experimentally evaluate a churn-prediction technique that predicts churning from subscriber contractual information and call pattern changes extracted from call details. This proposed technique is capable of identifying potential churners at the contract level for a specific prediction time-period. In addition, the proposed technique incorporates the multi-classifier class-combiner approach to address the challenge of a highly skewed class distribution between churners and non-churners. The empirical evaluation results suggest that the proposed call-behavior-based churn-prediction technique exhibits satisfactory predictive effectiveness when more recent call details are employed for the churn prediction model construction. Furthermore, the proposed technique is able to demonstrate satisfactory or reasonable predictive power within the one-month interval between model construction and churn prediction. Using a previous demographics-based churn-prediction system as a reference, the lift factors attained by our proposed technique appear largely satisfactory. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A panel of 28 pediatricians classified seven standardized descriptions of patients with permanent sequelae after bacterial meningitis according to the EQ-5D and HUI classification system. Quality weights for each classification were calculated using the EQ-5D and HUT standard scoring algorithms. HUI Mark 3 quality weights were substantially lower than the EQ-5D for all descriptions (mean difference 0.11; 95% CI: 0.08-0.14). Mean Kendall W for agreement of the ranking order between EQ-5D and HUI Mark 3 was 0.90. The EQ-5D and HUI resulted in different absolute quality weights, in particular for states associated with "deafness" and "mental retardation." Due to their performance differences, the HUI may be preferable to EQ-5D in studies focussed on "sensation" (hearing, vision, speech) or "cognition." These differences proved not to be relevant in the present cost-utility study of diagnostic strategies to rule out bacterial meningitis, as such consequences were at the distal end of the decision tree. This may be different in a cost-utility analysis of therapeutic strategies. Hence, sensitivity analysis to quality weights is recommended. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Decision tree analysis highlights patient subgroups and critical values in variables assessed. Importantly, the results are visually informative and often present clear clinical interpretation about risk factors faced by patients in these subgroups. The aim of this prospective study was to compare results of logistic regression with those of decision tree analysis of an observational, head-injury data set, including a wide range of secondary insults and 12-month outcomes. Methods. One hundred twenty-four adult head-injured patients were studied during their stay in an intensive care unit by using a computerized data collection system. Verified values falling outside threshold limits were analyzed according to insult grade and duration with the aid of logistic regression. A decision tree was automatically produced from root node to target classes (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS] score). Among 69 patients, in whom eight insult categories could be assessed, outcome at 12 months was analyzed using logistic regression to determine the relative influence of patient age, admission Glasgow Coma Scale score, Injury Severity Score (ISS), papillary response on admission, and insult duration. The most significant predictors of mortality in this patient set were duration of hypotensive, pyrexic, and hypoxetnic insults. When good and poor outcomes were compared, hypotensive insults and pupillary response on admission were significant. Using decision tree analysis, the authors found that hypotension and low cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) are the best predictors of death, with a 9.2% improvement in predictive accuracy (PA) over that obtained by simply predicting the largest outcome category as the outcome for each patient. Hypotension was a significant predictor of poor outcome (GOS Score 1-3). Low CPR patient age, hypocarbia, and pupillary response were also good predictors of outcome (good/poor), with a 5.1% improvement in PA. In certain subgroups of patients pyrexia was a predictor of good outcome. Conclusions. Decision tree analysis confirmed some of the results of logistic regression and challenged others. This investigation shows that there is knowledge to be gained from analyzing observational data with the aid of decision tree analysis.

J	Schaefer, M				Schaefer, M			Discussing basic principles for a coding system of drug-related problems: the case of PI-Doc((R))	PHARMACY WORLD & SCIENCE			English	Editorial Material						coding system; drug-related problems; process indicators; quality of care		Coding systems are important tools for the documentation of drug-related problems and following interventions. They should be suitable not only for scientific studies but for the broader implementation of Pharmaceutical Care in the pharmacy. A suitable coding system must be easy to use in daily routine. To facilitate later computer aided use, it should be preferably structured like a decision tree and consist of three parts: 1. the classification of drug-related problems 2. the intervention taken to solve to problem 3. the degree to which the problem was solved PI-Doc(R) considers other classification systems used by Hepler and Strand the PAS(R)-Coding System and draws empirical experience from a study in 1995 and 1998 in Germany. The main groups comprise the following: - unsuitable drug choice - unsuitable use by the patient, incl. compliance - unsuitable dosage - drug-drug interactions - adverse drug reactions - other drug-related problems - patient-related - communication-related - technical and logistic problems The article discusses basic principles of the development of a coding system and the prerequisites for its application. In addition, it tries to give guidance for the classification process itself. It is also recommended to collect further information while documenting drug-related problems, in order to allow additional statistical evaluation.

J	McIver, DK; Friedl, MA				McIver, DK; Friedl, MA			Using prior probabilities in decision-tree classification of remotely sensed data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							GLOBAL LAND-COVER; NEURAL-NETWORK CLASSIFICATION; AVHRR DATA; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; IMAGE SEGMENTATION; VEGETATION; ALGORITHMS; CLIMATE; MODELS	Land cover and vegetation classification systems are generally designed for ecological or land use applications that are independent of remote sensing considerations. As a result, the classes of interest are often poorly separable in the feature space provided by remotely sensed data. In many cases, ancillary data sources can provide useful information to help distinguish between inseparable classes. However, methods for including ancillary data sources, such as the use of prior probabilities in maximum likelihood classification, are often problematic in practice. This paper presents a method for incorporating prior probabilities in remote-sensing-based land cover classification using a supervised decision-tree classification algorithm. The method allows robust probabilities of class membership to be estimated from nonparametric supervised classification algorithms using a technique known as boosting. By using this approach in association with Bayes' rule, poorly separable classes can be distinguished based on ancillary information. The method does not penalize rare classes and can incorporate incomplete or imperfect information using a confidence parameter that weights the influence of ancillary information relative to its quality. Assessments of the methodology using both Landsat TM and AVHRR data show that it successfully improves land cover classification results. The method is shown to be especially useful for improving discrimination between agriculture and natural vegetation in coarse-resolution land cover maps. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

J	Muchoney, DM; Strahler, AH				Muchoney, DM; Strahler, AH			Pixel- and site-based calibration and validation methods for evaluating supervised classification of remotely sensed data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK CLASSIFICATION; GLOBAL LAND-COVER; AVHRR DATA; DATA SET; VARIABILITY; VEGETATION; ACCURACY; MODEL; MODIS; MAPS	The characteristics of calibration and validation data, especially sample size, distribution, thematic labeling, and representativeness, are important to supervised classification algorithms, as are their use to ascribe accuracy statements to supervised classification results. While random and stratified random sampling of calibration and validation into calibration (training) and validation (testing) subsets has often been based on pixel sampling, the resulting accuracy statements may be overly optimistic and biased due to spatial autocorrelation. This is especially true for decision tree and neural network algorithms that tend to learn examples well even when just a single pixel from a site is presented in the learning phase. Therefore, polygon- or site-based sampling (using groups of contiguous pixels) for calibration and validation may provide better estimates of prediction accuracies. This paper presents the results of pixel- versus polygon-based calibration and validation of a supervised Gaussian ARTMAP neural network algorithm. Both techniques were applied to (1) a multitemporal AVHRR vegetation index data set and (2) a multitemporal data set of NDVI, temperature, and additional temporal metric and physical data to map vegetation and land cover (VLC) based on a regional network of sites in Central America. Our results indicate that although pixel-based accuracy assessment because of spatial autocorrelation may overstate accuracy, polygon-based assessments are also problematic. The Gaussian ARTMAP algorithm was used to provide insight into the problems of site heterogeneity, per-class accuracy, sampling rate, sampling representativeness, and the generalization properties of sites and classes, as related to pixel- and polygon-based sampling.

Among its allied disciplines, diagnostic radiology is of some importance. Studies in community medicine take advantage of diagnostic imaging in all stages of their development. Many fields of radiologic activity (bone absorptiometry, mammography, vascular and chest radiology) have been examined by community medicine researchers. A similar evaluation of differential indications for cross-sectional imaging and teleradiology is still to be expected. In order to increase the research on interrelations between the two disciplines, radiologists have to set foot on new grounds of scientific methods (decision trees, models, cost-efficiency analysis). In this way, the mechanisms that control the transfer of research into the so-called good radiological practice can be clarified.

Purpose-The goal of this study was to assess the first multifrequency transcranial Doppler system specially developed for online automatic detection of cerebral microemboli. Methods-The multifrequency Doppler instrumentation insonates simultaneously with 2.0- and 2.5-MHz frequencies. The detection threshold for embolus detection used in this study was a relative Doppler energy increase of >20 dB . ms, at which point the Doppler power increase was at least 5 dB and lasted >4 ms above the background energy. Four parameters were used in an optimized binary decision tree to recognize emboli: quarter Doppler shift, maximum duration limit, reference gate, and bidirectional enhancement. In in vitro studies, 200 plastic microspheres (80 mum), 200 gas bubbles (8 to 25 mum), and 600 artifacts were studied in a pulsatile closed-loop system. In vivo studies were carried out for 1 hour in 15 patients with mechanical heart valves and in 45 patients with carotid stenosis. This gave a total of 60 hours of online automatic monitoring in patients. Results-All 400 plastic spheres and microbubbles were automatically detected and correctly classified. Of the 600 artifacts, 596 (99.3%) were correctly classified as artifacts, and 4 (0.7%) were incorrectly identified as emboli (kappa=0.992, P<0.001). The experienced observer detected a total of 554 emboli and 800 artifacts in the heart valve (521 emboli, 400 artifacts) and carotid stenosis (33 emboli, 400 artifacts) patients. With multifrequency Doppler, 546 of these emboli (98.6%) and 791 of these artifacts (98.9%) were automatically detected and correctly classified as embolus or artifact (kappa=0.953, P<0.0001). Conclusions-We found that multifrequency transcranial Doppler had a relatively high sensitivity and specificity when used to automatically detect cerebral microemboli and reject artifacts online.

The objective of the tree was to minimise direct costs and export losses of FMD epidemics under several scenarios based on livestock and herd density in the outbreak region, the possibility of airborne spread, and the time between first infection and first detection. The starting point of the tree was an epidemiological model based on a deterministic susceptible-infectious-recovered approach. The effect of four control strategies on FMD dynamics was modelled. In addition to the standard control strategy of stamping out and culling of high-risk contact herds, strategies involving ring culling within 1 km of an infected herd, ring-vaccination within 1 kin of an infected herd, and ring-vaccination within 3 kin of an infected herd were assessed. An economic model converted outbreak and control effects of farming and processing operations into estimates of direct costs and export losses. Ring-vaccination is the economically optimal control strategy for densely populated livestock areas whereas ring culling is the economically optimal control strategy for sparsely populated livestock areas.

However, about 30% of patients do not respond to infliximab for unknown reasons. Identifying predictive factors of response is important for optimizing clinical management and for better understanding infliximab's mechanisms of action. The aim of this study was to assess whether demographic or clinical parameters influence short-term response to infliximab. METHODS: The first 240 CD patients of the Belgian Infliximab Expanded Access Program were studied for response to infliximab treatment and assessed at 4 (refractory luminal CD) or 10 wk (fistulizing CD) after the first infusion. Detailed demographic and clinical information on age, sex, type of disease (fistulizing or refractory), Crohn's Disease Activity Index score, C-reactive protein (CRP), smoking habits, disease duration, localization of disease, concomitant medication, and previous surgery were obtained from all patients. Logistic regression and decision tree analysis were performed. RESULTS: There were 73.5% responders and 26.5% nonresponders to treatment. Stepwise logistic regression identified age (OR = 0.971, 95% CI = 0.947-0.995, p = 0.018), isolated ileitis (OR = 0.359, 95% CI 0.177-0.728, p = 0.004), and previous surgery (OR 0.429, 95% CI = 0.233-0.787, p = 0.006) as inversely correlated with response, whereas isolated colitis (OR = 1.905, 95% CI = 1.010-3.597, p = 0.046) and concomitant immunosuppressive treatment (OR = 2.670, 95% CI = 1.430-5.016, p = 0.0022) were positively correlated with response to infliximab. Surprisingly, smoking habits were not retained as predictors for response. Decision tree analysis provided a working algorithm based on age and immunosuppressive treatment that warrants further exploration. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of infliximab-treated CD patients, young age, Crohn's colitis, and concomitant immunosuppressive treatment were identified as independent variables favoring short-term response to infliximab.

J	Perner, P; Perner, H; Muller, B				Perner, P; Perner, H; Muller, B			Mining knowledge for HEp-2 cell image classification	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						image mining; data mining; medical diagnosis; HEp-2 cell classification; fluorescence image analysis; decision tree induction; texture classification		HEp-2 cells are used for the identification of antinuclear autoantibodies (ANAs). They allow for recognition of over 30 different nuclear and cytoplasmic patterns, which are given by upwards of 100 different autoantibodies. The identification of the patterns has recently been done manually by a human inspecting the slides with a microscope. In this paper, we present results on the analysis and classification of cells using image analysis and data mining techniques. Starting from a knowledge acquisition process with a human operator, we developed an image analysis and feature extraction algorithm. The collection of the dataset was done based on an expert's image reading and based on the automatic extracted features. A dataset containing 132 features for each entry was set up and given to a data mining algorithm to find out the relevant features among this large feature set and to construct the classification knowledge. The classifier was evaluated by cross validation. The results gave the expert new insights into the necessary features and the classification knowledge and show the feasibility of an automated inspection system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Cheng, SW; Lee, KH				Cheng, SW; Lee, KH			Quadtree, ray shooting and approximate minimum weight Steiner triangulation	COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article								We present a quadtree-based decomposition of the interior of a polygon with holes. The complete decomposition yields a constant factor approximation of the minimum weight Steiner triangulation (MWST) of the polygon. We show that this approximate MWST supports ray shooting queries in the query-sensitive sense as defined by Mitchell, Mount and Suri. A proper truncation of our quadtree-based decomposition yields another constant factor approximation of the MWST. For a polygon with n vertices, the complexity of this approximate MWST is O(n log n) and it can be constructed in O(n log n) time. The running time is optimal in the algebraic decision tree model.

J	Durvasula, S; Lysonski, S; Mehta, SC				Durvasula, S; Lysonski, S; Mehta, SC			Understanding the interfaces: How ocean freight shipping lines can maximize satisfaction	INDUSTRIAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						services marketing; service encounters; service quality; service satisfaction; decision tree	SERVICE-QUALITY; ENCOUNTERS; PROFITABILITY; MODEL	Physical distribution services are becoming increasingly important as supply chains strive to become more efficient in the logistical flow of goods to industrial customers. Performance of these services, however, takes place during encounters :that customers have with various interfacing departments within the firm. These encounters may ultimately determine the level of satisfaction clients have with the service and the concomitant perceived quality. While previous research in this area has focused on service quality assessment, little attention 'has' been given to determining the pattern of interfacing departments that maximize service satisfaction. This study examines a sample of shipping managers in Singapore who evaluated the service dimensions of ocean freight shipping lines (or companies). Using an analytical method called decision tree calculus, this article identifies the combination of interfacing departments that maximize service satisfaction. The results of this approach offer definite guidance to ocean shipping lines in terms of the importance of key interfacing departments in shaping satisfaction and perceived quality. Implications are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Baek, JG; Kim, CO; Kim, SS				Baek, JG; Kim, CO; Kim, SS			Online learning of the cause-and-effect knowledge of a manufacturing process	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article								This paper deals with the intelligent learning of the cause-and-effect knowledge of a manufacturing process in online mode. This knowledge discovery problem is characterized as online learning where the knowledge is gradually found using the instances periodically obtained from the part processing of the process. We develop a new decision tree learning method called 'Statistical Batch based Decision tree Learning' (SBDL). To deal with large number of instances collected from the process, the concept of batch-based learning is introduced. A two-phased fitness test is also developed for measuring the fitness of the decision tree, thereby detecting the update point in time of the decision tree. The performance of SBDL has been verified with a real instance set collected from a Korean TFT-LCD manufacturing company.

J	Mason, L; Bartlett, PL; Golea, M				Mason, L; Bartlett, PL; Golea, M			Generalization error of combined classifiers	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER AND SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article						voting methods; margins analysis; decision trees; neural networks; boosting	SIZE	We derive an upper bound on the generalization error of classifiers which can be represented as thresholded convex combinations of thresholded convex combinations of functions. Such classifiers include single hidden-layer threshold networks and voted combinations of decision trees (such as those produced by boosting algorithms). The derived bound depends on the proportion of training examples with margin less than some threshold and the average complexity of the combined functions (where the average is over the weights assigned to each function in the convex combination). The complexity of the individual functions in the combination depends on their closeness to threshold. By representing a decision tree as a thresholded convex combination of weighted leaf functions, we apply this result to bound the generalization error of combinations of decision trees. Previous bounds depend on the margin of the combined classifier and the average complexity of the decision trees in the combination, where the complexity of each decision tree depends on the total number of leaves. Our bound also depends on the margin of the combined classifier and the average complexity of the decision trees, but our measure of complexity for an individual decision tree is based on the distribution of training examples over leaves and can be significantly smaller than the total number of leaves.

We use a multistage process to map primary forest, pasture, second growth, urban, rock/savanna, and water using 33 Landsat scenes acquired over three contiguous areas between 1975 and 1999. Accuracy of the 1999 classified maps was assessed as exceeding 85% based on digital airborne videography. Rondonia is highly fragmented, in which forests outside of restricted areas consist of numerous, small irregular patches. Pastures in Rondonia persist over many years and are not typically abandoned to second growth, which when present rarely remains unchanged longer than 8 years. Within the state, annual deforestation rates, pasture area, and ratio of second growth to cleared area varied spatially. Highest initial deforestation rates occurred in the southeast (Luiza), at over 2%, increasing to 3% by the late 1990s. In this area, the percentage of cleared land in second growth averaged 18% and few pastures were abandoned. In central Rondonia (Ji-Parana), deforestation rates rose from 1.2% between 1978 and 1986 to a high of 4.2% in 1999. In the northwest (Ariquemes), initial deforestation rates were lowest at 0.5% but rose substantially in the late 1990s, peaking at 3% in 1998. The ratio of second growth to cleared area was more than double the ratio in Luiza and few pastures remained unchanged beyond 8 years. Land clearing was most intense close to the major highway, BR364, except in Ariquemes. Intense forest clearing extended at least 50 km along the margins of BR364 in Ji-Parana and Luiza. Spatial differences in land use are hypothesized to result from a combination of economic factors and soil fertility.

J	Viaene, S; Derrig, RA; Baesens, B; Dedene, G				Viaene, S; Derrig, RA; Baesens, B; Dedene, G			A comparison of state-of-the-art classification techniques for expert automobile insurance claim fraud detection	JOURNAL OF RISK AND INSURANCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Congress on Insurance	JUL 23-25, 2001	UNIVERSITY PK, PENNSYLVANIA		PENN STATE UNIV		LEARNING ALGORITHMS; ROC CURVE; CLASSIFIERS; NETWORK; MARKET; AREA	Several state-of-the-art binary classification techniques are experimentally evaluated in the context of expert automobile insurance claim fraud detection. The predictive power of logistic regression, C4.5 decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, Bayesian learning multilayer perceptron neural network, least-squares support vector machine, naive Bayes, and tree-augmented naive Bayes classification is contrasted. For most of these algorithm types, we report on several operationalizations using alternative hyperparameter or design choices. We compare these in terms of mean percentage correctly classified (PCC) and mean area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve using a stratified, blocked, ten-fold cross-validation experiment. We also contrast algorithm type performance visually by means of the convex hull of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves associated with the alternative operationalizations per algorithm type. The study is based on a data set of 1,399 personal injury protection claims from 1993 accidents collected by the Automobile Insurers Bureau of Massachusetts. To stay as close to real-life operating conditions as possible, we consider only predictors that are known relatively early in the life of a claim. Furthermore, based on the qualification of each available claim by both a verbal expert assessment of suspicion of fraud and a ten-point-scale expert suspicion score, we can compare classification for different target/class encoding schemes. Finally, we also investigate the added value of systematically collecting nonflag predictors for suspicion of fraud modeling purposes. From the observed results, we may state that: (1) independent of the target encoding scheme and the algorithm type, the inclusion of nonflag predictors allows us to significantly boost predictive performance; (2) for all the evaluated scenarios, the performance difference in terms of mean PCC and mean AUROC between many algorithm type operationalizations turns out to be rather small; visual comparison of the algorithm type ROC curve convex hulls also shows limited difference in performance over the range of operating conditions; (3) relatively simple and efficient techniques such as linear logistic regression and linear kernel least-squares support vector machine classification show excellent overall predictive capabilities, and (smoothed) naive Bayes also performs well; and (4) the C4.5 decision tree operationalization results are rather disappointing; none of the tree operationalizations are capable of attaining mean AUROC performance in line with the best. Visual inspection of the evaluated scenarios reveals that the C4.5 algorithm type ROC curve convex hull is often dominated in large part by most of the other algorithm type hulls.

Such mixtures are sometimes found to be incompatible but compatibility data are scarce. An attempt was made to develop a quick and simple investigation strategy to obtain complete information on the compatibility of two drugs. This strategy was then used to study the physical and chemical compatibility of morphine HCl with alizapride HCl, atropine sulphate, dexamethasone sodium phosphate, hyoscine butylbromide, metoclopramide HCl, octreotide lactate, ranitidine HCl and hyoscine hydrobromide. These compatibility data are presented in such a way that they are easy to use in clinical practice. The investigation strategy outlined here allows the collection of complete information on the compatibility of morphine with another drug by studying a limited number of carefully selected mixtures per combination. The mixtures to be studied are selected using a scheme in which all possible mixtures prepared by mixing morphine solutions of varying concentrations with a drug solution in different volume ratios can be visualized. Applying this strategy to the eight combinations revealed, except for ranitidine HCl, no physical (visual) or chemical (HPLC; >90%) incompatibility in any of the mixtures studied for seven days at 22 and 32degreesC. This indicates that all possible mixtures of these drug solutions with morphine HCl are compatible. For the combination with ranitidine incompatibility was observed only when using morphine HCl solutions containing >40 mg/ml and at certain ratios (drug/morphine HCl [D/M]: 4/42, 10/6 and 8/8, v/v), but all physically compatible mixtures were chemically stable (>90%). Studying extra mixtures in addition to those required to be studied according to the strategy revealed no discrepancies for any of the eight combinations studied. Adaptation of the layout of the scheme and the design of a decision tree resulted in an easy tool to check compatibility in daily practice. The scheme designed in this study is a useful tool for research and for daily practice. It simplifies and thereby encourages investigation of the compatibility of drugs. The availability of data on the physical as well as chemical compatibility in daily practice will contribute to a better quality of the mixtures used in palliative care and help to avoid complications and inadequate symptom control.

J	Bruno, MS				Bruno, MS			Geomechanical and decision analyses for mitigating compaction-related casing damage	SPE DRILLING & COMPLETION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2001 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition	SEP 30-OCT 03, 2001	NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA	Soc Petr Engineers				Reservoir compaction and its associated bedding plane slip and overburden shear have induced damage to hundreds of wells in oil and gas fields throughout the world. Critical casing damage mechanisms observed in a variety of structural settings include overburden shear damage on localized horizontal planes, shearing at the top of production and injection intervals, and compression and buckling damage within the production interval, primarily around perforations. Analytical solutions are readily available to estimate compaction, subsidence, and casing damage risks. These should be applied as initial screening tools at an early stage in reservoir development planning. They also can be applied to estimate relative risks for various well locations and trajectories. Geomechanical models of increasing complexity, including 2D and 3D finite element type techniques, have been used with good success to assess formation deformation and casing damage risks in several reservoirs and are described herein. Three-dimensional geomechanical models at the wellbore scale are required to evaluate shearing deformation on specific well designs and are used to assess damage mitigation effectiveness for varying completion strategies. An economic decision tree model is applied to compare the costs and benefits of alternative well designs while taking into account inherent uncertainties in model input data, the well's damage location. and the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies. In some instances, the appropriate action is not to change the completion design, but simply to accept damage risk.

The classification task consisted of identifying an individual cow's milk-yield test as being either outlier or non-outlier Experiments were carried out to explore the importance of deriving predictive attributes and choice of machine-learning technique. Data consisted of 1080 milk yield tests, of which 108 had been classified as outliers by a dairy nutrition specialist and 972 cases had been classified as non-outliers. Two different approaches to machine learning were applied to these data: decision-tree induction and naive-Bayes classification. Performance of the classifiers was estimated through ten-fold cross-validation, while relative operating characteristic curves were used to visualize the achieved trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Use of an initial set of derived attributes significantly improved the performance compared to limiting attributes to those available to the domain specialist. However, adding even more complex attributes did not necessarily improve the classification performance. Overall, the naive-Bayes approach showed significantly better performance than decision-tree induction. For each machine-learning approach, three final classifiers, associated with a low, medium, and high filtering intensity, were generated from the 1080 cases. The expected true positive rate varied from 41% to 78% for false positive rates between 1.1% and 4.6%. However, due to the low prevalence of outlier tests, this performance was associated with a large number of false positives. The domain specialist considered the final classifiers of both approaches as plausible, but found the decision trees easier to understand than the naive-Bayes classifiers. Machine learning was considered to be a promising approach to assist knowledge acquisition.

The objective of this study is to develop a model to estimate the average cost per measles case and per adverse event following measles immunisation using the Netherlands (NL), the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada as examples. Methods: Parameter estimates were based on a review of the published literature. A decision tree was built to represent the complications associated with measles cases and adverse events following imminisation. Monte-Carlo Simulation techniques were used to account for uncertainty. Results: From the perspective of society, we estimated the average cost per measles case to be US$ 276, US$ 307 and US$ 254 for the NL, the UK and Canada, respectively, and the average cost of adverse events following immunisation per vaccinee to be US$ 1.43, US$ 1.93 and US$ 1.51 for the NL, UK and Canada, respectively. Conclusions: These average cost estimates could be combined with incidence estimates and costs of immunisation programmes to provide estimates of the cost of measles to industrialised countries. Such estimates could be used as a basis to estimate the potential economic gains of global measles eradication.

STUDY DESIGN: A decision-tree model incorporating a Markov analysis was used to compare the decision either to electively induce labor at term or expectantly manage the pregnancy until 42 weeks' gestation. Main outcome measures, stratified by parity, cervical ripeness, and gestational age at induction, were number of cesarean deliveries and costs to the health care system. RESULTS: By use of baseline estimates, induction at any gestational age, regardless of parity and cervical ripeness, required expenditures from the medical system. Although never cost saving, inductions were less expensive at later gestational ages, for multiparous patients, and for those women with a favorable cervix. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated a robust model. CONCLUSIONS: Elective induction of labor at term is not cost saving and results in a large excess of cesarean deliveries. Costs are significantly altered by the timing of the induction, parity, and cervical ripeness.

Owing to alarming resistance rates among invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, particularly in young children, macrolide use should be restricted to patients infected with susceptible pathogens, eg, Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Objective: To develop a simple clinical prediction rule for identifying M pneumoniae as the cause of CAP in children. Design and Setting: Prospective cohort study in 253 children with radiologically confirmed CAP in a walk-in clinic of a tertiary care hospital. Main Outcome Measures: Mycoplasma infection, proven by results of antibody testing of paired serum samples (gold standard). We compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (c statistic) of the following 2 prediction models: a scoring system derived from logistic regression analysis and a fast-and-frugal decision tree. Results: Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was confirmed in 32 (13%) of 253 children. A scoring system based on duration of fever and patient age yielded a c statistic of 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-0.91), compared with that of the decision tree (c=0.76 [95% CI, 0.70-0.83]). The scoring system identified 75% of all cases as being at high or very high risk for M pneumoniae infection; the decision tree, 72% at high risk. The scoring system would curtail macrolide prescriptions by 75%; the decision tree, by 68%. Conclusions: In children with CAP, simple clinical decision rules identify patients at risk for M pneumoniae infection. At present US macrolide resistance rates among invasive S pneumoniae isolates, both rules increase the chance of prescribing effective first-line antibiotics compared with general macrolide administration.

Unlike least-squares regression trees, which concentrate on modelling the relationship between the response and the covariates at the Centre of the response distribution, our quantile regression trees can provide insight into the nature of that relationship at the Centre as well as the tails of the response distribution. Our nonparametric regression quantiles have piecewise polynomial forms, where each piece is obtained by fitting a polynomial quantile regression model to the data in a terminal node of a binary decision tree. The decision tree is constructed by recursively partitioning the data based on repeated analyses of the residuals obtained after model fitting with quantile regression. One advantage of the tree structure is that it provides a simple summary of the interactions among the covariates. The asymptotic behaviour of piecewise polynomial quantile regression estimates and the associated derivative estimates are studied under appropriate regularity conditions. The methodology is illustrated with an example on the incidence rates of mumps in the United States.

The French regional cancer network Oncora investigated the decision-making process for this disease. Based on a thorough review of the literature, the risk of relapse and the potential benefit of adjuvant treatments for each group of patients were evaluated. A consensus decision-tree was drawn in which chemotherapy is proposed only to patients in whom it is expected to decrease the risk of relapse by at least 5 %. This approach, based on a widely accepted decision-making model, makes it possible to offer all patients of the network homogeneous treatment options. However, due to the subjectivity of risk/benefit estimations, patients themselves should become more involved in the decision-making process.

Because single biomarkers most likely will not be found that are expressed by all genetic forms of PCA, we evaluated and developed a proteomic approach for the simultaneous detection and analysis of multiple proteins for the differentiation of PCA from noncancer patients. Methods: Serum samples from 386 men [197 with PCA, 92 with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and 96 healthy individuals), randomly divided into training (n = 326) and test (n = 60) sets, were analyzed by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) mass spectrometry. The 124 peaks detected by computer analyses were analyzed in the training set by a boosting tree algorithm to develop a classifier for separating PCA from the noncancer groups. The classifier was then challenged with the test set (30 PCA samples, 15 BPH samples, 15 samples from healthy men) to determine the validity and accuracy of the classification system. Results: Two classifiers were developed. The AdaBoost classifier completely separated the PCA from the noncancer samples, achieving 100% sensitivity and specificity. The second classifier, the Boosted Decision Stump Feature Selection classifier, was easier to interpret and used only 21 (compared with 74) peaks and a combination of 21 (vs 500) base classifiers to achieve a sensitivity and specificity of 97% for the test set. Conclusions: The high sensitivity and specificity achieved in this study provides support of the potential for SELDI, coupled with a bioinformatics learning algorithm, to improve the early detection/diagnosis of PCA.

J	Xu, J; Lipton, RJ				Xu, J; Lipton, RJ			On fundamental tradeoffs between delay bounds and computational complexity in packet scheduling algorithms	COMPUTER COMMUNICATION REVIEW			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	ACM SIGCOMM 2002 Conference	AUG 19-23, 2002	PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA	ACM		computational complexity; packet scheduling; Quality of Service; delay bound; decision tree	FAIR	In this work, we clarify, extend and solve an open problem concerning the computational complexity for packet scheduling algorithms to achieve tight end-to-end delay bounds. We first focus on the difference between the time a packet finishes service in a scheduling algorithm and its virtual finish time under a CPS (General Processor Sharing) scheduler, called GPS-relative delay. We prove that, under a slightly restrictive but reasonable computational model, the lower bound computational complexity of any scheduling algorithm that guarantees O(1) CPS-relative delay bound is Omega(log(2)n) (widely believed as a "folklore theorem" but never proved). We also discover that, surprisingly, the complexity lower bound remains the same even if the delay bound is relaxed to O(n(a)) for 0 < a < 1. This implies that the delay-complexity tradeoff curve is "flat" in the "interval" [O(1), O(n)). We later extend both complexity results (for O(1) or O(n(a)) delay) to a much stronger computational model. Finally, we show that the same complexity lower bounds are conditionally applicable to guaranteeing tight end-to-end delay bounds. This is done by untangling the relationship between the GPS-relative delay bound and the end-to-end delay bound.

This paper focuses on design and configuration of high-level optimization systems (wrappers) for relevance determination and constructive induction, and on integrating these wrappers with elicited knowledge on attribute relevance and synthesis. In particular, we discuss decision support issues for the application (cost prediction for automobile insurance markets in several states) and report experiments using D2K, a Java-based visual programming system for data mining and information visualization, and several commercial and research tools. We describe exploratory clustering, descriptive statistics, and supervised decision tree learning in this application, focusing on a parallel genetic algorithm (GA) system, Jenesis, which is used to implement relevance determination (attribute subset selection). Deployed on several high-performance network-of-workstation systems (Beowulf clusters), Jenesis achieves a linear speedup, due to a high degree of task parallelism. Its test set accuracy is significantly higher than that of decision tree inducers alone and is comparable to that of the best extant search-space based wrappers.

We determined the expected utilities of global patients (P, n = 67) and coronary territories (T; n = 126) with the classic strategy: DSE 1 and results of a rest follow-up echocardiogram (REST 2) and applying them to a complementary strategy that submitted false positives (Fp) and false negatives (Fn) results to DSE 2. Assigned utilities in each node of the decision tree were maximal (1.0), submaximal (0.75), and intermedium (0.50) using the folding method as a mathematical model. Results: Global P and T expected utilities when performing DSE 1 were 0.84 and 0.89, respectively for positive viability; 0.85 and 0.82, respectively; and for negative viability 0.83 and 0.82, respectively. The expected utilities with the decision of performing a DSE 2 to Fp were 0.74 and 0.76, respectively (viability was detected in 66% of P and in 58% of T) and 0.47 and 0.45, respectively, as applied to Fn. Conclusions: Low dose DSE results in high clinical utility by finding viable or scar myocardium before CABG as well as when discordant results are found in follow-up, particularly with Fp.

Collaborative filtering has been known to be one of the most successful recommendation methods, but its application to e-commerce has exposed well-known limitations such as sparsity and scalability, which would lead to poor recommendations. This paper suggests a personalized recommendation methodology by which we are able to get further effectiveness and quality of recommendations when applied to an Internet shopping mall. The suggested methodology is based on a variety of data mining techniques such as web usage mining, decision tree induction, association rule mining and the product taxonomy. For the evaluation of the methodology, we implement a recommender system using intelligent agent and data warehousing technologies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

An ecosystem approach for determining environmental water allocations in dryland regions is presented in this paper. This four-step process involves (1) a hierarchical characterisation of the river system, to assess what mesohabitats are present and where they are located; (2) the determination of flows that would inundate these habitats and perform other key ecological processes; (3) hydrological analyses in which the key hydrological signatures of the river are identified and the impact of water resource development on these is determined and (4) the derivation of a water management decision tree that enables managers to allocate water to consumptive users during individual flood pulses (events). It is recommended that the flood pulse should be the focus for environmental flow management in dryland regions. If rivers are indeed nested hierarchies, then a change in hydrological behaviour at the scale of a flood pulse will, with time, extend throughout the hydrological hierarchy. Current environmental flow management strategies in dryland river systems are essentially focused at the flow regime and history scale; this is inappropriate given the inherent flow variability of these systems. The ecosystem approach is outlined for the Condamine-Balonne River, a large dryland system in Australia. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Establishing the spatio-temporal correspondence is a problem with combinatorial complexity in the number of objects and views. In addition vision-based tracking suffers from the ambiguities introduced by occlusion, clutter and irregular 3D motion. In this paper we present a discrete relaxation algorithm for reducing the intrinsic combinatorial complexity by pruning the decision tree based on unreliable prior information from independent 2D-tracking for each view. The algorithm improves the reliability of spatio-temporal correspondence by simultaneous optimisation over multiple views in the case where 2D-tracking in one or more views are ambiguous. Application to the 3D reconstruction of human movement, based on tracking of skin-coloured regions in three views, demonstrates considerable improvement in reliability and performance. Results demonstrate that the optimisation over multiple views gives correct 3D reconstruction and object labelling in the presence of incorrect 2D-tracking whilst maintaining real-time performance.

While most previous studies deal with the situation where the aggregate functions are applied to all cells in a given range, this paper considers a class of queries, called the Partial-MAX/MIN query, that are applied only to specified cells in a given range. We propose the Rank Index and Rank Decision Tree (RD-Tree) for efficient processing of the partial-max/min queries. Through experiments, we show our approach has an efficient and robust processing capability for partial-max/min queries. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Weeding performance was analysed at the aggregate, farm and field level using survey data for three crop seasons. Farmer decision-making for weeding was modelled using a hierarchical decision-tree. Rainfall, termites, fertilizer use and labour supply were identified as the main determinants of timely weeding. Farmers had developed specific weeding techniques to cope with these contingencies. Understanding weeding as a farmer 'performance' highlights the importance of diagnostic research to codify farmer knowledge and exposes the limitations of prescriptive research recommendations based on a fixed, predetermined plan. We argue that in the short- to medium-term, the most effective strategy for improving the timeliness of weeding is to increase the effective demand for hired labour. This will require crop management interventions that improve the ability of the farming system to generate cash income for reinvestment.

Patients and Methods: Nine hundred twelve women underwent breast-conserving surgery, axillary dissection, and radiation. Systemic therapy was chemotherapy with or without tamoxifen in 32%, tamoxifen in 27%, or none in 41%. RPA was used to create a decision tree according to predictive variables that classify patients by IBTR risk, and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate 10-year risks. Median follow-up was 5.9 years. Results: Age was the first split in the partition tree. Patients more than 55 years old had a 4% 10-year IBTR, the only further division being use of tamoxifen or not (2% v 5%, P = .03). For patients less than or equal to 55 years, old, extensive intraductal component (EIC) was the next significant split. For EIC-negative tumors, age less than or equal to 35 years and negative margins were associated with a 10-year IBTR of 3%, with close (less than or equal to 2 mm) or positive margins, 34%. Patients 36 to 55 years old with estrogen receptor-positive tumors receiving tamoxifen had a risk of IBTR of 5%, but had a 20% risk without tamoxifen. Conclusion: This RPA showed that age less than or equal to 55 versus. more than 55 years was the most significant factor for IBTR. Patients less than or equal to 35 years old had a low risk of IBTR when tumors were EIC-negative with negative margins. EIC was an independent factor for IBTR for ages less than or equal to 55 years. Use of tamoxifen was the most significant factor for patients older than 55 years, but it resulted in a greater absolute decrease in risk of IBTR for patients 36 to 55 years old.

J	Markovitch, S; Rosenstein, D				Markovitch, S; Rosenstein, D			Feature generation using general constructor functions	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						constructive induction; feature generation; decision tree learning		Most classification algorithms receive as input a set of attributes of the classified objects. In many cases, however, the supplied set of attributes is not sufficient for creating an accurate, succinct and comprehensible representation of the target concept. To overcome this problem, researchers have proposed algorithms for automatic construction of features. The majority of these algorithms use a limited predefined set of operators for building new features. In this paper we propose a generalized and flexible framework that is capable of generating features from any given set of constructor functions. These can be domain-independent functions such as arithmetic and logic operators. or domain-dependent operators that rely on partial knowledge on the part of the user. The paper describes an algorithm which receives as input a set of classified objects, a set of attributes. and a specification for a set of constructor functions that contains their domains, ranges and properties The algorithm produces as output a set of generated features that can be used by standard concept learners to create improved classifiers. The algorithm maintains a set of its best generated features and improves this set iteratively. During each iteration, the algorithm performs abeam search over its defined feature space and constructs new features by applying constructor functions to the members of its current feature set. The search is guided by general heuristic measures that are not confined to a specific feature representation. The algorithm was applied to a variety of classification problems and was able to generate features that were strongly related to the underlying target concepts.

To evaluate the economic impact of universal Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccination starting at 2 months of age. Methods. Decision-tree-based analysis was conducted of a hypothetical US birth cohort of 3 815 469 infants using population-based vaccination coverage and disease incidence data. All costs were estimated from both the direct cost (medical and nonmedical) and societal perspectives. Net present value, cost-effectiveness ratios, and benefit-cost ratios of the US Hib vaccination program were evaluated. Results. The results of these analyses showed that the universal vaccination program using the Hib conjugate vaccines in the United States in 2000 was cost-saving from both the direct and societal perspectives, with the benefit of the Hib vaccination program (net present value) from the direct cost and societal perspectives of $0.95 billion and $2.09 billion, respectively. Without a Hib vaccination program, the direct and societal costs of Hib invasive cases would be $1.35 billion and $2.58 billion, respectively. The direct and societal costs of the Hib vaccination program were estimated at $0.39 billion and $0.48 billion, respectively. The direct and societal benefit-cost ratios for the Hib vaccination program were 3.4 and 5.4, respectively. Varying the proportion of vaccines purchased and administered in the public versus the private sector and the proportion of combination vaccine versus monovalent vaccine administered did not have much effect on the results. Conclusions. Regardless of the perspective (direct cost or societal) and the assumptions used, the benefit-cost ratios of the US vaccination program are >1.0. Potential changes in the program, including use of more or less Hib combination vaccines, would not significantly alter the benefit-cost ratio. The national Hib vaccination program is highly cost beneficial and results in substantial cost savings.

J	Asberg, A; Tretli, S; Hveem, K; Bjerve, KS				Asberg, A; Tretli, S; Hveem, K; Bjerve, KS			Benefit of population-based screening for phenotypic hemochromatosis in young men	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY			English	Article						benefit; hemochromatosis; QALY; screening	COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS; MEDICAL DECISION-MAKING; IRON-BINDING-CAPACITY; PRIMARY-CARE PATIENTS; LONG-TERM SURVIVAL; HEREDITARY HEMOCHROMATOSIS; BLOOD-DONORS; HIGH PREVALENCE; CHILDREN; LIFE	Background: Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common genetic disease leading to accumulation of iron in the body, most notably in the liver. More men than women become clinically ill. The prognosis is excellent if phlebotomy treatment is started before liver cirrhosis develops. Screening has been recommended, but the benefit of population-based screening has never been shown in a randomized clinical trial. In this article, we estimate the benefit of screening young men, using a theoretical model. Methods: A phenotypic screening scenario was modelled using a decision tree. Gain of quality-adjusted life-years was used as a measure of benefit, and estimated using Markov processes. Data on the accuracy of the screening tests, the prevalence of HH and the risk of liver cirrhosis were mainly derived from a cross-sectional study on the prevalence and morbidity of HH in 30509 men. Data on the excess mortality of cirrhosis were taken from relevant literature. Sensitivity analysis was done for important variables. Results: Assuming basal case values for variables, screening a cohort of 1000 men aged 30 years for phenotypic HH would gain about 8 quality-adjusted life-years, compared to awaiting symptomatic disease. Based on actual costs of our cross-sectional study, the screening cost was US$ 250 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. The prevalence of phenotypic HH, the excess mortality of liver cirrhosis, the quality of life in non-cirrhotic HH patients, and the fractions of patients compliant with treatment were the most important variables in the sensitivity analysis. Conclusion: Incorporating screening for phenotypic HH in health survey programmes for young men may be worthwhile.

J	Dubuisson, S; Davoine, F; Masson, M				Dubuisson, S; Davoine, F; Masson, M			A solution for facial expression representation and recognition	SIGNAL PROCESSING-IMAGE COMMUNICATION			English	Article						facial expression recognition; dimensionality reduction; feature selection and extraction; classifier design	OBJECT REPRESENTATION; FACE RECOGNITION; CLASSIFICATION; EIGENFACES	The design of a recognition system requires careful attention to pattern representation and classifier design. Some statistical approaches choose those features, in a d-dimensional initial space, which allow sample vectors belonging to different categories to occupy compact and disjoint regions in a low-dimensional subspace. The effectiveness of the representation subspace is then determined by how well samples from different classes can be separated. In this paper, we propose a feature selection process that sorts the principal components, generated by principal component analysis, in the order of their importance to solve a specific recognition task. This method provides a low-dimensional representation subspace which has been optimized to improve the classification accuracy. We focus on the problem of facial expression recognition to demonstrate this technique. We also propose a decision tree-based classifier that provides a "coarse-to-fine" classification of new samples by successive projections onto more and more precise representation subspaces. Results confirm, first, that the choice of the representation strongly influences the classification results, second that a classifier has to be designed for a specific representation.

Our system takes as input microscopic images of two hairs and produces a classification decision as to whether or not the hairs came from the same person. Hair images were captured using a NEXTDimension(TM) video board in a NEXTDimension(TM) color turbo computer, connected to a video camera. linage processing was done on an SGI indigo workstation. Each image is segmented into a number of pieces appropriate for classification of different features. A variety of image processing techniques are used to enhance this information. Use of wavelet analysis and the Haralick texture algorithm to pre-process data has allowed us to compress large amounts of data into smaller, yet representative data. Neural networks are then used for feature classification. Finally, statistical tests determine the degree of match between the resulting collection of hair feature vectors. An important issue in automation of any task in criminal investigations is the reliability and understandability of the resulting system. To address this concern, we have developed methods to facilitate explanation of neural network's behavior using a decision tree. The system was able to achieve a performance of 83% hair match accuracy, using 5 of the 21 morphological characteristics used by experts. This shows promise for the usefulness of a fuller scale system. While an automated system would not replace the expert, it would make the task easier by providing a means for pre-processing the large amount of data with which the expert must contend.

This paper has developed a dimensional variation diagnostic reasoning and decision approach through the combination of data mining (DM) and knowledge discovery techniques. Correlation analysis (CA) and maximal tree (MT) methods were applied to extract the large variation group from massive multi-dimensional measured data, while the multi-variate statistical analysis (MSA) approach was used to discover the principle variation pattern. A decision tree (DT) approach based on knowledge of product and assembly process was developed to fulfill the "hypothesis and validation" characterized variation causes reasoning procedure. The established decision support analysis (DSA) approach for sheet metal assembly variation diagnosis has been proven to be effective and efficient through practical implementation.

J	El-Serag, HB; Graham, DY; Richardson, P; Inadomi, JM				El-Serag, HB; Graham, DY; Richardson, P; Inadomi, JM			Prevention of complicated ulcer disease among chronic users of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs - The use of a nomogram in cost-effectiveness analysis	ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article							UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL TOXICITY; ANTIINFLAMMATORY DRUGS; PEPTIC-ULCER; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; HELICOBACTER-PYLORI; CONTROLLED TRIAL; DUODENAL-ULCERS; ELDERLY PERSONS; HIGH-RISK; MISOPROSTOL	Background: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with an increased risk of clinical upper gastrointestinal tract (UGI) events, namely, symptomatic ulcer, perforation, bleeding, and obstruction. Our objective in this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of several strategies aimed at reducing the risk of clinical UGI events in NSAID users. Methods: A decision tree model was used for patients requiring long-term treatment with NSAIDs to compare conventional NSAID therapy alone with 7 other treatment strategies to reduce the risk of NSAID-related clinical UGI events (cotherapy with proton-pump inhibitor, cotherapy with misoprostol, cyclooxygenase [COX]-2-selective NSAID therapy, or Helicobacter pylori treatment followed by each of the previous strategies, including conventional NSAID treatment, respectively). The outcome measure is the incremental cost per clinical UGI event prevented compared with conventional NSAID treatment over 1 year. Results: The use of a COX-2-selective NSAID and cotherapy with proton-pump inhibitors were the 2 most cost-effective strategies. However, the incremental cost associated with these strategies was high (>$35000) in persons with a low risk of clinical UGI event with conventional NSAIDs (eg, 2.5% per year). If the baseline risk of clinical UGI events is moderately high (eg, 6.5%), using a COX-2-selective NSAID becomes the most effective and least costly (dominant) treatment strategy, followed closely by cotherapy with a daily proton-pump inhibitor. Because small changes in costs or assumed efficacy of these drugs could change the conclusions, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios between any 2 strategies were presented in a nomogram that allows the flexible use of a wide range of values for costs and rates of clinical UGI events. Conclusions: The risk of clinical UGI events in NSAID users depends on their baseline risk, the added risk associated with the individual NSAID, and the protection conferred by cotherapy. A nomogram can be used to incorporate these factors and derive estimates regarding cost-effectiveness of competing strategies aimed at reducing the risk of clinical UGI events.

However, translating such a model into field application requires a stepwise approach. This article describes a decision tree developed to assist public health workers in determining which contacts are most likely to have a positive tuberculin skin test. The Classification and Regression Tree analysis was performed on 292 consecutive cases and their 2,941 contacts seen by the Alabama Department of Public Health from January 1, 1998, to October 15, 1998. Several decision trees were developed and were then tested using prospectively collected data from 366 new tuberculosis cases and their 3,162 contacts from October 15, 1998, to April 30, 2000. Testing showed the trees to have sensitivities of 87-94%, specificities of 22-28%, and false-negative rates between 7 and 10%. The use of the decision trees would decrease the number of contacts investigated by 17-25% while maintaining a false-negative rate that was close to that of the presumed background rate of latent tuberculosis infection in the state of Alabama.

J	Billingham, J				Billingham, J			Pesek lecture: SETI and society - Decision trees	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article								This paper presents a simplified decision tree diagram for SETI (the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) and society. It deals with the series of steps and circumstances that follow from the quest for evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations, with the major goal of including those branch points which involve decisions that are societal rather than scientific or technological. Since SETI is based on science and technology these factors are also included in the decision diagram, but more in a summary fashion. A condensed list of the relevant societal disciplines is given. The most difficult decisions are those related to issues of transmitting communications from Earth to ETI. The diagram may be useful as a new way of looking at the subject of Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CETI), and how it inevitably blends into SETI. Arguments are made for vigorous pursuit of studies in all the societal cultural and behavioral domains involved, and it is shown that many of these studies can profitably be undertaken now, before an ETI signal has been detected. Not least, it is argued that the newly emerging field of CETI and Society would benefit materially from the application of formal decision theory and analysis, and from game theory and utility theory.

STUDY DESIGN: A decision tree was designed that compared four strategies for a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 women with a previous classic cesarean delivery: (1) delivery at 39 weeks of gestation, (2) delivery at 36 weeks of gestation without amniocentesis, (3) amniocentesis at 36 weeks of gestation with delivery if the fetus was mature and antenatal corticosteroids if the fetus was immature, and (4) weekly amniocentesis starting at 36 weeks of gestation with delivery when mature. RESULTS: Strategy 2 provided the greatest maternal quality-adjusted life years. Comparing strategy 1 with strategy 2, it was determined that 27 cesarean deliveries must be performed at 36 weeks of gestation with one associated case of respiratory distress syndrome to prevent one case of uterine rupture. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the uterine rupture rate must be below 0.36% for any strategy to surpass strategy 2 (elective cesarean delivery at 36 weeks of gestation without amniocentesis). CONCLUSION: A 36-week delivery may be preferable because it provides a lower risk of severe adverse outcomes and higher maternal quality of life.

STUDY DESIGN: A decision tree was designed that compared four possible screens for Down syndrome: (1) current second-trimester expanded maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein test (AFP), (2) first-trimester nuchal translucency screen, (3) first-trimester serum screen, and (4) combined first-trimester screen with both nuchal translucency screen and a serum screen. Incremental cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated that compared the first-trimester screens with expanded alpha-fetoprotein. RESULTS: The combined screen (nuchal translucency screen + first-trimester serum screen) identified 3833 Down syndrome fetuses, the nuchal translucency alone identified 3413 Down syndrome fetuses, and the first-trimester serum screen identified 2993 Down syndrome fetuses. Each of these screens was an improvement over the current expanded AFP screen, which diagnosed 2446 Down syndrome fetuses. It would cost $98,381 for each additional Down syndrome case that would be identified by nuchal translucency alone, with a benefit-to-cost ratio of 4.85. The addition of the first-trimester serum screen is still cost-effective compared with expanded AFP; the cost would be $319,934 for each additional Down syndrome fetus who was identified, which would be a benefit-to-cost ratio of 1.57. CONCLUSION: First-trimester screening for Down syndrome with nuchal translucency screening alone or with serum markers is more clinically effective and cost-effective than the current expanded AFP screen that is being used.

Purpose: To determine the optimal management by using expected-value decision analysis. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Outcome probabilities were determined from a systematic literature review, and patient-derived utility values were obtained from a visual analog scale questionnaire. A decision tree was constructed, and fold-back analysis was used to determine optimal treatment. Sensitivity analyses were used to determine the effect of varying outcome probabilities and utilities on decision-making. Results: Outcome probabilities (expressed as operative; nonoperative) were as follows: well (0.762; 0.846), rerupture (0.022; 0.121), major complication (0.030; 0.025), moderate complication (0.075; 0.003), and mild complication (0.111; 0.005). Outcome utility values were well operative (7.9), well nonoperative (7.0), rerupture (2.6), major complication (1.0), moderate complication (3.5), and mild complication (4.7). Fold-back analysis revealed operative treatment as the optimal management strategy (6.89 versus 6.30). Threshold values were determined for the probability of a moderate complication from operative treatment (0.21) and the utility of rerupture (6.8). Conclusions: Operative management was the optimal strategy, given the outcome probabilities and patient utilities we studied. Nonoperative management was favored by increasing rates of operative complications; operative, by decreasing utility of rerupture. We advocate a model of doctor-patient shared decision-making in which both outcome probabilities and patient preferences are considered. (C) 2002 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.

Consequently, resistance to pepsinolysis has become incorporated into decision tree assessment for potential allergenic risk posed by novel foods. However, existing methods take little account of the interaction between food structure and physiological conditions existing during digestion in vivo. Here we show that a range of protein allergens can adsorb to model stomach emulsions, providing a further means of resisting digestion. We also show that raising the pH and the addition of bile salts to a model stomach emulsion, thereby mimicking the duodenal environment, has the effect of desorbing the adsorbed protein.

During the summer of 2000, airborne hyperspectral data were collected three times at two field sites in southwestern Quebec, Canada. One field site contained 24 plots (20 m by 24 m) that were amended with manure treatments and planted with maize and soya beans. The second field site contained 18 plots (18.5 m by 75 m) that received chemical fertilisers and were planted with maize. Reflectances of 71 wave bands of hyperspectral data (400 nm for violet to 940 nm for near infrared) were collected from 5 subplots within each of the 42 plots. The decision-tree algorithm of data mining technology was used to distinguish between manure and chemical fertiliser treatments. The decision-tree algorithm divides the data to reduce the deviance, and classifies them into the pre-defined categories as many tree branches. The success of the classification rate was as high as 91% for the early planting season, 99% for the mid-planting season, and 95% for the late planting season. The accuracy of the results demonstrates that data mining technology could be used for remote-sensing imagery classification of fertiliser applications. (C) 2002 Silsoe Research Institute.

To identify critical processing inputs in large databases, we have explored the use of Decision Tree Analysis with the decision metrics of Gain (i.e., Shannon Entropy changes), Gain Ratio, and a multiple hypergeometric distribution. The usefulness of this approach lies in its ability to treat "categorical" variables, which are typical of archived fermentation databases, as well as "continuous" variables. In this work, we demonstrate the use of Decision Tree Analysis for the problem of optimizing recombinant green fluorescent protein production in E. coli. A database of 85 fermentations was generated to examine the effect of 15 process input parameters on final biomass yield, maximum recombinant protein concentration, and productivity. The use of Decision Tree Analysis led to a considerable reduction in the fermentation database through the identification of the significant as well as insignificant inputs. However, different decision metrics selected different inputs and different numbers of inputs to classify the data for each output.

J	Ayan, NF; Li, WS; Kolak, O				Ayan, NF; Li, WS; Kolak, O			Automating extraction of logical domains in a web site	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						logical domain; domain boundary; decision tree algorithm; information gain; WWW; link structures	INFORMATION	The domain name field in a universal resource locator (URL) has been viewed as a natural choice to organize Web pages. For example, Web search results may be grouped in terms of domains and presented to users as clusters for ease of visualization. However, using this approach, large Web sites, such as Geocities, W3C, and www.cs.umd.edu, tend to yield many matches that leads to a few large, flat structured, and unorganized clusters. As a matter of fact, many pages in these sites are actually "logical domains" by themselves. For example, Web sites for projects at a university or the XML section at W3C could be viewed as "logical domains". In this paper, we propose the concept of a logical domain, which is identified by semantic relatedness, as opposed to a physical domain, which is identified simply by domain name. The identification of logical domain is important to many Web applications, such as query result reorganization, site map generation, and topic distillation. We have developed and implemented a set of rules based on link structure, path information, document metadata, and citations to identify logical domain entry pages (i.e., root pages of logical domains). The importance of these rules are automatically adjusted using a novel decision tree algorithm and training data provided by human feedback. We also develop techniques to define the boundary of each logical domain based on identified logical domain entry pages. We have conducted extensive experiments on real Web sites to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques. The experimental results show that our techniques perform very well in extracting logical domains in a Web site. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Some products are identical to foods while others come close to or are medicines. Botanical products are regulated differently within the different member states of the European Union (EU) and globally. They are regulated either as food or as medicinal products, and in the latter case often with simplified registration procedures. These differences are caused by differences in traditional use, in cultural and historical background, in scientific substantiation and in enforcement of current legislation. One may expect that in the future differences will remain, unless EU legislation is enacted with sufficient room for different approaches. The strengths and weaknesses of the different regulatory procedures have been reviewed and evaluated as well as the current methods for quality, efficacy and safety evaluation. Criteria to categorize botanical products have been defined, such that botanical products can be regulated under the current food and medicinal regulations. Furthermore, a decision tree has been developed as a tool to distinguish herbal medicinal products from botanical health products and vice versa, and to provide a stepwise framework for the assessment of safety and efficacy.

While most of the work done in this area focuses on identifying and documenting business rules, we have proposed a methodology that addresses several aspects of the business rules lifecycle: acquisition, deployment and evolution. The methodology assumes that business rules are expressed in terms of business concepts and corporate knowledge that are captured in a high level architecture. The architecture proposed consists of three interconnected components: the enterprise model, the business rules model and the decision support model. This approach permits a greater variety of rules to be specified while providing an opportunity to automate the production of deployable business rules. The ability to deal with the inconsistent and ambiguous rules is crucial in capturing the conflicting requirements placed on the operation of any large scale enterprise. This paper presents a flexible deployment of business rules, which not only supports decision making in the face of conflicting requirements, but also the evolution of those requirements in the face of changing regulatory environments, competitive markets and corporate goals.

The quality of a segmentation is defined by an objective function suitable for the user's objective, such as "mean squared error," "mutual information," or "chi(2)," each of which is defined in terms of the distribution of a given target attribute. Our goal is to find value groups on a given conditional domain that split databases into two segments, optimizing the value of an objective function. Though the problem is intractable for general objective functions, there are feasible algorithms for finding high quality binary segmentations when the objective function is convex, and we prove that the typical criteria mentioned above are all convex. We propose two practical algorithms, based on computational geometry techniques, which find a much better value group than conventional heuristics.

A scheme far automatic linguistic discretization of continuous attributes, based on quantiles, is formulated. A novel concept for measuring the goodness of a decision tree, in terms of its compactness (size) and efficient performance, is introduced. Linguistic rules are quantitatively evaluated using new indices. The rules are mapped to a fuzzy knowledge-based network, incorporating the frequency of samples and depth of the attributes in the decision tree. New fuzziness measures, in terms of class memberships, are used at the, node level of the tree to take care of overlapping classes. The effectiveness of the system, in terms of recognition scores, structure of decision tree, performance of rules, and network size, is extensively demonstrated on three sets of real-life data.

A good online catalog is crucial to the success of an e-commerce web site. Traditionally, an online catalog is mainly built by hand. To what extent this can be automated is a challenging problem. Recently, there have been investigations on how to reorganize an existing online catalog based on some criteria, but none of them has addressed the problem of organizing an online catalog automatically from scratch. This paper attempts to tackle this problem. We model an online catalog organization as a decision tree structure and propose a metric, based on the popularity of products and the relative importance of product attribute values, to evaluate the quality of a catalog organization. The problem is then formulated as a decision tree construction problem. Although traditional decision tree algorithms, such as C4.5, can be used to generate online catalog organization, the catalog constructed is generally not good based on our metric. An efficient greedy algorithm (GENCAT) is thus developed, and the experimental results show that GENCAT produces better catalog organizations based on our metric.

The first classifier uses evolutionary optimization and boosting for learning fuzzy classification rules. The second classifier is a fuzzy neural network that employs a fuzzy variant of the classic backpropagation learning algorithm. The experiments are carried out on a real life credit scoring data set. It is shown that, for the case at hand, the boosted genetic fuzzy classifier performs better than both the neurofuzzy classifier and the well-known C4.5(rules) decision tree(rules) induction algorithm. However, the better performance of the genetic fuzzy classifier is offset by the fact that it infers approximate fuzzy rules which are less comprehensible for humans than the descriptive fuzzy rules inferred by the neurofuzzy classifier.

J	Cho, SB				Cho, SB			Exploring features and classifiers to classify gene expression profiles of acute leukemia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						biological data mining; feature selection; classification; gene expression profile; acute leukemia; AML; ALL	CLASSIFICATION; PATTERNS; CANCER	Bioinformatics has recently drawn a lot of attention to efficiently analyze biological genomic information with information technology, especially pattern recognition. In this paper, we attempt to explore extensive features and classifiers through a comparative study of the most promising feature selection methods and machine learning classifiers. The gene information from a patient's marrow expressed by DNA microarray, which is either the acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia, is used to predict the cancer class. Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients, Euclidean distance, cosine coefficient, information gain, mutual information and signal to noise ratio have been used for feature selection. Backpropagation neural network, self-organizing map, structure adaptive self-organizing map, support vector machine, inductive decision tree and k-nearest neighbor have been used for classification. Experimental results indicate that backpropagation neural network with Pearson's correlation coefficients produces the best result, 97.1% of recognition rate on the test data.

In response to budgetary pressure at our large county hospital we identified the cost components of laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection that could be targeted to decrease procedure costs before expanding our laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection program. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive literature review of open and laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection was performed and certain parameters were abstracted, including operative time and equipment, hospital stay, perioperative complications and surgical success rates. Using these data the projected overall cost and individual cost centers at our institution were compared for open and laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Decision tree analysis models were devised to estimate the cost of each treatment using commercially available software. We performed 1 and 2-way sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effect of individual treatment variables on overall cost. Base case analysis involved a young man with clinical stage I nonseminomatous testicular cancer who was a candidate for retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Results: Based on a review of the costs at our institution open retroperitoneal lymph node dissection was a less costly procedure at $7,162 versus $7,804 for the laparoscopic approach. The slight cost superiority of the open approach was due to significantly lower costs associated with operating room time and equipment. On the other hand, the laparoscopic procedure showed a cost advantage for hospital stay. On 1-way sensitivity analysis laparoscopic dissection was less costly when operative time was less than 3.6 hours, hospitalization was less than 2.2 days or laparoscopic equipment, costs were less than $768. On 2-way sensitivity analysis the laparoscopic approach was cost advantageous when performed in less than 5 hours or when the patient was discharged home within 2 days postoperatively. Conclusions: The primary cost variables for surgical treatment for testicular cancer include operative time, hospital stay and equipment cost. According to published data and decision tree analysis open retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is slightly less costly (less than $650) than laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for the surgical treatment of clinical stage I nonseminomatous testicular cancer at our institution. Our model identifies several measures that can be applied at any institution to render laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection economically superior to the open approach.

J	Zhou, ZH; Chen, ZQ				Zhou, ZH; Chen, ZQ			Hybrid decision tree	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						machine learning; knowledge acquisition; decision tree; neural networks; hybrid learning; incremental learning; constructive induction	NEURAL NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION TREES; INDUCTION; ALGORITHM; EXTRACTION	In this paper, a hybrid learning approach named hybrid decision tree (HDT) is proposed. HDT simulates human reasoning by using symbolic learning to do qualitative analysis and using neural learning to do subsequent quantitative analysis. It generates the trunk of a binary HDT according to the binary information gain ratio criterion in an instance space defined by only original unordered attributes. If unordered attributes cannot further distinguish training examples falling into a leaf node whose diversity is beyond the diversity-threshold, then the node is marked as a dummy node. After all those dummy nodes are marked, a specific feedforward neural network named FANNC that is trained in an instance space defined by only original ordered attributes is exploited to accomplish the learning task, Moreover, this paper distinguishes three kinds of incremental learning tasks. Two incremental learning procedures designed for example-incremental learning with different storage requirements are provided, which enables HDT to deal gracefully with data sets where new data are frequently appended. Also a hypothesis-driven constructive induction mechanism is provided, which enables HDT to generate compact concept descriptions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Morgan, SL				Morgan, SL			Modeling preparatory commitment and non-repeatable decisions: Information-processing, preference formation and educational attainment	RATIONALITY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						bounded rationality; decision theory; educational attainment; expectations	CHOICE	For many decisions with uncertain outcomes, prior preparation determines the payoffs received following choices. The payoff to an investment in human capital, for example, is a function of the ability to benefit from the course of training undertaken, and this ability is at least partly a function of one's self-regulated prior preparation. How should we use rational choice theory to model a goal-directed individual's preparatory commitment toward a consequential future decision if we cannot assume that preferences are fixed, that individuals engage in perfect information-processing, and that their expectations obey statistical decision theory? Introducing the concept of prefigurative commitment while invoking a stochastic decision tree for forecasts of future behavior, I show how a bounded rationality information-processing and evaluation mechanism generates courses of preparatory commitment decisions that differ from those that would result from strict adherence to orthodox decision theory. Throughout the development of the model, I discuss how the stochastic decision-tree framework can enhance sociological models of educational attainment.

J	Chen, YJ; Wu, CH; Chiu, YH; Liao, HC				Chen, YJ; Wu, CH; Chiu, YH; Liao, HC			Generation of robust phonetic set and decision tree for Mandarin using chi-square testing	SPEECH COMMUNICATION			English	Article						confusion characteristic; phonetic representation; decision tree; Mandarin speech recognition		A phonetic representation of a language is used to describe the corresponding pronunciation and synthesize the acoustic model of any vocabulary. A phonetic representation with smaller phonetic units such as SAMPA-C for Mandarin Chinese and decision trees for parameter sharing are broadly applied to deal with the problem of large numbers of recognition units. However, the confusable phonetic representation in SAMPA-C generally degrades the recognition performance. In this paper, a statistical method based on chi-square testing is used to investigate the phonetic unit characteristics that are confusing and develop a more reliable phonetic set, named modified SAMPA-C. A corresponding question set for the modified SAMPA-C and a two-level splitting criterion are also proposed to effectively and efficiently construct the decision trees. Experiments using continuous Mandarin telephone speech recognition were conducted. Experimental results show that an encouraging improvement in recognition performance can be obtained. The proposed approaches represent a good compromise between the demands of accurate acoustic modeling and the limitations imposed by insufficient training data. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

(1999)failed to demonstrate either that the framing bias is likely to be of salience in strategic decision making, or that causal cognitive mapping provides an effective means of limiting the damage accruing from this bias. In reply, we show that there is ample evidence to support both of our original claims. Moreover, using Wright and Goodwin's own data set, we demonstrate that our studies did in fact attain appropriate levels of ecological validity, and that their proposed alternative to causal cognitive mapping, a decision tree approach, is far from 'simpler.' Wright and Goodwin's approach not only fails to eliminate the framing bias-it leads to confusion. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

In this review, we describe a decision analysis model comparing technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile (Tc-99m sestamibi) scintimammography and excisional biopsy as breast cancer evaluation strategies for hypothetical cohorts of estimated 16,00040,000 women with indeterminate mammographic probability of malignancy because of mammographically dense breasts. In cost-effectiveness analysis, quantitative decision tree sensitivity analysis was used to compare the conventional excision biopsy alone strategy (strategy A) with decision strategy for screening with Tc-99m sestamibi scintimammography before excision biopsy (strategy B) after an indeterminate mammogram. Strategy B showed a cost saving of US dollars 649,600-1,624,000 in reducing the cost of unnecessary biopsies. The total cost of strategy B showed a cost saving of US dollars 123,075-307,776 compared to strategy A. The analysis data indicate that Tc-99rn sestamibi scintimammography can save the cost of unnecessary biopsies in Taiwanese women with non-diagnostic mammogram because of mammographically dense breasts.

It is concluded that free amino acid composition can constitute a basis for classifying and typifying these cultivars into five groups: (1) Marcona and Texas, (2) Ferragnes and Masbovera, (and probably Primorskyi), (3) Tuono and Guara, (4) Non Pareil (and probably Titan), and (5) an isolated cultivar (Desmayo Largueta). As a result, an easy decision tree is proposed to discriminate the cultivar of an almond flour, as used in confectionery, if it consists of a single cultivar.

This new approach yields simple learning algorithms for multivariate polynomials and decision trees over finite fields under any constant bounded product distribution. The output hypothesis is a (single) multivariate polynomial that is an epsilon-approximation of the target under any constant bounded product distribution. The new approach demonstrates the learnability of many classes under any constant bounded product distribution and using membership queries, such as j-disjoint disjunctive normal forms (DNFs) and multivariate polynomials with bounded degree over any field. The technique shows how to interpolate multivariate polynomials with bounded term size from membership queries only. This, in particular, gives a learning algorithm for an O(log n)-depth decision tree from membership queries only and a new learning algorithm of any multivariate polynomial over sufficiently large fields from membership queries only. We show that our results for learning from membership queries only are the best possible.

J	Fodor, IK; Kamath, C				Fodor, IK; Kamath, C			Dimension reduction techniques and the classification of bent double galaxies	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						data mining; exploratory data analysis; feature selection; dimension reduction; classification; decision trees; generalized linear models	RADIO	As data mining gains acceptance in the analysis of massive data sets, it is becoming clear that there is a need for algorithms that can handle not only the massive size, but also the high dimensionality of the data. Certain pattern recognition algorithms can become computationally intractable when the number of features reaches hundreds or even thousands, while others can break down if there are large correlations among the features. A common solution to these problems is to reduce the dimension, either in conjunction with the pattern recognition algorithm or independent of it. We describe how dimension reduction techniques can be applied in the context of a specific data mining application, namely, the classification of radio-galaxies with a bent double morphology. We discuss certain statistical and exploratory data analysis methods to reduce the number of features, and the subsequent improvements in the performance of decision tree and generalized linear model classifiers. We show that a careful extraction and selection of features is necessary for the successful application of data mining techniques. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hayes, TP; Kutin, S; van Melkebeek, D				Hayes, TP; Kutin, S; van Melkebeek, D			The quantum black-box complexity of majority	ALGORITHMICA			English	Article						majority function; quantum computing; query complexity; Las Vegas algorithms		We describe a quantum black-box network computing the majority of N bits with zero-sided error the correct answer with probability epsilon using only 2/3 N + O (rootN log(epsilon(-1) log N)) queries: the algorithm returns at least 1 - epsilon, and "I don't know" otherwise. Our algorithm is given as a randomized "XOR decision tree" for which the number of queries on any input is strongly concentrated around a value of at most 2/3 N. We provide a nearly matching lower bound of 2/3 N - O(rootN) on the expected number of queries on a worst-case input in the randomized XOR decision tree model with zero-sided error o(1). Any classical randomized decision tree computing the majority on N bits with zero-sided error 1/2 has cost N.

Aim: To analyse the cost of celecoxib (selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor) and conventional NSAID regimens for the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis from the perspective of a public health organization in Hong Kong. Methods: A decision tree was used to analyse the cost of celecoxib, NSAID alone, NSAID plus histamine2-receptor antagonist, NSAID plus misoprostol and NSAID plus proton pump inhibitor over 6 months. Model outcomes were no gastrointestinal toxicity, gastrointestinal discomfort, symptomatic ulcer, anaemia with occult bleeding and serious gastrointestinal complications. The clinical probabilities were estimated from clinical trials. Resource utilization for gastrointestinal events was determined locally. Sensitivity analysis was performed. Results: The 6-month costs per base-case analysis were as follows: NSAID plus histamine2-receptor antagonist, HK$1404 (1US$ = 7.8HK$); celecoxib, HK$1545; NSAID alone, HK$1610; NSAID plus misoprostol, HK$2213; NSAID plus proton pump inhibitor, HK$2857. The model was sensitive to the patients' underlying gastrointestinal risk scores, daily cost of NSAID regimen, risk ratio of NSAID plus histamine2-receptor antagonist for symptomatic ulcer, daily cost of celecoxib and daily cost of histamine2-receptor antagonist. Conclusions: Celecoxib appeared to be the least costly alternative in patients with intermediate to high gastrointestinal risk for the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in Hong Kong.

While modelling distributions of individual species is the best known and most widely used approach to such modelling, there are many situations in which more information can be extracted from available data by supplementing, or replacing, species-level modelling with modelling of communities or assemblages. This paper provides an overview of approaches to community-level modelling employed in a series of major land-use planning processes in the northeast New South Wales region of Australia, and evaluates how well communities and assemblages derived using these techniques function as surrogates in regional conservation planning. We also outline three new directions that may enhance the effectiveness of community-level modelling by: ( 1) more closely integrating modelling with traditional ecological mapping ( e. g. vegetation mapping); ( 2) more tightly linking numerical classification and spatial modelling through application of canonical classification techniques; and ( 3) enhancing the applicability of modelling to data-poor regions through employment of a new technique for modelling spatial pattern in compositional dissimilarity.

J	Molina, JM; Garcia, J; Jimenez, FJ; Casar, JR				Molina, JM; Garcia, J; Jimenez, FJ; Casar, JR			Surveillance multisensor management with fuzzy evaluation of sensor task priorities	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						surveillance systems; radar management; multisensor coordination; fuzzy inference systems; multiple criteria evaluation		In this contribution a fuzzy management scheme is proposed to cope with the evaluation of multisensor tasks priority in defence surveillance applications. Based on all fused track and sector data, a reasoning system determines the priority of each surveillance task to perform during the decision cycle, by means of a symbolic inference process inspired in the behaviour of human operators. This approach allows to integrate high-level information (possibly subjective concepts, considering also their uncertainty) with conventional numeric representations in the decision process. The elected formal method to represent the variables involved in this decision process is the theory of possibility and fuzzy sets, since it offers a unified framework to represent uncertainty knowledge. In this sense, to obtain the priority for each task, the reasoning process relies on a decision tree whose nodes are linguistic variables representing intermediate concepts used by a human operator to determine the tasks priorities. The validity of the fuzzy reasoning approach is supported by the fact that it has been able to manage environmental situations in a similar way as experienced human operators do. Included results illustrate how the importance of the tasks, measured through their time-varying priorities, allows the manager to timely adapt sensor operation to changing situations.

To meet these requirements, efficient scheduling methods are important for traffic control in the ATM networks. Among the general scheduling schemes, the rate monotonic algorithm is simple enough to be used in high-speed networks, but it does not attain as high a system utilization as the deadline driven algorithm does. However, the deadline driven scheme is computationally complex and hard to implement in hardware. The mixed scheduling algorithm is the combination of the rate monotonic algorithm and the deadline driven algorithm; thus it can provide most of the benefits of these two algorithms. In this paper, we use the mixed scheduling algorithm to achieve high system utilization under the hardware constraint. Because there is no analytic method for the schedulability test of the mixed scheduling, we propose a genetic algorithm-based neural fuzzy decision tree (GANFDT) to realize it in a real-time environment. The GANFDT combines the GA and a neural fuzzy network into a binary classification tree. This approach also exploits the power of the classification tree. Simulation results show that the GANFDT provides an efficient way to carry out the mixed scheduling in the ATM networks.

To facilitate intelligent access to the rich multimedia data over the Internet, we develop an on-line knowledge- and rule-based video classification system that supports automatic "indexing" and "filtering" based on the semantic concept hierarchy. This paper investigates the use of video and audio content analysis, feature extraction and clustering techniques for further video semantic concept classification. A supervised rule-based video classification system is proposed using video automatic segmentation, annotation and summarization techniques for seamless information browsing and updating. In the proposed system, a real-time scene-change detection proxy performs an initial video-structuring process by splitting a video clip into scenes. Motional, visual and audio features are extracted in real-time for every detected scene by using on-line feature-extraction proxies. Higher semantics are then derived through a joint use of low-level features along with classification rules in the knowledge base. Classification rules are derived through a supervised learning process that relies on some representative samples from each semantic category. An indexing and filtering process can now be built using the semantic concept hierarchy to personalize multimedia data based on users' interests. In real-time filtering, multiple video streams are blocked, combined, or sent to certain channels depending on whether or not the video streams are matched with the user's profile. We have extensively experimented and evaluated the classification and filtering techniques using basketball sports video data. In particular, in our experiment, the basketball video structure is examined and categorized into different classes according to distinct motional, visual and audio characteristics features by a rule-based classifier. The concept hierarchy describing the motional/visual/audio feature descriptors and their statistical relationships are reported in this paper along with detailed experimental results using on-line sports videos.

Genetic testing for colorectal cancer risk is now part of standard medical practice, but very little is known about the economic impact of this technology. The aim of this study was to assess, from a healthcare system perspective, the direct costs of two strategies for screening at-risk relatives of FAP patients: clinical screening versus genetic testing for FAR Methods: A systematic review of the literature was carried out. Additional information was gathered from experts in research and clinical laboratories and in hospital departments. A decision tree was constructed to compare per-person and per-family costs of the two strategies for screening at-risk relatives of FAP patients. Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the stability of the model across the full range of plausible values for all key parameters. Results: According to the decision analysis, with FAP screening starting at puberty, the average screening costs are $3,181 and $2,259 (Canadian dollars), respectively, for the clinical screening and the genetic testing strategies. Genetic screening is cost saving up to a first screening age of 36. Sensitivity analysis shows that the results of the baseline analysis hold across a variety of assumptions concerning the parameter values. Conclusions: The genetic testing strategy is cost saving relative to the clinical screening alternative. Apart from its lower costs, it is associated with many other benefits, Accordingly, under predefined conditions, predictive genetic testing seems to be the optimal screening strategy for FAP.

An economic evaluation of hemodialyzer reuse versus conventional single-use hemodialysis for chronic hemodialysis patients	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN HEALTH CARE			English	Article						costs; decision analysis; economic evaluation; end-stage renal disease; hemodialyzer reuse; hemodialysis	STAGE RENAL-DISEASE; DIALYZER REUSE; DIALYSIS; SURVIVAL; ASSOCIATION; HOSPITALIZATION; MORTALITY; SYMPTOMS; QUALITY; IMPACT	Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of reusing hemodialyzers for patients with kidney failure on dialysis employing either a heated citric acid or formaldehyde sterilization method, in comparison to the standard practice of single-use dialysis. Methods: A meta-analysis of all relevant studies was performed to determine whether hemodialyzer reuse was associated with an increased relative risk of mortality or hospitalization. A decision tree was constructed to model the effect of three different dialysis strategies (single-use dialysis, heated citric acid, and formaldehyde dialyzer reuse) on the costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy of "typical" hemodialysis patients. The cost of heated citric acid reuse was estimated from a center experienced with the technique. The cost of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) care, survival data. and patient utilities were estimated from published sources. Results: There was evidence of a higher relative risk of hospitalization (but not mortality) for hemodialyzer reuse compared with single-use dialysis. Depending on the assumptions used, the cost savings that could be expected by switching from single-use dialysis to heated citric acid reuse were small, ranging from CAN $0-739 per patient per year. Conclusions: ESRD programs can incorporate the results of this study based on their individual situations to determine whether hemodialyzer reuse is appropriate in their setting.

We developed an inductive method to compose prefetch rules from practical data which were obtained in a hospital using a decision tree algorithm. Our methods were evaluated on data acquired in Osaka University Hospital for one month. The data collected consisted of 58,617 cases of consultation reservations, 643,797 examination histories of patients, and 323,993 records of image requests in PACS. Four parameters indicating whether the images of the patient were requested or not for each consultation reservation were derived from the database. As a result, the successful selection sensitivity for consultations in which images were requested was approximately 0.8, and the specificity for excluding consultations accurately where images were not requested was approximately 0.7.

J	Saito, K; Nakano, R				Saito, K; Nakano, R			Extracting regression rules from neural networks	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						polynomial equations; nominal variables; regression rules; rule extraction; vector quantization; cross-validation; decision trees		This paper proposes a new framework and method for extracting regression rules from neural networks trained with multivariate data containing both nominal and numeric variables. Each regression rule is expressed as a pair of a logical formula on the conditional part over nominal variables and a polynomial equation on the action part over numeric variables. The proposed extraction method first generates one such regression rule for each training sample, then utilizes the k-means algorithm to generate a much smaller set of rules having more general conditions, where the number of distinct polynomial equations is determined through cross-validation. Finally, this method invokes decision-tree induction to form logical formulae of nominal conditions as conditional parts of final regression rules. Experiments using four data sets show that our method works well in extracting quite accurate and interesting regression rules. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Studies that report "average" effects document the efficacy of psychotherapy but have limited implications for decision making in clinical practice. Although it is very unlikely that statistical models will ever perfectly predict treatment outcomes, models that identify and describe changes in a patient's risk of treatment failure may be developed to support decisions during ongoing treatment. In the current study, the classification and regression tree (CART) method was applied to data from the German multicenter study on the relationship between treatment duration/intensity and outcome in inpatient treatment of eating disorders (Project TR-EAT). Within a sample of patients diagnosed with bulimia nervosa (n = 630), data on admission, treatment strategy, and treatment response were used to develop a CART decision tree. This has potential for treatment decision support because the tree structure identifies changes in risk status associated with available treatment options and is sensitive to a patient's unique presenting characteristics and observed treatment response.

New diagnostic and treatment techniques have been developed in the last decade, so an updated appropriateness of indications tool was developed for cholecystectomy in patients with non-malignant diseases. The validity and reliability of panel results using this tool were tested. Methods: Criteria were developed using a modified Delphi panel judgement process. The level of agreement between the panellists (six gastroenterologists and six surgeons) was analysed and the ratings were compared with those of a second different panel using weighted kappa statistics. Results: The results of the main panel were presented as a decision tree. Of the 210 scenarios evaluated by the main panel in the second round, 51% were found appropriate, 26% uncertain, and 23% inappropriate. Agreement was achieved in 54% of the scenarios and disagreement in 3%. Although the gastroenterologists tended to score fewer scenarios as appropriate, as a group they did not differ from the surgeons. Comparison of the ratings of the main panel with those of a second panel resulted in a weighted kappa statistic of 0.75.

In this paper we present the results of an intelligent data analysis based on decision trees used for determining the most important risk factors for diagnosis of asthma in very young children because of inability to perform pulmonary function tests, which are the golden standard in older children. The study included 106 Slovenian children aged 2-8 years. All decision trees were highly accurate in a sense of classifying unseen test cases. The most interesting decision tree classified unseen test cases with 97.3% accuracy. Many well-known decision pathways were shown and more importantly some new interesting patterns, which deserve to be more carefully examined, were exposed.

The VR simulator is a synthesizer made up of unit programs which is a individual function component in the VR agent, and the performance can be improved by addition of unit with another function. As an experimental example, we investigate an application construction for digital archiving of china production process which requires complex design skill using this simulator. Through the result of china production archive, we show that the proposed system can structure an intelligent application providing a evolving organization based on knowledge integration and has global adaptability for industrial applications.

Generally speaking, NNTrees outperform conventional DTs because better features can be extracted by the ENNs, and the performance can be improved further through incremental learning. In addition, as we have shown recently, NNTrees can always be interpreted in polynomial time if we restrict the number of inputs for each ENN. Currently, we proposed an algorithm which can grow the tree automatically, and can provide very good results. However, the algorithm is not efficient because GA is used both in re-training the ENNs and in creating new nodes. In this paper, we propose a way to replace GA with the back propagation (BP) algorithm in the growing algorithm. Experiments with several public databases show that the improved algorithm can grow better NNTrees, with much less computational costs.

That is why the research on the factor causing cancer also becomes a quite significant subject. Though biomedical researchers can obtain lots of related biomedical literatures through search engine, they have to face the problem of information overload as well. We propose an intelligent agent system regarding the data mining of biomedical literature, hoping to provide assistance. According to the type of cancer user enter, the system will automatically combine it with LOH (loss of heterozygosity) or CGH (comparative genomic hybridization), and then search for related biomedical literatures from the PubMed. And then the retrieved literatures will be categorized using the decision tree, with which the cancer-related genes can be mined at the same time. The method in this article can help mine important information from biomedical literatures and thus helps users to gain quick and easy access to important information. Also, this method can be applied to other diseases.

Given a database of records, each with a class label, a classifier generates a concise and meaningful description for each class that can be used to classify subsequent records. Decision trees are a very popular class of classifiers. There are two phases commonly in the procedure of decision trees construction. These classifiers first build a decision tree in a tree-growing phase and then prime subtrees from the decision tree in a subsequent tree-pruning phase to improve accuracy and prevent "over-fitting". There have been a large number of technologies in decision trees construction in the past literature. We present several good algorithms in this paper comparing and analyzing their performance in the construction procedure. Which would be helpful for the future work of decision trees construction.

We posited that risk neutral calibration could be applied to other classifier systems with few or no changes and observe possibly even better classification performance. In this paper, we confirm these ideas for decision trees and show that, indeed, decision tree classifiers respond very well to risk neutral analysis. In most cases, we observe W>>1 which implies a substantial reduction in empirical misclassifications, pi(e\alpha). In other words, for every 1% of classifications we reject at or above the risk neutral error threshold, a; decision trees compensate us by reducing the error rate >>1%. By implication the covariance structure between the false positive distribution, P(e\alpha) and the Bernoulli error distribution, e, is not only positive but consistently large for most a's. We measured these, results on exhaustive tests using several benchmark datasets from the UCI machine-learning repository.

Therefore, a single tree may lead to unnecessary tests of attributes and may not represent rules that are best for the collection of the objects in the database. By applying a multidimensional association rule finding algorithm with some limitation to large database, we found that most of the branches in decision tree have shorter and more reliable multidimensional association rules as subsets of the branches so that some improvement is possible.

The prosody is often described with a hierarchical structure. So the generation of the hierarchical prosody structure is very important both in the corpus building and the run-time text analysis. But the prosody labeling procedure is laborious and time consuming. Moreover, to keep the consistence between different labelers and even the same labeler in different time is difficult. In this paper an automatic prosody labeling system is presented, in which the decision tree plus Viterbi decoding framework proposed in [1] is used. In the system, not only the acoustic information but also the text information such as the part-of-speech (POS) of a word is used. A prosody model is built up using the automatically labeled corpus for our Mandarin TTS system. Listening test shows that the automatic prosody labeling system works pretty well.

The method is based on a procedure of unsupervised acoustic clustering that is coupled with a decision tree for each type of unit. During synthesis, the trees predict the acoustic classes for a given symbolic target and the units belonging to the predicted classes are retained as candidates for the final selection. The units used in this study are phones and diphones, although the methodology is entirely automatic and may be applied to any type of unit or language. The proposed method is evaluated by comparison to a handcrafted method in a formal listening test.

Virus is one of the major kinds of malicious programs, which attach themselves to others and usually get executed before the host programs. They can be easily planted into computer systems by hackers, or simply down loaded and executed by naive users while they are browsing the web or reading E-mails. They often damage its host computer system, such as destroying data and spoiling system software when they are executed. Thus, to detect computer viruses before they get executed is a very important issue. Current detection methods are mainly based on pattern scanning algorithms. However, they are unable to detect unknown viruses. In this paper, an automatic heuristic method to detect unknown computer virus based on data mining techniques, namely Decision Tree and Naive Bayesian network algorithms, is proposed and experiments are carried to evaluate the effectiveness the proposed approach.

Using the proposed approach, we can explicitly capture the differences of individuals' subjectivity with respect to linguistic values defined in the same linguistic variable. The proposed approach can be employed as a useful tool for discovering hidden relationship among linguistic values defined in the same linguistic variable. Consequently, it provides a basis for improving the precision of knowledge acquisition in the development of fuzzy systems including fuzzy expert systems, fuzzy decision tree, fuzzy cognitive map, etc. In this paper, we apply the proposed approach to a collective linguistic assessment among multiple experts. We show that the linguistic assessment with a degree of membership to a linguistic value can be systematically computed according to a given granule. In the proposed approach, degree of membership to a linguistic value is, monotonically and adaptively, changed according to a degree of granule. It is a further step toward an automatic perception handling.

The interesting-learning agent uses improved ID3 algorithms to learn a user's profile; the filter agent is based on Vector Space Model. Here we use improved ID3.at beginning, when the number of web pages that an user provides is smaller than 10, we create the decision tree, when the user provides more new web pages, we only add the new features of the new web pages into our decision tree. When the change of decision tree is bigger than a threshold, we recreate the decision tree. By this way, we can enhance the efficiency of interesting-learning agent. In filter agent we use an improved vector space method based on the structure of html. By this way, we can filter the web pages more exactly.

Similarity of mouth shapes (SMS) is brought forward to design visual question set in the tree building process. Experimental results show that SMS is a good measurement of mouth shape contexts.

Most of these classifiers also produce probability estimations of the classification, but they are completely ignored in the accuracy measure. This is often taken for granted because both training and testing sets only provide class labels. In this paper we establish rigourously that, even in this setting, the area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve, or simply AUC, provides a better measure than accuracy. Our result is quite significant for three reasons. First, we establish, for the first time, rigourous criteria for comparing evaluation measures for learning algorithms. Second, it suggests that AUC should replace accuracy when measuring and comparing classification systems. Third, our result also prompts us to re-evaluate many well-established conclusions based on accuracy in machine learning. For example, it is well accepted in the machine learning community that, in terms of predictive accuracy, Naive Bayes and decision trees axe very similar. Using AUC, however, we show experimentally that Naive Bayes is significantly better than the decision-tree learning algorithms.

They are recursively built following a top-down approach (from general concepts to particular examples) by repeated splits of the training dataset. When this dataset contains numerical attributes, binary splits axe usually performed by choosing the threshold value which minimizes the impurity measure used as splitting criterion (e.g. C4.5 gain ratio criterion or CART Gini's index). In this paper we propose the use of multi-way splits for continuous attributes in order to reduce the tree complexity without decreasing classification accuracy. This can be done by intertwining a hierarchical clustering algorithm with the usual greedy decision tree learning.

In other words, given the ethane concentration in the soil and certain environmental data, a fuzzy classifier defines whether a specific sample site is within the reservoir boundaries. Two datasets from a natural gas reservoir in Pennsylvania were studied The method aims to obtain small fuzzy classifiers by means of optimization of fuzzy rules bases using a genetic algorithm. It is shown how a fuzzy rules base is generated from a numerical database and how its best subset is found by the genetic algorithm. The classifiers are evaluated in terms of accuracy, cardinality and amounts of features employed. The results obtained are compared with a known study in the literature and with an academic decision tree tool. The method was able to produce small fuzzy classifiers with very good performance.

It is very efficient because of its greedy search. Meanwhile, a decision tree is an effective means of data classification from which rules that are easy to understand can be obtained. However, a decision tree could not be produced for the data which is not explicitly expressed with attribute-value pairs. In this paper, we proposes a method of constructing a classifier (decision tree) for graph-structured data by GBI. In our approach attributes, namely substructures useful for classification task, are constructed by GBI on the fly while constructing a decision tree. We call this technique Decision Tree - Graph-Based Induction (DT-GBI). DT-GBI was tested against a DNA dataset from UCI repository. Since DNA data is a sequence of symbols, representing each sequence by attribute-value pairs by simply assigning these symbols to the values of ordered attributes does not make sense. The sequences were transformed into graph-structured data and the attributes (substructures) were extracted by GBI to construct a decision tree. Effect of adjusting the number of times to run GBI at each node of a decision tree is evaluated with respect to the predictive accuracy. The results indicate the effectiveness of DT-GBI for constructing a classifier for graph-structured data.

We combine the comprehensibility of rules generated based on decision. tree such as ID3 and C4.5 and the expressive power of fuzzy sets for dealing with quantitative data. Particularly, fuzzy rules allow us to effectively classify patterns of non-axis-parallel decision boundaries, which are difficult to do using attribute-based classification methods. We also investigate the use of genetic algorithm to optimize fuzzy decision trees in accuracy and comprehensibility by determining an appropriate set of membership functions for quantitative data. We have experimented our algorithm with several benchmark test data including manually generated two-class patterns, the iris data, the Wisconsin breast cancer data, and the credit screening data. The experiment results show that our method is more efficient in performance and comprehensibility of rules compared with methods including C4.5 and FID (Fuzzy ID3).

For this purpose, two useful prosperities of the multi-edited nearest neighbor rule are investigated. Experiments show that the method proposed could drastically reduce the size of resulting trees, significantly enhance their understandability, and meanwhile improve the test accuracy when the control parameter takes an appropriate value.

Based on variable precision rough set theory, a new concept of generalization of one equivalence relation with respect to another one with precision beta is introduced and used for construction of multivariate decision tree. The experimentation result shows its fitness to create multivariate decision tree retrieved from noisy data.

Design: cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses. Measurements: event probabilities, intervention effectiveness, treatment costs, and utility of hip fracture state were determined from peer-reviewed medical literature and public use data. Methods: a societal perspective with an 18-month time horizon was used. A decision tree model was constructed. Expected cost, effectiveness, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. One and two-way sensitivity analyses and threshold analyses were performed. Results: the strategy of using external hip protectors saves approximately US$300 per subject and adds 0.01 quality adjusted life year over 18 months. The model remains dominant over the entire range of input values for all variables except the cost of hip protectors. At the maximum estimated cost of US$695/subject/18 months, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $30,600/quality adjusted life year. The strategy of using hip protectors was cost saving or cost neutral if the cost of hip protector strategy is less than or equal toUS$397/subject/18 months. Conclusions: using external hip protectors in nursing facilities is cost saving or economically attractive over a wide range of cost and utility assumptions.

However, there is no perfect detection method so that most of IDSs can detect the limited types of intrusion and suffers from its false alarms. Combining multiple detectors can be a good solution for this problem of conventional anomaly detectors. This paper proposes a detection method that combines multiple detectors using a machine learning technique called decision tree. We use conventional measures for intrusion detection and modeling methods appropriate to each measure. System calls, resource usage and file access events are used to measure user's behavior and hidden Markov model, statistical method and rule-base method are used to model these measures which are combined with decision tree. Experimental results with real data clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method that has significantly low false-positive error rate against various types of intrusion.

But decision trees have two notable problems - those of replication and fragmentation. One way of solving these problems is to introduce the notion of decision graphs - a generalization of the decision tree - which addresses the above problems by allowing for disjunctions, or joins. While various decision graph systems are available, all of these systems impose some forms of restriction on the proposed representations, often leading to either a new redundancy or the original redundancy not being removed. Tan and Dowe (2002) introduced an unrestricted representation called the decision graph with multi-way joins, which has improved representative power and is able to use training data with improved efficiency. In this paper, we resolve the problem of encoding internal repeated structures by introducing dynamic attributes in decision graphs. A refined search heuristic to infer these decision graphs with dynamic attributes using the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle (see Wallace and Boulton (1968), Wallace and aeeman (1987) and Wallace and Dowe (1999)) is also introduced. On both real-world and artificial data, and in terms of both "right"/ "wrong" classification accuracy and logarithm of probability "bit-costing" predictive accuracy (for binary and multinomial target attributes), our enhanced multi-way join decision graph program with dynamic attributes improves our Tan and Dowe (2002) multi-way join decision graph program, which in turn significantly outperforms both C4.5 and C5.0. The resultant graphs from the new decision graph scheme axe also more concise than both those from C4.5 and from C5.0. We also comment on logarithm of probability as a means of scoring (probabilistic) predictions.

The resultant rules from FDTs can be used in decision-making with similar nature of our human beings by inference mechanism. A parameter, namely significant level (SL) alpha, plays an important role in the entire process of building FDTs. It greatly affects the computation of fuzzy entropy and classification results of FDTs, however this important parameter value is usually estimated based on users by domain knowledge, personal experience and requirements. As a result of this, it will be hard to build a high performance FDT without an optimal SL option in practice. This paper aims at developing a method to determine an optimal SL value through analyzing the relationship between the fuzzy entropy and alpha. The main contribution of this work is to provide some guidelines for selecting the SL parameter alpha in order to build FDTs with better classification performance. Six data sets from the UCI Machine Learning database are employed in the study. Experimental results and discussions are given.

Some classifiers, even if based on decision tree induction like C4.5 [1], produce as output a set of rules in order to classify new given examples. Most of these rule-based classifiers make the assumption that at classification time we can know all about new given examples. Probabilistic approaches make rule-based classifiers able to get the most probable class, on the basis of the frequency of the missing attribute in the training set [2]. This kind of assumption sometimes leads to wrong classifications. We present an abductive approach to (help to) choose which classification rule to apply when a new example with missing information needs to be classified, using knowledge about the domain.

Pollution sources can have different origins: point or non-point sources. As point sources can be well identified, these can be controlled, but the identification and control of non-point sources is not an easy task. Moreover, the natural responses of polluted streams in front of these external aggressions are still quite unknown. The decision-making processes involved in stream reach management require extensive human expertise (from water managers), empirical knowledge from scientific research and elaborated calculation over large amounts of numerical and symbolic data. In this sense, the STREAMES project appears as an attempt to develop and implement a knowledge-based decision support system to help water managers in taking decisions. The knowledge acquisition process is the most important step to build a complete knowledge base. After acquiring the knowledge, the efforts will concentrate on structuring and representing the knowledge in a decision tree fashion as a previous step to build the knowledge base. Each decision tree developed refers to a specific river problem: eutrophication, excess of ammonia, organic matter pollution... This paper presents the STREAMES project, with major emphasis on the knowledge acquisition step.

Implications of resistance for acne, patients and prescribers	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL DERMATOLOGY			English	Article							BENZOYL PEROXIDE; IN-VITRO; ERYTHROMYCIN-RESISTANCE; CORYNEBACTERIUM-ACNES; ANAEROBIC-BACTERIA; TOPICAL TREATMENT; CLINDAMYCIN GEL; VULGARIS; MINOCYCLINE; TETRACYCLINE	It is well recognized that some patients with acne do not respond adequately to antibiotic therapy. It is important to distinguish antibiotic recalcitrant acne which we would suggest represents acne that shows a diminished response to treatment irrespective of the cause as opposed to 'antibiotic-resistant acne' which is acne that is less responsive to treatment as a direct consequence of skin colonization with resistant propionibacteria. Here we show that antibiotic-resistant acne is not just a theoretical possibility but a real phenomenon that could have important consequences for patients and prescribers. The relationship between skin colonization by antibiotic-resistant propionibacteria and treatment outcomes is a complex one that is explained at the follicular level by physiological differences affecting local drug concentrations. A systematic review of the literature on antibiotic-resistant propionibacteria revealed methodological shortcomings in studies of their prevalence and a paucity of evidence on their clinical significance. Despite the elucidation of resistance mechanisms in cutaneous propionibacteria, our continuing inability to distinguish between strains of Propionibacterium acnes means that we still do not fully understand how resistance spreads, although person-to-person transfer is most likely. Finally, we present a decision tree for acne management in an era of prudent antimicrobial prescribing that provides an alternative to existing treatment algorithms by placing topical retinoids and not antibiotics at the cornerstone of acne management.

Clinical studies in patients with early and established RA have broadened understanding of its pathogenesis and have fundamentally changed the therapeutic approach to this disease. Quantum leaps in therapy-including the use of early, aggressive therapy, combination therapy, and the introduction of anti-cytokine agents-have improved patients' quality of life, eased clinical symptoms, retarded the progression of joint destruction, and delayed disability. We review clinical evidence supporting these therapeutic approaches. Diagnostic and therapeutic challenges are highlighted, and a decision tree to guide treatment in patients with early or established RA is provided.

Based on the common model CIDF, we present an IDS framework with an embedded data mining module to improve accuracy of IDS. Three subsystems (including monitor system, data process system and decision-making system) in the framework are introduced respectively. Using experiments on mining network connection features, we present a decision-tree classification algorithm, which uses data set of network connection features as training data set to build decision tree. Using system behaviors as new samples and testing their attributes on the decision tree can recognize anomalies and unknown intrusions accurately.

Methods: An economic decision-tree model was used on follow-up data from 703 patients with prior ocular HSV disease who were enrolled in a Herpetic Eye Disease Study multicenter clinical trial that evaluated the prolonged use of oral acyclovir. Costs were based on wholesale drug prices, Medicare fees, and national health surveys. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for all patients and for patients with prior stromal keratitis were calculated as the additional net cost of acyclovir prophylaxis compared with the number of cases of ocular herpes prevented during 12 months. One- and 2-way sensitivity analyses evaluated the effect of different treatment costs and recurrence risks. Results: Approximately $17.7 million is expended annually to treat the estimated 59000 new and recurrent episodes of HSV eye disease occurring among 29000 individuals each year in the United States. Chronic suppressive oral acyclovir costs $8532 per ocular HSV episode averted. The incremental cost per infection averted would decline by up to 51% if antiviral prophylaxis were more effective and by up to 87% if patients had a higher recurrence risk. Targeting prophylaxis to patients with a history of stromal keratitis is not more cost-effective than providing oral acyclovir for patients with any prior HSV eye disease. Conclusions: Herpetic eye disease is costly to treat and prevent.

The model is a decision tree with soft sigmoidal splits at the inner nodes and linear autoregressive models at the leaves. The global prediction of the mixture is a weighted average of the partial predictions from each of the AR models. The weights in this average are computed by the application of the hierarchy of soft splits at the inner nodes of the tree on the input, which consists in the vector of the delayed values of the time series. The weights can be interpreted as a priori probabilities that an example is generated by the AR model at that leaf. As an illustration of the flexibility and robustness of the models generated by these mixtures, an application to the analysis of a financial time-series is presented.

The tree is constructed by performing a hierarchical decomposition of the feature space; this step is performed regardless of complex nature of protein functions, i.e. it performs this decomposition even without knowledge of the protein functional class labels. In order to test our algorithm, we have constructed a library of Protein Phylogenetic Profiles for the proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae with 60 species. Results showed our algorithm compares favorably to other classification algorithms such as the decision tree algorithms C4.5, C5, and to support vector machines.

A too high reserve price may discourage the bidding process, but a price too low may damage the sellers. The analysis of the problem shows its high complexity. We suggest an objective methodology of constructing the evaluation of art works, based on a multi-attributes valuation system using a fiizzy expert system. The start point is the use of FM matrix similar to the Boston matrix to assign the work to one of four main categories of authors and art goods: stars, blue chips, portfolios and dogs, questions. For each one of the categories, the second step is the decision tree design. At the basis of these designs there is the belief that four are the main categories of variables, which carry at the final evaluation: artistic values, hedonic values, sociological economic macro-factors, micro-economic factors. These four are not independent variables. So the simple decision trees with four branches become very involved till at the final building which has more then thirty independent variables like the artistic values relate to the artist, to the work, to the artistic current, etc. The paper is a preliminary effort to apply the Fuzzy Sets Theory to the multi-attributes valuation of art goods. This theory provides a systematic framework to deal with qualitative concepts that can be translated in to quantitative parameters in a complex system of variables only by "fuzzy" relations, because of the intrinsic lack of precision and of uncertainty about the causal relation between sets of the inputs and of outputs. Experts give the ranges of values imputed to the linguistic variables, by reference to the statistics of the past auctions in the international market. The system structure identifies the fuzzy logic inference flow from the input variables to the output variables. The fuzzy inference takes place in rule blocks, which contain the linguistic control rules. The outputs of these rule blocks are linguistic variables. The defuzzificafion in the output interfaces usually translates them into crisp variables. In this case we propose as output a fuzzy evaluation that produces an interval of values between the minimum and the maximum.

Well-trained dermatologists reach a diagnosis via visual inspection, and reach sensitivity and specificity levels of about 80%. Several computerised diagnostic systems were reported in the literature using different classification algorithms. In this paper, we will illustrate a novel approach by which a suitable combination of different classifiers is used in order to improve the diagnostic performances of single classifiers. We used three different kinds of classifiers, namely linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) and a decision tree, the inputs of which are 38 geometric and colorimetric features automatically extracted from digital images of skin lesions. Multiple classifiers were generated by combining the diagnostic outputs of single classifiers with appropriate voting schemata. This approach was evaluated on a set of 152 digital skin images. We compared the performances of multiple classifiers (2- and 3-classifier groups) between them and with respect to single ones (1-classifier group). We further compared the classifiers' performances with those of eight dermatologists. Classifiers' performances were measured in terms of distance from the ideal classifier. Compared with 1- and 2-classifier groups, performances of 3-classifier systems were significantly higher (P < 0.0005 and P < 0.001, respectively). No statistically significant differences were found between the 1- and 2-classifier groups (P = 0.352). While the dermatologists group showed a level of performances significantly higher than the I-classifier systems (P < 0.020), no differences were found between the multiple classifier groups and the dermatologists groups, indicating comparable performances This work suggests that a suitable combination of different kinds of classifiers can improve the performances of an automatic diagnostic system.

Decision Tree (DT) and Neural Network (NN) methods have been used for modeling the languages with irregular pronunciation. The DT based methods are usually more accurate and therefore they provide better recognition accuracy than the NN based methods. The main drawback of the DT based methods is their large memory footprint. In the paper, we propose three methods, i.e. 1) a clipping approach to reduce the pronunciation variability in the aligned dictionary, 2) a revised DT structure, and 3) a Huffman coding scheme for efficient DT parameter storing that can jointly be applied to minimize the memory footprint of the DT models. The results obtained in the simulation experiments indicate that the memory requirements of the DT models can significantly be reduced without degrading the mapping accuracy. The applicability of the approach is also verified in the speech recognition experiments.

The models of the name entities are domain-independent and could be directly applied to other domains of applications. This technique can also be applied to iteratively decode a set of raw sentences, if available, and use the decoded output to improve the statistic models. Applied to the mutual fund trading application, this new technique achieves a performance comparable to that using the decision tree model, which is trained from an annotated corpus. Iterative decoding of a set of natural language utterances and training of the general language model decreases the sentence error rate by 11%.

ToBI labels, along with text features, are in turn incorporated into decision-tree models of F0 and segment duration to be used during synthesis, sparing the need for expression-specific large corpora and decision trees. Synthesizing using this approach enables listeners to perform the difficult task of distinguishing yes-no questions from identically-worded declarative sentences 78% of the time, compared to the baseline system's 50%. For contrastive emphasis, a sentence is synthesized with emphasis on a word which is chosen appropriately or inappropriately based on a preceding sentence. Listeners' mean opinion scores for appropriate emphases exceed inappropriate by 0.40 on a 1-to-5 scale for the experimental system, compared to a difference of 0.11 for the baseline, a significant system difference (p < 0.01).

To provide a biometric person authentication system based on human movement signals, this paper presents optimal neural network classifiers that are composed of local experts to solve the problem of human gender recognition. Two ensembles of neural network classifiers have been proposed to discriminate the human gender by using the information of moving joints of actors. With a database consisting of 13 males' and 13 females' movement, and containing 10 repetitions of knocking, waving and lifting movements both in neutral and angry style each, we have compared the results of ensembles to the conventional classifiers such as single MLP, decision tree, self-organizing map and support vector machine. Furthermore, the sensitivity has been calculated for the comparison with the human performance that has been obtained from the same data. The experimental results show that the ensemble models are much superior to the conventional classifiers and human subjects.

The faces may be rotated in-plane from -60degrees to 60degrees which suffices for most practical applications. The detector consists of a multi-path decision tree, with two different types of node classifiers. Each tree node has the capability to reject the current subwindow or to classify it in one out of 3 rotation classes. The node classifiers are designed so that most of the non-face locations are eliminated at early nodes, leaving the harder cases to later nodes. The improvement at each node is twofold, higher angular resolution and successive rejection of non-face locations. The early nodes consist of sparse linear feature nets defined in the gradient direction domain which are very efficient to compute. So many of the non-face locations are rejected with low computational effort. The classifiers in the last node apply linear feature nets using spatially sampled grey value features. The proposed detector design allows to focus onto interesting image regions very rapidly allowing for a Teal-time system on standard PCs which can process approximately 25 frames per second. We present experimental results of the system on the widely used CMU Database (frontal and rotated set) and the BioID Database where an overall detection rate of 91% is achieved.

This resource manager is made up of four trees, the isolated platform tree, the multi-platform tree, the fuzzy parameter selection tree and the fuzzy strategy tree. The isolated platform tree provides a fuzzy decision tree that allows an individual platform to respond to a threat. The multi-platform tree allows a group of platforms to respond to a threat in a collaborative fashion. A genetic algorithm is used to optimize the resource manager. A genetic program is used to evolve optimal fuzzy decision tree topology. The non-uniqueness of the tree structure is considered. The superiority of a genetic program evolved tree compared to a tree written down exclusively based on expertise is discussed. Fuzzy membership functions related to four fuzzy concepts are given. Experiments designed to test these concepts in the expert system are discussed, as well as the resource manager's ability to: allow multiple platforms to self-organize without the benefit of a commander; to tolerate errors made by other systems; and to deal with multiple distinct enemy strategies.

Research on barriers to guideline adherence usually focuses on attitudinal factors. Factors linked to the guideline itself are much less studied. Aim: To identify characteristics of effective clinical guidelines for general practice, and to explore whether these differ between therapeutic and diagnostic recommendations. Design of study: Analysis of performance data from an audit study of 200 general practitioners (GPs) in The Netherlands conducted in 1997. Setting: Panel of 12 GPs in The Netherlands who were familiar with guideline methodology. Method: A set of 12 attributes, including six potential facilitators and six potential barriers to guideline use, was formulated. The panel assessed the presence of these attributes in 96 guideline recommendations formulated by the Dutch College of General Practitioners. The attributes of recommendations with high compliance rates (79% to 100%) were compared with those with low compliance rates (0% to 60%). Results: Recommendations with high compliance rates were to a lesser extent those requiring new skills (7% compared with 22% in recommendations, with low compliance rates), were less often part of a complex decision tree (12% versus 25%), were more compatible with existing norms and values in practice (87% versus 76%), and more often supported with evidence (47% versus 31%). For diagnostic recommendations, the ease of applying them and the potential (negative) reactions of patients were more relevant than for therapeutic recommendations. Conclusion: To bridge the gap between research and practice, the evidence as well as the applicability should be considered when formulating recommendations If the recommendations are not compatible with existing norms and values, not easy to follow or require new knowledge and skills, appropriate implementation strategies should he designed to ensure change in daily practice.

Surprisingly, these genetic diseases can manifest for the first time during adolescence and adulthood. In this case, the clinical presentation and evolutivity are very different. In childhood, many neurological systems are touched and their evolution is rapidly lethal. In the adult, their presentation may be that of a degenerative disease of the central nervous system and, according to the disease, the syndrom is very particular and very systematized. From our clinical and biological experience, we would like to suggest a decision tree.

Although it is often somewhat easier to generate potential problem cases that cover the domain tasks, acquiring the solutions for the problems captured by the cases may demand valuable time of a busy expert. This paper investigates how a Case-Based Reasoning system can be empowered to actively select a small number of useful cases from a pool of problem cases, for which the expert can then provide the solution. Past cases that are complete, containing both the problem and solution, together with partial cases containing just the problem, axe clustered by exploiting a decision tree index built over the complete cases.,We introduce a Cluster Utility Score ClUS and Case Utility Score CaUS, which then guide case selection from these clusters. Experimental results for six public domain datasets show that selective sampling techniques employing ClUS and CaUS are able to select cases that significantly,improve the accuracy of the case base. There is further evidence to show that the influence of complete and partial cases utilised by these scores needs also to consider the number of partitions created by-the case base index.

The intelligent data analysis using advanced methods for decision tree construction was used in order to try to find the main factors that can reduce the risk for development of osteoporosis in women. Most of the extracted knowledge confirmed known medical criteria that put women to risk for osteoporosis, however some new interesting patterns have also been shown.

An observation logic specifies which observations are made, and in what order. The observation logic determines how, after each observation, an entity is either assigned to a category, or subjected to another observation. In real systems, observations have associated costs, and assignment to the wrong category has associated costs. In this paper, algorithms are presented to enumerate observation logics. This enumeration is a prerequisite step for computational optimization of observation logics. This analysis is directly applicable to the optimization of medical and other diagnostic applications, as well as to classification systems. In a simple but generalizable abstraction of a diagnostic system, each entity has n binary attributes, and the entities are to be classified into two categories. The diagnostic system can be viewed as a Binary Decision Tree (BDT) with two output terminals. The BDT implements a selection expression, which specifies which entity attribute states are assigned to each output category. The BDT also implements the observation logic, which gives the combination and sequence of observations applied to each entity. In an important subclass of diagnostic systems, each attribute contributes to a single decision metric, and increasing selection expressions are of primary interest. The number of increasing selection expressions is a small fraction of the total number of selection expressions. An algorithm is presented to generate the set of increasing selection expressions for a given number of nodes. The algorithm makes use of a partial ordering relationship among the entity states, and does not require examination of all possible selection expressions. An algorithm is also presented for enumerating all of the BDT's that implement an increasing selection expression. For a four-attribute observation system, there are 114 distinct increasing selection expressions that can be implemented through a total of 11808 BDT's.

In credit card portfolio management, predicting the cardholder's spending behavior is a key to reduce the risk of bankruptcy. Given a set of predicting variables (attributes) that describes all possible aspects of credit cardholders, we first present a set of general classification models that can theoretically handle any size of multiple-group cardholders' behavior problems. Then, we implement the algorithm of the classification models by using SAS and Linux. platforms. Finally, we test the models on a special case where the cardholders' behaviors are predefined as five classes: (i) bankrupt charge-off; (ii) non-bankrupt charge-off; (iii) delinquent; (iv) current and (v) outstanding on a real-life credit card data warehouse. As a part of the performance analysis, a data testing comparison between the MCLP and induction decision tree approaches is demonstrated. These findings suggest that the MCLP-data mining techniques have a great potential in discovering knowledge patterns from a large-scale real-life database or data warehouse.

Custom genetic operators and a multi-objective fitness function are designed for this representation. The approach has previously been illustrated using a binary class data set. In this paper we explore the possibility of using the algorithm on a multi-class data set. The accuracy of the rules produced by the evolutionary algorithm approach are compared to those obtained by a decision tree technique on the same data. The advantages of using an evolutionary classification technique over the more traditional decision tree structure are discussed.

The IBM Trainable Speech Synthesis System is one such system. This paper begins by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the decision tree and non-decision tree approaches to unit selection synthesis. It goes on to present the results of formal listening tests conducted on the IBM system to investigate a number of different topics pertinent to decision tree based systems. These include the use of extended context features during clustering, the effect of using trees with different numbers of leaves And different numbers of segments per leaf, and the performance of several different offline segment preselection algorithms.

This study focused on using graphical and statistical techniques to analyze the results of machine-learning experiments involving data preprocessing and algorithm tuning. Data consisted of 1428 cases that were classified by a dairy-nutrition specialist as outliers (34 cases) or non-outliers. The performance of classifiers, generated with decision-tree induction, was estimated through tenfold cross validation. Relative operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to visualize the achieved trade-offs between correctly classifying positive and negative cases. A performance index, representing the mean true positive rate of these curves for a limited range of false positive rate values, was developed to facilitate comparison among classification schemes. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine whether real differences existed for the expected performance on new data among the different combinations of data preprocessing and algorithm configurations evaluated in this study. In terms of data preprocessing. randomly assigning herds to the folds of the cross validation did not perform significantly differently from assigning cases to folds, while using a special value to indicate irrelevant attribute values significantly improved the performance over treating these values as unknown. Tuning the configuration of the decision-tree induction algorithm significantly improved the classification performance. The application of ten-fold cross validation in combination with ROC curves and ANOVA was found to he Useful in analyzing the results of machine-learning experiments involving decision-tree induction and small data sets, These methods could also be used with other machine-learning techniques Such as artificial neural networks and instance-based learning.

A relative operating characteristic curve was used to visualize the achievable range of trade-offs between correctly classifying positive and negative cases. A series of three final decision trees with increasing tendency of classifying a lactation as outlier was induced from the entire data set. For these trees, the expected true positive rates were 52, 68 and 92%, at false positive rates of 1.5, 3.5 and 8.6%, respectively, However. due to the low prevalence of outlier lactations (cases), this performance was associated with many false positives. The performance of individual decision nodes was tested against the entire data set to identify potentially counter-intuitive nodes resulting from overspecialization to the training data. The specialist reviewed the final trees and adjusted two decision nodes. This study suggests that although the input from a domain specialist remains important, decision-tree induction is a useful technique to support knowledge acquisition involved in the removal of outlier lactations.

A novel Bayesian decision tree algorithm is proposed to detect two types of pacemaker failures, nonsense and non-capture, without a priori knowledge of pacemaker type, model, or programming. A variety of pacemaker devices and modes were studied, including devices with single and dual chamber pacing; single and dual chamber sensing; and fixed rate and rate adaptive pacing. 12-lead ECG signals were acquired from 34 pacemaker patients at rest. These signals were annotated by a team of experts. A 10-fold cross-validation was performed on the data set to test the algorithm. Out-of-sample sensitivity and specificity of 87.8% and 98.7%, respectively, were achieved. This work shows that nonsense and non-captures pacemaker failures can be detected with high sensitivity and specificity without prior knowledge of the pacemaker type, model or programming, making this algorithm clinically relevant in emergency room environments where such pacemaker information may be unavailable.

Decision Tree structures are constructed, using data mining/distillation methods and then are used to classify heart sounds that were recorded from patients that have either Aortic Stenosis (AS) or Mitral Regurgitation (MR). Emphasis is given on the selection of the appropriate features that are adequately independent from the heart sound signal acquisition method. The differentiation capabilities and the classification performance of the fully expanded Decision Tree classifiers and the pruned Decision tree classifiers are studied for this problem. For each constructed Decision Tree classifier the partial classification accuracies for the AS and MR auscultation findings are also estimated.

Software agents acting as mediators or decision makers deliver validated information to the appropriate destinations. We outline the procedure for creating agent ontologies, agent types, and finally, for training agents based on historical data volumes. The C4.5 algorithm for decision tree extraction is applied on meteorological and air-pollutant measurements. The decision models extracted are related to the validation of incoming measurements and to the estimation of missing or erroneous measurements. Emphasis is given on the agent training process, which must embed these data-driven decision models on software agents in a simple and effortless way. We developed a prototype system, which demonstrates the advantages of agent-based solutions for intelligent environmental applications.

J	Chen, SM; Lee, SW				Chen, SM; Lee, SW			A new method to generate fuzzy rules from relational database systems for estimating null values	CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article							TRAINING EXAMPLES	Fuzzy decision trees can be used to generate fuzzy rules from training instances to deal with forecasting and classification problems. We propose a new method to construct fuzzy decision trees from relational database systems and to generate fuzzy rules from the constructed fuzzy decision trees for estimating null values, where the weights of attributes are used to derive the values of certainty factors of the generated fuzzy rules. We use the concept of "coefficient of determination" of the statistics to derive the weights of the attributes in relational database systems and use the normalized weights of the attributes to derive the values of certainty factors of the generated fuzzy rules. Furthermore, we also use regression equations of the statistics to construct a complete fuzzy decision tree for generating better fuzzy rules. The proposed method obtains a higher average estimated accuracy rate than the existing methods for estimating null values in relational database systems.

They are built recursively following a top-down approach (from general concepts to particular examples) by repeated splits of the training dataset. The chosen splitting criterion may affect the accuracy of the classifier, but not significantly. In fact, none of the proposed splitting criteria in the literature has proved to be universally better than the rest. Although they all yield similar results, their complexity varies significantly, and they are not always suitable for multi-way decision trees. Here we propose two new splitting rules which obtain similar results to other well-known criteria when used to build multi-way decision trees, while their simplicity makes them ideal for non-expert users.

ID3 is a greedy algorithm that considers one attribute at a time for splitting at a node. In C4.5, all attributes, barring the nominal attributes used at the parent nodes, are retained for further computation. This leads to extra overheads of memory and computational efforts. Rough Set theory (RS) simplifies the search for dominant attributes in the information systems. In this paper, Rough set based Decision Tree (RDT) model combining the RS tools with classical DT capabilities, is proposed to address the issue of computational overheads. The experiments compare the performance of RDT with RS approach and ID3 algorithm. The performance of RDT over RS approach is observed better in accuracy and rule complexity while RDT and ID3 are comparable.

According to our observation on real data, the distribution of attributes with respect to information gain is very sparse because only a few attributes are major discriminating attributes where a discriminating attribute is an attribute, by whose value we are likely to distinguish one tuple from another. In this paper, we propose an efficient decision tree classifier for categorical attribute of sparse distribution. In essence, the proposed Inference Based Classifier (abbreviated as IBC) can alleviate the "overfitting" problem of conventional decision tree classifiers. Also, IBC has the advantage of deciding the splitting number automatically based on the generated partitions. IBC is empirically compared to C4.5, SLIQ and K-means based classifiers. The experimental results show that IBC significantly outperforms the companion methods in execution efficiency for dataset with categorical attributes of sparse distribution while attaining approximately the same classification accuracies. Consequently, IBC is considered as an accurate and efficient classifier for sparse categorical attributes.

Cases who had been diagnosed as NINCDS/ADRDA 'probable AD' in life were usually confirmed at autopsy, but half of the NINCDS/ADRDA 'negative' cases were not (low specificity). It was hypothesized that the overall clinical impression may have taken precedence over the use of the actual criteria. We therefore investigated the validity and reliability of the clinical criteria using a computerized 'dementia diagnosis system' for each of 6 sets of criteria [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), NINCDS/ADRDA and three sets of criteria specifically for vascular dementia (VaD): NINCDS-AIREN, State of California Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centers (ADDTC), and Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI)] to classify a subset (n = 96) of the cases confirmed post-mortem. The use of the computerized system significantly (p = 0.01) increased the specificity (81%, similar to sensitivity) of the NINCDS/ADRDA diagnoses, which were shown to have 'moderate' inter-rater reliability. The DSM-IV criteria had good validity for AD when compared with post-mortem confirmation and showed 'substantial' inter-rater reliability. The ADDTC and VCI criteria for VaD had good specificity (88%) and sensitivity (75%), but only for one rater. The DSM-IV and NINCDS-AIREN criteria for VaD showed poor validity and inter-rater reliability. We conclude that the forced use of decision trees through a computerized system enhances the accuracy of the clinical diagnoses of dementia. Copyright (C) 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Choosing an appropriate kernel still is a trial and error approach for SVM however. This research provides some insights into the data characteristics that suit particular kernels. Our approach consists of four main stages. First, the performance of six kernels is examined across a collection of 33 classification problems from the machine learning literature. Secondly, a collection of statistics that describe each of the 33 problems in terms of data complexity is collected. After that, fuzzy C-means (FCM) is used to cluster and construct a decision tree is used to generate the rules of the 33 problems based on these measures of complexity. Each cluster represents a group of classification problems with similar data characteristics. The performance of each kernel within each cluster and the rules among the tree is then examined in the final stage to provide both quantitative and qualitative insights into which kernels perform best on certain problem types.

We develop a decision tree construction method, which minimizes the total time of data transmission between client and server. Our method, based on divide and conquer search strategy, minimizes the number of simple queries necessary to search for the best cuts. To make it possible, we develop some approximate measures, defined on intervals of attribute values, to evaluate the chance that the best cut belongs to the given interval. We propose some applications of the presented approach in discretization and construction of soft decision tree, which is a novel classifier model.

In our previous research we found a new formula, similar to the original ABCD formula, that yielded fewer diagnostic errors. This new ABCD formula was developed using data mining techniques, in particular, the rule induction algorithm LEM2, a part of the data mining system LERS. In this paper we compare the quality of the old and new ABCD formulas, measured by the number of diagnostic errors, using three other data mining techniques: two rule induction algorithms, LEM1 and a modified version of LEM2 called MLEM2, and the decision tree generating system C4.5. Additionally, we compare the quality of diagnosis using TDS (original and new) and diagnosis without using TDS at all, to address complaints by some diagnosticians that TDS does not improve diagnosis of melanoma. Our experiments show that TDS is a valuable tool, significantly increasing melanoma diagnosis accuracy.

RS helps to identify dominant attributes and DT algorithm results in simpler and generalized classifier. Experimental results obtained by applying the hybridized rough set framework and related base algorithms on data sets from three categories are presented in this paper. Accuracy, complexity, number of rules and number of attributes assess the performance of candidate algorithms. The results indicate that the proposed framework is effective as a model for classification.

It is hoped that the analysis will enlighten as to a heuristic which identifies the most appropriate discretization method to be applied, given some preliminary analysis or visualization to determine the type of statistical distribution of the attribute to be discretized. Further, the comparative effectiveness of discretization given each data distribution is a primary focus. Analysis of the data was accomplished by inducing a decision tree classifier (C4.5) on the discretized data and an error measure was used to determine the relative value of discretization. The experiments showed that the method of discretization and the level of inherent error placed in the class attribute has a major impact on classification errors generated post-discretization. More importantly, the general effectiveness of discretization varies significantly depending on the shape of data distribution considered. Distributions that are highly skewed or have high peaks tend to result in higher classification errors, and the relative superiority of supervised discretization over unsupervised discretization is diminished significantly when applied to these data distributions.

In particular, musical instrument indentification is one of the primitive functions in obtaining auditory information. The pitch dependency of timbres has not been fully exploited in musical instrument identification. In this paper, we present a method using an F0-dependent multivariate normal distribution of which mean is represented by a cubic polynomial of fundamental frequency (F0). This F0-dependent mean function represents the pitch dependency of each feature, while the F0-normalized covariance represents its non-pitch dependency. Musical instrument sounds are first analyzed by the F0-dependent multivariate normal distribution, and then identified by using the discriminant function based on the Bayes decision rule. Experimental results of identifying 6,247 solo tones of 19 musical instruments by 10-fold cross validation showed that the proposed method improved the recognition rate at individual-instrument level from 75.73% to 79.73%, and the recognition rate at category level from 88.20% to 90.65%. Based on these results, systematic generation of musical sound ontology is investigated by using the C5.0 decision tree program.

This paper pays special attention to tables because tables are commonly used within many documents to make the meanings clear, which are well recognized because web documents use tags for additional information. On the Internet, tables are used for the purpose of the structure of knowledge and also the design of documents. This report will propose a method of extracting meaningful tables using a decision tree and to construct a dictionary of table indexes in order to apply an information retrieval system and thus enhance the accuracy.

Substructures (patterns) are extracted at each node of a decision tree by stepwise pair expansion (pairwise chunking) in GBI and they are used as attributes for testing. DT-GBI is efficient since GBI is used to extract patterns by greedy search and the obtained result (decision tree) is easy to understand. However, experiments against a DNA dataset from UCI repository revealed that the predictive accuracy of the classifier constructed by DT-GBI was not high enough compared with other approaches. Improvement is made on its predictive accuracy and the performance evaluation of the improved DT-GBI is reported against the DNA dataset. The predictive accuracy of a decision tree is affected by which attributes (patterns) are used and how it is constructed. To extract good enough discriminative patterns, search capability is enhanced by incorporating a beam search into the pairwise chunking within the greedy search framework. Pessimistic pruning is incorporated to avoid overfitting to the training data. Experiments using a DNA dataset were conducted to see the effect of the beam width, the number of chunking at each node of a decision tree, and the pruning. The results indicate that DT-GBI that does not use any prior domain knowledge can construct a decision tree that is comparable to other classifiers constructed using the domain knowledge.

E-BONSAI we developed can create a good decision tree to classify positive and negative data for records whose attributes are either numerical, categorical or string patterns while other methods such as C5.0 and CART cannot deal with string patterns directly. We shall demonstrate advantages of E-BONSAI over existing methods for forecasting future demands by applying the methods to real business data. To demonstrate an advantage of E-BONSAI for business application, it is significant to evaluate it from the two perspectives. The first is the objective and technical perspective such as the prediction accuracy. The second is the management perspective such as the interpreterability to create new business action. Applying the E-BONSAI to forecast how long new products survive in instant noodle market in Japan, we have succeeded in attaining high prediction ability and discovering useful knowledge for domain experts.

Two important aspects are considered for the task: feature subset selection and cost-sensitive classification. These are to cope with the huge number of features and unbalanced samples in a dataset of drug candidates. We designed a pattern classifier with such capabilities based on information theory and re-sampling techniques. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. In particular, the classification accuracy of our approach was higher than that of the winner of KDD Cup 2001 competition.

To support the task of designing CAs, this paper proposes a method for automatic discovery of cellular automata rules (CA-rules). Given a sequence of CA configurations, we first collect cellular changes of states as cases. The collected cases are then classified using a decision tree, which is used for constructing CA-rules. Conditions for classifying cases in a decision tree are computed using genetic programming. We perform experiments using several types of CAs and verify that the proposed method successfully finds correct CA-rules.

For this purpose the multi-attribute decision theory was chosen as the methodology that provided the ISI main structure, which detached the problem to analyze in a decision tree. The main branches or general attributes of the tree were chosen to be: Financial Evaluation, In-walls, and Out-walls. The last two branches were divided into economic, social, and environmental attributes. Through this index, it is possible to evaluate the economic-financial situation of an industry, as well as the well being of its workers, and its surroundings considering the environmental, economic and social systems. Another aim of this study is to analyze the performance of a refinery comparing it with similar ones, and also to compare its performance as a function of time. The ISI was built for applying it to a specific refinery, the "Miguel Hidalgo" refinery, located about 80 kilometers northeast of Mexico City. Nevertheless the methodology was so formulated that it could be used, with variances, in other industries. It is thus worth our effort to emphasize the viability of this type of analysis and its importance to locate problems that have to be solved for making compatible the operation of an industry with the wellbeing of people and the environment.

TAX-PQ;enables taxonomy-based topic-focused web search on ordinary Boolean web search interfaces. TAX-PQ utilizes a taxonomy and the data set maintained in an existing taxonomy-based search facility for this purpose. The search is initiated by designating an initial query and a context category in the taxonomy. The data set in the taxonomy-based search facility is probed with a technique combining the initial query with sampling, and a decision tree is constructed from the sampled query result. A query modifier is then derived from the decision tree to focus the initial query on the selected context category. To adapt TAX-PQ to different user requirements on search result effectiveness and properties of target web search interfaces, we have developed a new decision tree construction algorithm. Experiments involving real web sites show that TAX-PQ can significantly improve the web search process and result. The results comply with user requirements under constraints of the target web search interfaces.

Such algorithms might be used for solving various problems of combinatorial optimization, such as covering, Boolean satisfiability, etc. The proposed architecture contains memory blocks for a binary or a ternary matrix, general-purpose registers, five stacks, that make possible to carry out recursive search procedures based on a decision tree, and a reprogrammable functional unit that allows to perform the required operations over binary and ternary vectors. Two levels of control circuits have been suggested The first (top) level permits to realize the search algorithm. The second (bottom) level allows operations that are required for the algorithm to be implemented.

We have designed and built a software tool (expert system shell) called McESE (McMaster Expert System Environment) that processes a set of production (decision) rules of a very general form. Such a production (decision) set can be equivalently symbolized as a decision tree. In real life, even if the logical structure of a production system (decision tree) is provided, the knowledge engineer maybe faced with the lack of knowledge of other important parameters of the tree. For instance, in our system McESE, the weights, threshold, and the certainty propagation functions - all of these are a part of the machinery handling the certainty/uncertainty of decisions - have to be designed according to a set of training (representative) events, observations, and examples. One possible way of deriving these parameters is to employ machine learning (ML) or data mining (DM) algorithms. However, 'traditional' algorithms in both fields select immediate (usually local) optimal values - in the context of a whole decision set such algorithms select optimal values for each rule without regard to optimal values for the whole knowledge base. Genetic algorithms comprise a long process of evolution of a large population of objects (chromosomes) before selecting (usually global) optimal values, and so giving a 'chance' to weaker, worse objects, that nevertheless may prove to be optimal in the context of the whole knowledge base. In this methodology case study, we expect that a set of McESE decision rules (or more precisely, the topology of a decision tree) is given.

There are two important steps in FDI: residual generation, and residual evaluation. In the first step, several analytical methods are used, the process characteristics play an important role in the choice of the method. The second step is a decision making problem. The methods of qualitative reasoning are more an more used. In this paper a combined analytical and knowledge based method for fault detection and isolation is presented. The residuals are generated using, a set of adaptive observers. For residuals evaluation a behavioural models (under form of decision tree) are extracted by means of a classification technique. This method is illustrated by a simulation example of biotechnological process.

Therefore, decision trees for evaluation of the risk have been developed, the latest being proposed by WHO/FAO early in 2001. Proteins developed using modern biotechnology and derived from fish are being considered for use in food and other applications, and since allergy to fish is well established, a potential risk from such proteins to susceptible human beings exists. The overall aim of the study was to investigate the potential allergenicity of an Ice Structuring Protein (ISP) originating from an arctic fish (the ocean pout, Macrozoarces americanus) using the newly developed decision tree proposed by FAO/WHO. The methods used were those proposed by FAO/WHO including amino acid sequence analysis for sequence similarity to known allergens, methods for assessing degradability under standardised conditions, assays for detection of specific IgE against the protein (Maxisorb RAST) and histamine release from human basophils. In the present paper we describe the serum screening phase of the study and discuss the overall application of the decision tree to the assessment of the potential allergenicity of ISP Type III. In an accompanying paper [Food Chem. Toxicol. 40 (2002) 965], we detail the specific methodology used for the sequence analysis and assessment of resistance to pepsin-catalysed proteolysis of this protein. The ISP showed no sequence similarity to known allergens nor was it stable to proteolytic degradation using standardised methods. Using sera from 20 patients with a well-documented clinical history of fish allergy, positive in skin prick tests to ocean pout, eel pout and eel were used, positive IgE-binding in vitro to extracts of the same fish was confirmed. The sera also elicited histamine release in vitro in the presence of the same extracts. The ISP was negative in all cases in the same experiments. Using the proposed decision tree, we demonstrated the safety of the ISP to patients already sensitised to fish, as well as to individuals potentially susceptible to producing IgE responses to proteins. Furthermore, the practicability of the new decision tree was confirmed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The RGB system was used for digitizing the color images. Four colored areas, white, red, yellow and brown, were segmented according to the Hierarchical Classification using Projection Pursuit (HICUPP) decision tree. Experiments were conducted with six varieties of chicory. In the experiments, a comprehensive index, Sc, was presented and used for estimating the unfavorable color change (turning to brown and red). The index is based on comprehensive consideration of the colored area and degree of the color change. The translation among the segmented color areas has been discussed, to explain why the rgb values decrease during the shelf storage. The effects of red and brown separately on the color change as well as changing temperature on Sc are discussed. Finally, the effect of different varieties on the yellow leaf growth and the effect of a commercial cut on Sc have been analyzed. The results indicate that two commercial varieties, Focus and Sigma, and a test variety, Pax, have better characteristics for the red and brown colors of the core. The results also show that the segmented areas translate with time. In the first 4 days the red area increases more rapidly than the brown; while from the fourth day on the brown increases more prominently. Higher temperatures (T10-18 degreesC) during the first 2 days of shelf storage lead to more serious red and brown coloring compared with the lower temperatures (T2-5 degreesC) for both Sigma and Focus. The lower the humidity, the slower the color change is. The recommended humidity range for shelf storage is between 50 and 65%RH. The higher temperature also leads to stronger leaf-growth; the effect of humidity on the leaf-growth is small. Changing temperatures during storage often lead to a serious red and brown coloring. So avoiding to change temperature during shelf storage is reasonable. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Moser, WK; Treiman, T; Johnson, R				Moser, WK; Treiman, T; Johnson, R			Species choice and the risk of disease and insect attack: evaluating two methods of choosing between longleaf and other pines	FORESTRY			English	Article							FORESTS; MODEL	Management of near-to-nature forests is frequently supplanted by faster-growing 'industrial' plantations on the basis of the latter's superior economic return. These latter species often produce higher volumes of usable biomass in shorter periods of time. Increased yields come with a price, however. While some species provide a superior net present value, they may require a higher cash flow position on the part of the landowner. Other species may possess superior production capabilities but are susceptible to insect and disease attack. Under such conditions, less productive 'native' species might produce a satisfactory rate of return considering their reduced risk of attack. We examine two methods of evaluating differences in effective yield and rate of return. The first method, expected value analysis, is a deterministic method that uses decision tree methodology coupled with pre-determined probabilities of outcome for a given series of events and choices. The second method is a matrix model using stochastic transitions between healthy trees and different states of poor health. Markov processes are used to drive simulations of insect and disease attack, and then calculate net present value and optimal rotation age. We keep the final per-unit product price fixed to simplify the analysis and better validate the comparison between the deterministic and stochastic methods. We use longleaf (Pinus palustris Mill.), loblolly (P. taeda L.), shortleaf (P. echinata Mill.) and slash (P. elliottii Engelm.) pines as the species in our comparison. Longleaf is the slowest growing, but it is less prone to attack than the other three. Using more recent Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data, both our Markov analysis and expected value analysis found loblolly and slash pines to be superior economic performers. Earlier FIA surveys support the selection of loblolly and slash over longleaf, but suggest that higher fusiform incidence might push the investment decision towards longleaf pine, particularly vis-a-vis slash pine at higher site indices. Both analysis methods provided the same outcomes, so long as they used the same data. Given this result, a decision tree methodology is a reasonable method for evaluating the economics of species choice in forest restoration activities.

More extensive search quickly leads to intolerable time consumption. Moreover, it has been observed that lookahead cannot benefit prediction accuracy as much as one would hope. It has even been claimed that lookahead would be mostly harmful in decision tree learning. We present a computationally efficient splitting algorithm for numerical domains, which, in many cases, leads to more accurate trees. The scheme is based on information gain and an efficient variant of lookahead. We consider the performance of the algorithm, on one hand, in view of the greediness of typical splitting criteria and, on the other hand, the possible pathology caused by oversearching in the hypothesis space. In empirical tests, our algorithm performs in a promising manner.

The succinct vector itself is generated by a machine-learning approach which builds parsers that can identify, significant features in a document by partitioning it into regions based on low-level document characteristics. The fact that the feature vector is succinct overcomes the problem of very large term vectors, which have hindered the application of conventional machine learning to document classification. The fact that the parser can be trained to extract only important terms from documents means that small training sets can be used to achieve the same classification accuracy as with conventional approaches.,	Univ New S Wales, Sch Engn & Comp Sci, Kensington, NSW 2033, Australia	Ma, LP (reprint author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Engn & Comp Sci, Kensington, NSW 2033, Australia.

The controller must be able to make decisions based on rules provided by experts. The fuzzy logic approach allows the direct incorporation of expertise. Genetic algorithm based optimization is conducted to determine the form of the membership functions for the fuzzy root concepts. The resource manager is made up of five parts, the isolated platform model, the multi-platform model, the fuzzy EA model, the fuzzy parameter selection free and the fuzzy strategy tree. Automatic determination of fuzzy decision tree topology using a genetic program, an algorithm that creates other algorithms is discussed. A comparison to trees obtained using a genetic program and those constructed by hand from rules is made. Experiments designed to test various concepts in the expert system are discussed, including its ability to: allow multiple platforms to self-organize.

J	Martin, JLFV; Shackleton, M				Martin, JLFV; Shackleton, M			Investigation of the importance of the genotype-phenotype: mapping in information retrieval	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GRID COMPUTING AND ESCIENCE			English	Article						genotype phenotype mapping; information retrieval; genetic algorithms; genetic programming		An investigation of the role of the genotype-phenotype mapping (G-Pm) is presented for an evolutionary optimization task. A simple genetic algorithm (SGA) plus a mapping creates a new mapping genetic algorithm (MGA) that is used to optimize a Boolean decision tree for an information retrieval task, with the tree being created via a relatively complex mapping. Its performance is contrasted with that of a genetic programming algorithm, British Telecom Genetic Programming (BTGP) which operates directly on phenotypic trees. The mapping is observed to play an important role in the time evolution of the system allowing the MGA to achieve better results than the BTGP. We conclude that an appropriate G-Pm can improve the evolvability of evolutionary algorithms. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

For such tasks, decomposing the problem into more manageable components can make learning feasible. In this paper, we provide a task decomposition, in the form of a decision tree, for one such task. We investigate two different methods of learning the resulting subtasks. The first approach, layered learning, trains each component sequentially in its own training environment, aggressively constraining the search. The second approach, coevolution, learns all the subtasks simultaneously from the same experiences and puts few restrictions on the learning algorithm. We empirically compare these two training methodologies using neuro-evolution, a machine learning algorithm that evolves neural networks. Our experiments, conducted in the domain of simulated robotic soccer keepaway, indicate that neuro-evolution can learn effective behaviors and that the less constrained coevolutionary approach outperforms the sequential approach. These results provide new evidence of coevolution's utility and suggest that solution spaces should not be over-constrained when supplementing the learning of complex tasks with human knowledge.

Decision trees are very attractive for classification problems because of their comprehensibility and white box modeling features. However, optimizing he classification accuracy and the tree size is a difficult problem, and to our knowledge very few studies have addressed the issue. This paper presents an automated and simplified genetic programming (GP) based decision tree modeling technique for calibrating software quality classification models. The proposed technique is based on multi-objective optimization using strongly typed pp. Two fitness functions are used to optimize the classification accuracy and tree size of the classification models calibrated for a real-world high-assurance software system. The performances of the classification models are compared with those obtained by standard GP. It is shown that the GP-based decision tree technique yielded better classification models.

In this paper we examine the use of Genetic Programming and a Genetic Algorithm to pre-process data before it is classified using the C4.5 decision tree learning algorithm. The Genetic Programming is used to construct new features from those available in the data, a potentially significant process for data mining since it gives consideration to hidden relationships between features. The Genetic Algorithm is used to determine which such features are the most predictive. Using ten well-known datasets we show that our approach, in comparison to C4.5 alone, provides marked improvement in a number of cases.

One of the most important problems in network reconstruction is finding, for each gene in the network, which genes can affect it and how. We use a supervised learning approach to address this question by building decision-tree-related classifiers, which predict gene expression from the expression data of other genes. Results: We present algorithms that work for continuous expression levels and do not require a priori discretization. We apply our method to publicly available data for the budding yeast cell cycle. The obtained classifiers can be presented as simple rules defining gene interrelations. In most cases the extracted rules confirm the existing knowledge about cell-cycle gene expression, while hitherto unknown relationships can be treated as new hypotheses. Conclusions: All the relations between the considered genes are consistent with the facts reported in the literature. This indicates that the approach presented here is valid and that the resulting rules can be used as elements for building and explaining gene networks.

J	Arentze, T; Timmermans, H				Arentze, T; Timmermans, H			Measuring impacts of condition variables in rule-based models of space-time choice behavior: Method and empirical illustration	GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS			English	Article								The use of rule-based systems for modeling space-time choice has gained increasing research interests over the last years. The potential advantage of the rule-based approach is that it can handle interactions between a large set of predictors. Decision tree induction methods are available and have been explored for deriving rules from data. However the complexity of the structures that are generated by such knowledge discovery methods hampers an interpretation of the rule-set in behavioral terms with as a consequence that the models typically remain a black box. To solve this problem, this paper develops a method for measuring the size and direction of the impact of condition variables on the choice variable as predicted by the model.

The main aim of using these data is to obtain regular and reliable crop statistics during the growing season via a monthly crop status bulletin. Optical data are being used on an operational basis to provide agricultural statistics as early as possible in the year because, with the use of satellite imagery, large areas can be covered under the same atmospheric conditions at a very limited cost. But cloud cover poses the greatest restriction on the acquisition of data that may be required at different intervals. This limitation has been somewhat alleviated by the use of Synthetic Aperture Radars (SARs) which are essentially all-weather systems. A number of works have already reported the use of SAR intensity images for land use classification. Another SAR-based technique, called SAR interferometry, uses two single look complex (or SLC) SAR images which contain both amplitude and phase information. Coherence images can be produced from two SLC images, often as part of the interferogram generation process. This study was carried to study the impact of the use of texture features derived from coherence and intensity images on land use classification accuracy, in combination with coherence and intensity images. For this study, five SLC images covering a period from 02/05/1996 to 20/09/1996 were selected. The classification problem involved the identification of seven land cover types; namely, wheat, potato, sugar beet, onion, peas, barley and carrots that cover the bulk of the area of interest. Interferometric processing was carried out using all five SLC images. Five intensity and three coherence images were obtained and it was found that only the tandem pair (02/05/1996 and 03/05/1996) provided good quality coherence images. Texture features based on the GLCM, Markov random fields, local statistics, and fractals were derived from all intensity and the coherence images for further use in image classification. As the number of input features become large for classification, a feature selection based on a statistical measure called Hotelling's T-2 was carried out to select the three best features for each intensity and coherence image. Five different data sets (1) five median filtered intensity images, (2) median filtered coherence and five intensity images, (3) median filtered coherence and three texture features of coherence images and five intensity images, (4) data set (1) with texture features and, (5) data set (2) with texture features were used in this study. Three different classifiers (ML, neural and decision tree) were used. Results suggests that the classification based on data set (2) is about 9% more accurate than data set (1) with all the classification system used thus, suggesting that the incorporation of coherence information can be very useful for land cover classification, in combination with intensity images. By using the texture features of all the images (data set (5)) an overall classification accuracy of more than 82% was achieved, which suggests that the use of texture features derived from InSAR data can results in acceptable levels of accuracy being attained for land cover classification. This study also suggests that a decision tree classifier can be used very effectively for land cover classification studies involving radar data.

However, segmenting customers in terms of their profit contribution remains an underutilized approach in many recommender systems nowadays. In such systems, they are likely to believe every browser might be a buyer later, so they give the same care to all of the customers without calculating whether the expected profit from a customer is greater than the cost of marketing to her or not. Providing a high quality recommendation service to all customers is totally not economically logical. So in this paper, our research is based on the understanding of individual customer profitability, Pareto's principle and the customer pyramid. A segmenting algorithm based on decision tree and RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) Model has been proposed here. Network value has also been considered in the segmenting algorithm.

This paper discusses a robot, situated in the real world, which very quickly learns target pursuit and obstacle avoidance behaviours using this technique. We also discuss the benefits of decision tree learning in the implementation.

This FNN combines the features of initial fuzzy model self-generation, fast input selection, partition validation, parameter optimisation and rule-base simplification. Experimental studies demonstrate that the FNN is able to achieve accuracy comparable to or higher than both a feedforward crisp neural network i.e. NeuroRule, and a decision tree i.e. C4.5, with more compact rule bases for most of the data sets used in our experiment. hi addition, the FNN is insensitive to the problem of small disjuncts that affects decision trees. This can be very useful in real-world situations, since the data of interest can often be only a small fraction of the available data.

The framework evolves two types of agents which hold the discovered knowledge, and uses a non-standard implicit fitness evaluation in a co-evolving environment. Together with self-adaptation of evolutionary parameters and with some other improvements it can monitor and adjust its own behavior. This framework is a base for a specific implementation of a program for induction of decision trees. The program's capability to self-adapt to a given problem is used as a measure to predict if some dataset is difficult or even impossible to analyze. On average it produces very general solutions or gives no solution if the dataset is prone to the overfitting problem.

Thus the paper describes a new, on-line, hierarchical, probabilistic modeling architecture that is based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). For the purpose of on-line behavior recognition, a probabilistic decision tree is implemented that accepts HMM behavior probabilities of player and effectively segments their behavior-with-time trajectories. This allows the location of important points in time where behavior changes occur. Furthermore, the hierarchical nature of the system allows individual player classification results to be used towards the modeling and classification of higher-level tactical behaviors of groups of players, as defined within an application envelope. The system is applied in a relatively simple "air patrol" scenario and system simulation performance results are provided in terms of certain useful metrics.

Southern Portugal, mostly a Mediterranean ecosystem due to climate and geomorphology, is characterized by large homogeneous patches. For this reason, it was chosen as the most promising region where global products could be used. The most recent 2002 MODIS Land Cover data set was used. The selection of the test sites was conducted through a method supported by Landsat5-TM images, to derive homogeneous patches. Moreover, field test sites accommodated the guidelines from the System for Terrestrial Ecosystem Parameterization (STEP) document. Confusion matrix results in an overall accuracy of about 36% and a: kappa statistic of 0.09. Croplands, which constitute the majority of the study area, is the most well classified feature, with an accuracy of 77%, although the MODIS classifies it largely by excess. The evergreen broadleaf forest is the most confused theme, with several land cover classes - evergreen needleaf forest, mixed forest, woody savannas, savannas and closed shrublands - classified as such. However, there isn't any classified evergreen broadleaf forest pixel. Therefore, it seems that there is a consistent misclassification of broadleaf evergreen forest. We strongly believe that the reason for the misclassification of the Mediterranean landscape relies in its weak representation within the training sites framework. MODIS land cover maps, produced by processing the 32-day database using decision tree and artificial neural network classification algorithms, are greatly dependent on the core sites data. Therefore, the classification of Mediterranean likely landscapes could never occur properly. Adding Mediterranean ecosystem like training sites could greatly improve the results. This study shows how careful the adoption of global products to regional studies should be.

Between 1978 and 2002, the municipal population increased from 8 to 10.2 million and GDP grew seven-fold, changes which have had profound impacts on land cover. To address these issues, this research involves two tasks. First, we monitor land cover change using a supervised, multi-date decision tree method that exploits spectral as well as seasonal differences in Landsat imagery. Results indicate that urban areas have increased by more than 350% between 1978 and 2002. Second, we estimate changing urban density by applying spatial landscape metrics and gradient analysis to the map of land cover change. Using a moving window technique, changes in urban pattern are estimated for seven urban-rural corridors. Results show that western corridors exhibit more disaggregate growth, possibly as the result of policies attracting foreign investment. These results have important implications for urban sustainability, resource use, and potential degradation of the environment.

In order to achieve more complex analysis it is advantageous to use binary decision trees, in which the decision between only two classes must be assigned at each node [10]. Pixel based feature extraction methods reduce classification performance because of the speckle and also conventional texture analysis is not applicable to every part of an image. Therefore, a decision-making process, which can be applied to every pixel of an image, is required. The results show that computation time and accuracy of classification process are improved.

The resulting classifier, referred to as an ensemble classifier, is a set of classifiers whose individual decisions are combined by weighted or unweighted voting to classify new examples. An ensembles are often more accurate than the individual classifiers that makes them up (Dietterich, 2002). In remote sensing Giacinto and Roli, 1997, Roli et al., 1997 report the use of ensemble of neural networks and the integration of classification results of different type of classifiers. Studies by growing an ensemble of decision trees and allowing them to vote for the most popular class reported a significant improvement in classification accuracy for land cover classification (Friedl et al., 1999, Pal and Mather, 2001). This paper presents results obtained by random forests classifier, another technique of generating ensemble of classifiers (Breiman, 1999), and their performance is compared with the ensemble of decision tree classifiers. A classification accuracy of 88.32% is achieved by random forest classifier in comparison with 87.38% and 87.28% by decision tree ensemble created using boosting and bagging techniques. Further, study also suggests that bagging perform well in comparison with boosting in case of noise in training data.

This indexing mechanism utilizes the statistical properties and ground-truth labeling of image data for efficient and accurate searches. It is particularly valuable in the domains of medical and biological image database retrieval, where ground-truth labeling are available and archived with the images. The EBS k-d tree is an extension to the statistical k-d tree that attempts to optimize a multi-dimensional decision tree based on the fundamental principles from which it is constructed. Our approach is to develop and validate the notion of an entropy balanced statistical based decision tree. It is shown that by making balanced split decisions in the growth processing of the tree, that the average search depth is improved and the worst case search depth is usually dramatically improved. Furthermore, a method for linking the tree leaves into a non-linear structure was developed to increase the n-nearest neighbor similarity search accuracy. We have applied this to a large-scale medical diagnostic image database and have shown increases in search speed and accuracy over an ordinary distance-based search and the original statistical k-d tree index.

The remote sensing main data include ETM+, TM and parts of SPOT, because area is very extensive, time is short too, it is very important to explore and develop extraction methods of LUCC information. Through making some experiments, the author finds some methods effectively base on study area as follows. Methods of change detection efficiently are change identification methods in spectral feature, such as Image Subtraction and Threshold, PCA, Multi-temporal false color composite, bands ratio and so on. Using ancillary data. Remote sensing allows large area to be monitored quickly, but GIS information provide source of very valuable information, which has great advantages over direct field surveying. Such as DEM, land use special subject information, vegetation cover. The use of these information, and remote sensing can together greatly attain changed information.

[19] We describe some simple techniques for speeding up the calculation of sufficient statistics for decision trees and related hypothesis classes from multi-relational data. Because missing values are fairly common in many real-world applications of data mining, our implementation also includes some simple techniques for dealing with missing values. We describe results of experiments with several real-world data sets from the KDD Cup 2001 data mining competition and PKDD 2001 discovery challenge. Results of our experiments indicate that MRDTL is competitive with the state-of-the-art algorithms for learning classifiers from relational databases.

Many of these applications require high speed, low power, functionality and flexibility, which cannot be obtained by standard logic device. These special logic cells can be constructed by the topology design strategy automatically or manually. However, the need arises for the topology design verification. The layout versus schematic (LVS) analysis is an essential part of topology design verification, and subcircuit extraction is one of the operations in the LVS testing. In this paper, we first provided an efficient decision tree approach to the graph isomorphism problem, and then effectively applied it to the subcircuit extraction problem based on the solution to the graph isomorphism problem. To evaluate its performance, we compare it with the neural networks based heuristic dynamic programming algorithm (SubHDP) which is by far one of the fastest algorithms for subcircuit extraction problem.

We discuss its type system, focussing on the treatment of statistical models as first-class values. This allows rapid construction of composite models - complex models built from simpler ones - such as mixture models, Bayesian networks and decision trees. We illustrate this with a flexible decision tree tool for CDMS which rather than being limited to discrete target attributes, can model any kind of data using arbitrary probability distributions.

Traditional packet filtering just compares some fields of an input packet header with a given rlue-list in linear order and finds out the first matched rule, then follows the matched rule's policy to allow or block the packet. In this way, efficiency is low and rules in the rule-list are independent, so that information among them can not be used effectively. In this paper, a new idea using a decision tree classifier is proposed. It first builds a decision tree according to the rule-list and then searches the tree to find out the matched rule for an input packet. It can be illustrated that packet filtering using a decision tree classifier is more quickly and can study inductively from the rules, so it will make the packet filter firewall has some prediction ability.

Different parameters were collected simultaneously when embedded sensors (dielectric, optical fibre, and piezoelectric sensors) were used within two different composite matrices during the curing process. The measurements were used by an algorithm-based software as a logged data file, resulting in to induction of a decision tree. Later, a systematic software is designed based on the rules derived from this decision tree, to recognise the type of composites used in the experiment together with recognition of their physical and mechanical characteristics. This is a new approach to data acquisition in intelligent materials produced by smart manufacturing system.

Recently, text classification has been applied by machine learning technologies such as k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, support vector machine, and neural networks. However, most of the investigations in text classification are studied not on real data but on well-organized text corpus, and do not show their usefulness. This paper suggests and analyzes text classification method for a real application, FAQ text classification task, by combining multiple classifiers. We propose two methods of combining multiple neural networks that improve performance by maximum combining and neural network combining. Experimental results show the usefulness of proposed methods for real application domain.

This paper presents a new approach for developing two C4.5 based classifiers. The first, RFC4.5, uses the RainForest framework approach while the second, GARFC4.5, uses genetic algorithm. The two classifiers have been applied on medical database of 20MB size for thrombosis diseases, obtained from the discovery challenge competition of the 3rd European Conference on Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Database held in Prague, 1999. The results show that the two Classifiers give higher classification accuracy than traditional C4.5 classifier. For both classifiers, at a certain population size, it is found that the classification accuracy increases with sample size.

In many applications, practical constraints require such systems to provide support for data analysis where the data and the computational resources are available. This presents us with distributed learning problems. We precisely formulate a class of distributed learning problems; present a general strategy for transforming traditional machine learning algorithms into distributed learning algorithms; and demonstrate the application of this strategy to devise algorithms for decision tree induction (Using a variety of splitting criteria) from distributed data. The resulting algorithms are provably exact in that the decision tree constructed from distributed data is identical to that obtained by the corresponding algorithm when in the batch setting. The distributed decision tree induction algorithms have been implemented as part of INDUS, an agent-based system for data-driven knowledge acquisition from heterogeneous, distributed, autonomous data sources.

There are other alternative forms of groupings: one approach is to group patients according to common characteristics and infer their resource consumption based on their group membership. In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of the alternative forms of patient classification obtained from data mining with the current classification for an objective assessment of the average difference between the inferred and the actual resource consumption. In tackling this prediction tasks, classification trees and neural clustering are used. Demographic and hospital admission information is used to generate the clusters and decision tree nodes. For the case study under consideration, the alternative forms of patient classifications seem to be better able to reflect the resource consumption than diagnosis related groups.

The design of a gating scheme includes the selection of the types of gate and calculation of the sizes and determination of the location, which depends heavily on prior experience and knowledge and involves a trial-and-error process. Due to the vagueness and uncertainty in the design of a gating scheme, classical rough set theory is not effective. In this paper, a fuzzy rough set model is proposed, which is not based on equivalent relationships but on fuzzy similarity relationships. An inductive learning algorithm based on the fuzzy rough set model (FRILA) is then presented. Compared to decision tree algorithms, the proposed algorithm can generate fewer classification rules; moreover, the generated rules are more concise. Finally, an intelligent prototype system for the design of a gating scheme based on an induced fuzzy knowledge base is developed.

A new search method is proposed in this system to improve the efficiency of the diagnostic process. First of all, a diagnostic tree (a decision tree) is built by domain experts according to the functions of the devices in the machine. Then, the diagnostic priorities of nodes (devices) in the tree are determined based on a fuzzy group multiple attribute decision making method. A meta knowledge base for fault diagnosis is generated automatically, based on the determined priorities to guide the diagnostic process. After that, a domain knowledge base that hypothesises possible faults for each device in the tree is generated by domain experts and/or manuals. At last, the inference process starts based on the meta knowledge base and hypothesises which device is the possible cause of failure. To validate the system performance, an illustrative example (VCR troubleshooting) is presented for demonstration purposes.

J	Abonyi, J; Roubos, JA; Szeifert, F				Abonyi, J; Roubos, JA; Szeifert, F			Data-driven generation of compact, accurate, and linguistically sound fuzzy classifiers based on a decision-tree initialization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						classification; fuzzy classifier; decision tree; genetic algorithm; model reduction	BASIS FUNCTION NETWORKS; COMPLEXITY REDUCTION; CLASSIFICATION RULES; NEURAL NETWORKS; SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE	The data-driven identification of fuzzy rule-based classifiers for high-dimensional problems is addressed. A binary decision-tree-based initialization of fuzzy classifiers is proposed for the selection of the relevant features and effective initial partitioning of the input domains of the fuzzy system. Fuzzy classifiers have more flexible decision boundaries than decision trees (DTs) and can therefore be more parsimonious. Hence, the decision tree initialized fuzzy classifier is reduced in an iterative scheme by means of similarity-driven rule-reduction. To improve classification performance of the reduced fuzzy system, a genetic algorithm with a multiobjective criterion searching for both redundancy and accuracy is applied. The proposed approach is studied for (i) an artificial problem, (ii) the Wisconsin Breast Cancer classification problem, and (iii) a summary of results is given for a set of well-known classification problems available from the Internet: Iris, Ionosphere, Glass, Pima, and Wine data.

J	Shiue, YR; Su, CT				Shiue, YR; Su, CT			An enhanced knowledge representation for decision-tree based learning adaptive scheduling	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING			English	Article							FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; RULES; INTEGRATION; SIMULATION; SELECTION; FMS	The classical decision tree (DT) learning approach to constructing DT knowledge bases is usually not considered if there exist some irrelevant and redundant attributes in the problem domain. Since the essential attributes are uncertain in manufacturing systems, how to select important manufacturing attributes to improve the generalization ability of knowledge bases and avoid overfitting training data in DT-based learning is a crucial research issue for the adaptive scheduling problem domain. In this study, we will first develop an attribute selection algorithm based on the weights of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to identify the importance of system attributes. Next, we will use the C4.5 DT learning algorithm to learn the whole set of training examples with important attributes in order to enhance knowledge representation. This hybrid ANN/DT approach is called an attribute selection DT (ASDT) based learning adaptive scheduling system. The results from the case study show that the use of an attribute selection algorithm to build scheduling knowledge bases delivers better generalization ability than in the absence of the attribute selection procedure in terms of the size of DTs under various performance criteria. Consistent conclusions are drawn from the resulting prediction accuracy of unseen data. The resulting prediction accuracy of unseen data also reveals that scheduling knowledge bases by the proposed attribute selection approach to constructing DTs can avoid overfitting the training data compared with the classical DT learning approach.

Although image occupies a large part of importance on these increasing Web documents, there have not been many researches for analyzing and understanding it. Many Web images are used for carrying important information but others are not used for it. If images in a Web document can be classified by which have particular information or not, then it would be very useful for analysis and multi-formatting of Web documents. In this paper we introduce the machine learning based methods of classifying Web images as either eliminable or non-eliminable. For this research, we have detected 16 special and rich features for Web images and experimented by using the Bayesian and decision tree methods. As the results, F-measures of 87.09%, 82.72% were achieved for each method and particularly, from the experiments to compare the effects of feature groups, it has proved that the selected features on this study are very useful for Web image classification.

A two-level hierarchical DT model was constructed for the discrimination of 87 ASTs in accordance to the WHO grading system. The first level concerned the detection of low versus high-grade tumours and the second level the detection of less aggressive as opposed to highly aggressive tumours. The decision rule at each level was based on a SVM classification methodology comprising 3 steps: i) From each biopsy, images were digitized and segmented to isolate nuclei from surrounding tissue. ii) Descriptive quantitative variables related to chromatin distribution and DNA content were generated to encode the degree of tumour malignancy. iii) Exhaustive search was performed to determine best feature combination that led to the smallest classification error. SVM classifier training was based on the leave-one-out method. Finally, SVMs were comparatively evaluated with the Bayesian classifier and the Probabilistic Neural Network. The SVM classifier discriminated low from high-grade tumours with an accuracy of 90.8% and less from highly aggressive tumours with 85.6%. The proposed decision tree classification scheme based on SVMs and the analysis of quantitative nuclear features provide means to reduce subjectivity in grading brain tumors.

Mitral valve prolapse is one of the most controversial prevalent cardiac condition and may affect up to ten percent of the population and in the worst case results in sudden death. MultiVeDec is a general framework enabling researchers to generate various intelligent tools based on machine learning. In this paper we focused on various decision tree methods, which are capable of extracting knowledge in a form closer to human perception, a feature that is very important in medical field. The experiment included classifiers with various classical single method approaches, evolutionary approaches, hybrid approaches and also our newest multimethod approach. The main concern of the latest approach is to find a way to enable dynamic combination of methodologies to the somehow quasi unified knowledge representation. The proposed multimethod approach was capable to outperform all other tested approaches by producing classifier for diagnosing mitral valve prolapse with the highest overall and average class accuracy.

In this work, the task of classifying ultrasonic images of the placenta according with the gradation proposed by Grannum is attempted. With this purpose, the ability of a decision tree classifier to discriminate different textures with three sets of textural features was tested. The performance of the classifier using textural features corresponding to co-ocurrence matrices, Law's operators and neighborhood gray-tone difference matrices (NGDTM) was firstly assessed. A preliminary experiment was done using natural textures taken from Brodatz's album with the addition of an ultrasonic image of the placenta. In a second step the method was applied to the problem of the classification of ultrasonic images of the placenta corresponding to different grades.

In general this diagnostic problem can be divided in many sub problems, each one dealing either with one morphological characteristic of the heart sound or with difficult to distinguish heart diseases. The sub problems of the discrimination of Aortic Stenosis from Mitral Regurgitation and the discrimination between the second heart sound split, opening snap and third heart sound, are used as case studies. Using signal-processing methods, we extracted the heart sound feature vector. Relevance analysis was performed using the Uncertainty Coefficient. Then for each heart sound diagnosis sub problem, a Specific Decision Tree (DT) was constructed. Decision Tree pruning was also investigated. Finally, a General Decision Support System Architecture for the Heart Sound Diagnosis problem, is proposed. The partial diagnosis, given by these DT, can be combined using arbitration rules to give the final diagnosis. These rules can be implemented by another DT, or can be based on different methods, algorithms, or even on expert knowledge. All these can lead to an Integrated Decision Support System Architecture for Heart Sound Diagnosis.

In this paper we extend the approach to deal with temporal information. We introduce a notion of temporal decision tree, which is designed to make use of relevant information as long as it is acquired, and we present an algorithm for compiling such trees from a model-based reasoning system.

This complexity limits the practicality of treatment guidelines, which attempt to be comprehensive. A user-friendly guide can, however, be constructed by considering only the most common early critical decision points likely to be encountered in the management of bipolar patients: new onset of an acute manic or mixed episode, interepisode treatment entry, and initial treatment for acute bipolar depression. Three general treatment principles, i.e., use proven treatments first, use a mood stabilizer in every phase of the illness, and use a multiphase treatment strategy to link current assessment with an appropriate treatment plan, can be applied to guide decision making at critical decision points that follow entry into clinical care. To guide the selection of appropriate therapeutic agents, a simple grading system can be used to evaluate the weight of evidence supporting use of various options. Multiple high-quality studies with positive results support the use of lithium, divalproex, carbamazepine, olanzapine, and haloperidol as initial intervention for acute mania; other agents with positive results in one double-blind mania trial are reasonable first-line alternatives. In the absence of high-quality evidence to guide treatment selection for nonacutely ill bipolar patients, guidelines recommend maintenance mood-stabilizer treatment. Standard antidepressant medications do not appear to add statistically significant benefit beyond that of mood stabilizers alone; lithium and lamotrigine have shown some benefit, and promising preliminary data have been presented on the antidepressant benefit of divalproex and topiramate as well.

In order to have an evident anti-proliferative activity with a reduced phototoxicity, many linear and angular derivatives have been synthesised. In this paper we describe a QSAR study in which, by means of the neural networks methodology, a useful model for predicting biological activity, expressed as ID50 (the UVA dose that reduces to 50% the DNA synthesis in Ehrlich cells), has been derived. A decision tree that is able to discriminate between active and inactive compounds has been built based on recursive partitioning.

This paper investigates the use of wrapper methods for bagging, boosting, and feature selection to improve the prediction accuracy of the decision tree algorithm. A set of concrete bridge decks is extracted from the Kansas bridge database, and the deterioration of the health index is selected as the decision/ class value for induction. From the conducted experiments, the decision tree accuracy obtained is 67.7%, whereas bagging and the boosting gave 73.4% and 72.7%, respectively. Wrapping with a feature selection method gave an accuracy of 75.0%. If feature selection method is applied first, bagging and boosting do not provide any further improvement to the decision tree algorithm. A series of tests were conducted where the selected features were examined and manually eliminated for the data set. This revealed that the improvement obtained by the feature selection method can be misleading. For the problem at hand, the attributes selected were not the most important ones to the problem domain. Therefore, what may be an improvement from the machine learning or data mining viewpoint, can turn out to be a mistake from an engineering perspective. Automatically selected attributes should be checked carefully. Feature selection is not recommended in this case.

Materials and Methods: A comprehensive literature search for articles addressing surgical correction of ureteropelvic junction obstruction was performed and data were abstracted on operative time, hospital stay, complications and success rate. The overall cost and individual cost center's at our institution for antegrade endopyelotomy, retrograde ureteroscopic endopyelotomy, Acucise (Applied Medical Resources, Laguna Hills, California) endopyelotomy, laparoscopic pyeloplasty and open pyeloplasty were compared. A decision tree model estimated the cost of treatment and followup for each modality using commercially available software. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of individual treatment variables on overall cost. Results: Based on cost center review retrograde ureteroscopic endopyelotomy was the least costly procedure ($2,891). In the decision tree model the rank order of overall treatment costs was: retrograde ureteroscopic endopyelotomy ($3,842), Acucise endopyelotomy ($4,427), antegrade endopyelotomy ($5,297), laparoscopic pyeloplasty ($7,026) and open pyeloplasty ($7,119). Despite various hospital stay, operative time, equipment cost and success rate data 1-way sensitivity analysis revealed that antegrade endopyelotomy, laparoscopic pyeloplasty and open pyeloplasty were never cost effective compared with retrograde ureteroscopic endopyelotomy or Acucise endopyelotomy, while 2-way sensitivity analysis favored retrograde ureteroscopic endopyelotomy. Conclusions: Primary cost variables for ureteropelvic junction obstruction treatments include operative time, hospital stay, equipment cost and success rate. Decision tree analysis showed that retrograde ureteroscopic or Acucise endopyelotomy is the most cost-effective treatment modality at our institution. However, cost is only 1 of a number of factors that are considered when deciding on an optimal course of treatment.

Invariably, the level of trade-off is decided a priori. It is possible for such decisions to be made a posteriori which means the induction process does not discriminate against any of the objectives. In this paper, we present such a method that uses multi-objective Genetic Programming to optimize decision tree models. We have used this method to build decision tree models from Diabetes data in a bid to investigate its capability to trade-off comprehensibility and performance.

The ID3 algorithm by Quinlan is one of the well-known methods to form a classification tree. Baldwin introduced probabilistic fuzzy decision trees in which fuzzy partitions were used to discretize continuous feature universes. Here, we have introduced a way of fuzzy partitioning in which we can have asymmetric triangular fuzzy sets for mass assignments approach to fuzzy logic. In this paper we have shown with example that the use of asymmetric and unevenly spaced triangular fuzzy sets will reduce the number of fuzzy sets and will also increase the efficiency of probabilistic fuzzy decision tree.

Despite this in practice often violated assumption, these simple classifiers have been found efficient, effective, and robust to noise. Discretization of continuous attributes in naive Bayesian classifiers has achieved a lot of attention recently. Continuous attributes need not necessarily be discretized, but it unifies their handling with nominal attributes and can lead to improved classifier performance. We show that optimal partitioning results from decision tree learning carry over to Naive Bayes as well. In particular, it sets decision boundaries on borders of segments with equal class frequency distribution. An optimal univariate discretization with respect to the Naive Bayes rule can be found in linear time but, unfortunately, optimal multivariate optimization is intractable.

Breiman et al., with their Twoing criterion in CART, considered gathering the categories of the predicted attribute into two superclasses. In this paper, we propose an extension of this method. We try to merge the categories in an optimal unspecified number of superclasses. Our method, called Arbogodai, allows during tree growing to group categories of the target variable as well as categories of the predictive attributes. At the end, the user can chose to generate either a set of single rules or or a set of multi-conclusion rules that provide interval like predictions.

A Bayesian network, in general, is widely accepted as an effective graphical model for analyzing biomedical data to determine associations among variables and to make probabilistic predictions of the expected values of hidden variables. This paper presents Bayesian network-based analysis of infertility patient data, which have been collected from the IVF clinic in a general hospital for two years. Through learning Bayesian networks from the clinical data, we identify the significant factors and their dependence relationships in determining the pregnancy of an infertility patient we classify the patient data into two classes (pregnant and not-pregnant) using the learned Bayesian network classifiers. From this medical data mining, we discovered the new domain knowledge that the age of female partner and stimulants like hCG, FSH, LH, Clomiphene, Parlodel and GnRH play the key role in pregnancy of an infertility patient. Through the experiments for investigating the prediction accuracy, Bayesian network classifiers showed the higher accuracy than non-Bayesian classifiers such as the decision tree and k-NN classifier.

It would appear to be limited to relatively simple hypothesis classes because of computational complexity issues. In this paper we, nevertheless, apply Rademacher penalization to the in practice important hypothesis class of unrestricted decision trees by considering the prunings of a given decision tree rather than the tree growing phase. Moreover, we generalize the error-bounding approach from binary classification to multi-class situations. Our empirical experiments indicate that the proposed new bounds clearly outperform earlier bounds for decision tree prunings and provide non-trivial error estimates on real-world data sets.

Whistles were recorded from nine odontocete species in the eastern tropical Pacific to determine how reliably these vocalizations can be classified to species based on simple spectrographic measurements. Twelve variables were measured from each whistle (n = 908). Parametric multivariate discriminant function analysis (DFA) correctly classified 41.1% of whistles to species. Non-parametric classification and regression tree (CART) analysis resulted in 51.4% correct classification. Striped dolphin whistles were most difficult to classify. Whistles of bottlenose dolphins, false killer whales, and pilot whales were most distinctive. Correct classification scores may be improved by adding prior probabilities that reflect species distribution to classification models, by measuring alternative whistle variables, using alternative classification techniques, and by localizing vocalizing dolphins when collecting data for classification models.
