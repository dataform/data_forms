Much of the current and past work has focused on algorithm development, data processing, and optimization. Lately, a subset of research has emerged which explores issues related to security. This research is gaining traction as systems employing these methods are being applied to both secure and adversarial environments. One of machine learning's biggest benefits, its data-driven versus logic-driven approach, is also a weakness if the data on which the models rely are corrupted. Adversaries could maliciously influence systems which address drift and data distribution changes using re-training and online learning. Our work is focused on exploring the resilience of various machine learning algorithms to these data-driven attacks. In this paper, we present our initial findings using Monte Carlo simulations, and statistical analysis, to explore the maximal achievable shift to a classification model, as well as the required amount of control over the data.

Such a system is well-suited to the increasing deployment of low-power devices with ubiquitous internet connectivity. Our proposal makes use of previous work on extracting a feature vector from network packets using a histogram of hashed n-grams. The commercially available CogniMem CM1K device implements a version of the Restricted Coulomb Energy neural network classifier, which was used to classify the resulting feature vectors at high speed and low power. In this paper, we describe our feature extraction technique for network packets and the classification algorithm used by the CM1K chip, and present initial classification results on a fabricated test set. Despite the generality of the RCE algorithm and our 'plug-in' approach to the classification task, with no fine-tuning of the hardware to our problem domain, we obtain surprisingly good classification results even on highly imbalanced and restricted training sets.

Energy-efficient STDP-based Learning Circuits with Memristor Synapses	MACHINE INTELLIGENCE AND BIO-INSPIRED COMPUTATION: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS VIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Machine Intelligence and Bio-inspired Computation - Theory and Applications VIII	MAY 08-09, 2014	Baltimore, MA	SPIE		Machine Learning; Memristors; Spiking Neural Networks; Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)	DEVICE	It is now accepted that the traditional von Neumann architecture, with processor and memory separation, is ill suited to process parallel data streams which a mammalian brain can efficiently handle. Moreover, researchers now envision computing architectures which enable cognitive processing of massive amounts of data by identifying spatio-temporal relationships in real-time and solving complex pattern recognition problems. Memristor cross-point arrays, integrated with standard CMOS technology, are expected to result in massively parallel and low-power Neuromorphic computing architectures. Recently, significant progress has been made in spiking neural networks (SNN) which emulate data processing in the cortical brain. These architectures comprise of a dense network of neurons and the synapses formed between the axons and dendrites. Further, unsupervised or supervised competitive learning schemes are being investigated for global training of the network. In contrast to a software implementation, hardware realization of these networks requires massive circuit overhead for addressing and individually updating network weights. Instead, we employ bio-inspired learning rules such as the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) to efficiently update the network weights locally. To realize SNNs on a chip, we propose to use densely integrating mixed-signal integrate-and-fire neurons (IFNs) and cross-point arrays of memristors in back-end-of-the-line (BEOL) of CMOS chips. Novel IFN circuits have been designed to drive memristive synapses in parallel while maintaining overall power efficiency (<1 pJ/spike/synapse), even at spike rate greater than 10 MHz. We present circuit design details and simulation results of the IFN with memristor synapses, its response to incoming spike trains and STDP learning characterization.

MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR OBJECTIVE INPAINTING QUALITY ASSESSMENT	MOBILE MULTIMEDIA/IMAGE PROCESSING, SECURITY, AND APPLICATIONS 2014	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Mobile Multimedia/Image Processing, Security, and Applications	MAY 05-06, 2014	Baltimore, MA	SPIE		inpainting; quality assessment; image quality; inpainting; SVR		This paper focuses on a machine learning approach for objective inpainting quality assessment. Inpainting has received a lot of attention in recent years and quality assessment is an important task to evaluate different image reconstruction approaches. Quantitative metrics for successful image inpainting currently do not exist; researchers instead are relying upon qualitative human comparisons in order to evaluate their methodologies and techniques. We present an approach for objective inpainting quality assessment based on natural image statistics and machine learning techniques. Our method is based on observation that when images are properly normalized or transferred to a transform domain, local descriptors can be modeled by some parametric distributions. The shapes of these distributions are different for non-inpainted and inpainted images. Approach permits to obtain a feature vector strongly correlated with a subjective image perception by a human visual system. Next, we use a support vector regression learned on assessed by human images to predict perceived quality of inpainted images. We demonstrate how our predicted quality value repeatably correlates with a qualitative opinion in a human observer study.	[Frantc, V. A.; Voronin, V. V.; Marchuk, V. I.; Sherstobitov, A.

We present results from an ongoing effort to extend machine vision methodologies to the environmental sciences, using state-of-theart adaptive signal processing, combined with compressive sensing and machine learning techniques. We use a modified Hebbian learning rule to build spectral-textural dictionaries that are tailored for classification. We learn our dictionaries from millions of overlapping multispectral image patches and then use a pursuit search to generate classification features. Land cover labels are automatically generated using CoSA: unsupervised Clustering of Sparse Approximations. We demonstrate our method on multispectral WorldView-2 data from a coastal plain ecosystem in Barrow, Alaska (USA). Our goal is to develop a robust classification methodology that will allow for automated discretization of the landscape into distinct units based on attributes such as vegetation, surface hydrological properties (e. g., soil moisture and inundation), and topographic/geomorphic characteristics. In this paper, we explore learning from both raw multispectral imagery, as well as normalized band difference indexes. We explore a quantitative metric to evaluate the spectral properties of the clusters, in order to potentially aid in assigning land cover categories to the cluster labels.

Decision support systems are intelligent software systems that support decision makers on their decisions. The design of decision support systems consists of four main subjects called inference mechanism, knowledge-base, explanation module, and active memory. Inference mechanism constitutes the basis of decision support systems. There are various methods that can be used in these mechanisms approaches. Some of these methods are decision trees, artificial neural networks, statistical methods, rule-based methods, and so forth. In decision support systems, those methods can be used separately or a hybrid system, and also combination of those methods. In this study, synthetic data with 10, 100, 1000, and 2000 records have been produced to reflect the probabilities on the ALARM network. The accuracy of 11 machine learning methods for the inference mechanism of medical decision support system is compared on various data sets.

Therefore, many efforts have been made to investigate and predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Analysis of strengths of PPIs is also important because such strengths are involved in functionality of proteins. In this paper, we propose several feature space mappings from protein pairs using protein domain information to predict strengths of PPIs. Moreover, we perform computational experiments employing two machine learning methods, support vector regression (SVR) and relevance vector machine (RVM), for dataset obtained from biological experiments. The prediction results showed that both SVR and RVM with our proposed features outperformed the best existing method.

J	Kumar, AV; Jeyapal, A				Kumar, Anitha Vijaya; Jeyapal, Akilandeswari			Self-Adaptive Trust Based ABR Protocol for MANETs Using Q-Learning	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							AD HOC NETWORKS; ROUTING PROTOCOL	Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are a collection of mobile nodes with a dynamic topology. MANETs work under scalable conditions for many applications and pose different security challenges. Due to the nomadic nature of nodes, detecting misbehaviour is a complex problem. Nodes also share routing information among the neighbours in order to find the route to the destination. This requires nodes to trust each other. Thus we can state that trust is a key concept in secure routing mechanisms. A number of cryptographic protection techniques based on trust have been proposed. Q-learning is a recently used technique, to achieve adaptive trust in MANETs. In comparison to other machine learning computational intelligence techniques, Q-learning achieves optimal results. Our work focuses on computing a score using Q-learning to weigh the trust of a particular node over associativity based routing (ABR) protocol. Thus secure and stable route is calculated as a weighted average of the trust value of the nodes in the route and associativity ticks ensure the stability of the route. Simulation results show that Q-learning based trust ABR protocol improves packet delivery ratio by 27% and reduces the route selection time by 40% over ABR protocol without trust calculation.

Given the characteristics of complexity, nonlinearity, and fitfulness in the line icing process, a model based on a multivariable time series is presented here to predict the icing load of a transmission line. In this model, the time effects of micrometeorology parameters for the icing process have been analyzed. The phase-space reconstruction theory and machine learning method were then applied to establish the prediction model, which fully utilized the history of multivariable time series data in local monitoring systems to represent the mapping relationship between icing load and micrometeorology factors. Relevant to the characteristic of fitfulness in line icing, the simulations were carried out during the same icing process or different process to test the model's prediction precision and robustness. According to the simulation results for the Tao-Luo-Xiong Transmission Line, this model demonstrates a good accuracy of prediction in different process, if the prediction length is less than two hours, and would be helpful for power grid departments when deciding to take action in advance to address potential icing disasters.

However, the solution of the primal optimal model of SVM is susceptible for class distribution and may result in a nonrobust solution. In order to overcome this shortcoming, an improved model, support vector machine with globality-locality preserving (GLPSVM), is proposed. It introduces globality-locality preserving into the standard SVM, which can preserve the manifold structure of the data space. We complete rich experiments on the UCI machine learning data sets. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, especially on the Wine and Iris databases; the recognition rate is above 97% and outperforms all the algorithms that were developed from SVM.

This paper focuses on a specific kind of reviews: the suggestive type. Suggestions have a significant influence on both consumers' choices and designers' understanding and, hence, they are key for tasks such as brand positioning and social media marketing. The proposed approach consists of three main steps: (1) classify comparative and suggestive sentences; (2) categorize suggestive sentences into different types, either explicit or implicit locutions; (3) perform sentiment analysis on the classified reviews. A range of supervised machine learning approaches and feature sets are evaluated to tackle the problem of suggestive opinion mining. Experimental results for all three tasks are obtained on a dataset of mobile phone reviews and demonstrate that extending a bag-of-words representation with suggestive and comparative patterns is ideal for distinguishing suggestive sentences. In particular, it is observed that classifying suggestive sentences into implicit and explicit locutions works best when using a mixed sequential rule feature representation. Sentiment analysis achieves maximum performance when employing additional preprocessing in the form of negation handling and target masking, combined with sentiment lexicons.

SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPE IMAGES; SEQUENCE-BASED PREDICTION; FEATURE DESCRIPTOR; LOCATION PATTERNS; FEATURE-SELECTION; BINARY PATTERNS; CANCER TISSUES; ATLAS; PROTEOMICS; RETRIEVAL	Human protein subcellular location prediction can provide critical knowledge for understanding a protein's function. Since significant progress has been made on digital microscopy, automated image-based protein subcellular location classification is urgently needed. In this paper, we aim to investigate more representative image features that can be effectively used for dealing with the multilabel subcellular image samples. We prepared a large multilabel immunohistochemistry (IHC) image benchmark from the Human Protein Atlas database and tested the performance of different local texture features, including completed local binary pattern, local tetra pattern, and the standard local binary pattern feature. According to our experimental results from binary relevance multilabel machine learning models, the completed local binary pattern, and local tetra pattern are more discriminative for describing IHC images when compared to the traditional local binary pattern descriptor. The combination of these two novel local pattern features and the conventional global texture features is also studied. The enhanced performance of final binary relevance classification model trained on the combined feature space demonstrates that different features are complementary to each other and thus capable of improving the accuracy of classification.

An estimated 1.3 million Indians died from this in 2000. The projected death from coronary artery disease by 2016 is 2.98 million. OBJECTIVE: To build an effective model which assorts the individuals, whether they belong to the normal group, risk group and pathologic group regarding atherosclerosis in real time by doing necessary preprocessing techniques and to compare the performance with other state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. METHODS: In this work we have employed STULONG dataset. We have made a deep case study in selecting the attributes which contributes for higher accuracy in predicting the target. The selected attributes includes missing values. Initially our work includes imputation of missing values using Iterative Principal Component Analysis (IPCA). The second step includes selecting best features using Fast Correlation Based Filter (FCBF). Finally the classifier Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) with kernel Radial Basis Function (RBF) is used for classification of atherosclerotic community. RESULTS: For the subjects belonging to the classes of normal, risk and pathologic, our methodology has outperformed with an accuracy of 99.85%, 99.80% and 99.46% respectively. CONCLUSION: The combined optimization methods such as Iterative Principal Component Analysis (IPCA) for missing value imputation, Multiclass SVM for classifying normal, risk and pathologic community in real time has performed with overall accuracy of about 98.97%. The essential pre-processing technique, Fast Correlation Based Filter (FCBF) was employed to further intensifying the target.

Thus, an efficient predictive estimation of wireless networks performance w.r.t. medium status by the communication peers would be a leap ahead in the improvement of wireless communication. For that purpose, we designed a measurement bench that allows us to accurately control the noise level on an unidirectional WIFI communication link in the protected environment of an anechoic room. This way, we generated different medium conditions and collected several measurements for various PHY layer parameters on that link. Using the collected data, we analyzed the ability to predictively estimate the throughput performance of a noisy wireless link from measured physical medium parameters, using machine learning (ML) algorithms. For this purpose, we chose two different classes of ML algorithms, namely SVR (Support Vector Regression) [1] and k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors) [2], to study the tradoff between complexity and estimation accuracy. Finally, we ranked the pertinence of the most common physical parameters for estimating or predicting the throughput that can be expected by users on top of the IP layer over a WIFI link.

J	Ozsen, S; Ceylan, R				Ozsen, Seral; Ceylan, Rahime			Comparison of AIS and fuzzy c-means clustering methods on the classification of breast cancer and diabetes datasets	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						Artificial immune systems; artificial neural networks; fuzzy c-means clustering; breast cancer dataset; diabetes dataset		Data reduction is an indispensable part of pattern classification processes in many cases. If the number of samples is excessive, sample reduction or data reduction algorithms can be used for an effective processing time and reliable successive results. Many methods have been used for data reduction. Fuzzy c-means is one of these methods and it is widely used in such applications as clustering algorithms. In this study, we applied a different clustering algorithm, an artificial immune system (AIS), for the data reduction process. We realized the performance evaluation experiments on the standard Chain link and Iris datasets, while the main application was conducted using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer and Pima Indian datasets, which were taken from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository. For these datasets, the performance of the AIS in the data reduction process was compared with the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm, in which a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network was used as a classifier after the data reduction processes. The obtained results show that the maximum classification accuracies were obtained as 73.96% for the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset and 97.80% for the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset with the AIS and the compression rates were 80% and 40% for these results. For fuzzy c-means clustering, however, the aforementioned accuracies were obtained as 63% and 86.69% for the Pima Indian Diabetes and Wisconsin Breast Cancer datasets, respectively. Moreover, the compression rates for these results for fuzzy c-means were 90% and 70%. When the mean classification accuracy values over the experimented compression rates were taken into consideration, the AIS reached a mean classification accuracy of 70.07% for the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset, while 47.64% was obtained by fuzzy c-means for this dataset. For the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, however, the mean classification accuracies of the AIS and fuzzy c-means methods were recorded as 94.90% and 75.43%, respectively.

Node localization via analyzing multi-path signals in ultrasonic sensor networks	WIRELESS SENSING, LOCALIZATION, AND PROCESSING IX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Wireless Sensing, Localization, and Processing IX	MAY 07-08, 2014	Baltimore, MD	SPIE		Source Localization; Ultrasound; Ultrasonic Sensor Networks; Pattern Recognition; System Design; Structural Health Monitoring		This paper proposes a novel signal analysis based node localization strategy for sensor networks used in structural health monitoring (SHM) applications. The key idea is to analyze location-dependent multipath signal patterns in inter-node ultrasonic signals, and use machine-learning mechanisms to detect such patterns for accurate node localization on metal substrates on target structures. Majority of the traditional mechanisms rely on radio based Time Delay of Arrival (TDOA), coupled with multilateration, and multiple reference nodes. The proposed mechanism attempts to solve the localization problem in an ultrasonic sensor network (USN), avoiding the use of multiple reference beacon nodes. Instead, it relies on signal analysis and multipath signature classification from a single reference node that periodically transmits ultrasonic localization beacons. The approach relies on a key observation that the ultrasonic signal received at any point on the structure from the reference node, is a superposition of the signals received on the direct path and through all possible multi-paths. It is hypothesized that if the location of the reference node and the substrate properties are known a-priori, it should be possible to train a receiver (source node), to identify its own location by observing the exact signature of the received signal. To validate this hypothesis, steps were taken to develop a TI MSP-430 based module for implementing a run-time system from a proposed architecture. Through extensive experimentation within an USN on the 2024 Aluminum substrate, it was demonstrated that localization accuracies up to 92% were achieved in the presence of varying spatial resolutions.

This is due to the incidence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) distance measurements between the anchors and an unlocalized node. While a large corpus of research work dealt with the scenario where the NLOS distances form a minority of the total distances to anchors, there has been not much research done to handle the situation where a majority or even all distance measurements to anchors are NLOS in nature. In our previous work, we showed that using localizers in a cluttered environment can improve the localization accuracy of a target node even when all the distance measurements are NLOS. Instead of NLOS bias, these techniques suffer residual multi-hop error, which is caused due to the distance overestimate when a multi-hop chain is used instead of the straight-line distance. In this paper, we analyze the effect of clutter topology on the multi-hop error. We use machine learning techniques to estimate the aggregate forms of the multi-hop error for a given clutter topology when only characteristic features of the clutter topology are provided.

Actual research focuses on Virtual Metrology (VM) using high sophisticated Machine Learning methods to predict a predefined metrology target based on statistical models trained on historical data. Enhancing physical metrology by predictive models leads to smart future fabs. Enabling scalable VM for fab-wide deployment depends on the extraction of only the most important out of typically hundreds to thousands of available process parameters. High Density Plasma (HDP) Chemical Vapor Deposition appears to be a process area in SM predestinated for application of thus required Data Mining. In low-volume-high-mixture fabrication plants, Knowledge Discovery in Databases is extremely challenging due to complex technology mixtures and reduced availability of data for comparable process steps. In this paper, a new Feature Selection wrapper method has been developed and is investigated to reveal only the most important process parameters for smart VM. Modeling of unknown functional interrelations and selection of these features is achieved to predict the layer thickness of dielectric layers deposited onto a metallization layer of the manufactured wafers with highest accuracy and reliability.

Both recombination and release of reactive species occur depending on the wall conditions such as: temperature, thickness, and composition of the deposited film. The stability of the wall conditions affects the etch output such as critical dimension and selectivity to the exposed films. A well known practice to maintain the process chamber stability and prevent process drift is to season the plasma chamber with conditions similar to the ones used for etching product wafers. Periodical insitu cleaning to remove byproduct films has also been used. In order to control such processes, a monitoring system is needed. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) has been extensively used in plasma etching and specific set of wavelengths monitoring has been established for several etch applications. In the case of monitoring the insitu cleaning, literature is very limited due the uniqueness of each case. The byproduct accumulation on the chamber wall depends on the etch product mix. In this paper we developed a multivariate method that combines machine learning algorithm (MLA) and principal component analysis (PCA). MLA is used to reduce the input variables to the few ones that are contributing to the differentiation between clean and chamber with polymer buildup while PCA has been used to build a control chart to monitor the state of the etch chamber.

Existing approaches use white-box modeling and require intimate knowledge of the internal layout of the drive, which can take months to extract. Automatically learning this behavior is a much more desirable approach, requiring less expert knowledge, fewer assumptions, and less time. While previous research has created black-box models of hard disk drive performance, none have shown low per-request errors. A barrier to machine learning of access times has been the existence of periodic behavior with high, unknown frequencies. We identify these high frequencies with Fourier analysis and include them explicitly as input to the model. In this paper we focus on the simulation of access times for random read workloads within a single zone. We are able to automatically generate and tune request-level access time models with mean absolute error less than 0 : 1 5 ms. To our knowledge this is the first time such a fidelity has been achieved with modern disk drives using machine learning. We are confident that our approach forms the core for automatic generation of access time models that include other workloads and span across entire disk drives, but more work remains.

The parameters for SVM will be selected by a swarm intelligence algorithm (Particle Swarm Optimization or Artificial Bee Colony). We use the NSL-KDD data set and show that our model can achieve higher detection rate and lower false alarm rate than regular SVM.

When facing the most exciting machine learning applications such as deep learning, the computing requirement is intensive. For the purpose of improving energy efficiency of mobile device and enhancing the performance of applications through reducing execution time, M2C offloads computation of its machine learning application to the cloud side. We propose the prototype of M2C with the mobile side on Android, iPad and with the cloud side on the open source cloud: Spark, a part of the Berkeley Data Analytics Stack with NVIDA GPU. M2C's distinct set of varying computational tools and mobile nodes allows for thorough implementing distributed machine learning algorithm and innovative wireless protocols with energy efficiency, verifying the theoretical research and bringing the user extremely fast experience.

The accelerometer is a widely-used tool for this purpose, but the quadruped Sony AIBO does not have such a high-end sensor compared to the latest state-of-art developments. Past works focused on attaching replacement sensors to the robot dog as well as collecting many samples for machine learning methods although some studies did not address this issue at all. This paper focuses on improvements with sensor fusion of built-in sensors to recognize wider variety of surfaces and get similar or better accuracy than earlier experiments. The combined features are based on the accelerometer and paw sensors to make the recognition more robust and a naive Bayes classifier achieves 85-91% accuracy for different locomotion speeds. Evaluation suggests that this method can reduce the data collection time for training samples dramatically and it is suitable for practical applications.

Vision-based hand gesture recognition techniques have many proven advantages compared with traditional devices, giving users a simpler and more natural way to communicate with electronic devices. This work proposes a generic system architecture based in computer vision and machine learning, able to be used with any interface for human-computer interaction. The proposed solution is mainly composed of three modules: a pre-processing and hand segmentation module, a static gesture interface module and a dynamic gesture interface module. The experiments showed that the core of vision-based interaction systems can be the same for all applications and thus facilitate the implementation. In order to test the proposed solutions, three prototypes were implemented. For hand posture recognition, a SVM model was trained and used, able to achieve a final accuracy of 99.4%. For dynamic gestures, an HMM model was trained for each gesture that the system could recognize with a final average accuracy of 93.7%. The proposed solution as the advantage of being generic enough with the trained models able to work in real-time, allowing its application in a wide range of human-machine applications.

This scenario applies also to symmetric functions f, where the partial derivatives approach zero as the corresponding component value increases. The goal is to pre-compute exact values f(u) on a tight enough net of sequence arguments, so that given any other sequence x, a neighboring sequence u in the net giving a close approximation can be efficiently found. Our scheme avoids pre-computing the more-numerous partial-derivative values. It employs a new data structure that combines ideas of a trie and an array implementation of a heap, representing grid values compactly in the array, yet still allowing access by a single index lookup rather than pointer jumping. We demonstrate good size/approximation performance in a natural application.

We focus on expressing the Collaborative Filtering Algorithm (CF or CFA) as a Greedy Construction Algorithm as well as implementing and testing a Collaborative Metaheuristic Algorithm (CMA) for providing recommendations. The empirical findings suggest that the recommendation problem can indeed be defined as an optimization problem, which provides new opportunities for the application of powerful and effective OR algorithms on recommendation problems.

Typical examples include, among many others, military, music, healthcare, gaming, and data sharing. Despite the recent boom of mobile computing makes service deployment in mobile environment possible, significant challenges arise due to the limitations in existing mobile hardware/software capable of managing resource intensive applications. The situation gets worse when managing complex services that allow concurrent clients and requests. This paper addresses the issue related specifically to concurrency control improvement in mobile web servers to support the mobile deployment of complex services. The authors identify key factors that affect a system to respond a request, including request related factors, system resource related factors, and context. Based on this, the authors propose a dynamic heavy request classification model (DHRC) to estimate the heaviness of an incoming request using machine-learning methods. The heavy request will be detected, which requires relatively heavy system resources of the mobile server to generate a response. The authors design a dynamic request management strategy (DRMS), which reduces the number of discarded requests by adding heavy requests to a queue and processing them asynchronously. The proposed solution is implemented on Android-based mobile devices as an extension of I-Jetty web server. Experimental studies are conducted and the result indicates the effectiveness of our solution.

This paper presents a novel approach using association rules for sentiment classification of web reviews. An optimal classification rule set is generated to abandon the redundant general rule with comparatively lower confidence. In the class label prediction procedure, we proposed a new metric named Maximum Term Weight (MTW) for the evaluation of rules and a multiple metric voting scheme to solve the problem when the covered rules are not adequately confident or not applicable. The final score of a test review depends on the overall contributions of four metrics. Experiments on multiple domain datasets from web site demonstrate that the voting strategy obtains improvements on other rule based algorithms. Another comparison to popular machine learning algorithms also indicates that the proposed method outperforms these strong benchmarks.

For example, many illustrative labeled data sets can be found at sources such as the UCI Repository for Machine Learning (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/), or at the Keel Data Set Repository (http://www.keel.es). However, increasingly many real world classification problems involve data that contain both labeled and unlabeled samples. In the latter case, the data samples are assumed to be missing all class label information, and when used as training data these samples are considered to be of unknown origin (i.e., to the learning system, actual class membership is completely unknown). Typically, when presented with a classification problem containing both labeled and unlabeled training samples, a technique that is often used is to throw out the unlabeled data. In other words, the unlabeled data are not included with existing labeled data for learning, and which can result in a poorly trained classifier that does not reach its full performance potential. In most cases, the primary reason that unlabeled data are not often used for training is that, and depending on the classifier, the correct optimal model for semi-supervised classification (i.e., a classifier that learns class membership using both labeled and unlabeled samples) can be far too complicated to develop.

Various computational tools based on machine-learning and data-mining methods like feature selection/extraction have been proposed to escape the curse of dimensionality in large datasets. Incidentally, evolutionary studies, primarily based on sequentially evolved variations have remained un-facilitated by such advances till date. Here, we present a novel approach of recursive feature selection for hierarchical clustering of Y-chromosomal SNPs/haplogroups to select a minimal set of independent markers, sufficient to infer population structure as precisely as deduced by a larger number of evolutionary markers. To validate the applicability of our approach, we optimally designed MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry-based multiplex to accommodate independent Y-chromosomal markers in a single multiplex and genotyped two geographically distinct Indian populations. An analysis of 105 world-wide populations reflected that 15 independent variations/markers were optimal in defining population structure parameters, such as F-ST, molecular variance and correlation-based relationship. A subsequent addition of randomly selected markers had a negligible effect (close to zero, i. e. 1 x 10(-3)) on these parameters. The study proves efficient in tracing complex population structures and deriving relationships among world-wide populations in a cost-effective and expedient manner.

Quantifying sequence and structural features of protein-RNA interactions	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							BINDING SITES; PSEUDO PAIRS; PREDICTION; INSIGHTS; SERVER; INTERFACE; COMPLEXES; RESIDUES	Increasing awareness of the importance of protein-RNA interactions has motivated many approaches to predict residue-level RNA binding sites in proteins based on sequence or structural characteristics. Sequence-based predictors are usually high in sensitivity but low in specificity; conversely structure-based predictors tend to have high specificity, but lower sensitivity. Here we quantified the contribution of both sequence-and structure-based features as indicators of RNA-binding propensity using a machine-learning approach. In order to capture structural information for proteins without a known structure, we used homology modeling to extract the relevant structural features. Several novel and modified features enhanced the accuracy of residue-level RNA-binding propensity beyond what has been reported previously, including by meta-prediction servers. These features include: hidden Markov model-based evolutionary conservation, surface deformations based on the Laplacian norm formalism, and relative solvent accessibility partitioned into backbone and side chain contributions. We constructed a web server called aaRNA that implements the proposed method and demonstrate its use in identifying putative RNA binding sites.

We validate the learned predictive model with a field study where we release an instrumented high-altitude balloon and compare the predicted trajectory with the sensed winds. The experiments show the promise of using airplane in flight as a large-scale sensor network. Beyond making predictions, we explore the guidance of sensing with value-of-information analyses, where we consider uncertainties and needs of sets of routes and maximize information value in light of the costs of acquiring data from airplanes. The methods can be used to select ideal subsets of planes to serve as sensors and also to evaluate the value of requesting shifts in trajectories of flights for sensing.

We first show that an ultrasonic rangefinder alone is unable to accurately measure the level of water on a road due to thermal effects. Using additional passive infrared sensors, we show that ground temperature and local sensor temperature measurements are sufficient to correct the rangefinder readings and improve the flood detection performance. Since floods occur very rarely, we use a supervised learning approach to estimate the correction to the ultrasonic rangefinder caused by temperature fluctuations. Preliminary data shows that water level can be estimated with an absolute error of less than 2 cm.

Although the government is publishing the outdoor PM2.5 concentration on an hourly basis, the indoor PM 2.5 concentration, to which most people expose for most of their everyday life time, remains unsupervised. The high cost of the professional PM 2.5 measuring equipments, which utilize filtering and direct mass measuring methodology, prevents the indoor air quality to be monitored pervasively. We designed and implemented PiMi air box, a cost-effective portable sensor, which is able to estimate the PM 2.5 mass concentration with satisfactory accuracy. The PiMi air boxes adopt the low-cost optical particle counting technology and convert the particle counts into PM 2.5 mass concentration via empirical diameter-distribution and density of particulate matters. The errors introduced by the individuality of the low-cost particle counters are offset during a machine-learning-based calibration procedure for each single unit. The PiMi air box enjoys a stunning cost reduction by a factor of 1,000 comparing to professional equipments, and still maintains an satisfactory level of accuracy for everyday life air quality measurement. Together with embedded Bluetooth connectivity and SmartPhone APPs, PiMi air box is well-suited for massive crowd-sourced indoor air-quality monitoring research.

In this work, we present a more efficient simulated annealing called Fast Simulated Annealer (FSA) which is based on a decision tree machine learning algorithm. Our proposed exploration method makes use of a standard simulated annealer to generate a training set, and uses this set to implement a decision tree. Based on the outcome of the decision tree, the algorithm fixes the synthesis directives (pragmas) which contribute to minimizing/maximizing one of the cost function objectives and continues the annealing procedure using the decision tree. Experimental results show that the average execution time of our proposed tree based simulated annealing algorithm is on average 36% faster than the standard annealer and can be up to 48% faster, while leading to similar results.

Such massive data must be accurately classified both functionally and structurally. Determining appropriate sequences with a specific function from next generation sequencing, however, is a daunting experimental task. A recent salivary gland transcriptome from the hard tick Ixodes ricinus, a European disease vector, has been made publicly available. Among the protein families sequenced by the salivary gland transcriptome of I. ricinus, the Kunitz-domain is one of the highly represented protein families. Thus far, recent tick transciptomes solely classify (computationally) Kunitz sequences as putative serine protease inhibitors. We present here a novel method using a machine-learning algorithm to "fish" for candidate ion-channel effectors and loss of serine protease inhibitor function within the Kunitzdomain protein family of the I. ricinus salivary gland transcriptome.

Such systems can reduce intersection crashes and fatalities by predicting driver stop-or-run behavior. The research presented in this paper used data collected from a controlled field experiment on the smart road at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute to model driver stop-or-run behavior at the onset of a yellow indication. The paper offers three contributions. First, it evaluates the importance of various model predictors in the modeling of driver stop-or-run behavior in the vicinity of signalized intersections. Second, this paper introduces a new variable related to driver aggressiveness and demonstrates that this measure enhances the modeling of driver stop-or-run behavior. Third, the paper applies well-known machine learning techniques, including k nearest neighbor (k nn), random forests, and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) techniques on the data and compares their performance to standard logistic models in an attempt to identify the optimum modeling framework. The experimental work shows that adding the driver aggressiveness predictor to the model increases the model accuracy by approximately 10% for the logistic, random forest, and k nn models and by 7% for the AdaBoost model. The paper also demonstrates that all modeling frameworks produce similar prediction accuracies.

PMLC exploits limited information of the signal strength and combines a clustering task and a classification task. PMLC is compared with well-known machine learning classifiers, i.e. Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Artificial Neural Networks. The performance comparison is done in terms of accuracy of position classification and precision of distance classifier. The result of this study shows that PMLC can increase performance for indoor positioning of all classifiers when an appropriate number of clusters is assigned in the clustering process. In addition, PMLC is the most optimized model while having Decision Tree to be its classifier.

This has led to an unprecedented growth of biological information. Consequently, techniques that can help researchers find the important insights of the data are becoming more and more important. Molecular measurements from cancer patients such as gene expression and DNA methylation are usually very noisy. Furthermore, cancer types can be very heterogeneous. Therefore, one of the main assumptions for machine learning, that the underlying unknown distribution is the same for all samples in training and test data, might not be completely fulfilled. In this work, we introduce a method that is aware of this potential bias and utilizes an estimate of the differences during the generation of the final prediction method. For this, we introduce a set of sparse classifiers based on L1-SVMs [1], under the constraint of disjoint features used by classifiers. Furthermore, for each feature chosen by one of the classifiers, we introduce a regression model based on Gaussian process regression that uses additional features. For a given test sample we can then use these regression models to estimate for each classifier how well its features are predictable by the corresponding Gaussian process regression model. This information is then used for a confidence-based weighting of the classifiers for the test sample. Schapire and Singer showed that incorporating confidences of classifiers can improve the performance of an ensemble method [2]. However, in their setting confidences of classifiers are estimated using the training data and are thus fixed for all test samples, whereas in our setting we estimate confidences of individual classifiers per given test sample. In our evaluation, the new method achieved state-of-the-art performance on many different cancer data sets with measured DNA methylation or gene expression. Moreover, we developed a method to visualize our learned classifiers to find interesting associations with the target label. Applied to a leukemia data set we found several ribosomal proteins associated with leukemia that might be interesting targets for follow-up studies and support the hypothesis that the ribosomes are a new frontier in gene regulation.

In order to deal with such data, we propose a framework for 3D human pose estimation that relies on random forests. The first contribution is a novel grid-based shape descriptor robust to noisy stereo data that can be used by any classifier. The second contribution is a two step classification procedure, first classifying the body orientation, then proceeding with determining the full 3D pose within this orientation cluster. To validate our method, we introduce a dataset recorded with a stereo camera synchronized with an optical motion capture system that provides ground truth human body poses.

It not only degrades the quality of search results by intentionally boosting undesirable web pages to users, but also causes the search engine to waste a significant amount of computational and storage resources in manipulating useless information. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach for spam detection by adopting the ant colony optimization algorithm. We first construct a directed graph corresponding to web hosts and their aggregated hyperlinks. Then, we train a classifier by employing ants to walk along paths in the graph. Each ant will start from an individual non-spam host and afterwards decides to follow a link to the next host with a probability based on both heuristic function and pheromone trail. Relying on the approximate isolation principle of a good set, we reward an ant that can discover a good path, i.e., a sequence of non-spam hosts, by charging energy for its longer walking. In contrast, if the ant instead discovers any spam, it will be penalized by decreasing its walking step. Finally, the classification rules are constructed by choosing common overlapping characteristic features of all non-spam hosts along the discovered paths. Experiments on WEBSPAM-UK2007 dataset show that our approach contributes to more accurately classify spam and non-spam hosts than several rule-based classification baselines.

In this paper, we describe a computationally efficient approach which automatically detects, tracks and classifies different objects within aerial full motion video (FMV) sequences in the maritime domain. A multi-layered saliency detector is utilized to first remove any image regions likely belonging to background categories (ie, calm water) followed-by progressively pruning out distractor categories such as wake, debris, and reflection. This pruning stage combines features generated at the level of each individual pixel, with 2D descriptors formulated around the outputs of prior stages grouped into connected components. Additional false positive reduction is performed via aggregating detector outputs across multiple frames, by formulating object tracks from these detections and, lastly, by classifying the resultant tracks using machine learning techniques. As a by-product, our system also produces image descriptors specific to each individual object, which are useful in later pipeline elements for appearance-based indexing and matching.

Previous works in motion analysis have used data from sensors (including gyroscopes, accelerometers, and force plates), radar signatures, and video. However, full-motion video, motion capture, range data provides a higher resolution time and spatial dataset for the analysis of dynamic motion. Works using motion capture data have been limited by small datasets in a controlled environment. In this paper, we explore machine learning techniques to a new dataset that has a larger number of subjects. Additionally, these subjects move unrestricted through a capture volume, representing a more realistic, less controlled environment. We conclude that existing linear classification methods are insufficient for the gender classification for larger dataset captured in relatively uncontrolled environment. A method based on a nonlinear support vector machine classifier is proposed to obtain gender classification for the larger dataset. In experimental testing with a dataset consisting of 98 trials (49 subjects, 2 trials per subject), classification rates using leave-one-out cross-validation are improved from 73% using linear discriminant analysis to 88% using the nonlinear support vector machine classifier.

Due to the high dimensionality, large number of classes, presence of noise and complex structure, this is not a trivial task. There exists a need for more precise and computationally efficient algorithms for hyperspectral image segmentation and classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm for segmentation of hyperspectral images and selecting valuable pixels for classifier training procedure. Our approach is based on Quad Tree Decomposition method, which detects homogeneous region in the input image. This allows to precisely detect groups with similar structure and recognize different possible classes on the image. We discuss the computational complexity of our algorithm and show that it can be easily used in real-life applications. Further, this algorithm is extended by active learning approach, which allows to select a single representative pixel for each detected homogeneous region. With this, the classifier is trained on a significantly reduced dataset without sacrificing its quality. We examine the correlation between the number of folds taken by our segmentation algorithm and used classifiers.

These machine learning models are based on measured sensor information. In practice, sensors might fail for several reasons. The prediction models cannot naturally cannot work properly with incomplete patterns. If the imputation method, which completes the missing data, is not appropriately chosen, a bias may be introduced. The objective of this work is to propose the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) regression as geo-imputation preprocessing step for pattern-label-based short-term wind prediction of spatio-temporal wind data sets. The approach is compared to three other methods. The evaluation is based on four turbines with neighbors of the NREL Western Wind Data Set and the values are missing uniformly distributed. The results show that kNN regression is the most superior method for imputation.

In this paper, in order to obtain advantages and disadvantages of both techniques, a prediction of mechanical properties of electrolytic tinplate is made from the data obtained in both methodologies. The predictions, and therefore, the comparative analysis are performed using various machine learning techniques: linear regression, artificial neural networks, support vector machines and regression trees. Data from both methodologies are used to develop models that subsequently are tested with their own method data and with data obtained from mechanical tests. The obtained results show that models based on design of experiments are more accurate, but the models based on finite element simulations better define the problem space.

The information used for this prediction can be extracted from various sources, such as the user attributes or theWeb of Trust (WoT). The WoT contains the user explicit trust declarations, allowing to know who already has expressed trust or distrust on the trustee. Collecting these trust statements we obtain the reputation features of the target trustee. Trust Prediction is then a classification problem that can be solved by machine learning approaches. However, most learning algorithms work on fixed diamension feature spaces, while reputation features are of arbitrary size for each social agent. Using probabilistic descriptors of the reputation feature vector we obtain a fixed dimension representation that is amenable to machine learning aproaches. We demonstrate the Trust Prediction approach on the WoT obtained from the Wikipedia vote network database.

Unauthorized, malicious software can cause expensive damage to both private users and companies. It can destroy the computer, breach the privacy of user and result in loss of valuable data. The amount of data uploaded and downloaded each day makes almost impossible for manual screening of each incoming software package. That is why there is a need for effective intelligent filters, that can automatically dichotomize between the safe and dangerous applications. The number of malware programs, that are faced by the detection system, is typically much smaller than the number of desired programs. Therefore, we have to deal with the imbalanced classification problem, in which standard classification algorithms tend to fail. In this paper, we present a novel ensemble, based on cost-sensitive decision trees. Individual classifiers are constructed according to an established cost matrix and trained on random feature subspaces to ensure, that they are mutually complementary. Instead of using a fixed cost matrix we derive its parameters via ROC analysis. An evolutionary algorithm is being applied for simultaneous classifier selection and assignment of committee member weights for the fusion process. Experimental analysis, carried out on a large malware dataset, prove that our method is capable of outperforming other state-of-the-art algorithms, and hence is an effective approach for the problem of imbalanced malware detection.

Users of a website can express themselves showing their feelings or opinions. This fact has led to negative side effects: sometimes the content generated is inappropriate. Frequently, this content is authored by troll users who deliberately seek controversy. In this paper we propose a new method to detect trolling comments in social news websites. To this end, we extract a combination of statistical, syntactic and opinion features from the user comments. Since this troll phenomenon is quite common in the web, we propose a novel experimental setup for our anomaly detection method: considering troll comments as base model (normal behaviour: 'normality'). We evaluate our approach with data from 'Meneame', a popular Spanish social news site, showing that our method can obtain high rates whilst minimising the labelling task.

However, as happens with other media, each type of information is targeted to a different type of public. Specifically, adult content should not be accessible for children. In this context, several approaches for content filtering have been proposed both in the industry and the academia. Some of these approaches use the text content of a webpage to model a classic bag-of-word model to categorise them and filter the inappropriate content. These methods, to the best of our knowledge, have no semantic information at all and, therefore, they may be surpassed using different attacks that exploit the well-known ambiguity of natural language. Given this background, we present the first semantics-aware adult filtering approach that models webpages, applying a previous wordsense-disambiguation step in order to face the ambiguity. We show that this approach can improve the filtering results of the classic statistical models. abstract environment.

The proposed method was applied to 4 different data set. Discrete and real attributes were decoded in different ways. Discrete attributes were coded as binary whereas real attributes were coded by using two real values These values indicate the midpoint and the expansion of intervals of the attributes that form the rules. Classification success was used as fitness function of rule extraction. CLONALG which is Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) algorithm was used to optimize the fitness function. To apply the proposed method Iris, Wine, Glass and Abalone datasets were used. The datasets were obtained from machine learning repository of University of California at Irvine (UCI). The proposed method achieved prediction accuracy ratios of 100%, 99,44%, 77,10%, and 62,59% for Iris, Wine, Glass and Abalone datasets, respectively. When it is compared with the previous studies it has been seen that the proposed method achieved more successful results and has advantage in terms of complexity.

Although graphical models define the principle information necessary to adapt inference algorithms to specific probabilistic models, entirely model-driven development is not yet possible. However, generating executable code from graphical models could have several advantages. It could reduce the skills necessary to implement probabilistic models and may speed up development processes. Both advantages address pressing industry needs. They come along with increased supply of data scientist labor, the demand of which cannot be fulfilled at the moment. To explore the opportunities of model-driven big data analytics, I review the main modeling languages used in machine learning as well as inference algorithms and corresponding software implementations. Gaps hampering direct code generation from graphical models are identified and closed by proposing an initial conceptualization of a domain-specific modeling language.

The relationship between net flows is closely related to investor perception of the future and past performance of mutual funds. In order to explore the relationship between investor's perception of ETFs and subsequent net flows, this study is designed to shed light on the multifaceted linkages between fund characteristics and net flows. An international selection of 222 ETFs from one of the top three ETF providers is used in this study, of which fifteen attributes from each fund are used because they are likely to be contributors to fund inflows and outflows. Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is used in this study accompanied with machine learning tools to develop a neural network which will forecast a positive or negative flow of net assets for ETFs.

We systematically examine sixteen features for predicting the difficulty of health texts using six different machine learning algorithms. Three represent new features not previously examined: medical concept density; specificity (calculated using word-level depth in MeSH); and ambiguity (calculated using the number of UMLS Metathesaurus concepts associated with a word). We examine these features for a binary prediction task on 118,000 simple and difficult sentences from a sentence-aligned corpus. Using all features, random forests is the most accurate with 84% accuracy. Model analysis of the six models and a complementary ablation study shows that the specificity and ambiguity features are the strongest predictors (24% combined impact on accuracy). Notably, a training size study showed that even with a 1% sample (1,062 sentences) an accuracy of 80% can be achieved.

We demonstrate a novel machine-learning approach to theory identification based on citation data and article features. The multi-disciplinary ecosystem of articles which cite a theory's originating paper is created and refined into the network of papers predicted to contribute to, and thus identify, a specific theory. We provide a 'proof-of-concept' for a highly-cited theory. Implications for cross-disciplinary theory integration and the identification of theories for a rapidly expanding scientific literature are discussed.

One of the key activities of an ISO is load forecasting which is critical to short-term energy trading markets and effective operation of the power grid. In this paper, we analyze load forecasts and develop methods for improving forecasts that can be used directly by ISO's or third parties. Specifically, we assess the hourly electrical load forecasts against actual load data provided by Midwest ISO over a two-year period. Residual analysis shows systematic inaccuracies in hourly forecasts that can be caused by a variety of factors including modeling errors and pumped storage in the grid. We utilize machine learning-based methods to improve forecasts over short time horizons. Our methods reduce the mean squared error of forecasts over the entire year by roughly 20%. By shortening the forecast horizon to 1 to 32 hours, we are able to improve by over 90%. These improvements can be important in operational energy market contexts, where even small differences in forecasts can lead to large swings in transmission behavior and market activity.

Principles of image processing in machine vision systems for the color analysis of minerals	APPLICATIONS OF DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING XXXVII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Applications of Digital Image Processing XXXVII	AUG 18-21, 2014	San Diego, CA	SPIE		color sorting method; image processing; machine vision; color analysis of minerals; low-contrast minerals; color segmentation; solid minerals		At the moment color sorting method is one of promising methods of mineral raw materials enrichment. This method is based on registration of color differences between images of analyzed objects. As is generally known the problem with delimitation of close color tints when sorting low-contrast minerals is one of the main disadvantages of color sorting method. It is can be related with wrong choice of a color model and incomplete image processing in machine vision system for realizing color sorting algorithm. Another problem is a necessity of image processing features reconfiguration when changing the type of analyzed minerals. This is due to the fact that optical properties of mineral samples vary from one mineral deposit to another. Therefore searching for values of image processing features is non-trivial task. And this task doesn't always have an acceptable solution. In addition there are no uniform guidelines for determining criteria of mineral samples separation. It is assumed that the process of image processing features reconfiguration had to be made by machine learning. But in practice it's carried out by adjusting the operating parameters which are satisfactory for one specific enrichment task. This approach usually leads to the fact that machine vision system unable to estimate rapidly the concentration rate of analyzed mineral ore by using color sorting method. This paper presents the results of research aimed at addressing mentioned shortcomings in image processing organization for machine vision systems which are used to color sorting of mineral samples. The principles of color analysis for low-contrast minerals by using machine vision systems are also studied. In addition, a special processing algorithm for color images of mineral samples is developed. Mentioned algorithm allows you to determine automatically the criteria of mineral samples separation based on an analysis of representative mineral samples. Experimental studies of the proposed algorithm were performed using samples of gold and copper-nickel ores. And obtained results confirmed its efficiency with respect to mineral objects. The research results will allow: expanding the use of the color sorting method in the field of mineral raw materials enrichment; facilitating the search for values of image processing features for machine vision systems which are used to the color analysis of minerals; reducing the time required for reconfiguration of image processing features when changing the type of analyzed minerals; realizing the process of rapid estimating the concentration rate of analyzed mineral ore by using color sorting method.

Many approaches are proposed which use supervised machine learning techniques for prediction with features obtained by some databases. However, often we do not know which features are important for driver mutations prediction. In this study, we propose a novel feature selection method (called DX) from 126 candidate features' set. In order to obtain the best performance, rotation forest algorithm was adopted to perform the experiment. On the train dataset which was collected from COSMIC and Swiss-Prot databases, we are able to obtain high prediction performance with 88.03% accuracy, 93.9% precision, and 81.35% recall when the 11 top-ranked features were used. Comparison with other various techniques in the TP53, EGFR, and Cosmic2plus datasets shows the generality of our method.

Based on these molecular interactions (especially protein interactions), molecular networks have been built for using in several typical applications, such as the discovery of new disease genes and the identification of drug targets and molecular complexes. Because the data are incomplete and a considerable number of false-positive interactions exist, protein interactions from different sources are commonly integrated in network analyses to build a stable molecular network. Although various types of integration strategies are being applied in current studies, the topological properties of the networks from these different integration strategies, especially typical applications based on these network integration strategies, have not been rigorously evaluated. In this paper, systematic analyses were performed to evaluate 11 frequently used methods using two types of integration strategies: empirical and machine learning methods. The topological properties of the networks of these different integration strategies were found to significantly differ. Moreover, these networks were found to dramatically affect the outcomes of typical applications, such as disease gene predictions, drug target detections, and molecular complex identifications. The analysis presented in this paper could provide an important basis for future network-based biological researches.

The profiling approach of the student modeling system is based on Felder and Silverman's Learning Styles Model and Felder and Soloman's Index of Learning Styles Questionnaire. The questionnaire was adapted to Turkish for this experimental study conducted with respect to the visual/verbal and active/reflective dimensions of the model. A topic in EFL was chosen for the learning content design, which was also carried into the digital domain and remastered as separate learning scenes for different learning styles. Computer software was also implemented to carry out the experimental learning processes. A quasi-experimental pre-test, post-test design was conducted with 46 volunteers, with 23 students assigned each to a control and an experimental group to compare academic achievement between student-based learning and conventional computer-based learning. No significant difference was found in academic achievement between the control and experimental groups after the experimental treatment. The diagnostic performance of the proposed student modeling system was also compared with performances from similar studies. This student modeling system had a successful prediction rate of 41% on the visual/verbal dimension and 54% on the active/reflective dimension, respectively.

The average sampling of about four days from September to May, yielded a detection of 238 transients in 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 seasons. The superb photometric and astrometric quality of the OGLE data allows for numerous applications of the discovered transients. We use this sample to prepare and train a Machine Learning-based automated classifier for early light curves, which distinguishes major classes of transients with more than 80% of correct answers. Spectroscopically classified 49 supernovae Type Ia are used to construct a Hubble Diagram with statistical scatter of about 0.3 mag and fill the least populated region of the redshifts range in the Union sample. We investigate the influence of host galaxy environments on supernovae statistics and find the mean host extinction of A(I) = 0.19 +/- 0.10 mag and A(V) = 0.39 +/- 0.21 mag based on a subsample of supernovae Type Ia. We show that the positional accuracy of the survey is of the order of 0.5 pixels (0 ''.13) and that the OGLE-IV Transient Detection System is capable of detecting transients within the nuclei of galaxies. We present a few interesting cases of nuclear transients of unknown type. All data on the OGLE transients are made publicly available to the astronomical community via the OGLE website.

They have a tight relation with the information systems. Our goal is to develop a system to support the diagnosis and the classification of epilepsy in children. Around 50 million people in the world have epilepsy. Epilepsy diagnosis can be an extremely complex process, demanding considerable time and effort from physicians and healthcare infrastructures. Exams such as electroencephalograms and magnetic resonances are often used to create a more accurate diagnosis in a short amount of time. After the diagnosis process, physicians classify epilepsy according to the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9). Physicians need to classify each specific type of epilepsy based on different data, e.g., types of seizures, events and exams' results. The classification process is time consuming and, in some cases, demands for complementary exams. This work presents a text mining approach to support medical decisions relating to epilepsy diagnosis and ICD-9-based classification in children. We put forward a text mining approach using electronically processed medical records, and apply the K-Nearest Neighbor technique as a white-box multiclass classifier approach to classify each instance, mapping it to the corresponding ICD-9-based standard code. Results on real medical records suggest that the proposed framework shows good performance and clear interpretations, albeit the reduced volume of available training data. To overcome this hurdle, in this work we also propose and explore ways of expanding the dataset.

First, multivariate discretization method is implemented to convert continuous military simulation data into discrete data. Then, rough set theory is employed to generate the simple rules and to remove irrelevant and redundant variables. Finally, OELM is compared with classical extreme learning machine (ELM) and support vector machine (SVM) to evaluate the performance of both original and reduced military simulation datasets.

In this paper, hybrid intelligent forecasting models based on the cuckoo search (CS) as well as the singular spectrum analysis (SSA), time series, and machine learning methods are proposed to conduct short-term power load prediction. The forecasting performance of the proposed models is augmented by a rolling multistep strategy over the prediction horizon. The test results are representative of the out-performance of the SSA and CS in tuning the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and support vector regression (SVR) in improving load forecasting, which indicates that both the SSA-based data denoising and SI-based intelligent optimization strategy can effectively improve the model's predictive performance. Additionally, the proposed CS-SSA-SARIMA and CS-SSA-SVR models provide very impressive forecasting results, demonstrating their strong robustness and universal forecasting capacities in terms of short-term power load prediction 24 hours in advance.

The design of an efficient model and the proper adjustment of the SVMs parameters are integral to reducing the testing time and enhancing performance. In this paper, a new bipartite objective function consisted of the sparseness property and generalization performance is proposed. Since the proposed objective function is based on selecting fewer numbers of the support vectors, the model complexity is reduced while the performance accuracy remains at an acceptable level. Due to the model complexity reduction, the testing time is decreased and the ability of SVM in practical applications is increased Moreover, to prove the performance of the proposed objective function, a comparative study was carried out on the proposed objective function and the conventional objective function, which is only based on the generalization performance, using the Binary Genetic Algorithm (BGA) and Real-valued vectors GA (RGA). The effectiveness of the proposed cost function is demonstrated based on the results of the comparative study on four real-world datasets of UCI database.

We compare the standard method of binning with a turbulence renormalization method and a machine learning approach using a data set derived from simulations. The method of binning is unable to cope with changes in turbulence; the turbulence renormalization method cannot account for changes in shear other than by using the the equivalent wind speed, which is derived from wind speed data at multiple heights in the rotor disk. The machine learning method is best able to predict the power as conditions change, and could be modified to include additional inflow variables such as veer or yaw error.

Hence, finding efficient and discriminative genes is crucial to cancer classification. However, the problem is NP-complete and brings out a great challenge for machine learning and statistic techniques. In this paper, a class of sparse q-norm regularization terms (0 < q <= 2) are considered for the developing sparse classifiers for determining discriminative genes, and classification algorithm of conjugate gradient q-norm regularization Logistic regression is proposed. This approach was tried on synthetic datasets and bladder, lymphoma and colon benchmark data sets. It obtained encouraging results on those data sets as compared with L1-norm and L2-norm Logistic regression.

Based on the analysis of the existed classifier for skin damages, a complex group classifier based on lie group machine learning algorithm is introduced in this paper. According to the damage infrared thermal images obtained by the infrared thermal imager, the feature of internal defects of the skin specific defects is extracted and a discriminant function is established, and then a direct classification for the input image is realized.

Several machine learning approaches have been applied to malware detection, based on different features derived from dynamic analysis of the malware. While these methods demonstrate promise, they pose at least two major challenges. First, these approaches are subjected to a growing array of countermeasures that increase the cost of capturing these malware binary executable file features. Further, feature extraction requires a time investment per binary file that does not scale well to the daily volume of malware instances being reported by those who diligently collect malware. In order to address the first challenge, this article proposed a binary-to-image projection algorithm based on a new type of feature extraction for the malware, was introduced in [2]. To address the second challenge, the technique's scalability is demonstrated through an implementation for the distributed (Key, Value) abstraction in cloud computing environment. Both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrate its effectiveness over other state-of-the-art malware detection techniques on malware corpus, and the proposed method could be a useful and efficient complement to dynamic analysis.

The traditional algorithms for structure learning are usually focused on the batch data in nature. It is difficult to learn the structure quickly from the huge amounts of data. But in many practical applications, the structure of BN should be learned by using time-series data that are available to us. To achieve this goal, we propose an incremental structure learning approach for BN. Firstly, we proposed the framework of incremental structure learning and a new evaluation criterion "ABIC" (Adopt Bayesian Information Criterion) based on the BIC. Then, three phase algorithm is used to learn the structure. Numerical experiments on two standard networks show that our proposed algorithm can greatly improve the accuracy of the structure and the total of learning time is greatly reduced.

To resolve this problem, an improved algorithm based on C4.5 is proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithm firstly modifies the available training data according to the predictions of C4.5, then continuous data is discretized by dividing many finite intervals of attributes, this modified training data is used to train TANG. In this way it can improve the classification accuracy of the TANG. The experimental results show that the improved algorithm is superior to TANG in terms of classification accuracy.

In this work we present an empirical performance evaluation of classification strategies for metagenomic gene prediction. This comparison takes into account distinct supervised learning strategies: one lazy learner, two eager-learners and one ensemble learner. Though the performance of the four base classifiers was good, the ensemble-based strategy with Random Forest has achieved the overall best result.

Therefore, it contains useful information for diagnosis of epilepsy. However, it is a very time consuming and costly task to handle these subtle details by a human observer. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) was proposed to automate the process of seizure detection in EEG signals. Initially, the EEG signals have been analysed using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for features extraction. Then, the PSO algorithm has been trained to recognize the epileptic signals in EEG data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of classification accuracy and stability. A comparison with other methods in the literature confirms the superiority of the PSO.

This paper proposed a sample index based encoding method, which significantly reduces the search space of evolutionary computation so the clustering algorithm converged quickly. Evolutionary computation has a good global search ability while the traditional clustering method k-means has a better capability at local search. In order to combine the strengths of both, this paper researched on the effect of initializing k-means by evolutionary computation algorithms. Experiments were conducted on five commonly used evolutionary computation algorithms. Experimental results show that the sample index based encoding method and evolutionary computation initialized k-means both perform well and demonstrate great potential.

In this short review, the main neuroimaging techniques which have shown potential as biomarkers for AD are introduced, with a focus on MRI. Structural MRI measures of the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe are still the most clinically validated biomarkers for AD, but newer techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging offer great scope in tracking changes in the brain, particularly in functional and structural connectivity, which may precede gray matter atrophy. These new advances in neuroimaging methods require further development and crucially, standardization; however, before they are used as biomarkers to aid in the diagnosis of AD.

Biologically-plausible models are usually organized into a hierarchy that models the brain in primates after carefully examining neurophysiological and psychophysical studies. Currently, these models extract some values (corners, edges, textures, contours) from images and then apply machine learning algorithms to learn objects or shapes. Are they really that different from classical, non-biologically-inspired, computer vision methods? What facts can we learn from the primate visual system other than the extensively used edge extraction by means of Gabor filters? Should we work more on the representation along this hierarchy before applying a learning strategy?

In recent years, however, a number of effective physical attacks on PUFs have been developed [17,18,20,8,2]. This paper continues this line of research, and introduces the first power and timing side channels (SCs) on PUFs, more specifically on Arbiter PUF variants. Concretely, we attack so-called XOR Arbiter PUFs and Lightweight PUFs, which prior to our work were considered the most secure members of the Arbiter PUF family [28,30]. We show that both architectures can be tackled with polynomial complexity by a combined SC and machine learning approach. Our strategy is demonstrated in silicon on FPGAs, where we attack the above two architectures for up to 16 XORs and 512 bits. For comparison, in earlier works XOR-based Arbiter PUF designs with only up to 5 or 6 XORs and 64 or 128 bits had been tackled successfully. Designs with 8 XORs and 512 bits had been explicitly recommended as secure for practical use [28,30]. Together with recent modeling attacks [28,30], our work shows that unless suitable design countermeasures are put in place, no remaining member of the Arbiter PUF family resists all currently known attacks. Our work thus motivates research on countermeasures in Arbiter PUFs, or on the development of entirely new Strong PUF designs with improved resilience.

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Cardiac Imaging: Harnessing Big Data and Advanced Computing to Provide Personalized Medical Diagnosis and Treatment	CURRENT CARDIOLOGY REPORTS			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Big data; Personalized medicine; IBM's Watson; Electronic health records; Neural networks; Cardiac imaging	NEURAL-NETWORKS; ERRORS	Although advances in information technology in the past decade have come in quantum leaps in nearly every aspect of our lives, they seem to be coming at a slower pace in the field of medicine. However, the implementation of electronic health records (EHR) in hospitals is increasing rapidly, accelerated by the meaningful use initiatives associated with the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services EHR Incentive Programs. The transition to electronic medical records and availability of patient data has been associated with increases in the volume and complexity of patient information, as well as an increase in medical alerts, with resulting "alert fatigue" and increased expectations for rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, these increased demands on health care providers create greater risk for diagnostic and therapeutic errors. In the near future, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning will likely assist physicians with differential diagnosis of disease, treatment options suggestions, and recommendations, and, in the case of medical imaging, with cues in image interpretation. Mining and advanced analysis of "big data" in health care provide the potential not only to perform "in silico" research but also to provide "real time" diagnostic and (potentially) therapeutic recommendations based on empirical data. "On demand" access to high-performance computing and large health care databases will support and sustain our ability to achieve personalized medicine. The IBM Jeopardy! Challenge, which pitted the best all-time human players against the Watson computer, captured the imagination of millions of people across the world and demonstrated the potential to apply AI approaches to a wide variety of subject matter, including medicine. The combination of AI, big data, and massively parallel computing offers the potential to create a revolutionary way of practicing evidence-based, personalized medicine.

Such a system is well-suited to the increasing deployment of low-power devices with ubiquitous internet connectivity. Our proposal makes use of previous work on extracting a feature vector from network packets using a histogram of hashed n-grams. The commercially available CogniMem CM1K device implements a version of the Restricted Coulomb Energy neural network classifier, which was used to classify the resulting feature vectors at high speed and low power. In this paper, we describe our feature extraction technique for network packets and the classification algorithm used by the CM1K chip, and present initial classification results on a fabricated test set. Despite the generality of the RCE algorithm and our 'plug-in' approach to the classification task, with no fine-tuning of the hardware to our problem domain, we obtain surprisingly good classification results even on highly imbalanced and restricted training sets.

The proposed terrain classification system is mainly based on the analysis of volunteered geographic information gathered by cyclists. By using participatory accelerometer and GPS sensor data collected from the cyclists' smartphones, which is enriched with image data from geographic web services or the smartphone camera, the proposed system is able to distinguish between 6 different terrain types. For the classification of the multi-modal bike data, the system employs a random decision forest (RDF), which compared favorably for the geo-annotation task against different classification algorithms. The system classifies the features of every instance of road (over a 5 seconds interval) and maps the results onto the corresponding GPS coordinates. Finally, based on all the collected instances, we can annotate geographic maps with the terrain types, create more advanced route statistics and facilitate geo-based recommender systems. The accuracy of the bike sensing system is 92% for 6-class terrain classification. For the 2-class on-road/off-road classification an accuracy of 97 % is achieved, almost six percent above the state-of-the-art in this domain.

Distributed Cache Strategies for Machine Learning Classification Tasks over Cluster Computing Resources	HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING, CARLA 2014	Communications in Computer and Information Science		English	Proceedings Paper	1st HPCLATAM - CLCAR Latin American Joint Conference	OCT 20-22, 2014	Valparaiso, CHILE	Univ Tecnica Federico Santa Maria, Valparaiso Ctr Sci & Technol, Univ Chile, Natl Lab High Performance Comp, Intel, NVidia, Seagate, Siasa	Univ Santa Maria			Scaling machine learning (ML) methods to learn from large datasets requires devising distributed data architectures and algorithms to support their iterative nature where the same data records are processed several times. Data caching becomes key to minimize data transmission through iterations at each node and, thus, contribute to the overall scalability. In this work we propose a two level caching architecture (disk and memory) and benchmark different caching strategies in a distributed machine learning setup over a cluster with no shared RAM memory. Our results strongly favour strategies where (1) datasets are partitioned and preloaded throughout the distributed memory of the cluster nodes and (2) algorithms use data locality information to synchronize computations at each iteration. This supports the convergence towards models where "computing goes to data" as observed in other Big Data contexts, and allows us to align strategies for parallelizing ML algorithms and configure appropriately computing infrastructures.

One of the core issues for the efficient management of such applications is the prediction of tasks performance. This paper proposes a novel approach that enables the construction models for predicting task's running-times of data-intensive scientific workflows. Ensemble Machine Learning techniques are used to produce robust combined models with high predictive accuracy. Information derived from workflow systems and the characteristics and provenance of the data are exploited to guarantee the accuracy of the models. The proposed approach has been tested on Bioinformatics workflows for Gene Expressions Analysis over homogeneous and heterogeneous computing environments. Obtained results highlight the convenience of using ensemble models in comparison with single/standalone prediction models. Ensemble learning techniques permitted reductions of the prediction error up to 24.9% in comparison with single-model strategies.

Beginning with Leibniz, scholars have attempted to unify logic and probability. For "classical" AI, based largely on first-order logic, the purpose of such a unification is to handle uncertainty and facilitate learning from real data; for "modern" AI, based largely on probability theory, the purpose is to acquire formal languages with sufficient expressive power to handle complex domains and incorporate prior knowledge. This paper provides a brief summary of an invited talk describing efforts in these directions, focusing in particular on open-universe probability models that allow for uncertainty about the existence and identity of objects.

Kernel theory provides an elegant way to map multi-source heterogeneous data into a combined homogeneous (implicit) space in which aggregation can be carried out. The focus of our initial work was the Choquet FI, a per-matrix sorting based on the quality of a base learner and learning was restricted to the Sugeno lambda-fuzzy measure (FM). Herein, we investigate what representations of FMs and FIs are valid and ideal for nonlinear MK aggregation. We also discuss the benefit of our approach over the linear convex sum MK formulation in machine learning. Furthermore, we study the Mobius transform and k-additive integral for scalable MK learning (MKL). Last, we discuss an extension to our genetic algorithm (GA) based MKL algorithm, called FIGA, with respect to a combination of multiple light weight FMs and FIs.

However, there are unresolved questions on how to model real-time emotionally intelligent applications through mapping of physiological patterns to users' affective states. In this study, we consider an approach for design of fuzzy affective agent based on the concept of typicality. We propose the use of typicality degrees of physiological patterns to construct the fuzzy rules representing the continuous transitions of user's affective states. The approach was tested on experimental data in which physiological measures were recorded on players involved in an action game to characterize various gaming experiences. We show that, in addition to exploitation of the results to characterize users' affective states through typicality degrees, this approach is a systematic way to automatically define fuzzy rules from experimental data for an affective agent to be used in real-time continuous assessment of user's affective states.

In this paper, we present a general semantic feature selection method for text problems based on the statistical t-test and WordNet, and we show its effectiveness on phishing email detection by designing classifiers that combine semantics and statistics in analyzing the text in the email. Our feature selection method is general and useful for other applications involving text-based analysis as well. Our email body-text-only classifier achieves more than 95% accuracy on detecting phishing emails with a false positive rate of 2.24 %. Due to its use of semantics, our feature selection method is robust against adaptive attacks and avoids the problem of frequent retraining needed by machine learning classifiers.

However, because only limited types of descriptors characterising the protein features are included in these approaches, these methods have poor prediction accuracy. In this study, we applied support vector machine methods to predict the peptides that bind to the major histocompatibility complexes Class II molecule HLA-DRB1*0401 using six sets of molecular descriptors characterising the primary structures of the peptides. We found that some feature groups provided good prediction accuracies and the overall accuracies were greater than 95% and some feature groups had poor accuracies of only 50%. The performance was improved significantly by additional feature selection and the overall accuracies from each group or combination of descriptors were greater than 90%. Of note, the inclusion of necessary informative and discriminative descriptors improved the prediction accuracies.

Though many taggers are available for this Named Entity Recognition (NER) task, we found none of them achieve a good state-of-art tagging for human genes/proteins. As most of the current text mining research is related to human literature, a good tagger to precisely tag human genes and proteins is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid approach based on (a) machine learning algorithm (conditional random fields), (b) set of (manually constructed) rules, and (c) a novel abbreviation identification algorithm to surmount the common errors observed in available taggers to tag human genes/proteins. Experiment results on JNLPBA2004 corpus show that our domain specific approach achieves a high precision of 80.47, F-score of 75.77 and outperforms most of the state-of-the-art systems. However, the recall of 71.60 still remains low and leaves much room for future improvement.

TOMATO DC3000; PATHOGEN PSEUDOMONAS-SYRINGAE; GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIA; VIRULENCE EFFECTORS; HOMOLOGY DETECTION; PROTEINS; SYSTEM; SEQUENCES; SIGNALS; SCREEN	The type III secretion system (T3SS) is a specialised protein delivery system that plays an important role in pathogenic bacteria. However, the secretion mechanism has not been fully understood yet. Especially, the identification of type III secreted effectors is a notoriously challenging problem which has attracted a lot of research interests in recent years. In this paper, we introduce a machine learning method using amino acid sequence features for predicting T3SEs. We use a topic model called HMM-LDA to select useful features, and conduct experiments on Pseudomonas syringae as well as some other bacterial genomes. The cross-validation results on P. syringae data set show an improved prediction accuracy with the reduced feature set. The experimental results on the test sets also demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed method is comparable to or better than the accuracies achieved by other available T3SE prediction tools.

In particular, marking the salient regions in images is useful for both psychologists and many computer vision applications. In this paper, we propose a computational approach for producing saliency maps using statistics and machine learning methods. Based on four assumptions, three properties (Feature-Prior, Position-Prior, and Feature-Distribution) can be derived and combined by a simple intersection operation to obtain a saliency map. These properties are implemented by a similarity computation, support vector regression (SVR) technique, statistical analysis of training samples, and information theory using low-level features. This technique is able to learn the preferences of human visual behavior while simultaneously considering feature uniqueness. Experimental results show that our approach performs better in predicting human visual attention regions than 12 other models in two test databases.

A wide variety of applications arise on the Internet and traffic classification is introduced to help people manage the massive applications on the Internet for security monitoring and quality of service purposes. A large number of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are introduced to deal with traffic classification. A significant challenge to the classification performance comes from imbalanced distribution of data in traffic classification system. In this paper, we proposed an Optimised Distance-based Nearest Neighbor (ODNN), which has the capability of improving the classification performance of imbalanced traffic data. We analyzed the proposed ODNN approach and its performance benefit from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. A large number of experiments were implemented on the real-world traffic dataset. The results show that the performance of "small classes" can be improved significantly even only with small number of training data and the performance of "large classes" remains stable.

We used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for the mental stress index. We previously constructed a machine learning algorithm to predict mental stress level using two-channel NIRS data from the PFC in 19 subjects aged 20-24 years at rest (Sato et al., Adv Exp Med Biol 765: 251-256, 2013). In the present study, we attempted the same prediction for aged subjects aged 61-79 years (10 women; 7 men). The mental stress index was again STAI. After subjects answered the STAI questionnaire, the NIRS device measured oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentration changes during a 3-min resting state. The algorithm was formulated within a Bayesian machine learning framework and implemented by Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation was performed. Average prediction error between the actual and predicted STAI values was 5.27. Prediction errors of 12 subjects were lower than 5.0. Since the STAI score ranged from 20 to 80, the algorithm appeared functional for aged subjects also.

The availability of drug-target interaction data has boosted the development of machine learning methods for the in silico prediction of drug-target interactions. In this paper we focus on the crucial issue of data bias. We show that four popular datasets contain a bias because of the way they have been constructed: all drug compounds and target proteins have at least one interaction and some of them have only a single interaction. We show that this bias can be exploited by prediction methods to achieve an optimistic generalization performance as estimated by cross-validation procedures, in particular leave-one-out cross validation. We discuss possible ways to mitigate the effect of this bias, in particular by adapting the validation procedure. In general, results indicate that the data bias should be taken into account when assessing the generalization performance of machine learning methods for the in silico prediction of drug-target interactions.

Here, we address the question of what can be done when it is relatively easy to obtain healthy patient samples, but when abnormalities corresponding to disease states may be rare and one-of-a-kind. The associated computational challenge, anomaly detection, is a well-studied machine learning problem. However, due to the dimensionality and variability of expression data, existing methods based on feature space analysis or individual anomalously-expressed genes are insufficient. We present a novel approach, CSAX, that identifies pathways in an individual sample in which the normal expression relationships are disrupted. To evaluate our approach, we have compiled and released a compendium of public microarray data sets, reformulated to create a testbed for anomaly detection. We demonstrate the accuracy of CSAX on the data sets in our compendium, compare it to other leading anomaly-detection methods, and show that CSAX aids both in identifying anomalies and in explaining their underlying biology. We note the potential for the use of such methods in identifying subclasses of disease. We also describe an approach to characterizing the difficulty of specific expression anomaly detection tasks and discuss how one can estimate the feasibility of a specific task. Our approach provides an important step towards identification of individual disease patterns in the era of personalized medicine.

The current algorithms transform a multi-label learning task to several binary single-label tasks, and then compute the average score of the features across all single-label tasks. Few research discusses the effect in averaging the scores. To this end, we discuss multi-label feature selection in the framework of fuzzy rough sets. We define a novel dependency functions with three fusion methods if the fuzzy lower approximation of each label has been calculated. A forward greedy algorithm is constructed to reduce the redundancy of the selected features. Numerical experiments validate the performance of the proposed method.

However, due to the large distortion, catadioptric camera calibration from circles remains a challenging and open problem. Under central catadioptric camera, circles in a scene are projected to quartic curves on the image plane. Except for the sufficient and necessary conditions that must be satisfied by paracatadioptric circle image, the properties of the antipodal image points and the absolute conic are both very important for catadioptric camera calibration. In this paper, we study the properties of the antipodal image points on paracatadioptric circle image, that is the criterion conditions for the antipodal image points on circle image. What's more, we show the image of the absolute conic, and derive the constraint equations about the intrinsic parameters of central catadioptric camera. Finally, we discuss on the central catadioptric camera calibration using circle images.

A number of approaches have been proposed to represent and cluster documents. One of the recent trends in document clustering research is to incorporate the semantic information into document representation. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique for capturing the robust and reliable semantic information from term-term co-occurrence statistics. Firstly, we propose a novel method to evaluate the explicit semantic relation between terms from their co-occurrence information. Then the underlying semantic relation between terms is also captured by their interaction with other terms. Lastly, these two complementary semantic relations are integrated together to capture the complete semantic information from the original documents. Experimental results show that clustering performance improves significantly by enriching document representation with the semantic information.

Ensemble learning can improve not only the accuracy but also the efficiency of the classification system. Constructing the component classifiers in ensemble learning is crucial, because it has direct influence on the performance of the classification system. In the construction of component classifiers, it should be guaranteed that the constructed component classifiers possess certain accuracy and diversity. Based on the confidence degree of classifier, this paper presents an approach consisting of three steps to dynamically integrate rough set reducts. Firstly, multiple reducts are computed. Secondly, multiple component classifiers with certain diversity are trained on the different reducts. Finally, these component classifiers are integrated by adopting dynamic integration strategy. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and feasible.

Multiple entropy and entropy-like measures have been explored to aid in epileptic seizure classification including Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, spectral entropy, Renyi entropy, approximate entropy, and equal frequency discretization. Here we propose a more computational efficient measure which calculates a discrete probability distribution directly from the recorded amplitudes of an EEG recording over a specified window and uses an entropy-like calculation to reduce dimensionality.

Self-tag sparsity refers to the problem of low recall obtained when searching for people on systems based on user profiles. In this paper, we use not only users' self-tags but also their friend relationships (which are often not hidden) to expand the tag list and measure the effectiveness of different types of friendship links and their self-tags. Experimental results show that friendship information (friendship links and profiles) can effectively improve the performance of tag expansion, especially for common users who have limited followers.

For either focus, particle time series are typically analyzed by ensemble averaging over paths, a perfectly natural protocol for homogeneous materials or for applications where mean properties are sufficient. Many biological materials, however, are heterogeneous over length scales above the probe diameter, and the implications of heterogeneity for biologically relevant transport properties (e.g. diffusive passage times through a complex fluid layer) motivate this paper. Our goals are three-fold: first, to detect heterogeneity as reflected by the ensemble path data; second, to further decompose the ensemble of particle paths into statistically distinct clusters; and third, to fit the path data in each cluster to a model for the underlying stochastic process. After reviewing current best practices for detection and assessment of heterogeneity in diffusive processes, we introduce our strategy toward the first two goals with methods from the statistics and machine learning literature that have not found application thus far to passive particle tracking data. We apply an analysis based solely on the path data that detects heterogeneity and yields a decomposition of particle paths into statistically distinct clusters. After these two goals are achieved, one can then pursue modelfitting. We illustrate these heterogeneity metrics on diverse datasets: for numerically generated and experimental particle paths, with tunable and unknown heterogeneity, on numerical models for simple diffusion and anomalous sub-diffusion, and experimentally on sucrose, hyaluronic acid, agarose, and human lung culture mucus solutions.

Most recent works concerning unsupervised learning have been focused on clustering, showing great potential of ACO-based techniques. This work presents an ACO-based clustering algorithm inspired by the ACO Clustering (ACOC) algorithm. The proposed approach restructures ACOC from a centroid-based technique to a medoid-based technique, where the properties of the search space are not necessarily known. Instead, it only relies on the information about the distances amongst data. The new algorithm, called MACOC, has been compared against well-known algorithms (K-means and Partition Around Medoids) and with ACOC. The experiments measure the accuracy of the algorithm for both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets extracted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Size of matrices has been increasing with the development of computational resources and dissemination of big data. Huge matrices are memory- and computational-time-consuming. Therefore, reducing the size and computational time of huge matrices is a key challenge in the data processing area. We develop MOARLE, a novel matrix computation framework that saves memory space and computational time. In contrast to conventional matrix computational methods that target to sparse matrices, MOARLE can efficiently handle both sparse matrices and dense matrices. Our experimental results show that MOARLE can reduce the memory usage to 2% of the original usage and improve the computational performance by a factor of 124x.

As people have many opportunities to express their opinions using various on-line channels (e. g., discussions, microblogs, social networks), the question is whether such data might be used for this purpose. Information hidden in the data includes the reasons why people perceive products or services as good or bad, what are the reasons of clients' satisfaction or dissatisfaction, or what affects their sentiment. However, having the needed large amounts of data, it is hardly possible to process it manually. This paper presents a method that aims at automatic discovery of sources of human feelings hidden in textual messages that clients produce. For a demonstration, messages having a form of freely written reviews containing subjective evaluation of medical services were used. During analysis of the data, clusters representing groups of the whole reviews (or individual sentences) with a certain requested degree of similarity were created in an unsupervised manner. Then, a decision tree classifier was trained in order to find attributes (words) of the reviews that were significant for assigning the reviews to the clusters. Because individual words were sometimes not informative enough they were subsequently used as a starting point for searching for frequent multi-word expressions. As a result, the list of multi-word phrases representing frequent and important sources of clients' opinions was presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

By the same token, it became obvious that accurate and interpretable models need to concern more than raw measurements taken at a single phase of gene expression. In order to reach a deeper understanding of the molecular nature of complexly orchestrated biological processes, all the available measurements and existing genomic knowledge need to be fused. In this paper, we introduce a tool for machine learning from heterogeneous gene expression data using prior knowledge. The tool is called miXGENE, it is elaborated upon in close connection with the biological departments that dispose of the above-mentioned data and have a strong interest in their integration within particular problem-oriented projects. The main idea is not merely to capture the transcriptional phase of gene expression quantified by the amount of messenger RNA (mRNA). The increasing availability of microRNA (miRNA) data asks for its concurrent analysis with the transcriptional data. Moreover, epigenetic data such as methylation measurements can help to explain unexpected transcriptional irregularities. miXGENE is an environment for building workflows that enable rapid prototyping of integrative molecular models.

Active input modes include digital pens, smartphones, and automatic handwriting recognition for a direct digitalisation of patient data. Passive input modes include sensors of the clinical environment and/or mobile smartphones. This combination for knowledge acquisition and decision support (while using machine learning techniques) has not yet been explored in clinical environments and is of specific interest because it combines previously unconnected information sources for individualised treatments. The innovative aspect is a holistic view on individual patients based on ontologies, terminologies, and textual patient records whereby individual active and passive real-time patient data can be taken into account for improving clinical decision support.

These tests, however, are inconsistent, costly and, oftentimes suffer from poor intra-and inter-judge reliability. As such, consistent, reliable, and perceptually-relevant objective evaluations of pathological speech are critical. Here, we propose a data-driven approach to this problem. We propose new cost functions for examining data from a series of experiments, whereby we ask certified SLPs to rate pathological speech along the perceptual dimensions that contribute to decreased intelligibility. We consider qualitative feedback from SLPs in the form of comparisons similar to statements "Is Speaker A's rhythm more similar to Speaker B or Speaker C?" Data of this form is common in behavioral research, but is different from the traditional data structures expected in supervised (data matrix + class labels) or unsupervised (data matrix) machine learning. The proposed method identifies relevant acoustic features that correlate with the ordinal data collected during the experiment. Using these features, we show that we are able to develop objective measures of the speech signal degradation that correlate well with SLP responses.

Many filter methods of feature selection are based on the mutual information (e.g. MIFS, MIFS-U, NMIFS, and mRMR methods). In this work, a new mutual information is defined based on the cross survival information potential (CSIP) and Cauchy-Schwartz divergence (CSD), called the survival Cauchy-Schwartz mutual information (SCS-MI). We apply this new mutual information to select an informative subset of features for a SVM classifier. Experimental results illustrate the desirable performance of the new method.

In this paper, we investigate the estimation of triphone acoustic models in parallel with the estimation of trigrapheme acoustic models under the MTL framework using deep neural network (DNN). As triphone modeling and trigrapheme modeling are highly related learning tasks, a better shared internal representation (the hidden layers) can be learned to improve their generalization performance. Experimental evaluation on three low-resource South African languages shows that triphone DNNs trained by the MTL approach perform significantly better than triphone DNNs that are trained by the single-task learning (STL) approach by similar to 3-13%. The MTL-DNN triphone models also outperform the ROVER result that combines a triphone STL-DNN and a trigrapheme STL-DNN.

COLLABORATIVE REPRESENTATION, SPARSITY OR NONLINEARITY: WHAT IS KEY TO DICTIONARY BASED CLASSIFICATION?	2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (ICASSP)	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing ICASSP		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	MAY 04-09, 2014	Florence, ITALY	IEEE		Machine Learning; Sparse Representation; Collaborative Representation	RECOGNITION	Recent studies have suggested that the critical aspect of sparse representation-based classification (SRC) is collaborative representation, rather than sparsity. This has given rise to fast collaborative representation-based classification using 2-norm regularized least squares (CRC-RLS). This paper digs deeper into the difference between SRC and CRC-RLS. We show that linear coding schemes such as CRC-RLS share a common pairwise boundary class B. Moreover, the corresponding pairwise classifiers can be realized by quadratic SVMs. Using three datasets, we show empirically that collaborative representations are not always required, and that a quadratic SVM has superior generalization over CRC-RLS, with fast classification times. However, SRC exhibits the best prediction accuracy. This leads us to posit that the nonlinear coding of SRC is a key attribute.

This paper addresses the emerging problem of comparing multivariate overcomplete dictionaries. Despite a recurrent need to rely on a distance for learning or assessing multivariate overcomplete dictionaries, no metrics in their underlying spaces have yet been proposed. Henceforth we propose to study overcomplete representations from the perspective of matrix manifolds. We consider distances between multivariate dictionaries as distances between their spans which reveal to be elements of a Grassmannian manifold. We introduce set-metrics defined on Grassmannian spaces and study their properties both theoretically and numerically. Thanks to the introduced metrics, experimental convergences of dictionary learning algorithms are assessed on synthetic datasets. Set-metrics are embedded in a clustering algorithm for a qualitative analysis of real EEG signals for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). The obtained clusters of subjects are associated with subject performances. This is a major methodological advance to understand the BCI-inefficiency phenomenon and to predict the ability of a user to interact with a BCI.

In this paper, we design a learning algorithm for multiclass support vector machines that allows us to enforce sparsity through various nonsmooth regularizations, such as the mixed l(1,p)-norm with p >= 1. The proposed constrained convex optimization approach involves an epigraphical constraint for which we derive the closed-form expression of the associated projection. This sparse multiclass SVM problem can be efficiently implemented thanks to the flexibility offered by recent primal-dual proximal algorithms. Experiments carried out for handwritten digits demonstrate the interest of considering nonsmooth sparsity-inducing regularizations and the efficiency of the proposed epigraphical projection method.

This problem is motivated by a common methodology in machine learning where a probability distribution is represented as the sample mean of kernel functions. In applications where this kernel mean function is evaluated repeatedly, having a sparse approximation is essential for scalability. However, existing sparse approximation algorithms such as matching and basis pursuit scale quadratically in the sample size, and are therefore not well suited to this problem for large sample sizes. We introduce an approximation bound involving a novel incoherence measure, and propose bound minimization as a sparse approximation strategy. In the context of sparsely approximating a kernel mean function, the bound is efficiently minimized by solving an appropriate instance of the k-center problem, and the resulting algorithm has linear complexity in the sample size.

Most of the existing works are based on the machine learning method with social network structure analysis and empirical data mining. However, the results learned from some specific dataset may not apply to the future networks, since the social network structure is in a highly dynamic environment. Moreover, the dynamics of information diffusion are also heavily influenced by network users' decisions, actions and their socio-economic interactions, which is generally ignored by existing works. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic framework to model the dynamic information diffusion process in social networks, which focuses on the users' behavior analysis from a microeconomics points of view. We also conduct experiments by using real-world Twitter information diffusion dataset, which shows that the proposed evolutionary game theoretic model is effective and practical in modeling the social network users' information diffusion dynamics.

Still, moderate to high values of the data dimension D and/or data record size N may render the optimal algorithm unsuitable for practical implementation due to its exponential in D complexity.

Aphasia rehabilitation requires intensive practice accompanied by appropriate feedback, the latter of which is difficult to satisfy outside of therapy. In this paper we take a first step towards developing an intelligent system capable of providing feedback to patients with aphasia through the automation of two typical therapeutic exercises, sentence building and picture description. We describe the natural speech corpus collected from our interaction with clients in the University of Michigan Aphasia Program (UMAP). We develop classifiers to automatically estimate speech quality based on human perceptual judgment. Our automatic prediction yields accuracies comparable to the average human evaluator. Our feature selection process gives insights into the factors that influence human evaluation. The results presented in this work provide support for the feasibility of this type of system.

A well-known class of MC methods is composed of importance sampling and its adaptive extensions (e. g., population Monte Carlo). In this work, we introduce an adaptive importance sampler using a population of proposal densities. The novel algorithm provides a global estimation of the variables of interest iteratively, using all the samples generated. The cloud of proposals is adapted by learning from a subset of previously generated samples, in such a way that local features of the target density can be better taken into account compared to single global adaptation procedures. Numerical results show the advantages of the proposed sampling scheme in terms of mean absolute error and robustness to initialization.

Large variations in the fetal HR is a good indicator that the fetus is in distress thus allowing for clinical intervention. Although advances have been made in the field of fetal HR detection, more can be done to improve accuracy and efficiency. The Variable Pulse Width - Finite Rate of Innovation (VPW-FRI) method is a suitable method given it deals with pulse parameters such as location, width and amplitude. This allows it to automatically segment and identify the foetal QRS complexes and R peak locations from compressed samples which in turn would yield the fetal HR. Our method, which includes model based denoising and multichannel capability, is comparable to other methods involving machine learning, wavelets and ICA.

On a dataset of about 100 minutes of music with 26k annotated onsets, we show that CNNs outperform the previous state-of-the-art while requiring less manual preprocessing. Investigating their inner workings, we find two key advantages over hand-designed methods: Using separate detectors for percussive and harmonic onsets, and combining results from many minor variations of the same scheme. The results suggest that even for well-understood signal processing tasks, machine learning can be superior to knowledge engineering.

Among these, commonly used strategies such as one-vs-one classification can require learning a large number of hyperplanes, even when the number of classes to be discriminated among is modest. Further, when the data being classified is inherently high-dimensional, the storage and computational complexity associated with the application of multiple linear classifiers can ignite critical resource management issues. This work describes a novel multiclass classification method based on efficient use of a single "recycled" linear classifier (or ReLiC), which addresses these storage and implementation complexity issues. The proposed approach amounts to constraining the entire collection of hyperplanes to be circularly-shifted versions of each other, enabling classification procedures that may be implemented with efficient operations, such as circular convolution (which can be efficiently computed using transform domain techniques), and simple sampling/thresholding operations. We show that the optimization task associated with our proposed approach can be formulated as a quadratic program, and we introduce an efficient distributed procedure for its solution based on an alternating direction method of multipliers. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed approach is comparable with the more complex, traditional multiclass linear classification strategies, suggesting the proposed approach is a viable alternative in large-scale data classification tasks.

A weighted combination of (groups of) similarities is learned jointly with the SVM parameters, by optimizing a criterion that is shown to be an equivalent formulation regularized with a mixed norm of the original fitting problem.

Recent studies on this topic have failed to reach a clear consensus as to whether machine learning techniques can outperform rule-based fusion schemes with varying amount of training data. In this paper, we present two parametric approaches to late fusion: a normalization scheme for arithmetic mean fusion (logistic averaging) and a fusion scheme based on logistic regression, and compare them to widely used rule-based fusion schemes. We also describe how logistic regression can be used to calibrate the fused detection scores to predict an optimal threshold given a detection prior and costs on errors. We discuss the advantages and shortcomings of each approach when the amount of positives available for training varies from 10 positives (10Ex) to 100 positives (100Ex). Experiments were run using video data from the NIST TRECVID MED 2013 evaluation and results were reported in terms of a ranking metric: the mean average precision (mAP) and (R) over bar (0), a cost-based metric introduced in TRECVID MED 2013.

The challenges are exacerbated in embedded sensing applications due to constraints on system resources (energy, area). Given the importance of classification functions in such applications, this paper presents an architecture for overcoming faults within a classification processor. The approach employs machine learning for modeling not only complex sensor signals but also error manifestations due to hardware faults. Adaptive boosting is exploited in the architecture for performing iterative data-driven training. This enables the effects of faults in preceding iterations to be modeled and overcome during subsequent iterations. We demonstrate a system integrating the proposed classifier, capable of training its model entirely within the architecture by generating estimated training labels. FPGA experiments show that high fault rates (affecting >3% of all circuit nodes) occurring on >80% of the hardware can be overcome, restoring system performance to fault-free levels.

To this end, we apply a novel data selection technique based on constrained submodular function maximization. Though NP-hard, the combinatorial optimization problem can be approximately solved by a simple and scalable greedy algorithm with constant-factor guarantees. We evaluate our approach by subselecting data from 1300 hours of conversational English telephone data to train two types large-vocabulary speech recognizers, one with Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based acoustic models, and another based on deep neural networks (DNNs). We show that training data can be reduced significantly, and that our technique outperforms both random selection and a previously proposed selection method utilizing comparable resources. Notably, using the submodular selection method, the DNN system using only about 5% of the training data is able to achieve performance on par with the GMM system using 100% of the training data - with the baseline subset selection methods, however, the DNN system is unable to accomplish this correspondence.

The idea is to generate multiple subsets of the training data via bootstrapping (random sampling with replacement), and then aggregate the output of the models trained from each subset via voting or averaging. As music is a temporal signal, we propose and study two bagging methods in this paper: the inter-song instance bagging that bootstraps song-level features, and the intra-song instance bagging that draws bootstrapping samples directly from short-time features for each training song. In particular, we focus on the latter method, as it better exploits the temporal information of music signals. The bagging methods result in surprisingly effective models for music auto-tagging: incorporating the idea to a simple linear support vector machine (SVM) based system yields accuracies that are comparable or even superior to state-of-the-art, possibly more sophisticated methods for three different datasets. As the bagging method is a meta algorithm, it holds the promise of improving other MIR systems.

Big data analytics can enable timely and accurate insights using machine learning and predictive analytics to make better decisions. The objective of this paper is to present big data analytics modeling in the metal cutting industry. This paper includes: 1) identification of manufacturing data to be analyzed, 2) design of a functional architecture for deriving analytic models, and 3) design of an analytic model to predict a sustainability performance especially power consumption, using the big data infrastructure. A prototype system has been developed for this proof-of-concept, using open platform solutions including MapReduce, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and a machine-learning tool.

The potentials of this localized and collective information have been seen to complement the maintenance process of authoritative mapping data sources and in realizing the development of Digital Earth. The main barrier to the use of this data in supporting this bottom up approach is the credibility (trust), completeness, accuracy, and quality of both the data input and outputs generated. The only feasible approach to assess these data is by relying on an automated process. This paper describes a conceptual model of indicators (parameters) and practical approaches to automated assess the credibility of information contributed through the VGI including map mashups, Geo Web and crowd - sourced based applications. There are two main components proposed to be assessed in the conceptual model - metadata and data. The metadata component comprises the indicator of the hosting (websites) and the sources of data / information. The data component comprises the indicators to assess absolute and relative data positioning, attribute, thematic, temporal and geometric correctness and consistency. This paper suggests approaches to assess the components. To assess the metadata component, automated text categorization using supervised machine learning is proposed. To assess the correctness and consistency in the data component, we suggest a matching validation approach using the current emerging technologies from Linked Data infrastructures and using third party reviews validation. This study contributes to the research domain that focuses on the credibility, trust and quality issues of data contributed by web citizen providers.	[Idris, N.

Although GPS data could provide precise spatiotemporal information of vehicular or personal movements, the transportation mode (in the case of personal movements with wearable GPS devices) and trip purpose are unable to be obtained from the GPS directly. In addition, the GPS data error identification and the trip segment from the continuous GPS data are quite fundamental to transportation mode identification and trip purpose inference. In this paper, we summarized the methodologies and input variables utilized to segment trip, infer trip purpose as well as identify transportation mode in the existing researches. Compared to probability method and criteria-based method, Machine Learning are often applied in detecting transportation mode. On the other hand, rules-based methods are more popular than probabilistic method and machine learning as the tool for inferring the trip purpose. Finally, researches attempting to utilize the data from accelerometer which are popularly integrated in smartphones demonstrates the potential of more accurate personal trip data derivation from smartphones can be achieved with much less burden on the respondents in the future.

And this has caught a lot of interests in recent years. Packet sizes and statistical features are effective features that widely used in early stage traffic identification. However, an important issue is still unconcerned, that is whether there exists essential differences between using the packet sizes and derived features such as statistics in early stage traffic identification. In this paper, we set out to evaluate the effectiveness of different kinds of early stage traffic features. We firstly extract the packet sizes and their derived features of the first 10 packets on 3 traffic data sets. Then the mutual information between each feature and the corresponding traffic type label is computed to show the effectiveness of the feature. And then we execute a set of crossover identification experiments with different feature sets using 7 well-known classifiers. Our experimental results show that most classifiers get almost the same performances using packet sizes and derived features for early stage traffic identification. And the combined feature set selected by mutual information can obtain high identification performances.

The primary goal of these techniques is to improve performance by avoiding an exhaustive exploration of the state space. Our framework focuses on probabilistic reachability, which is a core property for verification, and is illustrated through two distinct instantiations. The first assumes that full knowledge of the MDP is available, and performs a heuristic-driven partial exploration of the model, yielding precise lower and upper bounds on the required probability. The second tackles the case where we may only sample the MDP, and yields probabilistic guarantees, again in terms of both the lower and upper bounds, which provides efficient stopping criteria for the approximation. The latter is the first extension of statistical model checking for unbounded properties in MDPs. In contrast with other related techniques, our approach is not restricted to time-bounded (finite-horizon) or discounted properties, nor does it assume any particular properties of the MDP. We also show how our methods extend to LTL objectives. We present experimental results showing the performance of our framework on several examples.

An essential component of molecular docking programs is a scoring function (SF) that can be used to identify the most stable binding pose of a ligand, when bound to a receptor protein, from among a large set of candidate poses. Despite intense efforts in developing conventional SFs, which are either force-field based, knowledge-based, or empirical, their limited docking power (or ability to successfully identify the correct pose) has been a major impediment to cost-effective drug discovery. Therefore, in this work, we explore a range of novel SFs employing different machine-learning (ML) approaches in conjunction with physicochemical and geometrical features characterizing protein-ligand complexes to predict the native or near-native pose of a ligand docked to a receptor protein's binding site. We assess the docking accuracies of these new ML SFs as well as those of conventional SFs in the context of the 2007 PDBbind benchmark datasets on both diverse and homogeneous (protein-family-specific) test sets. We find that the best performing ML SF has a success rate of 80% in identifying poses that are within 1 angstrom root-mean-square deviation from the native poses of 65 different protein families. This is in comparison to a success rate of only 70% achieved by the best conventional SF, ASP, employed in the commercial docking software GOLD. We also observed steady gains in the performance of the proposed ML SFs as the training set size was increased by considering more protein-ligand complexes and/or more computationally-generated poses for each complex.

These methods, while designed according to human preference, can be ill-equipped for handling the variety and subjectivity in human responses. Different tasks have different requirements for interest point detection; some tasks may necessitate high precision while other tasks may require high recall. Sometimes points with high curvature may be desirable, while in other cases high curvature may be an indication of noise. Geometric methods lack the required flexibility to adapt to such changes. As a consequence, interest point detection seems to be well suited for machine learning methods that can be trained to match the criteria applied on the annotated training data. In this paper, we formulate interest point detection as a supervised binary classification problem using a random forest as our classifier. We validate the accuracy of our method and compare our results to those of five state of the art methods on a new, standard benchmark.

The classical formulation assumes that the data live in a pair of vector spaces which makes its use in certain important scientific domains problematic. For instance, the set of symmetric positive definite matrices (SPD), rotations and probability distributions, all belong to certain curved Riemannian manifolds where vector-space operations are in general not applicable. Analyzing the space of such data via the classical versions of inference models is rather sub-optimal. But perhaps more importantly, since the algorithms do not respect the underlying geometry of the data space, it is hard to provide statistical guarantees (if any) on the results. Using the space of SPD matrices as a concrete example, this paper gives a principled generalization of the well known CCA to the Riemannian setting. Our CCA algorithm operates on the product Riemannian manifold representing SPD matrix-valued fields to identify meaningful statistical relationships on the product Riemannian manifold. As a proof of principle, we present results on an Alzheimer's disease (AD) study where the analysis task involves identifying correlations across diffusion tensor images (DTI) and Cauchy deformation tensor fields derived from T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images.

The performance of these methods is often image-dependent. This paper aims to develop a method that is able to select for an input image the best salient object detection result from many results produced by different methods. This is a challenging task as different salient object detection results need to be compared without any ground truth. This paper addresses this challenge by designing a range of features to measure the quality of salient object detection results. These features are then used in various machine learning algorithms to rank different salient object detection results. Our experiments show that our method is promising for ranking salient object detection results and our method is also able to pick the best salient object detection result such that the overall salient object detection performance is better than each individual method.

The evidences needed to recognize events may occur in short time periods with variable lengths and can happen anywhere in a video. This fact prevents conventional machine learning algorithms from effectively recognizing the events. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can automatically identify the key evidences in videos for detecting complex events. Both static instances (objects) and dynamic instances (actions) are considered by sampling frames and temporal segments respectively. To compare the characteristic power of heterogeneous instances, we embed static and dynamic instances into a multiple instance learning framework via instance similarity measures, and cast the problem as an Evidence Selective Ranking (ESR) process. We impose l(1) norm to select key evidences while using the Infinite Push Loss Function to enforce positive videos to have higher detection scores than negative videos. The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. Experiments on large-scale video datasets show that our method can improve the detection accuracy while providing the unique capability in discovering key evidences of each complex event.

Twitter is commonly used to broadcast information and to organize support during times of need. During the 2010 Gulf Oil Spill, Twitter was utilized for spreading information, sharing firsthand observations, and to voice concern about the situation. Through building a series of classifiers to detect emotion and sentiment, the distribution of emotion during the Gulf Oil Spill can be analyzed and its propagation compared against released information and corresponding events. We contribute a series of emotion classifiers and a prototype collaborative visualization of the results and discuss their implications.

First, it works accurately for a wide range of typologically different languages. Second, it can be useful for semantics, since it can be easier to attach compositional rules directly to lexical items than to assign them to large numbers of phrase structure rules. Third, robust machine-learning based parsers are available. In this paper, we investigate two techniques for combining multiple data-driven dependency parsers for parsing Arabic, where we are faced with an exceptional level of lexical and structural ambiguity. Experimental results show that combined parsers can produce more accurate results, even for imperfectly tagged text, than each parser produces by itself for texts with the gold-standard tags.

It occurs when there is a increase in the normal diameter of the blood vessels by more than 50 percent. Approximately 90 percent of abdominal aortic aneurysms occur infrarenally, but they can also occur pararenally or suprarenally. This is because of some catastrophic outcome. Due to this, the blood flow is exaggerated so the blood hemodynamic interaction forces are affected. Therefore this will tends to wall rupture. To identify the AAA, it is important to identify the blood flow interaction and the wall shear stress. The blood and wall interaction is the wall shear stress. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to get the results for the mechanical conditions within the blood vessels with and without Aneurysms. CFD contains vast computations with Navier Stroke Equations so this will be very time consuming. So to make these CFD computations very efficient, Data mining algorithms are to be used. And also DM algorithms will be a best method to predict the shear stress at the AAA. This will estimate the wall shear stress. There is in need of thousands of CFD runs in a single computer for creating machine learning data so grid computing can be used.	[Kumar, A.

The state-of-the-art methods report very high accuracy rates but just a few classes are covered and several training samples are required. For the sake of the development of an asset management system, these approaches are out of reach. Furthermore, in this context, minimizing user's effort is more important than achieving maximal classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a catalogue-based traffic sign classifier which doesn't require real training samples for model building and promotes minimal user's workload involving the catalogue's semantic structure in the error propagation. Experimental results reveal that user's workload was reduced by 20% while accuracy was improved by 2%.	[Fernandes, Kelwin; Silva, Pedro F.

The best strands in a beta sheet can be classified into the outer or inner strands. Considering the protein primary sequences have determinant information to arrange the strands in the beta sheet topology, we introduce an approach by using the random forest algorithm to predict outer or inner arrangement of a beta strand. We use nine features to describe a strand based on the hydrophobicity, the hydrophilicity, the side-chain mass and other properties of the beta strands. The random forest classifiers reach the best prediction accuracy 89.45% with 10-fold cross-validation among five machine learning methods. This result demonstrates that there are significant differences between the outer beta strands and the inner ones in beta sheets. The finding in this study can be used to arrange beta strands in a beta sheet without any prior structure information. It can also help better understanding the mechanisms of protein beta sheet formation.

Characterised by sudden bursts of excess electricity in the brain manifesting as seizures, epilepsy is still not well understood when compared with other neurological disorders. Seizures often happen unexpectedly and attempting to predict them has been a research topic for the last 20 years. Electroencephalograms have been integral to these studies, as they can capture the brain's electrical signals. The challenge is to generalise the detection of seizures in different regions of the brain and across multiple subjects. This paper explores this idea further and presents a supervised machine learning approach that classifies seizure and non-seizure records using an open dataset containing 543 electroencephalogram segments. Our approach posits a new method for generalising seizure detection across different subjects without prior knowledge about the focal point of seizures. Our results show an improvement on existing studies with 88% for sensitivity, 88% for specificity and 93% for the area under the curve, with a 12% global error, using the k-NN classifier.

Current methods for the early detection of such births are inadequate. However, there has been some evidence to suggest that the analysis of uterine electrical signals, collected from the abdominal surface, could provide an independent and easier way to diagnose true labour and detect when preterm delivery is about to occur. Using advanced machine learning algorithms, in conjunction with electrohysterography signal processing, numerous studies have focused on detecting true labour several days prior to the event. In this paper however, the electrohysterography signals have been used to detect preterm births. This has been achieved using an open dataset that contains 262 records for women who delivered at term and 38 who delivered prematurely. Several new features from Electromyography studies have been utilized, as well as feature-ranking techniques to determine their discriminative capabilities in detecting term and preterm records. Seven artificial neural network algorithms are considered with the results showing that the Radial Basis Function Neural Network classifier performs the best, with 85% sensitivity, 80% specificity, 90% area under the curve and a 17% mean error rate.

It can provide important clues for us to study the functions of proteins and targeted drug discovery. Traditional experiment techniques which can determine the protein sub-cellular locations are almost costly and time consuming. In the last two decades, a great many machine learning algorithms and protein sub-cellular location predictors have been developed to deal with this kind of problems. However, most of the algorithms can only solve the single-location proteins. With the progress of techniques, more and more proteins which have two or even more sub-cellular locations are found, it is much more significant to study this kind of proteins for they have extremely useful implication in both basic biological research and drug discovery. If we want to improve the accuracy of prediction, we have to extract much more feature information. In this paper, we use fusion feature extraction methods to extract the feature information simultaneously, and the multi-label k nearest neighbors (ML-KNN) algorithm to predict protein sub-cellular locations, the best overall accuracy rate we got in dataset s1 in constructing Gpos-mploc is 66.1568% and 59.9206% in dataset s2 in constructing Virus-mPLoc.

Although many state-of-art approaches have been introduced, no one method performs the best on all data sources. With the aim of introducing an effective classification model, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based method that combines outputs of base classifiers (called meta-data or Level1 data) resulted from Stacking Algorithm. We further apply Genetic Algorithm (GA) to that data as a feature selection strategy to explore an optimal subset of Level1 data in which our GMM-based approach can achieve high accuracy. Experiments on 21 UCI Machine Learning Repository data files and CLEF2009 medical image database demonstrate the advantage of our framework compared with other well-known combining algorithms such as Decision Template, Multiple Response Linear Regression (MLR), SCANN and fixed combining rules as well as GMM-based approaches on original data.

Premature birth occurs when the baby is born before completion of the 37-week gestation period. The incomplete understanding of the physiology of the uterus and parturition means that premature labour prediction is a difficult task. The reason for this may be that the initial symptoms of preterm labour occur commonly in normal pregnancies. There is some misclassification in regard to recognizing full-term and preterm labour; approximately 20% of women who are identified as reaching full-term labour actually deliver prematurely. This paper explores the applicability of Artificial Immune System (AIS) technique as a new methodology to classify term and preterm records. Our AIS approach shows better results when compared with Neural Network, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machines, achieving more than 92% accuracy overall.

J	Than, K; Ho, TB				Than, Khoat; Tu Bao Ho			Modeling the diversity and log-normality of data	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Topic models; diversity; log-normality; lognormal distribution; LDA; stability; sensitivity	LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS; OPTIMIZATION	We investigate two important properties of real data: diversity and log-normality. Log-normality accounts for the fact that data follow the lognormal distribution, whereas diversity measures variations of the attributes in the data. To our knowledge, these two inherent properties have not been paid much attention from the machine learning community, especially from the topic modeling community. In this article, we fill in this gap in the framework of topic modeling. We first investigate whether or not these two properties can be captured by the most well-known Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (LDA), and find that LDA behaves inconsistently with respect to diversity. Particularly, it favors data of low diversity, but works badly on data of high diversity. Then, we argue that these two inherent properties can be captured well by endowing the topic-word distributions in LDA with the lognormal distribution. This treatment leads to a new model, named Dirichlet-lognormal topic model (DLN). Using the lognormal distribution complicates the learning and inference of DLN, compared with those of LDA. Hence, we used variational method, in which model learning and inference are reduced to solving convex optimization problems. Extensive experiments strongly suggest that (1) the predictive power of DLN is consistent with respect to diversity, and that (2) DLN works consistently better than LDA for datasets whose diversity is large, and for datasets which contain many log-normally distributed attributes. Justifications for these results require insights into the used statistical distributions and will be discussed in the article.

Other issues, such as within-class imbalance and high dimensionality, can exacerbate the problem. We propose a method HPS-DRS that combines two ideas: Hybrid Probabilistic Sampling technique ensemble with Diverse Random Subspace to address these issues. HPS improves the performance of traditional re-sampling algorithms with the aid of probability function, since it is not sufficient to simply manipulate the class sizes for imbalanced data with complex distribution. Moreover, DRS ensemble employs the minimum overlapping mechanism to provide diversity and weighted voting, so as to improve the generalization performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is efficient for learning from imbalanced data and can achieve better results than state-of-the-art methods for imbalanced data.

This disease may cause severe vision loss or even blindness. Specialists analyze fundus images in order to diagnostic it and to give specific treatments. Fundus images are photographs taken of the retina using a retinal camera, this is a noninvasive medical procedure that provides a way to analyze the retina in patients with diabetes. The correct classification of these images depends on the ability and experience of specialists, and also the quality of the images. In this paper we present a method for diabetic retinopathy detection. This method is divided into two stages: in the first one, we have used local binary patterns (LBP) to extract local features, while in the second stage, we have applied artificial neural networks, random forest and support vector machines for the detection task. Preliminary results show that random forest was the best classifier with 97.46% of accuracy, using a data set of 71 images.

This kernelizing approach has been applied, for example, to the famed least mean squares (LMS) [1] algorithm to give rise to the kernel least mean squares (KLMS) algorithm [2]. However, a major drawback of the LMS algorithm (and also of its kernelized version) is the performance degradation in scenarios with outliers. Bearing this in mind, we introduce instead a kernel classifier based on the least mean M-estimate (LMM) algorithm [3] which is a robust variant of the LMS algorithm based on M-estimation techniques. The proposed Kernel LMM (KLMM) algorithm is evaluated in pattern classification tasks with outliers using both synthetic and real-world datasets. The obtained results indicate the superiority of the proposed approach over the standard KLMS algorithm.

The NFIs' performance dataset consists of indicators that define the capital adequacy, assets' quality and profitability performance dimensions. The class performance variable is obtained by applying on the performance dataset the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm and obtaining clusters with similar performance. We attach to each input dataset observation a performance class depending on which cluster contains the observation given the characterization and hierarchy of the clusters in "good", "medium" and "poor" performance clusters. Finally, we apply artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained with genetic algorithms in order to find a function that maps the input performance space on the newly constructed performance class variable. The classification model obtained can be used by different beneficiaries (e. g.: the Supervision Department of National Bank of Romania) to classify new NFIs as having a "good" or "poor" performance so that the limited resources of the supervision authority to be better allocated.

J	Lawrynowicz, A; Potoniec, J				Lawrynowicz, Agnieszka; Potoniec, Jedrzej			Pattern Based Feature Construction in Semantic Data Mining	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON SEMANTIC WEB AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Intelligent System; Meta-Learning; Ontology; Pattern Discovery; Semantic Data Mining; SPARQL	OPTIMAL RULE DISCOVERY; DESCRIPTION LOGICS; ASSOCIATION RULES; SPARQL; DL; REDUNDANCY; INDUCTION; SYSTEMS; SUPPORT; WEB	The authors propose a new method for mining sets of patterns for classification, where patterns are represented as SPARQL queries over RDFS. The method contributes to so-called semantic data mining, a data mining approach where domain ontologies are used as background knowledge, and where the new challenge is to mine knowledge encoded in domain ontologies, rather than only purely empirical data. The authors have developed a tool that implements this approach. Using this the authors have conducted an experimental evaluation including comparison of our method to state-of-the-art approaches to classification of semantic data and an experimental study within emerging subfield of meta-learning called semantic meta-mining. The most important research contributions of the paper to the state-of-art are as follows. For pattern mining research or relational learning in general, the paper contributes a new algorithm for discovery of new type of patterns. For Semantic Web research, it theoretically and empirically illustrates how semantic, structured data can be used in traditional machine learning methods through a pattern-based approach for constructing semantic features.

In supervised classification, several approaches were proposed such as: Induction of Decision Tree and Formal Concept Analysis. The learning of formal concepts is generally based on the mathematical structure of Galois lattice (or concept lattice). The complexity of Galois lattice generation limits the application fields of these systems. In this paper, we discuss about supervised classification based on Formal Concept Analysis and we present methods based on concept lattice or sub lattice. We propose a new approach that builds only a part of the lattice, including the best concepts (i.e pertinent concepts). These concepts are used as classifiers in parallel combination using voting rule. The proposed method is based on Dagging of Nominal Classifier. Experimental results are given to prove the interest of the proposed method. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we proposed a variety of rule-based greedy algorithms that able to obtain knowledge contained in a given dataset as a series of inhibitory rules containing an expression "attribute not equal value" on the right-hand side. The main goal of this paper is to determine based on rule characteristics, rule length and coverage, whether the proposed rule heuristics are statistically significantly different or not; if so, we aim to identify the best performing rule heuristics for minimization of rule length and maximization of rule coverage. Friedman test with Nemenyi post-hoc are used to compare the greedy algorithms statistically against each other for length and coverage. The experiments are carried out on real datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository. For leading heuristics, the constructed rules are compared with optimal ones obtained based on dynamic programming approach. The results seem to be promising for the best heuristics: the average relative difference between length (coverage) of constructed and optimal rules is at most 2.27% (7%, respectively). Furthermore, the quality of classifiers based on sets of inhibitory rules constructed by the considered heuristics are compared against each other, and the results show that the three best heuristics from the point of view classification accuracy coincides with the three well-performed heuristics from the point of view of rule length minimization.

In order to ensure diversity of sub models, selection of a feature subsets was considered. In the experiments the Condensed Nearest Neighbor (CNN) and Edited Nearest Neighbor (ENN) algorithms were evaluated as basic instance selection methods. The results show that it is possible to obtain various trade-offs between data compression and classification accuracy depending on the acceptance threshold and feature ratio parameters. In some cases it was possible to achieve both: higher compression and higher accuracy than those of an individual instance selection algorithm. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

For these backgrounds, we observed the transaction data with the bad debt customer information gathered from a mail order company and characterized the customer with machine learning. From the results of the analysis, we are succeeded in characterizing the potential customers. Intensive research revealed that the characteristics of customers who make fraud transactions.

Some of application programs in the computer are habitually used or launched in a particular time. Even though their invocations can be predicted in advance, they are executed manually in each time, hence, this results in a deterioration of the usability in computer operation. In this paper, a considerable application prediction system with Artificial Neural Network, which recommends a useful application for the user at the time, will be proposed. It refers to an application ontology and uses an application log obtained from the user's personal computer. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed system will be discussed showing the prediction accuracy of about 90% in recommending useful applications when the user utilizes the computer in daily life.

Machine learning has a potential to address the problem of manual maintenance but can also require changes in how companies works with defect prediction. In this paper we address the problem of identifying what the benefits of machine learning are compared to existing methods and which barriers exist for adopting them in practice. Our methods consist of literature studies and a case study at two companies - Ericsson and Volvo Car Group. By studying literature we develop a framework for adopting machine learning and using case studies we evaluate this framework through a series of four interviews with experts working with predictions at both companies - line manager, quality manager and measurement team leader. The findings of our research show that the most important perceived benefits of adopting machine learning algorithms for defect prediction are accuracy of predictions and ability to generate new insights from data. The two most important perceived barriers in this context are inability to recognize new patterns and low generalizability of the machine learning algorithms. We conclude that in order to support companies in making an informed decision to adopt machine learning techniques for software defect predictions we need to go beyond accuracy and also evaluate factors such as costs, generalizability and competence.

Text mining of articles can solve the problem of DDI databases actuality, thus reducing time of detecting new articles related to drug-rug interaction. There are databases containing large amount of biomedical articles, therefore computational performance of classification method used for identification of documents with DDIs become a valuable factor. In this article, we propose a fast text mining approach to DDI articles classification using term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) statistic. As a result our approach was able to achieve F1 score value 0.69 (precision = 0.89, recall = 0.57) in DDI articles classification while still keeping short run-time.

On these systems it is common for programs to compete with co-running programs for resources. While multi-task scheduling for CPUs is a well-studied area, how to partitioning and map computing tasks onto the heterogeneous system in the presence of GPU contention (i.e. multiple programs compete for the GPU) remains an outstanding problem. In this paper we consider the problem of partitioning OpenCL kernels on a CPU-GPU based system in the presence of contention on the GPU. We propose a machine learning-based approach that predicts the optimal partitioning of OpenCL kernels, explicitly taking GPU contention into account. Our predictive model achieves a speed-up of 1.92 over a scheme that always uses the GPU. When compared to two state-of-the-art dynamic approaches our model achieves speed-ups of 1.54 and 2.56 respectively.	[Grewe, Dominik; Wang, Zheng; O'Boyle, Michael F.

However, non selective factors can cause similar effects on tests results. In order to make the influence of particular non selective forces weaker, a battery of such tests can be applied and the combination of results could be considered as inputs to a properly trained classifier. Success of such approach depends on two issues: appropriate expert knowledge to be used during training of the classifier and the choice of the most suitable machine learning method, which generalizes the acquired knowledge to unknown cases.

A significant number of computational methods have been developed to predict protein-protein interactions using proteins' sequence, structural and genomic data. Hence, this fact motivated us to perform a comparative study of various machine learning methods, training them on the set of known protein-protein interactions, using proteins' global and local attributes. The results of the classifiers were evaluated through cross-validation and several performance measures were computed. It was noticed from the results that support vector machine outperformed other classifiers. This fact has also been established through statistical test, called Wilcoxon rank sum test, at 5% significance level.

Relevance Prevails: Missing Data Treatment in Intelligent Lighting	MAN-MACHINE INTERACTIONS 3	Advances in Intelligent and Soft Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Man-Machine Interactions (ICMMI)	OCT 22-25, 2013	Brenna, POLAND			intelligent lighting; missing data; machine learning; classification models; relevance metric		Generally, in machine learning applications, the problem of missing data has significant effect on the prediction performance. For a given missing data problem, it is not straightforward to select a treatment approach in combination with a classification model due to several factors such as the pattern of data and nature of missing data. The selection becomes more difficult for applications such as intelligent lighting, where there is high degree of randomness in the pattern of data. In this paper, we study pairs of probabilistic missing data treatment methods and classification models to identify the best pair for a dataset gathered from an office environment for intelligent lighting. We evaluate the performance in simulations using a new metric called Relevance Score. Experimental results show that the CPOF (Conditional Probability based only on the Outcome and other Features) method in combination with the DecisionTable (DT) classifier is the most suitable pair for implementation.

In the phoneme classification task of speech recognition, small excerpts of speech need to be identified as one of the pre-defined phonemes; but the probability value assigned to each possible phoneme also hold valuable information. This is why, when combining classifier output in this task, we must use a combination scheme which can aggregate the output probability values of the basic classifiers in a robust way. We tested the representative uninorms for this task, and were able to significantly outperform all the basic classifiers tested.

For several software engineering problems, a fitness function is ill-defined, subjective, or difficult to quantify. For example, the evaluation of a software design is subjective. This paper introduces the use of a neural network-based fitness function for the problem of software refactoring. The software engineers evaluate manually the suggested refactoring solutions by a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for few iterations then an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) uses these training examples to evaluate the refactoring solutions for the remaining iterations. We evaluate the efficiency of our approach using six different open-source systems through an empirical study and compare the performance of our technique with several existing refactoring studies.

Both between and within organizations, sensitive and personal information often transits through the electronic mail systems undetected. Information leakage through this mode of communication has become a daunting problem in today's world. Often the mail volume within an organization is quite large making manual monitoring impossible. In this paper an integration of secure information flow techniques on intranet electronic mail systems is investigated. Categorization of emails based on the sensitivity is accomplished effectively using machine learning techniques. Analyzing the information flow and simultaneously mapping, categorizing and sorting emails in real time prior to receipt of emails has been characterized in this study. Defining security policies and application of lattice models for controlled exchange of emails is discussed. The paper proposed a secure architecture for an email web application. Experimental analysis on the accuracy of the application was determined using Enron email dataset.

However unlike classical desktop applications, Android apps available on the "Google Play" [1] have a feature in "category" of app. In this initial work, we propose and investigate the possibility of improving the efficiency of machine learning approach for android apps by exploiting the category information.

There are certain threats that will never evade away despite sophisticated advancements in defense strategy. Among them, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have witnessed continual growth in scale, frequency and intensity. The impact of DDoS attacks can be devastating such that it creates severe ripples to the cyberworld. Nowadays, attackers are advancing towards different variants of DDoS attacks to escape from the detection mechanisms. In this paper, a new DDoS Detection system is proposed. Initially, wavelet based features are extracted and classified using semi-supervised learning to detect the DDoS attacks. Different wavelet families are studied and the combination of them seems to be robust and efficient and hence used as features. Machine learning algorithms are highly appreciated in many classification problems. There is a considerable demand for labeled dataset and hence to bridge the gap between them and unlabeled dataset, semi-supervised learning algorithm is employed to classify the attack from normal traffic. Extensive analysis is performed by conducting experiments and by using real-time dataset. Results obtained are convincing and hence can be modeled for real-time approach.

They provide a more accessible way to bring people of the same concerns or interests. This paper aims to study the characteristics of online autism communities (called Clinical) in comparison with other online communities (called Control) using data from 110 Live Journal weblog communities. Using machine learning techniques, we comprehensively analyze these online autism communities. We study three key aspects expressed in the blog posts made by members of the communities: sentiment, topics and language style. Sentiment analysis shows that the sentiment of the clinical group has lower valence, indicative of poorer moods than people in control. Topics and language styles are shown to be good predictors of autism posts. The result shows the potential of social media in medical studies for a broad range of purposes such as screening, monitoring and subsequently providing supports for online communities of individuals with special needs.

The process is costly, inconvenient, and slow. Recently online search data has emerged as potential proxies for the survey data. However considerable human involvement is still needed for the selection of search indices, a task that requires knowledge of both the target issue and how search terms are used by the online community. The robustness of such manually selected search indices can be questionable. In this paper, we propose an automatic polling system through a novel application of machine learning. In this system, the needs for examining, comparing, and selecting search indices have been eliminated through automatic generation of candidate search indices and intelligent combination of the indices. The results include a publicly accessible web application that provides real-time, robust, and accurate measurements of public opinions on several subjects of general interest.

Several studies have shown that for the isolated and mentally ill, the Web and social media provide effective platforms for supports and treatments as well as to acquire scientific, clinical understanding of this mental condition. More and more individuals affected by depression join online communities to seek for information, express themselves, share their concerns and look for supports [12]. For the first time, we collect and study a large online depression community of more than 12,000 active members from Live Journal. We examine the effect of mood, social connectivity and age on the online messages authored by members in an online depression community. The posts are considered in two aspects: what is written (topic) and how it is written (language style). We use statistical and machine learning methods to discriminate the posts made by bloggers in low versus high valence mood, in different age categories and in different degrees of social connectivity. Using statistical tests, language styles are found to be significantly different between low and high valence cohorts, whilst topics are significantly different between people whose different degrees of social connectivity. High performance is achieved for low versus high valence post classification using writing style as features. The finding suggests the potential of using social media in depression screening, especially in online setting.

On the other hand, corpus-based approaches focus on the associative relations of words by taking their distributional features into account. Based on the assumption that different aspects of knowledge sources cover different kinds of semantic relations, this paper presents a hybrid model for computing semantic relatedness of words using new features extracted from various aspects of Wikipedia. The focus of this paper is on finding the optimal feature combination(s) that enhance the performance of the hybrid model. The empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets has shown that hybrid features perform better than single features by providing a complementary coverage of semantic relations, leading to improved correlation with human judgments.

However, existing approaches have an excessive computational cost that complicates its practical application. In this paper, a fast automatic 2D-to-3D conversion technique is proposed, which uses a machine learning framework to infer the 3D structure of a query color image from a training database with color and depth images Assuming that photometrically similar images have analogous 3D structures, a depth map is estimated by searching the most similar color images in the database, and fusing the corresponding depth maps. Large databases are desirable to achieve better results, but the computational cost also increases. A clustering-based hierarchical search using compact SURF descriptors to characterize images is proposed to drastically reduce search times. A significant computational time improvement has been obtained regarding other state-of-the-art approaches, maintaining the quality results.

There has, consequently, been considerable interest in the engineering of bacterial populations. Here we describe an approach for the engineering of aspects of bacterial quorum communication, using Standard Virtual Parts, a synthetic biology programming language, dubbed SVPWrite, and an evolutionary algorithm. We apply this system to engineering the output characteristics of the subtilin receiver system of Bacillus subtilis. Simple modifications, such as altering the strength of the output response to a subtilin input, are easily achieved. More complex adaptations, such as modifying the shape of the receiver response curve, necessitate alterations to the topology of the regulatory network. More generally, the use of Standard Virtual Parts and a programming language allow circuit design, simulation and evaluation to easily be automated, permitting exploration of a far larger proportion of design space than would be possible using standard manual design approaches.

High temperature negatively affects different stages of plant development in rice, mainly booting and flowering. Identifying candidate genes associated with high-temperature stress response may provide knowledge for the improvement of heat tolerance in rice. As the rice genome sequencing has already been undertaken, a major work challenge is annotating proteins and decoding their functionalities. MAP kinase (MAPK) proteins are involved in signaling various abiotic and biotic stresses, like temperature stress or drought, wounding and pathogen infection. Moreover, MAPKs have also been implicated in cell cycle and developmental processes. In this study, an attempt has been made in developing a MAP kinase prediction tool for rice, MapPred. The computational approach has been developed using Sequential Minimum Optimization (SMO) algorithm in Weka workbench, and a sensitivity of 100% was obtained using dipeptide method. MapPred was also tested with three plants, namely Arabidopsis, maize and tomato to prove that developed tool has higher accuracy with rice than other plants which further proves the higher prediction accuracy of species-specific tools. Prediction performance of MapPred was evaluated using cross validation, independent data test and leave one out validation. Our experimental results demonstrated that proposed algorithm based on dipeptide method could be very effective in the computational approach for predicting MAPK proteins in Oryza sativasubsp.indica.

A typical annotation is the association between a gene and a feature term that describes a functional feature of the gene by using a controlled vocabulary term (e.g. a Gene Ontology (GO) feature term). Unfortunately, available annotations contain errors and biologically validated ones are incomplete by definition, since new knowledge is continuously discovered. Thus, computational algorithms which are able to provide ranked lists of predicted new gene annotations are an excellent contribution to the bioinformatics research. Here, we propose two variants of the known Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm applied to the prediction of gene annotations. LDA is a very efficient machine learning method built on a set of multinomial probability distributions over a set of topics, given a document (a gene, in our case), and on a set of multinomial probability distributions over a set of words (feature terms, in our case), given a topic. In topic modeling, a topic can be considered as a latent meta-category of words, and a document as a mixture of topics. Our two LDA variants use the collapsed Gibbs Sampling method during the training phase, with two distinct initialization approaches to adapt the LDA mathematical model to the biomolecular annotation scenario. Using six outdated datasets of GO annotations of human and brown rat genes, we compared the annotations predicted by our methods to the ones given by the truncated Singular Value Decomposition (tSVD) method previously developed; then, we validated them by using the annotations available in an updated version of the same datasets. Obtained results show the efficiency of our new proposed algorithms.

Approaches to protein structure/fold classification typically extract amino acid sequence features, and machine-learning approaches are applied to classification problem. Protein contact maps are two-dimensional representations of contacts among the amino acid residues in the folded protein structure. Many researchers make note of the way secondary structures are clearly visible in the contact maps where alpha-helices are seen as thick bands and the beta-sheets as orthogonal to the diagonal. Some patterns in off-diagonal contact maps correspond to configurations of protein secondary structures. This paper explores the idea of extracting rules from contact maps to represent fold information. Contact maps for proteins of any length are generated. An efficient way to extract Secondary Structure Elements from contact maps is adopted. This method achieves appreciable performance, when compared to the original Secondary Structure Elements. Frequent substructures are extracted using a graph based pattern learning system, SUBDUE, to six folds in All-Alpha structural class. Extracted substructures are mapped to three-dimensional structure that proves the performance of the work. To extract additional features from off-diagonal contact map, Triangle Sub Division Method is implemented and feature set is enhanced to 20 regions of interest. An accuracy of 70% is achieved by the J48 decision tree classifier. The decision tree classifier results, gain understanding of rules generated for each structural class. The differences in regions of interest are distinguished for All-Alpha structural class. This method needs to be validated on other SCOP classes.	[Vani, Suvarna K.; Swaroopa, M. Om; Sravani, T.

Discriminating OMPs from different fold types of proteins is helpful for successful prediction of their structures and for exact designs of OMP-targeted drugs. In this paper, we developed a novel prediction method based on primary sequence features and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. For protein sequences, discriminative features were extracted by the combination of sequence encoding based on grouped weights (EBGW), amino acid compositions and biochemical properties. Feature subsets were screened using F-score algorithm for training a SVM-based classifier, namely EBGW_OMP. The performance of EBGW_OMP was examined on a benchmark dataset of 1087 proteins. The results show that EBGW_OMP can discriminate OMPs from globular proteins, alpha-helical membrane proteins or non-OMPs with cross-validated accuracy of 98.0%, 97.6% or 97.9%, respectively, which outperformed existing sequence-based methods. EBGW_OMP also successfully distinguished 681 out of 722 OMPs with 97.0% accuracy in another benchmark dataset of 2657 proteins. Genome-wide tests show that EBGW_OMP has excellent capability of correctly detecting OMPs and is considerable for genomic OMPs prediction.

However, most of the proposed PUFs have been shown to be vulnerable to modeling attacks, especially against Machine Learning algorithms. A subset of challenge-response pairs can leak the required information to break a PUF due to the presence of a linear separating boundary between the PUF responses. In this paper, we propose a strong and secure PUF based on non-linear current mirrors. The fundamental idea is to propagate a current through two identical chains of non-linear current mirrors. The current through a single stage is shifted by some amount based on the strength of the input current. As the current shift is not a fixed value anymore, strong non-linearity is introduced into the challenge-response relationship. The proposed PUF shows excellent properties upon statistical circuit simulation. The average inter-distance and intra-distance of the proposed PUF are 49.9% and 0.8% respectively. One of the most striking features of the proposed PUF is the low information leakage measured in terms of its modeling attack resistance. By employing Support Vector Machine (SVM) based attacks, we observed that the proposed PUF is almost 10-30x stronger than the delay-based PUFs. Moreover, the current mode nature of the PUF circuit enables low power operation. The proposed PUF consumes about 15% lower energy than an arbiter PUF to produce a single response bit.

Previous approaches evaluate security by measuring how much an invasive attack changes the derived key (Pappu et al. 2002, Science). If some attack insufficiently changes the derived key, an expert must redesign the hardware. An unexplored alternative uses software to enhance token response to known physical attacks. Our approach draws on machine learning. We propose a variant of linear discriminant analysis (LDA), called PUF LDA, which reduces noise levels in PUF instances while enhancing changes from known attacks. We compare PUF LDA with standard techniques using an optical coating PUF and the following feature types: raw pixels, fast Fourier transform, short-time Fourier transform, and wavelets. We measure the true positive rate for valid detection at a 0% false positive rate (no mistakes on samples taken after an attack). PUF LDA improves the true positive rate from 50% on average (with a large variance across PUFs) to near 100%. While a well-designed physical process is irreplaceable, PUF LDA enables system designers to improve the PUF reliability-security tradeoff by incorporating attacks without redesigning the hardware token.

Popular realizations use linear additive functions as building blocks. Security is scaled up using non-linear mixing (e. g., adding XORs). Because the responses are physically derived and thus noisy, the resulting explosion in noise impacts both the adversary (which is desirable) as well as the verifier (which is undesirable). We present the first architecture for linear additive physical functions where the noise seen by the adversary and the noise seen by the verifier are bifurcated by using a randomized decimation technique and a novel response recovery method at an authentication verification server. We allow the adversary's noise 1]a -> 0.50 while keeping the verifier's noise eta(v) constant, using a parameter-based authentication modality that does not require explicit challenge/response pair storage at the server. We present supporting data using 28nm FPGA PUF noise results as well as machine learning attack results. We demonstrate that our architecture can also withstand recent side-channel attacks that filter the noise (to clean up training challenge/response labels) prior to machine learning.

Although such multivariate methods can capture complex relationships in the data, traditional approaches provide irregular (l(2) penalty) or scattered (l(1) penalty) predictive pattern with a very limited relevance. A penalty like Total Variation (TV) that exploits the natural 3D structure of the images can increase the spatial coherence of the weight map. However, TV penalization leads to non-smooth optimization problems that are hard to minimize. We propose an optimization framework that minimizes any combination of l(1), l(2), and TV penalties while preserving the exact l(1) penalty. This algorithm uses Nesterov's smoothing technique to approximate the TV penalty with a smooth function such that the loss and the penalties are minimized with an exact accelerated proximal gradient algorithm. We propose an original continuation algorithm that uses successively smaller values of the smoothing parameter to reach a prescribed precision while achieving the best possible convergence rate. This algorithm can be used with other losses or penalties. The algorithm is applied on a classification problem on the ADNI dataset. We observe that the TV penalty does not necessarily improve the prediction but provides a major breakthrough in terms of support recovery of the predictive brain regions.

Analysis of such non-stationarities is of particular interest in neuroimaging, in which it leads to investigation of the dynamics of connectivity. A fundamental approach for such analysis is to estimate connectivities separately in short time windows, and use existing machine learning methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), to summarize or visualize the changes in connectivity. Here, we use the PCA approach by Leonardi et al as the starting point and present two new methods. Our goal is to simplify interpretation of the results by finding components in the original data space instead of the connectivity space. First, we show how to further analyse the principal components of connectivity matrices by a tailor-made two-rank matrix approximation, in which the eigenvectors of the conventional low-rank approximation are transformed. Second, we show how to incorporate the two-rank constraint in the estimation of PCA itself to improve the results. We further provide an interpretation of the method in terms of estimation of a probabilistic generative model related to blind source separation methods and ICA.

In order to make inference at the group level, a straightforward but sometimes unsuccessful approach is to train a classifier on the trials of a group of subjects and then to test it on unseen trials from new subjects. The extreme difficulty is related to the structural and functional variability across the subjects. We call this approach decoding across subjects. In this work, we address the problem of decoding across subjects for magnetoencephalographic (MEG) experiments and we provide the following contributions: first, we formally describe the problem and show that it belongs to a machine learning sub-field called transductive transfer learning (TTL). Second, we propose to use a simple TTL technique that accounts for the differences between train data and test data. Third, we propose the use of ensemble learning, and specifically of stacked generalization, to address the variability across subjects within train data, with the aim of producing more stable classifiers. On a face vs. scramble task MEG dataset of 16 subjects, we compare the standard approach of not modelling the differences across subjects, to the proposed one of combining TTL and ensemble learning. We show that the proposed approach is consistently more accurate than the standard one.

These pattern recognition based methods present clear benefits over classical (univariate) techniques, by providing predictions for unseen data, as well as the weights of each feature in the model. Machine learning methods have been applied to a range of data, from MRI to EEG. However, these multivariate techniques have scarcely been applied to electrocorticography (ECoG) data to investigate cognitive neuroscience questions. In this work, we used previously published ECoG data from 8 subjects to show that machine learning techniques can complement univariate techniques and be more sensitive to certain effects.

A few recent studies have shown the possibility of decoding brain states based on brain graph classification. Graph kernels have emerged as a powerful tool for graph comparison that allows the direct use of machine learning classifiers on brain graph collections. They allow classifying graphs with different number of nodes and therefore the inter-subject analysis without any kind of previous alignment of individual subject's data. Using whole-brain fMRI data, in this paper we present a method based on graph kernels that provides above-chance accuracy results for the inter-subject discrimination of two different types of auditory stimuli. We focus our research on determining whether this method is sensitive to the relational information in the data. Indeed, we show that the discriminative information is not only coming from topological features of the graphs like node degree distribution, but also from more complex relational patterns in the neighborhood of each node. Moreover, we investigate the suitability of two different graph representation methods, both based on data-driven parcellation techniques. Finally, we study the influence of noisy connections in our graphs and provide a way to alleviate this problem.

Despite their possible advantages, SVM use in space applications is still very limited for several reasons including low technology maturity and high computational demand. This paper proposes overcoming the computational demand hurdle through a hardware friendly implementation of SVM for satellite onboard applications using FPGAs. The evaluation of the proposed system shows excellent classification accuracy, low device utilization and acceptable speed for satellite onboard applications. The results shown in this paper opens the door for further exploration of various possible onboard applications including on-board image analysis, compression and autonomy.

The raw mRNA and miRNA expression features become enriched or replaced by new aggregated features that model the mRNA-miRNA interaction. The proposed subtractive integration method is directly motivated by the inhibition/degradation models of gene expression regulation. The method aggregates mRNA and miRNA expressions by subtracting a proportion of miRNA expression values from their respective target mRNAs. The method is used to model the outcome or development of myelodysplastic syndrome, a blood cell production disease often progressing to leukemia. The reached results demonstrate that the integration improves classification performance when dealing with mRNA and miRNA profiles of comparable predictive power.

While large volumes of labeled data are currently available for some of these problems, little or no labeled data exists for others. Manually labeling data can be costly and time consuming. An alternative is to learn classifiers in a domain adaptation setting in which existing labeled data can be lever-aged from a related problem, referred to as source domain, in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data and large amount of unlabeled data for the problem of interest, or target domain. In this paper, we propose two similar domain adaptation classifiers based on a naive Bayes algorithm. We evaluate these classifiers on the difficult task of splice site prediction, essential for gene prediction. Results show that the algorithms correctly classified instances, with highest average area under precision-recall curve (auPRC) values between 18.46% and 78.01%.

The HLA II - peptide complexes are generated in the antigen presenting cells (APC) and transported to the cell membrane to elicit an immune response via T-cell activation. The understanding of HLA class II protein-peptide binding interaction facilitates the design of peptide-based vaccine, where the high rate of polymorphisms in HLA class II molecules poses a big challenge. To determine the binding activity of 636 non-redundant peptides, a set of 27 HLA class II proteins are considered in the present study. The prediction of HLA class II - peptide binding is carried out by an ensemble classifier called RotaSVM. In RotaSVM, the feature selection scheme generates bootstrap samples that are further used to create a diverse set of features using Principal Component Analysis. Thereafter, Support Vector Machines are trained with these bootstrap samples with the integration of their original feature values. The effectiveness of the RotaSVM for HLA class II protein-peptide binding prediction is demonstrated in comparison with other traditional classifiers by evaluating several validity measures with the visual plot of ROC curves. Finally, Friedman test is conducted to judge the statistical significance of RotaSVM in prediction of peptides binding to HLA class II proteins.

The annotation of biological sequence data can be approached using machine learning techniques. Such techniques require that the input data is represented as a vector of features. In the absence of biologically known features, a common approach is to generate k-mers using a sliding window. A larger k value usually results in better features; however, the number of k-mer features is exponential in k, and many of the k-mers are not informative. Feature selection techniques can be used to identify the most informative features, but are computationally expensive when used over the set of all k-mers, especially over the space of variable length k-mers (which presumably capture better the information in the data). Instead of working with all k-mers, we propose to generate features using an approach based on Burrows Wheeler Transformation (BWT). Our approach generates variable length k-mers that represent a small subset of k-mers. Experimental results on both DNA (alternative splicing prediction) and protein (protein localization) sequences show that the BWT features combined with feature selection, result in models which are better than models learned directly from k-mers. This shows that the BWT-based approach to feature generation can be used to obtain informative variable length features for DNA and protein prediction problems.

In addition, we suggest a novel approach which involves variations of ACO, namely, refined ACO, logical ACO, and variant ACO. Variant ACO shows better reduction in false positives. In addition we propose black circular neighborhood approach to detect nodule centers from the edge detected image. Genetic algorithm based clustering is performed to cluster the nodules based on intensity, shape, and size.

J	Rienow, A; Goetzke, R				Rienow, Andreas; Goetzke, Roland			Supporting SLEUTH - Enhancing a cellular automaton with support vector machines for urban growth modeling	COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS			English	Article						Urban growth model; Cellular automata; SLEUTH; Support vector machines; SVM; Logistic regression; Probability map	LAND-COVER CHANGE; VALIDATION; DYNAMICS; PATTERN; URBANIZATION; ACCURACY; ERROR; MAPS	In recent years, urbanization has been one of the most striking change processes in the socioecological system of Central Europe. Cellular automata (CA) are a popular and robust approach for the spatially explicit simulation of land-use and land-cover changes. The CA SLEUTH simulates urban growth using four simple but effective growth rules. Although the performance of SLEUTH is very high, the modeling process still is strongly influenced by stochastic decisions resulting in a variable pattern. Besides, it gives no information about the human and ecological forces driving the local suitability of urban growth. Hence, the objective of this research is to combine the simulation skills of CA with the machine learning approach called support vector machines (SVM). SVM has the basic idea to project input vectors on a higher-dimensional feature space, in which an optimal hyperplane can be constructed for separating the data into two or more classes. By using a forward feature selection, important features can be identified and separated from unimportant ones. The anchor point of coupling both methods is the exclusion layer of SLEUTH. It will be replaced by a SVM-based probability map of urban growth. As a kind of litmus test, we compare the approach with the combination of CA and binomial logistic regression (BLR), a frequently used technique in urban growth studies. The integrated models are applied to an area in the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia involving a highly urbanized region along the Rhine valley (Cologne, Dusseldorf) and a rural, hilly region (Bergisches Land) with a dispersed settlement pattern. Various geophysical and socio-economic driving forces are included, and comparatively evaluated. The validation shows that the quantity and the allocation performance of SLEUTH are augmented clearly when coupling SLEUTH with a BLR- or SVM-based probability map. The combination enables the dynamical simulation of different growth types on the one hand as well as the analyses of various geophysical and socio-economic driving forces on the other hand. The SVM approach needs less variables than the BLR model and SVM-based probabilities exhibit a higher certainty compared to those derived by BLR. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It motivates the development of GGIG (Gams Graphical Interface Generator) by reviewing existing approaches. In opposite to frameworks available for environmental and Agent Based Modelling, GUI generators for more classical economic models seem to be scarce. GGIG aims at a fast development process not requiring programming skills where simple user operable controls are defined in an XML file such that GAMS based projects can add easily a GUI. It comprises quite versatile exploitation tools for interactive reporting (tables, graphs and maps) including a machine learning package plus useful utilities, e.g. to generate a HTML based GAMS code documentation or batch execution. In opposite to other approaches, GGIG strictly separates the GUI and GAMS code, but does not offer IDE functionality. Applications to CAPRI, a rather complex model, and some smaller projects seem to show that researchers without formal programming training are able to develop and modify a GUI for their models, while model users can be quickly trained in GGIG based GUIs.

This dynamic behavior is either caused by external factors or initiated by the system designers themselves. To adapt to such conditions, sensor networks often adopt machine learning techniques to eliminate the need for unnecessary redesign. Machine learning also inspires many practical solutions that maximize resource utilization and prolong the lifespan of the network. In this paper, we present an extensive literature review over the period 2002-2013 of machine learning methods that were used to address common issues in WSNs. The advantages and disadvantages of each proposed algorithm are evaluated against the corresponding problem.

In this paper, we suggest to combine Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with Random Forest. The intention of using DTW is to pre-process the data to eliminate outliers and to align the time series. Many applications require more than one inertial sensor for an accurate prediction of actions. In this paper, nine inertial sensors are deployed to ensure an accurate recognition of actions. Further, sensor fusion approaches are introduced and the most promising strategy is shown. The proposed framework is evaluated on a self-recorded dataset consisting of six human actions. Each action was performed three times by 20 subjects. The dataset is publicly available for download.

This paper describes a program that can assist in tactical coaching for table tennis by extracting and analyzing video data of a table tennis game. The here described application automatically extracts essential information from a table tennis match, such as speed, length, height and others, by analyzing a video of that game. It then uses the well known machine learning library "Weka" to learn about the success of a shot. Generalization is tested by using a training and a test set. The program then is able to predict the outcome of shots with high accuracy. This makes it possible to develop and verify tactical suggestions for players as part of an automatic analyzing and coaching tool, completely independent of human interaction.

Here, we evaluated the suitability of airborne lidar data in comparison with aerial photographs and field surveys for modelling the distribution of an endangered and cryptic forest species, the hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia). The study was conducted in the Bavarian Forest National Park of southeast Germany. Subsequently, a prediction map for conservation planning was generated for a large area, which encompassed the National Park. We examined the utility of lidar data for generating a hazel grouse distribution model by using machine learning (boosted regression trees), and then compared the results to variables derived from field surveys and aerial photographs, both separately and in combination. The cross-validated discrimination ability of the model was slightly higher when using lidar data (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), 0.79) compared to models using aerial photographs (AUC, 0.75) or field survey data (AUC, 0.78). The predictive performance consistently increased when combining the predictors from different sources, with an AUC of 0.86 being produced in the model combining all three data sources. The three data sources complemented one another, with each data source probably having an advantage at deriving one of three key aspects of the hazel grouse habitat, namely, vertically well-structured forest stands, horizontally mixed successional vegetation stages, and certain deciduous trees as food resources such as mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia). In addition, the diverse lidar metrics might be applied to simultaneously characterize vertically and horizontally well-structured forest stands. We conclude that public available airborne lidar data are a viable source for creating habitat suitability maps for large areas and may have increased utility for detecting forest characteristics and valuable wildlife habitats.

The key feature of the BDD is an ability to employ internal structure (not necessary known upfront) of an object being modelled in order to provide a compact in-memory representation. In this paper we propose application of the BDD for machine learning as a tool for fast general pattern recognition. Multiple BDDs are used to capture a sets of training samples (patterns) and to estimate the similarity of a given test sample with the memorized training sets. Then, having multiple similarity estimates further analysis is done using additional layer of BDDs or common machine learning techniques. We describe training algorithms for BDDs (supervised, unsupervised and combined), an approach for constructing multi-layered networks combining BDDs with traditional artificial neurons and present experimental results for handwritten digits recognition on the MNIST dataset.

Good numerical results have been reported; however, there remain some concerns regarding prediction ability when dealing with large data bases. This paper introduces clustering, which decreases the number of variables in the linear programming models that need be solved at each iteration. Preliminary results provide better prediction accuracy, while keeping the good characteristics of the previous classification scheme: a piecewise (non) linear surface that discriminates individuals from two classes with an a priori classification accuracy is built and at each iteration, a new piece of the surface is obtained by solving a linear programming (LP) model. The technique proposed in this work reduces the number of LP variables by linking one error variable to each cluster, instead of linking one error variable to each individual in the population. Preliminary numerical results are reported on real datasets from the Irvine repository of machine learning databases.

In order to differentiate the malicious flux domains from legitimate ones such as content delivery network (CDN) and network time protocol (NTP) services that have similar behavior, a novel time series model is created with a set of features that are not only focused on domain name system (DNS) time-to-live (TTL) but on loyalty and entropy of DNS resource records. An offline system is built with big data technology for training the model in a semi-supervised mode. In addition, an online platform is designed and developed to support large throughput real-time DNS streaming data processing with advanced analytics technologies. The feature extraction, classification, accuracy and performance are discussed based on large amount of real world DNS data in this paper.

The robot records experiences and creates or adapts concepts represented in the web ontology language OWL 2, extended by quantitative spatial and temporal information. As a typical task, the robot is instructed to perform a specific activity in a few concrete scenarios and then expected to autonomously apply the conceptualized experiences to a new scenario. Constructing concepts from examples in a formal knowledge representation framework is well understood in principle, but several aspects important for realistic applications in robotics have remained unattended and are addressed in this paper. First, we consider conceptual representations of activity concepts combined with relevant factual knowledge about the environment. Second, the instructions can be coarse, confined to essential steps of a task, hence the robot has to autonomously determine the relevant context. Third, we propose a "Good Common Subsumer" as opposed to the formal "Least Common Subsumer" for the conceptualization of examples in order to obtain cognitively plausible results. Experiments are based on work in Project RACE(1) where a PR2 robot is employed for recording experiences, learning and applying the learnt concepts.

Many cardiac abnormalities can be detected through ECG analysis. Various computerized techniques have been applied to assist physicians in an accurate diagnosis, among them Artificial neural networks (ANNs), Genetic algorithms (GAs) and their combinations (GANNs). A cardiac arrhythmia computerized diagnostics is a good example of such an application. Many different ANN approaches to arrhythmia classification appear in the literature, but we couldn't find any work related to GANN for this problem. In this paper we are closing this gap by presenting classification system of cardiac arrhythmia using GANN classifier. ANN is the base of the system, while GAs are used to evolve ANN architecture and weights. In addition, another GA is used to perform a feature selection task. The system is trained and tested for online UCI Machine Learning data set for cardiac arrhythmia. The classification performance of the system is evaluated by means of classification accuracy. The proposed classifier gives best classification results of 90.23%, 100%, 94.98%, 99.46%, 97.88% and 86.5% on classifying ischemic changes, old anterior myocardial infarction, old inferior myocardial infarction, sinus tachycardia, sinus bradycardia and right bundle branch block respectively. These results are competitive with the state of the art results in the field; that proves the effectiveness of our application. In addition the tool is enough generic to be used in solving of a wide range of problems. Also we have investigated effectiveness of GA as a training method. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that classification accuracy of GA-trained classifiers is inversely proportional to the number of classification cases and depends on the content and size of the feature set for the classifier that is built by help of it.

In contrast with the classical Vector Space Model which represents each document by a unique vector in the feature space, our model consists in representing each document by a vector in the space of training documents of each category. We develop, for this novel model, a discriminative classifier which is based on the norms of the generated vectors by our model. We call this algorithm the Nearest Cetroid based on Vector Norms. Our major goal, by the proposition of such new classification framework, is to overcome the problems related to huge dimensionality and vector sparsity which are commonly faced in Text Classification problems. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework by comparing its effectiveness and efficiency with those of some standard classifiers when used with the classical document representation. The studied classifiers are Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN). We conduct our experiments on multi-lingual balanced and unbalanced binary data sets. Our results show that our algorithm typically performs well since it is competitive with the classical methods and, at the same time, dramatically faster especially in comparison with NB and kNN. We also apply our model on the Reuters21578 corpus so as to evaluate its performance in a multi-class environment. We can say that the obtained result (85.4% in terms of micro-F1) is promising and that it can be improved in future works.

In particular, many computational intelligence systems rely on machine learning methods involving high dimensionality datasets that have to be fast processed for real-time adaptability. In this paper we describe a practical FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) implementation of a SVD processor for accelerating the solution of large LSE problems. The design approach has been comprehensive, from the algorithmic refinement to the numerical analysis to the customization for an efficient hardware realization. The processing scheme rests on an adaptive vector rotation evaluator for error regularization that enhances convergence speed with no penalty on the solution accuracy. The proposed architecture, which follows a data transfer scheme, is scalable and based on the interconnection of simple rotations units, which allows for a trade-off between occupied area and processing acceleration in the final implementation. This permits the SVD processor to be implemented both on low-cost and high-end FPGAs, according to the final application requirements.

Classification study of solvation free energies of organic molecules using machine learning techniques	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							STRUCTURALLY DIVERSE COMPOUNDS; ABSOLUTE FREE-ENERGIES; SURFACE-AREA; MODEL; QSAR; HYDRATION; DESCRIPTORS; DERIVATIVES; PREDICTION; NETWORKS	In this work, we have developed a list of classification models to categorise organic molecules with respect to their solvation free energies using different machine learning approaches (decision tree, random forest and support vector machine). The solvation free energies of the molecules (experimental values obtained from the literature) were split into highly favourable (<-3 kcal mol(-1)) and less favourable (>-3 kcal mol(-1)) values; -3 kcal mol(-1) was set as the threshold value for the classification model development. The MACCS fingerprint along with a set of physicochemical descriptors such as atom count, topology, vdW surface area (volsurf) and subdivided surface area contributed to the classification models. The validation studies using test set and 10-fold cross-validation methods provide statistical parameters such as accuracy, sensitivity and specificity with >90% significance. The sum of ranking difference (SRD) analysis reveals that the support vector machine models are comparatively significant, while the MACCS fingerprints containing models are ranked as good models in all approaches. The MACCS fingerprints indicate that the presence of halogen atoms causes less favourable solvation free energies. However, the presence of polar atoms/groups and some functional groups such as heteroatoms, double bonded branched aliphatic chains, C=N, N-C-C-O, NCO, >1 heterocyclic atoms, OCO, etc. cause highly favourable solvation free energies. The results derived from these investigations can be used along with some quantitative models to predict the solvation free energies of organic molecules and to design novel molecules with acceptable solvation free energies.

However, live events also feature inherent complexity, in the sense that they comprise multiple parallel sessions or happenings (e.g., in a conference you have several sessions in different rooms). The focus of this research is to improve the experience of (local or remote) attendees, by exploiting the contents shared on the social networks. The framework gathers in real time the tweets related to the event, analyses them and links them to the specific sub-events they refer to. Attendees have an holistic view on what is happening and where, so as to get help when deciding what sub-event to attend. To achieve its goal, the application consumes data from different data sources: Twitter, the official event schedule, plus domain specific content (for instance, in case of a computer science conference, DBLP and Google Scholar). Such data is analyzed through a combination of semantic web, crowdsourcing (e.g., by soliciting further inputs from attendees), and machine learning techniques (including NLP and NER) for building a rich content base for the event. The paradigm is shown at work on a Computer Science conference (WWW 2013)	[Brambilla, Marco; Dell'Aglio, Daniele; Della Valle, Emanuele; Mauri, Andrea; Volonterio, Riccardo] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettron Informaz & Bioingn, I-20133 Milan, Italy	Dell'Aglio, D (reprint author), Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettron Informaz & Bioingn, Pza L Da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.	marco.brambilla@polimi.it; daniele.dellaglio@polimi.it; emanuele.della.valle@polimi.it; andrea.mauri@polimi.it; riccardo.volonterio@polimi.it						10	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743		978-3-319-11955-7; 978-3-319-11954-0	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2014	8798						159	170		10.1007/978-3-319-11955-7_13		12	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BB7JR	WOS:000345643500013

Microblogging monitoring systems might be able to detect disease outbreaks in communities faster than the traditional public health services. The realization of such systems requires a message classification approach that can distinguish the messages which concern diseases from other unrelated messages. The existing machine learning classification approaches have some difficulties due to the lack of a longer history-based learning curve and the short length of the messages. In this paper, we present a demonstration of our rule-based approach for classification of disease reports. Our system is built based on the extraction of disease-related named entities. The type identification of the recognized named entities using the existing knowledge bases helps our system to classify a message as a disease report. We combine our approach with further text processing approaches like term frequency calculation. Our experimental results show that the presented approach is capable of classifying the disease report messages with acceptable precision and recall.

However, to enable the creation of such data space, the publisher of a tripleset t must be aware of other triplesets that he can interlink with t. Towards this end, this paper describes a Web-based application, called TRTML, that explores metadata available in Linked Data catalogs to provide data publishers with recommendations of related triplesets. TRTML combines supervised learning algorithms and link prediction measures to provide recommendations. The evaluation of the tool adopted as ground truth a set of links obtained from metadata stored in the DataHub catalog. The high precision and recall results demonstrate the usefulness of TRTML.

We investigated the use of eye gaze and contextual cues to automatically detect mind wandering during reading with a computer interface. Participants were pseudo-randomly probed to report mind wandering instances while an eye tracker recorded their gaze during a computerized reading task. Supervised machine learning techniques detected positive responses to mind wandering probes from gaze and context features in a user-independent fashion. Mind wandering was predicted with an accuracy of 72% (expected accuracy by chance was 62%) when probed at the end of a page and an accuracy of 59% (chance was 50%) when probed in the midst of reading a page.

In user-adaptive systems, goal recognition is the problem of recognizing a user's goals by observing the actions the user performs. Models of goal recognition can support student learning in intelligent tutoring systems, enhance communication efficiency in dialogue systems, or dynamically adapt software to users' interests. In this paper, we describe an approach to goal recognition that leverages Markov Logic Networks (MLNs)-a machine learning framework that combines probabilistic inference with first-order logical reasoning-to encode relations between problem-solving goals and discovery events, domain-specific representations of user progress in narrative-centered learning environments. We investigate the impact of discovery event representations on goal recognition accuracy and efficiency. We also investigate the generalizability of discovery event-based goal recognition models across two corpora from students interacting with two distinct narrative-centered learning environments. Empirical results indicate that discovery event-based models outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches on both corpora.

Then the current traces are pre-processed by using wavelet transform, data normalization and principal component analysis (PCA). The featured data samples selected by the pre-processor are then used to train the neural network. Through supervised learning algorithm and wavelet pre-processing, we are able to achieve around 25% improvement in guessing the secret key when compared to existing method of machine learning alone.

This paper presents a self-adaptive honeypot system we are developing that tries to overlap some of the disadvantaged that existing systems have.

An emerging and promising trend in this regard is the development of solutions that aim at maximizing the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the end users. However, predicting the QoE perceived by the users in different conditions remains a major challenge. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to support QoE-based Video Admission Control (VAC) and Resource Management (RM) algorithms. More specifically, we develop a learning system that can automatically extract the quality-rate characteristics of unknown video sequences from the size of H.264-encoded video frames. Our approach combines unsupervised feature learning with supervised classification techniques, thereby providing an efficient and scalable way to estimate the QoE parameters that characterize each video. This QoE characterization is then used to manage simultaneous video transmissions through a shared channel in order to guarantee a minimum quality level to the final users. Simulation results show that the proposed learning-based QoE classification of video sequences outperforms commonly deployed off-line video analysis techniques and that the QoE-based VAC and RM algorithms outperform standard content-agnostic strategies.

It is a popular machine learning technique which tries to fit a hypersphere with minimal volume containing most of normal data, rejecting most of negative data. It can obtain more flexible data description by using suitable kernel functions. SVDD considers all data points with the same importance, consequently SVDD is very sensitive to uncertain data (noisy data or outliers), to deal with the uncertainty of data a confidence coefficient can be associated to each training sample. In this paper we propose a new method to generate those confidence coefficients. The experimental results show that our proposed approach significantly improves the classification accuracy.

The benefits of collaborative learning platform are only achieved by active and well-functioning teams. But, can a human tutor support a large quantity of information stemming from a lot of learners interactions? Can the tutor send recommendations and remarks to each student? Is it possible for the tutor to intervene in the due time? Considering these constraints in terms of feasibility, tutor availability, and time latency, the purpose our project is to automate the human tutor tasks. In this paper we present the design of an intelligent multi-agents system that assists learners during collaborative E-learning. The assistance is done through the analysis of the cognitive and social indicators which determine the outcomes of interactions between learners to estimate their collaboration state. Based on these indicators, the system generates automatically some recommendations that are suitable for every learner. The automation of the tutor roles is achieved by an agent that uses fuzzy logic techniques for its machine learning.

It is an important issue, in particular for vehicle safety applications. It is usually tackled in three stages: detection, feature extraction and classification. We focus in this work on the second stage of the process, namely traffic sign feature extraction with applying the Block-Based Local Binary Pattern (LBP) method. This paper investigates the use of two normalization techniques: min-max and z-score. These techniques are incorporated in the SVM prediction model. For comparison purposes we also implemented the block-Based LBP with the K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) classifier. The evaluation of the proposed approach on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark Dataset (GTSRD) proved that the normalization of SVM input space can significantly influence the higher accuracy performance of the classification procedure. Extensive and comparative experiments have been conducted to evaluate our proposed method.

However, the clustering of text data is still in early stage, because the research focused so far on the case of quantitative or categorical data. In this paper we propose a new method for improving the clustering accuracy of text data. Our method encodes the string values of a dataset using Huffman encoding algorithm, and declares these attributes as integer in the cluster evaluation phase. In the experimental part, we compared the cluster label assigned by the proposed method to each instance of the dataset with its real category, and we obtained a better clustering accuracy than the one found with traditional methods. This method is useful when the dataset to be clustered has only string attributes, because in this case, a traditional clustering method does not recognize, or recognize with a low accuracy, the category of instances.

However, no single solution can be claimed as a rule of thumb for the wide spectrum of attacks. In this paper, a novel methodology is proposed for network intrusion detection based on the multi-criteria PROAFTN classification.

Examples of such applications include language translation, text summarization, question answering, plagiarism detection, and online information retrieval. A number of metrics have been proposed in the literature to quantify the textual similarity between two sentences. However, the accuracy of utilizing each similarity metric alone in detecting paraphrases is very low. Though some machine learning (ML) techniques have been deployed for paraphrase detection, there is no known study that intensively benchmarks their performance on this problem under similar conditions. In this paper, we evaluate the utility of integrating five lexical similarity metrics with three standard machine learning paradigms to detect paraphrases. We apply statistical tests to compare and benchmark the relative significance of the adopted ML-based paraphrase detectors on different datasets.

In emotion recognition, bio-signals reflect sequences of neural activity induced by emotional events and also, have many technical advantages. The aim of this study is to classify six emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and neutral) that human have often experienced in real life from multi-channel bio-signals using machine learning algorithms. We have measured physiological responses of three-hundred participants for acquisition of bio-signals such as electrodermal activity, electrocardiograph, skin temperature, and photoplethysmograph during six emotions induction. Also, for emotion classification, we have extracted eighteen features from the signals and performed emotion classification using five algorithms, linear discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes, classification and regression tree, self-organization map and support vector machine. The used algorithms were evaluated by only training, 10-fold cross-validation and repeated random sub-sampling validation. We have obtained recognition accuracy from 42.4 to 100% for only training and 39.2 to 53.9% for testing. Also, the result for testing showed that an accuracy of emotion recognition by Naive Bayes and linear discriminant analysis were highest (53.9%, 52.7%) and was lowest by support vector machine (39.2%). This means that Naive Bayes is the best emotion recognition algorithm for basic emotions. To apply to real system, we have to discuss in the view point of testing and this means that it needs to apply various methodologies for the accuracy improvement of emotion recognition in the future analysis.

The decision tree is one of the well-known data mining methods. In general, a decision tree can be grown so as to have zero error on the training data set. If there is any noise in the data set or it does not completely cover the decision space, then over-fitting occurs and the tree needs to be pruned in order to accurately generalize the test data set. In this paper, we propose a pre-pruning method with majority and minority properties for the decision tree. It uses two kinds of qualifying criteria to consider whether the ration of the highest class of a subtree is the majority of the subtree or a minority of the overall tree. New measures for these are added to the classifier with the extended data expression. Experiments show that a classifier using this pruning method can improve classification accuracy as well as reduce the size of the tree.

About it, a decision tree algorithm is much useful in the field of data mining or machine learning system for the problem of classification. However sometimes according to several reasons, a decision tree may have leaf nodes which are made of only noise data or include noise data. Therefore it should be excluded from a decision tree. Because those weak leaves is provided wrong results. This paper proposes a method using a classifier, UChoo, for solving a classification problem, and suggests how to exclude weak leaves as foreknow it whether each leaves is weak or not in decision tree. And, the experiment shows a gradient of the performance of a classifier, Uchoo, by changing the threshold for deciding between acceptable leaves and unacceptable leaves.

These techniques are proving much more effective to overcome the limitations of the traditional in-vitro experiments on the constantly increasing sequence data. However, most critical problems that caught the attention of the researchers may include, but not limited to these: accurate structure and function prediction of unknown proteins, protein subcellular localization prediction, finding protein-protein interactions, protein fold recognition, analysis of microarray gene expression data, etc. To solve these problems, various classification and clustering techniques using machine learning have been extensively used in the published literature. These techniques include neural network algorithms, genetic algorithms, fuzzy ARTMAP, K-Means, K-NN, SVM, Rough set classifiers, decision tree and HMM based algorithms. Major difficulties in applying the above algorithms include the limitations found in the previous feature encoding and selection methods while extracting the best features, increasing classification accuracy and decreasing the running time overheads of the learning algorithms.

These equations appears in many interdisciplinary research fields such as biological and medical physics, economics, computational immunology and machine learning. A mixed functional differential equation (MDE) consists of two equated parts: one part is a time-derivative of unknown function and the other one is a particular functional dependence, which involves spatial influence and time delay effects. In this paper, we propose the special subclass of linear multistep methods called startingless procedures, which can be used to gain an efficient numerical solution of MDEs. The advantage of this approach is that we do not need to make several passes to compute the next step values. The corresponding statements of stability and the theorem of convergence are provided.

In the discrimination of fatigued bills using an acoustic signal, the variation of an observed bill sound is considered to be one of causes in misclassification. Therefore a technique has demanded in order to make the classification of fatigued bills more efficient. In this paper, we proposed the algorithm that extracted feature quantity of bill sound from acoustic signal using the frequency difference, and carried out discrimination experiment of fatigued bill money by Support Vector Machine(SVM). The feature quantity of frequency difference can represent the frequency components of an acoustic signal is varied by the fatigued degree of bill money. The generalization performance of SVM does not depend on the size of dimensions of the feature space, even in a high dimensional feature space such as bill-acoustic signals. Furthermore, SVM can induce an optimal classifier which considers the combination of features by the virtue of polynomial kernel functions.

This research work explores the use of a nonparametric regression algorithm known as multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) which has the ability to approximate the relationship between the inputs and outputs, and express the relationship mathematically. In this sense, hazardous air pollutants or toxic air contaminants refer to any substance that may cause or contribute to an increase in mortality or serious illness, or that may pose a present or potential hazard to human health. To accomplish the objective of this study, the experimental dataset of nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O-3) and dust (PM10) were collected over 3 years (2006-2008) and they are used to create a highly nonlinear model of the PM10 in the Oviedo urban nucleus (Northern Spain) based on the MARS technique. One main objective of this model is to obtain a preliminary estimate of the dependence between PM10 pollutant in the Oviedo urban area at local scale. A second aim is to determine the factors with the greatest bearing on air quality with a view to proposing health and lifestyle improvements. The United States National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) establishes the limit values of the main pollutants in the atmosphere in order to ensure the health of healthy people. Firstly, this MARS regression model captures the main perception of statistical learning theory in order to obtain a good prediction of the dependence among the main pollutants in the Oviedo urban area. Secondly, the main advantages of MARS are its capacity to produce simple, easy-to-interpret models, its ability to estimate the contributions of the input variables, and its computational efficiency. Finally, on the basis of these numerical calculations, using the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) technique, conclusions of this research work are exposed.

Fast multipole methods (FMMs) in particular are known as efficient computational methods in these fields, but they have not gained much attention in computational finance. In this paper, we apply the improved fast Gauss transform (IFGT), a version of an FMM, to the computation of European-type option prices under Merton's jump-diffusion model. IFGT is applied to computing the nonlocal integral terms in partial integrodifferential equations, and our results indicate that IFGT is useful for the fast computation of option pricing under this model.

The proposed classification method consists of three stages. In the first stage, local features are obtained by partitioning each image into 25 overlapping sub-images, computing the 2-level contourlet transform of each subimage and extracting CS-LBPs from each resulting subband. In the second stage, fuzzy logic using reduced CCS-LBPs is employed to determine the degree of membership of subimages to each class. Finally, in order to assign images to their respective classes, we utilize membership values as the input of classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (K-NN). This work makes a major contribution to improve the performance of these classifiers. We conducted experiments on a subset of IRMA dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our classification scheme. Experimental results reveal that the proposed scheme not only achieves a very good performance but also learns well even with a small number of training images.

In this study, investigation on better handling class imbalance problem in customer behavior prediction is performed. Using a more appropriate evaluation metric (AUC), we investigated the increase of performance for under-sampling and two machine learning algorithms (weight Random Forests and RUSBoost) against a benchmark case of just using Random Forests. Results show that under-sampling is the most effective way to deal with class imbalance. RUSBoost, as a specific algorithm designed to deal with class imbalance problem, is also effective but not as good as under-sampling. Weighted Random Forests, as a cost-sensitive learner, only improves the performance of appetency classification problem out of three classification problems.

The collaboration between doctors and CAD systems can help reducing the false diagnosis rate. Knowledge representation is an important chain for any artificial intelligence system, including automated breast cancer diagnosis. The breast cancer experts' knowledge of distinguishing benign and malignant lesions is well described by Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS). Many digital formulas have been proposed to quantify BIRADS features. However, there is no direct evaluation scheme for these digital features. A common way that people evaluate digital features is using them as the input for classifiers, such as machine learning methods, and then evaluating the performance of classifiers, which indirectly serves as the evaluation of digital features. The performance of a classifier is affected by the digital features, but also affected by other factors. It is inaccurate to use only the performance of classifiers as the metric to evaluate digital features. The vision of this work is to separate the evaluation of digital features from the evaluation of classifiers, with the purpose of providing an accurate feature measurement procedure and improving the quality of knowledge representation. An independent feature evaluation scheme without using any automatic classifier is proposed. Such a scheme can directly evaluate how precisely experts' knowledge is represented in computerized systems. Several commonly used digital features and newly proposed digital features in this work are evaluated using this scheme on a breast ultrasound image database. Pathological results and radiologist's opinions serve as the ground truth for evaluation purpose.

One of these approaches is least squares-support vector machine regression (LS-SVMR). Besides, the robustness problem of the LS-SVMR among machine learning algorithms is importantly considered in recent years. Hence, for the robustness problem in LS-SVMR, a least trimmed squares support vector machine regression (LTS-SVMR) with wavelet kernel which is the hybrid of the LTS and LS-SVMR is proposed in this paper. When the LTS method faces on the training sample with noise and outliers, it can effectively remove large noise and outliers under the proper initial nonlinear function. Hence, robustness problem in LS-SVMR is enhanced by combining the LS-SVMR with wavelet kernel and the LTS. Finally, the proposed LTS-SVMR with wavelet kernel is applied on modeling of nonlinear systems with noise and outliers.

Mathematically, LDA-FP is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem that can be efficiently solved by a novel branch-and-bound method proposed in this paper.

As the templates are patterned by traditional lithography, their shapes may vary due to the process variations, which will ultimately affect the contacts/vias even for the same type of template. Due to the complexity of the DSA process, rigorous process simulation is unacceptably slow for full chip verification. This paper formulate several critical problems in DSA verification, and proposes a design automation methodology that consists of a data preparation and a model learning stage. We present a novel DSA model with Point Correspondence and Segment Distance features for robust learning. Following the methodology, we propose an effective machine learning (ML) based method for DSA hotspot detection. The results of our initial experiments have already demonstrated the high-efficiency of our ML-based approach with over 85% detection accuracy. Compared to the minutes or even hours of simulation time in rigorous method, the methodology in this paper validates the research potential along this direction.

A major goal of modern synoptic imaging surveys is to categorize this change over the entire sky to infer the diverse physical origins of variability. However, event discovery is only the beginning in the quest to extract the deepest insights: expensive follow-up resources (telescopes and people) are required, often in a time constrained environment. Viewing discovery and scientific insight through a resource-maximization lens, I discuss how machine learning is being applied to some modern astrophysics challenges. Here, the surfacing of parallelized feature engineering and machine learning into production-quality (scalable and fault tolerant) frameworks is the frontier for our field.

This paper describes Nitro, a programmer-directed autotuning framework that facilitates tuning of code variants, or alternative implementations of the same computation. Nitro provides a library interface that permits programmers to express code variants along with meta-information that aids the system in selecting among the set of variants at run time. Machine learning is employed to build a model through training on this meta-information, so that when a new input is presented, Nitro can consult the model to select the appropriate variant. In experiments with five real-world irregular GPU benchmarks from sparse numerical methods, graph computations and sorting, Nitro-tuned variants achieve over 93% of the performance of variants selected through exhaustive search. Further, we describe optimizations and heuristics in Nitro that substantially reduce training time and other overheads.

In recent years, SVM was adapted to the field of High Performance Computing for power/performance prediction, auto-tuning, and runtime scheduling. However, even at the risk of losing prediction accuracy due to insufficient runtime information, researchers can only afford to apply offline model training to avoid significant runtime training overhead. Advanced multi-and many-core architectures offer massive parallelism with complex memory hierarchies which can make runtime training possible, but form a barrier to efficient parallel SVM design. To address the challenges above, we designed and implemented MIC-SVM, a highly efficient parallel SVM for x86 based multi-core and many-core architectures, such as the Intel Ivy Bridge CPUs and Intel Xeon Phi co-processor (MIC). We propose various novel analysis methods and optimization techniques to fully utilize the multilevel parallelism provided by these architectures and serve as general optimization methods for other machine learning tools. MIC-SVM achieves 4.4-84x and 18-47x speedups against the popular LIBSVM, on MIC and Ivy Bridge CPUs respectively, for several real-world data-mining datasets. Even compared with GPUSVM, run on a top of the line NVIDIA k20x GPU, the performance of our MIC-SVM is competitive. We also conduct a cross-platform performance comparison analysis, focusing on Ivy Bridge CPUs, MIC and GPUs, and provide insights on how to select the most suitable advanced architectures for specific algorithms and input data patterns.

In this paper, the ranges of furan content in power transformer is predicted using measurements of transformer oil tests like breakdown voltage, acidity and water content. Machine learning approach is adopted, and maintenance data collected from 90 transformers are used. A maximum of 67% recognition rate was achieved using Decision Tree classifier. The major challenge of the used data is the relatively low number of available samples in certain furan intervals. Two solutions have been proposed to overcome this imbalanced classification problem, namely, using an over-sampling technique and balancing data distributions by reducing the number of intervals to be predicted to three instead of five intervals. The recognition rate has improved to reach 80%.

A 3-year collaboration between Audi AG, Volkswagen Group of America Electronics Research Laboratory, and UC San Diego, the driver assistance portion of the UIA project focuses on two main use cases of vital importance in urban driving. The first, Driver Attention Guard, applies novel computer vision and machine learning research for accurately tracking the driver's head position and rotation using an array of cameras. The system then infers the driver's focus of attention, alerting the driver and engaging safety systems in case of extended driver inattention. The second application, Merge and Lane Change Assist, applies a novel probabilistic compact representation of the on-road environment, fusing data from a variety of sensor modalities. The system then computes safe and low-cost merge and lane-change maneuver recommendations. It communicates desired speeds to the driver via Head-up Display, when the driver touches the blinker, indicating his desired lane. The fully-implemented systems, complete with HMI, were demonstrated to the public and press in San Francisco in January of 2014.

This has severe negative effects, including drivers stress due to increased time pressure, reduced usage efficiency of trucks and other commercial vehicles, and increased gas emissions-responsible for climate change and air pollution affecting population health in densely populated areas. As existing centralized approaches were neither efficient, nor scalable, there is a need for alternative approaches. Social insects provide many solutions for dealing with decentralized problems. For instance ants choose their routes based on pheromones left by previous ants. However, Ant Colony Optimization is not directly applicable to vehicle routing, as routing the vehicles to the same road would cause traffic congestion. Yet, the traffic is broadly similar from work-to work-day. This paper introduces an ant-colony optimization-based algorithm called Time-Ants. Time-Ants considers that an amount of "pheromone" or a traffic rating is assigned to each road at any given time in the day. Using an innovative algorithm the vehicle's routes are chosen based on these traffic ratings, aggregated in time. After several iterations this results in a global optimum for the traffic system. Bottlenecks are identified and avoided by machine learning. Time-Ants outperforms another leading algorithm by up to 19% in terms of percentage of vehicles to reach the destination within a given time-frame.

They need some ways to identify each application's flows generated by user hosts, especially the application classes with large flows because of the higher bandwidth occupation comparing with the other classes with small flows. A novel method is presented to modularize flow size using information gain ratio. The origin dataset is properly partitioned into large flow and small flow subsets by a threshold that is achieved when the data complexity of large flow subset is minimized. The searching algorithm of the partitioned threshold is independent of classification performance. The specific classifiers can be trained to identify large flows and small flows properly on each subset in generalization. Experimental results on real world traffic datasets show that byte accuracy increased 30% averagely when our method is compared with original.

Digital Forensics Triage is one solution to this problem as it can extract evidence quickly at the crime scene and provide vital intelligence in time critical investigations. Similarly, such methodologies can be used in a laboratory to prioritize deeper analysis of digital devices and alleviate examination backlog. Developments in Digital Forensics Triage methodologies have moved towards automating the device classification process and those which incorporate Machine Learning principles have proven to be successful. Such an approach depends on crime-related features which provide a relevant basis upon which device classification can take place. In addition, to be an accepted and viable methodology it should be also as accurate as possible. Previous work has concentrated on the issues of feature extraction and classification, where less attention has been paid to improving classification accuracy through feature manipulation. In this regard, among the several techniques available for the purpose, we concentrate on feature weighting, a process which places more importance on specific features. A twofold approach is followed: on one hand, automated feature weights are quantified using Kullback-Leibler measure and applied to the training set whereas, on the other hand, manual weights are determined with the contribution of surveyed digital forensic experts. Experimental results of manual and automatic feature weighting are described which conclude that both the techniques are effective in improving device classification accuracy in crime investigations.

Its revolutionary potential is now universally recognized. Data complexity, heterogeneity, scale, and timeliness make data analysis a clear bottleneck in many biomedical applications, due to the complexity of the patterns and lack of scalability of the underlying algorithms. Advanced machine learning and data mining algorithms are being developed to address one or more challenges listed above. It is typical that the complexity of potential patterns may grow exponentially with respect to the data complexity, and so is the size of the pattern space. To avoid an exhaustive search through the pattern space, machine learning and data mining algorithms usually employ a greedy approach to search for a local optimum in the solution space, or use a branch-and-bound approach to seek optimal solutions, and consequently, are often implemented as iterative or recursive procedures. To improve efficiency, these algorithms often exploit the dependencies between potential patterns to maximize in-memory computation and/or leverage special hardware (such as GPU and FPGA) for acceleration. These lead to strong data dependency, operation dependency, and hardware dependency, and sometimes ad hoc solutions that cannot be generalized to a broader scope. In this talk, I will present some open challenges faced by data scientist in biomedical fields and the current approaches taken to tackle these challenges.

This paper introduces a parameterized approach to translate natural language geographic questions into spatial SQLs. In particular, three types of complexity are introduced and initial solutions are proposed to deal with these complexities. The entire parameterization process is implemented to generate spatial SQL templates for five types of geographic questions. It is suggested that our approach is useful for solving natural geographic problems using spatial functions such as those in a GIS.

Even when good results are achieved, the datasets used by the state-of-the-art approaches are rarely published. In order to address these problems, this work presents an automatic approach to build multilingual semantic relation detectors through distant supervision combining two of the largest resources of structured and unstructured content available on the Web, DBpedia and Wikipedia. We map the DBpedia ontology back to the Wikipedia text to extract more than 100.000 training instances for more than 90 DBpedia relations for English and Portuguese languages without human intervention. First, we mine the Wikipedia articles to find candidate instances for relations described in the DBpedia ontology. Second, we preprocess and normalize the data filtering out irrelevant instances. Finally, we use the normalized data to construct regularized logistic regression detectors that achieve more than 80% of F-Measure for both English and Portuguese languages. In this paper, we also compare the impact of different types of features on the accuracy of the trained detector, demonstrating significant performance improvements when combining lexical, syntactic and semantic features. Both the datasets and the code used in this research are available online.

Recently, a new VSA based on multiplication of distributed vectors by random matrices was proposed; this is known as Matrix-Binding-of-Additive-Terms (MBAT). We propose an enhancement that introduces an important additional feature to MBAT: the ability to 'unbind' symbols. We show that our method, which exploits the inherent properties of orthogonal matrices, imparts MBAT with the 'question answering' ability found in other VSAs. We compare our results with another popular VSA that was recently demonstrated to have high utility in brain-inspired machine learning applications.

They have applications in machine learning and for understanding information processing in neurobiology. VSAs are typically described in an abstract mathematical form in terms of vectors and operations on vectors. In this work, we show that a machine learning approach known as hierarchical temporal memory, which is based on the anatomy and function of mammalian neocortex, is inherently capable of supporting important VSA functionality. This follows because the approach learns sequences of semantics-preserving sparse distributed representations.

Today, every sensor or ADA in its applied system participates in the collection of data throughout the entire system. The data collected from all of the sensors or ADAs are then integrated into one significant conclusion or decision, a process known as data fusion. However, the reliability, or reputation, of a single sensor or ADA may change over time, or may not be known at all. Since this reputation is taken into account when determining the final conclusion post data classification, one must be able to predict their reputations. We propose a new machine learning prediction technique (MLPT) to predict the reputation of each sensor or ADA. This technique is based on the existing 'Decision Tree Certainty Level' technique, or DTCL, which is the creation of many random decision trees (forests) with high certainty levels [Dolev et al. (2009)]. In particular, it was shown that the DTCL enhances the classification capabilities of CARTs (Classification and Regression Trees) [Briman et al. (1984)]. After applying the DTCL technique to the reputation data, we then apply a new evolutionary process on those decision trees to reduce the overall number of trees by merging only the most accurate trees and then using only these new trees to generate the reputation values. Thus, we combine DTCL and evolution techniques to enable the determination of sensor or ADA reputations by using only the most accurate trees. Finally, we demonstrate how to improve the data fusion process by identifying the most reliable portions of the collected data to reach more accurate conclusions.

This information can be perceived by computational systems. In this work, we show that early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is possible solely from the voice signal. This is in contrast to earlier work in which we showed that this can be done using hand-calculated features of the speech (such as formants) as annotated by professional speech therapists. In this paper, we review that work and show that a differential diagnosis can be produced directly from the analog speech signal itself. In addition, differentiation can be made between seven different degrees of progression of the disease (including healthy). Such a system can act as an additional stage (or another building block) in a bigger system of natural speech processing. For example it could be used in automatic speech recognition systems that are used as personal assistants (such as Iphones' Siri, Google Voice), or as natural man-machine interfaces. We also conjecture that such systems can be extended to monitoring and classifying additional neurological diseases and speech pathologies. The methods presented here use a combination of signal processing features and machine learning techniques.

Such a system could promote reading comprehension skills. An important step towards building a full ITS for reading comprehension is to build an automated ranking system that will assign a hardness level to questions used by the ITS. This is the main concern of this work. For this purpose we, first, had to define the set of criteria that determines the rate of difficulty of a question. Second, we prepared a bank of questions that were rated by a panel of experts using the set of criteria defined above. Third, we developed an automated rating software based on the criteria defined above. In particular, we considered and compared different machine learning techniques for the ranking system of the third part of the process: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), decision tree and naive Bayesian network.

So far this has been accomplished with: (1) artificial data (2) artificial noise (designed to mimic natural noise) (3) natural human data with artificial noise (4) natural human data with its natural noise and variance albeit for certain phonemes. This mechanism, unlike most other methods is done without any encoding of the signal; and without changing time into space; but instead uses the Liquid State Machine paradigm which is an abstraction of natural cortical arrangements. The data is entered as an analogue signal without any modifications. This means that the methodology is close to "natural" biological mechanisms.

The set of transformations provide a means with which data may be compared to a library of known clutter distributions. Several common non-Gaussian distributions are discussed and incorporated into the initial implementation of the library. This approach allows for the addition of empirically measured clutter distributions, which may not have a known analytic form. The adaptive threshold estimation reduces the probability of false alarm when non-Gaussian clutter is present..

FastICA algorithm has a faster and more robust convergence speed than the traditional ICA algorithm. But its recovery results are not satisfied. Inspired by various successful applications of kernel and spectral clustering methods in machine learning and data mining community, probability density function of the source signal is estimated by the FSS-kernel algorithm, and then to restore the blind separation of mixed signals, FastICA algorithm is used, the negative entropy is the objective function. The simulation results show that the signal aliasing could be separated effecti- vely by this method. It is proved that the method has higher separation accuracy and adaptive capacity, by contrasting with the traditional ICA algorithms and FastICA algorithm.

Road signs are typically placed either by the roadside or above roads. They provide important information in order to make driving safer and easier. This paper proposes an algorithm that recognizes Bangla road sign with a better percentage. The algorithm starts with capture image from real video scene, text detection from images, character segmentation and recognition of characters through shape matrix. The constructed feature vectors for each individual Bangla road sign are learned into a neural network which later classifies new instance of Bangla road sign. The promising preliminary experimental results indicate a positive potential of our algorithm.

In this paper, we aim to automatically extract the sentiments or opinions conveyed by users from Bangla microblog posts and then identify the overall polarity of texts as either negative or positive. We use a semi-supervised bootstrapping approach for the development of the training corpus which avoids the need for labor intensive manual annotation.

In this paper, we introduce an adaptive naive Bayes tree (NBTree) algorithm for scaling up the classification accuracy of multi-class classification problems, which considers the attributes that are used in the decision tree for the calculation of the naive assumption of class conditional independence. The NBTree is a hybrid classifier of decision tree and naive Bayes classifiers. In NBTree nodes contain and split as regular decision tree, but the leaves are replaced by naive Bayes classifier. We tested the performance of proposed algorithm against those of the existing decision tree and naive Bayes classifiers respectively using the classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity-specificity analysis, and 10-fold cross validation on 10 real benchmark datasets from UCI (University of California, Irvine) machine learning repository. The experimental results show that the proposed approach improved the classification accuracy of real life challenging multi-class problems.

In this study, we have conducted a comparative analysis for effective detection of Parkinson's disease using various machine learning classifiers from voice disorder known as dysphonia. To investigate robust detection process, three independent classifier topologies were applied to distinguish between PD patient and healthy individual, and to make a comparison of the results. The classifiers used here are Random Tree (RT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Feedforward Back-propagation based Artificial Neural Network (FBANN). To validate the overall classification with acceptable error rate, a 100 times repeated 10-fold cross validation analysis has been carried out for all classifiers. With optimized statistical parameters and using selective feature set, the proposed scheme has achieved up to 97.37% recognition accuracy. FBANN classifier outperformed than the others. Considering the classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, all classifiers achieved better than chance level.

In real-time streaming environments concepts of instances might change at any time such as weather predictions, astronomical and intrusion detection etc. To address this issue, we present an adaptive ensemble classifier for data streams classification, which uses a set of decision trees for mining complex noisy instances in data streams. The ensemble model updates automatically so that it represents the most recent concepts in data streams. In each iteration, the ensemble model generates a new training data from original training dataset, then builds a decision tree using new training data and assigns a weight to the tree based on its classification accuracy on original training instances. Also it updates the weight of training instances in training dataset. We tested the performance of the proposed ensemble classifier against that of existing C4.5 decision tree classifier using real benchmark datasets from UCI (University of California, Irvine) machine learning repository. The experimental results prove that the proposed ensemble classifier shows great flexibility and robustness in data streams classification.

The contribution of this work is in two folds: firstly it selects those features of speech which is most promising for classification and secondly it uses the majority voting technique that selects the exact class of emotion. Here, majority voting technique has been applied over Neural Network (NN), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Input vector of NN, DT, SVM and KNN consists of various acoustic and prosodic features like Pitch, Mel-Frequency Cepstral coefficients etc. From speech signal many feature have been extracted and only promising features have been selected. To consider a feature as promising, Fast Correlation based feature selection (FCBF) and Fisher score algorithms have been used and only those features are selected which are highly ranked by both of them. The proposed approach has been tested on Berlin dataset of emotional speech [3] and Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA) dataset [4]. The experimental result shows that majority voting technique attains better accuracy over individual machine learning techniques. The employment of the proposed approach can effectively recognize the emotion of human beings in case of social robot, intelligent chat client, call-center of a company etc.	[Sarker, Md Kamruzzaman; Alam, Kazi Md Rokibul; Arifuzzaman, Md] Khulna Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Khulna 9203, Bangladesh	Sarker, MK (reprint author), Khulna Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Khulna 9203, Bangladesh.	mdkamruzzamansarker@gmail.com; rokibcse@yahoo.com; arifuzzaman.likhon@gmail.com						16	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-1-4799-5180-2				2014												5	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BB7ZD	WOS:000346137900006

The research work here is focused on the study of various approaches for transformation large data into smaller datasets in effective manner so that accurate classification could be performed. Data clustering is a machine learning approach which divides dataset into smaller partitions and having higher intra partition similarity within it and dissimilarity among different partitions. Many clustering algorithm exists for varying nature of dataset and own their advantages as well as limitations as per nature of individual datasets thus there is sufficient scope to explore efficient and new algorithm for clustering based classification. This paper presents a new approach for centroid selection in k-mean algorithm for health datasets which gives better clustering results in comparison to traditional k-mean algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated against tuberculosis dataset and then results are applied to classifier for performance evaluation and results show improvement over previous algorithm.

Decisions over audiovisual encoding are related to the perceived quality of experience (QoE), but also to the physical attributes of initial material (i.e. resolution, color range, motion activity, audio dynamic range, bandwidth, etc.). Recent research showed that such decisions can be really crucial during the production of audiovisual e-learning material, where poor encoding may lead to unaccepted QoE or even to the creation of negative emotional response. On the other hand, exaggerated high quality encoding may create increased bandwidth demands that are associated with annoying delays and irregular playback flow, resulting again in QoE degradation with similar emotional repulsion. Thus, there has to be a careful treatment with proper encoding balance during the production of both the networked distance learning and stand-alone audiovisual mediated resources. Such machine creativity strategies are investigated in the current work with the utilization of applicable audiovisual features, QoE metrics and emotional measures. The current work is part of a broader research, aiming at implementing intelligent models for optimal audiovisual production and encoding configuration, with respect to the source content attributes, the requested quality of experience (and learning) and the related emotional properties.

The use of one-class classifiers is one of the main approaches to solving such problems. We conduct a comparative study of one-class classification algorithms in classification problems with extreme class imbalance. Emphasis is placed on evaluation of the classificatory accuracy of a one-class classifier based on the Real Valued Negative Selection Algorithm (RVNSA) from Artificial Immune Systems theory, as there are no previous studies focusing on it. Its performance is compared to the performance of 14 alternative classification algorithms which are considered as state of the art in one-class classification problems.

As a result, Genetic-AIRS is executed globally, in contrast with AIRS which is executed locally. We compare to AIRS and identify advantages and disadvantages of Genetic-AIRS and perform an experimental evaluation on various publicly available datasets.

However, machine learning needs to be optimised according to the target, e.g. a plant operating condition diagnosis. Thus, we propose a method that selects process signals to optimise the performance of a diagnostic machine for a plant using factor analysis and decision-tree analysis. A feature of our optimisation method is that it accounts for combinations of process signals. Further, an advantage of our method is that the time to create an optimised diagnostic machine is short. The diagnostic machines need to be updated in a limited period, e.g. plant equipment repair, which changes regular process values. Another advantage is that our method can be applied to various learning machines to improve performance. This advantage allows the designer of the diagnostic system to use the best machine-learning method on each diagnostic machine. This paper reports our methodology, our proposed method, and the experimental results where a diagnostic machine was improved by 5.3% to 98.8% from 93.5% abnormality detection accuracy when our method which implemented a support vector machine was applied to the diagnostic machine to detect the blockage of a pipe in the desulfurisation process in a chemical plant simulator.

Loss of confinement on a storage tank, vessel or piping on industrial sites could imply atmospheric dispersion of toxic or flammable gases. Gas dispersion forecasting is a difficult task since turbulence modeling at large scale involves expensive calculations. Therefore simpler models are used but remain inaccurate especially when turbulence is heterogeneous. The present work aims to study if Artificial Neural Networks coupled with Cellular Automata could be relevant to overcome these gaps. Two methods are reviewed and compared. An example database was designed from RANS k-epsilon CFD model. Both methods were then applied. Their efficiencies are compared and discussed in terms of quality, real-time applicability and real-life plausibility.

Addressing the issue, the current work-in-progress proposed an architecture utilizing the crowd for building an anti-virus knowledge base, which considers not only virus behaviour but also behaviour from the new applications. This architecture also utilized anti-virus experts in the crowd for classified objects that are unclassified by machines. Using the classified objects, it used a machine learning algorithm to analyse application behaviour from the crowd for updating the knowledge base, and thus the corresponding anti-virus system can correctly diagnose and classify objects, reducing the false-positive rates.

Nevertheless, CSP suffers from the problems of sensitivity to noise and overfitting. To overcome these issues, the regularized CSP (RCSP) has been proposed recently. In addition, CSP was originally designed for two-class classification. However, a practical BCI usually needs four-class commands to be able to operate. Thus, there is a high demand for increasing the performance of multi-class BCI. In this paper, we provide a complete study of classification accuracy in multi-class BCI using regularization theory, and compare it with the standard CSP to determine the suitable method for feature extraction in BCI learning. Besides CSP, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) has shown its robust and widespread use for machine learning in BCI. LDA estimates covariance matrices from extracted features. But for high-dimensional features with only a small amount of training data given, the estimation may become imprecise. In the attempt of clarifying the regularizing effects in BCI, this paper also provides the classification results of the regularized LDA (RLDA). The performance evaluation of this work was taken on data from 9 subjects, from BCI competition datasets. Results show that the combination of standard CSP and LDA has a slightly better accuracy than the regularizing methods.

This is reflected, for example, in a weak or absent correlation between promoter divergence and expression divergence between paralogs. However, an inability to predict may reflect an inability to accurately measure or employment of the wrong parameters. Here we address this issue through integration of two exceptional resources: ENCODE data on transcription factor binding and the FANTOM5 high-resolution expression atlas. Results: Consistent with the notion that in eukaryotes most transcription factors are activating, the number of transcription factors binding a promoter is a strong predictor of expression breadth. In addition, evolutionarily young duplicates have fewer transcription factor binders and narrower expression. Nonetheless, we find several binders and cooperative sets that are disproportionately associated with broad expression, indicating that models more complex than simple correlations should hold more predictive power. Indeed, a machine learning approach improves fit to the data compared with a simple correlation. Machine learning could at best moderately predict tissue of expression of tissue specific genes. Conclusions: We find robust evidence that some expression parameters and paralog expression divergence are strongly predictable with knowledge of transcription factor binding repertoire. While some cooperative complexes can be identified, consistent with the notion that most eukaryotic transcription factors are activating, a simple predictor, the number of binding transcription factors found on a promoter, is a robust predictor of expression breadth.

Conventionally, segmentation is carried out on T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and nuclear parcellation using diffusion weighted MR images. We present the first fully automatic method that incorporates both tissue contrasts and several derived features to first segment and then parcellate the thalamus. We incorporate fractional anisotrophy, fiber orientation from the 5D Knutsson representation of the principal eigenvectors, and connectivity between the thalamus and the cortical lobes, as features. Combining these multiple information sources allows us to identify discriminating dimensions and thus parcellate the thalamic nuclei. A hierarchical random forest framework with a multidimensional feature per voxel, first distinguishes thalamus from background, and then separates each group of thalamic nuclei. Using a leave one out cross-validation on 12 subjects we have a mean Dice score of 0.805 and 0.799 for the left and right thalami, respectively. We also report overlap for the thalamic nuclear groups.

Diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI is potentially able to measure tau(i) as it is sensitive to the average displacement of water molecules in tissue. However, previous work addressing this has been hampered by a lack of both sensitive data and accurate mathematical models. We address the latter problem by constructing a computational model using Monte Carlo simulations and machine learning in order to learn a mapping between features derived from DW MR signals and ground truth microstructure parameters. We test our method using simulated and in vivo human brain data. Simulation results show that our approach provides a marked improvement over the most widely used mathematical model. The trained model also predicts sensible microstructure parameters from in vivo human brain data, matching values of tau(i) found in the literature.

A Universal and Efficient Method to Compute Maps from Image-Based Prediction Models	MEDICAL IMAGE COMPUTING AND COMPUTER-ASSISTED INTERVENTION - MICCAI 2014, PT III	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	17th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI)	SEP 14-18, 2014	Boston, MA	Harvard Med Sch	Massachusetts Inst Technol	Machine learning; image-based prediction	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CLASSIFICATION; MRI; AD	Discriminative supervised learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines, are becoming increasingly popular in biomedical image computing. One of their main uses is to construct image-based prediction models, e.g., for computer aided diagnosis or "mind reading." A major challenge in these applications is the biological interpretation of the machine learning models, which can be arbitrarily complex functions of the input features (e.g., as induced by kernel-based methods). Recent work has proposed several strategies for deriving maps that highlight regions relevant for accurate prediction. Yet most of these methods either rely on strong assumptions about the prediction model (e.g., linearity, sparsity) and/or data (e.g., Gaussianity), or fail to exploit the covariance structure in the data. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient and universal framework for quantifying associations captured by black box machine learning models. Furthermore, our theoretical perspective reveals that examining associations with predictions, in the absence of ground truth labels, can be very informative. We apply the proposed method to machine learning models trained to predict cognitive impairment from structural neuroimaging data. We demonstrate that our approach yields biologically meaningful maps of association.

The Evolution of Boosting Algorithms From Machine Learning to Statistical Modelling	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Statistical computing; statistical models; algorithms; classification; machine learning	EVIDENCE CONTRARY; MICROARRAY DATA; REGRESSION; SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; VIEW; REGULARIZATION; PREDICTION; SPLINES	Background: The concept of boosting emerged from the field of machine learning. The basic idea is to boost the accuracy of a weak classifying tool by combining various instances into a more accurate prediction. This general concept was later adapted to the field of statistical modelling. Nowadays, boosting algorithms are often applied to estimate and select predictor effects in statistical regression models. Objectives: This review article attempts to highlight the evolution of boosting algorithms from machine learning to statistical modelling. Methods: We describe the AdaBoost algorithm for classification as well as the two most prominent statistical boosting approaches, gradient boosting and likelihood-based boosting for statistical modelling. We highlight the methodological background and present the most common software implementations. Results: Although gradient boosting and likelihood-based boosting are typically treated separately in the literature, they share the same methodological roots and follow the same fundamental concepts. Compared to the initial machine learning algorithms, which must be seen as black-box prediction schemes, they result in statistical models with a straight-forward interpretation. Conclusions: Statistical boosting algorithms have gained substantial interest during the last decade and offer a variety of options to address important research questions in modern biomedicine.

Objectives: This review highlights recent methodological developments regarding boosting algorithms for statistical modelling especially focusing on topics relevant for biomedical research. Methods: We suggest a unified framework for gradient boosting and likelihood-based boosting (statistical boosting) which have been addressed separately in the literature up to now. Results: The methodological developments on statistical boosting during the last ten years can be grouped into three different lines of research: i) efforts to ensure variable selection leading to sparser models, ii) developments regarding different types of predictor effects and how to choose them, iii) approaches to extend the statistical boosting framework to new regression settings. Conclusions: Statistical boosting algorithms I have been adapted to carry out unbiased variable selection and automated model choice during the fitting process and can nowadays be applied in almost any regression setting in combination with a large amount of different types of predictor effects.

A study of the literature reveals that most of the existing LCSs focused primarily on learning deterministic policies. However a desirable policy may often be stochastic, in particular when the environment is partially observable. To fill this gap, based on XCS, which is one of the most successful accuracy-based LCSs, a new Michigan-style LCS called Natural XCS (i.e. NXCS) is proposed in this paper. NXCS enables direct learning of stochastic policies by utilizing a natural gradient learning technology under a policy gradient framework. Its effectiveness is experimentally compared with XCS and one of its variation known as XCS mu in this paper. Our results show that NXCS can achieve competitive performance in both deterministic and stochastic multi-step problems.

Among different types of NNs, Back Propagation (BP) NN is one popular model, widely exploited in various applications. Recently, NNs attract even more attention in the community because a deep learning structure (if appropriately adopted) could significantly improve the learning performance. In this paper, based on a probabilistic assumption over the output neurons, we propose a hybrid strategy that manages to combine one typical deep NN, i.e., Convolutional NN (CNN) with the popular BP. We present the justification and describe the detailed learning formulations. A series of experiments validate that the hybrid approach could largely improve the accuracy for both CNN and BP on two large-scale benchmark data sets, i.e., MNIST and USPS. In particular, the proposed hybrid method significantly reduced the error rates of CNN and BP respectively by 11.72% and 28.89% on MNIST.

It brings financial damage to companies and security threat to governments and organizations. Most recent spam emails contain URLs that redirect spam receivers to malicious Web servers. In this paper, we propose an online machine learning based malicious spam email detection system. The term-weighting scheme represents each spam email. These feature vectors are then used as the input of the classifier. The learning is periodically performed to update the classifier so that the system provides increased adaptability to take account of spam emails whose contents change from time to time. A real data set is labeled by the SPIKE system which is developed by NICT. Evaluation experiments show that the detection system is efficient and accurate to identify malicious spam emails.

To address this issue, we design a domain-ontology-based approach for automatic plain-text-described service discovery. This approach incorporates a plain-text-described service ontology for standard service description, a plain-text-described service discovery framework for domain-relevant service discovery and ontology learning, and a machine-learning-based model for ontology-based service functionality annotation.

Our approach extends gene finders with a model of the sequential composition of genes at the genome-level - effectively producing a sequential genome annotation as output. The model can be used to obtain the most probable genome annotation based on a combination of i: a gene finder score of each gene candidate and ii: the sequence of the reading frames of gene candidates through a genome. The model - as well as a higher order variant - is developed and tested using the probabilistic logic programming language and machine learning system PRISM - a fast and efficient model prototyping environment, using bacterial gene finding performance as a benchmark of signal strength. The model is used to prune a set of gene predictions from an underlying gene finder and are evaluated by the effect on prediction performance. Since bacterial gene finding to a large extent is a solved problem it forms an ideal proving ground for evaluating the explicit modeling of larger scale gene sequence composition of genomes. We conclude that the sequential composition of gene reading frames is a consistent signal present in bacterial genomes and that it can be effectively modeled with probabilistic sequence models.

However, scoring functions are typically unsuccessful at correctly ranking ligands according to their binding affinity. Using cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), a particularly challenging workhorse in virtual screening (VS) we show how the use of support vector machines (SVMs), trained with the individual energy terms retrieved from docking-based VS experiments, can improve the discrimination between active and inactive compounds. Actives and inactives for COX-1 were obtained from the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD) and docked into COX-1 with AutoDock Vina (Vina). The energy parameters of Vina's scoring function were used to train classification models with SVM-light. The results show that Vina offers acceptable pose prediction accuracy, but its scoring function performs poorly compared to our SVM classification models. The superior performance of the trained classification models highlights the potential of using non-linear machine learning methods to identify bioactive compounds through docking-based screening.

LPS: a strategy for the generation of longer DNA sequence fragments from short reads	PROCEEDINGS IWBBIO 2014: INTERNATIONAL WORK-CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Work-Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering (IWBBIO)	APR 07-09, 2014	Granada, SPAIN	Univ Granada, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Spanish Chapter, BioMed Central, e Health Business Dev BULL Espana S A		DNA assembling; clustering; bioinformatics; machine learning		The output of some modern genome sequencing techniques consists of short length DNA fragments known as reads. A disadvantage of short length reads is that they may appear at different positions of the original genome sequence. Not recognizing the position of repetitive fragments may generate gaps in the final assembled sequence. This happens because repeated fragments would not be considered as candidates to appear at different positions of the assembly. Generating longer length reads could reduce the number of possible repeats in the genome, but this option is not always feasible due to technical restrictions. In this paper we propose a preprocessing method, called LPS, that takes short reads as input to construct longer DNA fragments. LPS uses a clustering strategy based in the overlaps between sequences to reduce the number of fragments to be fed to the assembly tool and to obtain enhanced quality assemblies.

When changes occur in the function of this enzyme, disorders such as pseudohermaphroditism, baldness, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer may arise. Currently, there are only two marketed drugs, finasteride and dutasteride, for the therapy of benign prostatic hyperplasia, which have long term side effects, stressing the need for the development of better inhibitors. In the present study, we used a dataset of compounds with known inhibitory activity against 5a-reductase (isozyme 2; 5 alpha-R2) obtained from the ChEMBL database, and employed machine learning methods (random forests and support vector machines) to build classifiers for high-throughput virtual screening campaigns to help prioritise molecules for further analysis. The performance of the classification models was evaluated based on sensitivity, specificity, precision, F-score and accuracy. Our results show that, overall the classification models produced by the two algorithms present similar performance. Furthermore, the classifiers show high performance on the identification and discrimination between potent and weak inhibitors.	[Sousa, Joana; Brito, Rui M. M.; Salvador, Jorge A.

In this paper we present a solution which classi es protein folds using Kohonen's Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and a comparison between few approaches for protein fold classi cation. We use SOM, Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLD), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) methods to classify three SCOP folds with six features (amino acid composition, predicted secondary structure, hydrophobicity, normalized van der Waals volume, polarity and polarizability). This paper has a novelty in the way of applying SOM to these six features, and also portrays the capabilities of SOM among the other methods in protein fold classi cation. The methods are tested on 120 proteins by applying 10-fold cross-validation technique and 93.33% classi cation performance is obtained with SOM.

One of the reasons is the lack of an effective computational method to deal with the huge number of online reviews which are not embedded with explicit features for a spam detection system to separate the untruthful reviews (i.e., spam) from the legitimate ones (i.e., ham). To improve the hygiene and the usefulness of online comments, there is a pressing need to develop a robust methodology for an objective and systematic assessment of the quality of online comments. The main contribution of this paper is the design, development, and evaluation of a novel information theory based methodology for the assessment of the quality of online comments. Our preliminary experiments show that the proposed quality assessment methodology is more effective than other baseline methods such as a peer-review based quality assessment approach.

The class imbalance problem corresponds to situations where majority of cases belong to one class and a small minority belongs to the other, which in many cases is equally or even more important. To deal with this problem a number of approaches have been studied in the past.

To automate the analysis of such data, pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms can be applied. However, the curse of dimensionality is unavoidable: very few samples to train, and many attributes in each sample. As the predictive accuracy of supervised classifiers decays with irrelevant and redundant features, the necessity of a dimensionality reduction process is essential. In this paper, we propose a new methodology that is based on the application of Principal Component Analysis and other statistical tools to gain insight in the identification of relevant genes. We run the approaches using two benchmark datasets: Leukemia and Lymphoma. The results show that it is possible to reduce considerably the number of genes while increasing the performance of well known classifiers.

One of the most known models for this type of applications is the ACM-ACD model. This model focuses on modelling the underlying joint distribution of both duration and price changes between consecutive transactions. However this model imposes distributional assumptions and its number of parameters increases rapidly (producing a complex and slow adjustment process). Therefore, we propose using two machine learning models, that will work sequentially, based on the ACM-ACD model.

However, handling data and uncertainty in a statistically meaningful way is an open problem in formal modelling, severely hampering the usefulness of these elegant tools in many real world applications. Here we introduce ProPPA, a process algebra which incorporates uncertainty in the model description, allowing the use of Machine Learning techniques to incorporate observational information in the modelling. We define the semantics of the language by introducing a quantitative generalisation of Constraint Markov Chains. We present results from a prototype implementation of the language, demonstrating its usefulness in performing inference in a non-trivial example.

It is recognized that the big data challenge can only be adequately addressed when knowledge of various different fields such as data mining, machine learning algorithms, parallel processing, and data management practices are effectively combined. This paper thus describes some of the 'smart data analytics methods' that enable a high productivity data processing of large quantities of scientific data in order to enhance the data analysis efficiency. The paper thus aims to provide new insights how various fields can be successfully combined. Contributions of this paper include the concretization of the cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISPDM) process model in scientific environments using concrete machine learning algorithms (e.g. support vector machines that enable data classification) or data mining mechanisms (e.g. outlier detection in measurements). Serial and parallel approaches to specific data analysis challenges are discussed in the context of concrete earth science application data sets. Solutions also include various data visualizations that enable a better insight in the corresponding data analytics and analysis process.	[Riedel, M.; Memon, A. S.; Memon, M.

This data could be used for the final exam performance prediction so that the excellent as well as the students requiring help could be detected. The data on 302 students enrolled into the first year Physics course of a biomedical university study program in 2011/2012 have been used. The data were preprocessed by dividing Croatian grading system which comprises 5 grades (range 1-5; 1=fail, 5=excellent) into 2 categorical classes in one version of the experiment and into 3 categorical classes in the second version. Several up to date algorithms for classification were applied without and with attributes optimization by a genetic algorithm. Also, since students have 4 chances at 5 exam terms during an academic year, 3 different dependent variables were constructed. In order to evaluate the performance that each of the classification models had the following performance criteria were used: accuracy for all models and sensitivity and area under curve (AUC) for binary classifier systems.

Our approach is based on continual observation of the student's activities on the particular course during the semester. In order to achieve realistic modelling of the students' devotion to the given lectures and also the degree of how much the student has learned from the given lecture, we take into account both the e-Learning and the e-Assessment results through the semester. In our previous work we did an intelligent students' Profiling to classify the students into a pass, or, fail category. In this paper we go deeper into the problem, achieving more precise modelling according to which we will be able to determine the student's most likely final grade, using multi classification methodology. The advantage of our model is in its ability to take into account all the assessments during the semester, not relying only on the results from the last student's assessment. It can be a good indicator whether the teacher needs to perform additional testing of the student's knowledge in order to derive an overall conclusion on the most appropriate grade.

After a short introduction to the energy centre localization methods, a machine learning technique was applied to predict measurement errors and adjust non-linear variation for measurement accuracy improvement. An Optical Scanning System was enhanced by measurement at the optical signal energy centre and error adjustment by SVM algorithm.

Optical Scanning Systems provide position measurements for SHM task by a novel method based on automatic geodetic measurements. Precise measurement of plane spatial angles are performed in the optical energy signal centre by the optical signal function geometric centroid calculation, however these scanners usually have non-linear variations in their measurement, and normally these variations depend on the position of the light emitter on the structure under monitoring in relation to the scanner. In this paper, SVM Regression is proposed as a machine learning technique to predict measurement errors and to adjust this non-linear variation for measurement accuracy enhancement.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a critical component of such infrastructure defense mechanism. IDS monitors and analyzes networks' activities for potential intrusions and security attacks. Machine-learning (ML) models have been well accepted for signature-based IDSs due to their learnability and flexibility. However, the performance of existing IDSs does not seem to be satisfactory due to the rapid evolution of sophisticated cyber threats in recent decades. Moreover, the volumes of data to be analyzed are beyond the ability of commonly used computer software and hardware tools. They are not only large in scale but fast in/out in terms of velocity. In big data IDS, the one must find an efficient way to reduce the size of data dimensions and volumes. In this paper, we propose novel feature selection methods, namely, RF-FSR (RandomForest-Forward Selection Ranking) and RF-BER (RandomForest-Backward Elimination Ranking). The features selected by the proposed methods were tested and compared with three of the most well-known feature sets in the IDS literature. The experimental results showed that the selected features by the proposed methods effectively improved their detection rate and false-positive rate, achieving 99.8% and 0.001% on well-known KDD-99 dataset, respectively.

Visibility that, in turns, can have a monetary value, since social media popular people usually either anticipate or establish trends that could impact the real world (at least, from a consumer point of view). The above rationale has fostered the flourishing of private companies providing statistical results for social media analysis. These results have been accepted, and largely diffused, by media without any apparent scrutiny, while Academia has moderately focused its attention on this phenomenon. In this paper, we provide evidence that analytic results provided by field-flagship companies are questionable (at least). In particular, we focus on Twitter and its "fake followers". We survey popular Twitter analytics that count the fake followers of some target account. We perform a series of experiments aimed at verifying the trustworthiness of their results. We compare the results of such tools with a machine-learning classifier whose methodology bases on scientific basis and on a sound sampling scheme. The findings of this work call for a serious re-thinking of the methodology currently used by companies providing analytic results, whose present deliveries seem to lack on any reliability.

Among these applications, the permuted Walsh-Hadamard matrices are frequently chosen for modeling real-world measurements that are limited to binary entry states by special structure (one typical example is the digital mirror device in single-pixel cameras) because the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform can efficiently calculate its multiplications; however, for a large-scale problem, the Walsh-Hadamard matrix would become unacceptably large to be stored in advance. To eliminate this defect, this paper proposes a maximum length sequence encoded Hadamard measurement paradigm that can be simply realized on chip without any usage of external memory, and proves this method can degenerate to a special permutation of the sequence ordered Walsh-Hadamard matrix so that the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform keeps feasible. Simulations show that compared with the conventional permuted Walsh-Hadamard matrix, the proposed one can emerge from the limit of external memory without losing much randomness performance in the measurement basis required by compressed sensing.

Most studies focus on large biopolymers such as DNA, RNA and Proteins but small metabolic molecules have received significantly less attention. In addition, studies have focused only on the analysis of classification performance of the biomarkers selected by various feature selection methods but do not consider possible temporal relationship among feature subsets. In this paper, we propose a two-stage bio-network discovery approach for ovarian cancer metabolites. At the first stage, feature selection is carried out using four different selection methods. The best features are selected based on overall best classification performance. At the second stage, Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) is used to model the temporal relationship among the stratified features. The results show that 39 features out of a total of 592 metabolomics features selected by the Least Angle Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) feature selection method yielded the highest predictive accuracy of 93%. Two DBN methods are then used to model the temporal relationships among the 39 features. The results show consistently significant relationships between the cancer biomarkers at features 219 and 225, and between features 543 and 219 across time points. Among these metabolites, around 20 metabolic chemical compounds have been identified, which could be regarded as potential biomarkers associated with ovarian cancer.

The prognosis of its recurrence, after a first treatment, is very important to increase the survival rate of a patient. This work shows the application of the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) method to prognosis breast cancer and also proposes a method to select a good setting with the parameters that can be changed when using this classification method. Using our method with the Wisconsin's breast cancer prognosis data, the kNN method has an average accuracy of 76 %, a small standard deviation, and a small difference between its maximum and minimum values.

Machine learning for the prediction of antibacterial susceptibility in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	2014 IEEE-EMBS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS (BHI)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI)	JUN 01-04, 2014	Valencia, SPAIN	IEEE, EMBS				The prevalence of antibiotic resistance in pathogens is far outpacing our ability to develop new antibiotics. This necessitates the development of diagnostic tests that can determine bacterial susceptibility. For Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), this is particularly urgent given that current methods for testing susceptibility take up to two months. The decreasing cost and time required for whole genome sequencing (WGS) offers the possibility of using genome-wide mutational patterns in bacterial DNA to determine drug susceptibility. However, the computational framework for taking advantage of this data has not yet been developed. This paper describes a machine-learning approach for predicting bacterial susceptibility from genomic data. The presence or absence of over 500 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in a dataset of 652 bacterial isolates from the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust and elsewhere in the UK were used as features for a number of classification algorithms. Susceptibility and resistance were defined based upon phenotypic growth patterns, and the results from the proposed machine learning method were compared to predictions based upon the presence of a set of known resistance-conferring mutations. Misclassified isolates were also examined for commonalities, revealing eleven potentially new resistance-conferring mutations. The prediction of drug susceptibility using the proposed approach was very promising. Classification accuracy of 93% was obtained for predicting resistance to isoniazid, a key first-line antibiotic drug for MTB. The proposed method was capable of particularly high sensitivity, ranging between 95-100% across the four drugs examined. There is great potential to further develop this framework to find new resistance-conferring mutations.

KC is a non-inflamatory, progressive thinning disorder of the cornea, resulting in a protusion, myopia and irregular astigmatism. The intracorneal ring implantation surgery has become a suitable technique to deal with keratoconus without the need of a corneal transplant. Two machine learning (ML) classifiers based on artificial neural network and a decision tree were used in this work. Artificial neural networks performed better than decision trees, achieving an absolute mean error lower than 2 diopters in a validation data set. An analysis of the most relevant features was also carried out.	[Valdes-Mas, M.

These systems work on the principle of imaging and analysis of cytology features in general and nuclear features in particular. Thus accurate localization and segmentation of the nuclei is crucial for the systems. Though several methods have been conceptualized, developed and employed to achieve the tasks of localization and segmentation of nuclei in cytology images, most fail to localize nuclei with opened up chromatin. This paper presents a machine learning approach based framework for accurate localization and segmentation of nuclei. The approach uses the random forest model to learn complete scale-space representation of the nuclear chromatin distribution in green and color saturation channels. Based on the multi scale features of an unknown image this model can predict an image such that gray level value of a pixel is proportionate to the probability that the pixel belongs to nuclear region. This predicted image then can be used for accurate localization and segmentation of the nuclei by random walks approach. Accuracy of the system has been tested on a publicly available dataset images and was found to be approximately 97%.	[Karri, S. P.

In this study, we present a simple semantic kernel for Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm. This kernel uses higher-order relations between terms in order to incorporate semantic information into the SVM. This is an easy to implement algorithm which forms a basis for future improvements.

In the majority of fall events external support is imperative in order to avoid major consequences. Therefore, the ability to automatically detect these fall events could help reducing the response time and significantly improve the prognosis of fall victims. This paper presents a unobtrusive smartphone based fall detection system that uses a combination of information derived from machine learning classification applied in a state machine algorithm. The data from the smartphone built-in accelerometer is continuously screened when the phone is in the user's belt or pocket. Upon the detection of a fall event, the user location is tracked and SMS and email notifications are sent to a set of contacts. The accuracy of the fall detection algorithm here proposed is near 97.5% for both the pocket and belt usage. In conclusion, the proposed solution can reliably detect fall events without disturbing the users with excessive false alarms, presenting also the advantage of not changing the user's routines, since no additional external sensors are required.

Feature selection plays an important role in activity recognition, data mining, and machine learning. In selecting subset of features, an efficient evolutionary algorithm Differential Evolution (DE), a very efficient optimizer, is used for finding informative features from eye movements using electrooculography (EOG). Many researchers use EOG signals in human-computer interactions with various computational intelligence methods to analyze eye movements. The proposed system involves analysis of EOG signals using clearness based features, minimum redundancy maximum relevance features, and Differential Evolution based features. This work concentrates more on the feature selection algorithm based on DE in order to improve the classification for faultless activity recognition.

It is a crucial property in estimating a compound's long-term impact on the environment. The ability to reliably predict biodegradability would reduce the need for laborious experimental testing. However, this endpoint is difficult to model due to unavailability or inconsistency of experimental data. Our approach makes use of the Online Chemical Modeling Environment (OCHEM) and its rich supply of machine learning methods and descriptor sets to build classification models for ready biodegradability. These models were analyzed to determine the relationship between characteristic structural properties and biodegradation activity. The distinguishing feature of the developed models is their ability to estimate the accuracy of prediction for each individual compound. The models developed using seven individual descriptor sets were combined in a consensus model, which provided the highest accuracy. The identified overrepresented structural fragments can be used by chemists to improve the biodegradability of new chemical compounds. The consensus model, the datasets used, and the calculated structural fragments are publicly available at http://ochem.eu/article/31660.

Rough set theory has been used as such a tool with much success. The main objective of this paper is to propose a feature selection procedure based on a special group of probabilistic rough set models, called confirmation-theoretic rough set model(CTRS). Different from the existing attribute reduction methods, the definition of positive features is based on Bayesian confirmation measures. The proposed method is further divided into two categories based on the qualitative and quantitative nature of the underlying rough set models. This study provides new insights into the problem of attribute reduction.

M. Freund, Math. Programming, 38 (1987), pp. 47-67], seeks the element of a convex set that is minimal with respect to a gauge function. This conceptually simple problem can be used to model a remarkable array of useful problems, including a special case of conic optimization, and related problems that arise in machine learning and signal processing. The gauge structure of these problems allows for a special kind of duality framework. This paper explores the duality framework proposed by Freund, and proposes a particular form of the problem that exposes some useful properties of the gauge optimization framework (such as the variational properties of its value function), and yet maintains most of the generality of the abstract form of gauge optimization.

J	Xiao, L; Zhang, T				Xiao, Lin; Zhang, Tong			PROXIMAL STOCHASTIC GRADIENT METHOD WITH PROGRESSIVE VARIANCE REDUCTION	SIAM JOURNAL ON OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						stochastic gradient method; proximal mapping; variance reduction	SIZE	We consider the problem of minimizing the sum of two convex functions: one is the average of a large number of smooth component functions, and the other is a general convex function that admits a simple proximal mapping. We assume the whole objective function is strongly convex. Such problems often arise in machine learning, known as regularized empirical risk minimization. We propose and analyze a new proximal stochastic gradient method, which uses a multistage scheme to progressively reduce the variance of the stochastic gradient. While each iteration of this algorithm has similar cost as the classical stochastic gradient method (or incremental gradient method), we show that the expected objective value converges to the optimum at a geometric rate. The overall complexity of this method is much lower than both the proximal full gradient method and the standard proximal stochastic gradient method.

Requirements engineering researchers seek innovative, effective means of addressing these problems. One powerful tool that can be added to the researcher toolkit is that of machine learning. Some researchers have been experimenting with their own implementations of machine learning algorithms or with those available as part of the Weka machine learning software suite. There are some shortcomings to using "one off" solutions. It is the position of the authors that many problems exist in requirements engineering that can be supported by Weka's machine learning algorithms, specifically by classification trees. Further, the authors posit that adoption will be boosted if machine learning is easy to use and is integrated into requirements research tools, such as TraceLab. Toward that end, an initial concept validation of a component in TraceLab is presented that applies the Weka classification trees. The component is demonstrated on two different requirements engineering problems. Finally, insights gained on using the TraceLab Weka component on these two problems are offered.

In our recent outdoor deployment, we observe that some bottleneck nodes can greatly determine other nodes' data collection ratio, and thus affect the whole network performance. To figure out the importance of a node in data collection, the manager needs to understand the interactive behaviors among the parent and child nodes. To address this issue, we present a management tool BOND (BOttleneck Node Detector). We introduce the concept of Node Dependence to characterize how much a node relies on each of its parent nodes. BOND models the routing process as a Hidden Markov Model, and uses a machine learning approach to learn the state transition probabilities in this model based on the observed traces. BOND utilizes Node Dependence to explore the hidden bottleneck nodes in the network. Moreover, we can predict how adding or removing the sensor nodes would impact the data flow, thus avoid data loss and flow congestion in redeployment. We implement our tool on real hardware and deploy it in an outdoor system. Our extensive experiments show that BOND infers the Node Dependence with an average accuracy of more than 85%.

In this paper we present an analog/digital Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) circuit that changes its internal state in a continuous analog way on short biologically plausible time scales and drives its weight to one of two possible bi-stable states on long time scales. We highlight the differences and improvements over previously proposed circuits and demonstrate the performance of the new circuit using data measured from a chip fabricated using a standard 180nm CMOS process. Finally we discuss the use of stochastic learning methods that can best exploit the properties of this circuit for implementing robust machine-learning algorithms.

The FFBs were scanned using a hyperspectral device, and reflectance was recorded at different wavelengths. A total of 469 fruits from oil palm FFBs (nigrescens, virescens, oleifera) were categorized as overripe, ripe, and underripe. Fruit attributes in the visible and near-infrared (400 nm to1000 nm) wavelength range regions were measured. Artificial neural network (ANN), classified the different wavelength regions on oil palm fruit through pixel-wise processing. The developed ANN model successfully classified oil palm fruits into the three ripeness categories (ripe, underripe, and overripe). The accuracy achieved by our approach was compared against that of the conventional system employing manual classification based on the observations of a human grader. Our classification approach had an accuracy of more than 95% for all three types of oil palm fruits. The research findings will help increase the quality harvesting and grading efficiency of FFBs.

It distinguishes itself from the conventional clustering method in four aspects. First, it can deal with uncertain values of attributes by defining possibility degrees. Then, it handles uncertainty when an object belongs to several clusters using possibilistic membership degrees. It also determines boundary regions through the computing of the approximation sets based on the rough set theory. Finally, it accommodates gradual changes in datasets where there is a decrease in the cluster number. Such a dynamically changing dataset can be seen in numerous real-world situations such as changing behaviour of customers, or popularity of products or when there is, for example, an extinction of some species or diseases. For experiments, we use UCI machine learning repository datasets with different evaluation criteria. Results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to different versions of k-modes method.

Identifying, detecting and adapting learning algorithms to non-stationary environments is a fundamental task in many data mining scenarios; however it is often a major challenge for current methodologies. Data analysis in the context of time-varying statistical moments is a very active research direction in machine learning and in computational statistics; but theoretical insights into latent causes of non-stationarity in empirical data are very scarce. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of the trajectory classification error statistic in order to detect a significant variation in the underlying dynamics of data collected in multiple stages. We analysed qualitatively the conditions leading to observable changes in non-stationary data generated by Duffing nonlinear oscillators; which are ubiquitous models of complex classification problems. Analyses are further benchmarked in a dataset consisting of atmospheric pollutants time series.

The LAD framework consists of the following four steps: data binarization, support set generation, pattern generation, and theory formulation. Patterns that contain the hidden structural information calculated from the binarized training data play the most important roles in the theory, which consists of a weighted linear combination of patterns and works as a classifier of new observations. In this work, we develop an efficient parameterized iterative genetic algorithm (PI-GA) to generate a set of patterns with good characteristics in terms of degree (simplicity-wise preference) and coverage (evidential preference) of patterns. The proposed PI-GA can generate simplicity-wise preferred patterns that also have high coverage. We also show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method through a numerical experiment using benchmark machine learning datasets.

The spectral reflectance of different dry grass- and heathland vegetation communities was measured with field spectrometers (350 nm - 2500 nm) in August 2009. Additionally, hyperspectral imagery was acquired by the airborne scanner aisaEAGLE (390 nm - 970 nm). The developed normalization technique was proven to be a suitable method to make image and field spectra comparable for classification. A support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifier trained with normalized field spectra were applied to normalized image data to classify thy grass- and heathland communities in different levels of detail. SVM (overall accuracy (OAA) 89.13%) provided significantly better classification results compared to RF (OAA 71.74%) in the second level of detail. Consequently, only SVM was used for classification in the highest level of detail (third level), which also led to high classification accuracy (OAA 77.27%). The results indicate the potential of the developed approach classifying airborne hyperspectral image data with field spectral measurements for the spatial assessment and separation of dry grass- and heathland communities.

Originally, rough set theory is dealing with the concept approximation problem under uncertainty. The basic idea of RS is related to lower and upper approximations, and it can be applied in classification problem. At the first sight RS and SVM offer different approaches to classification problem. Most RS methods are based on minimal decision rules, while SVM converts the linear classifiers into instance based classifiers. This paper presents a comparison analysis between these areas and shows that, despite differences, there are quite many analogies in the two approaches. We will show that some rough set classifiers are in fact the SVM with Boolean kernel and propose some hybrid methods that combine the advantages of those two great machine learning approaches.

Browserbite is a tool for cross-browser testing based on comparison of screenshots with the aim of identifying differences that a user may perceive as incompatibilities. Browserbite is based on segmentation and image comparison techniques adapted from the field of computer vision. The key idea is to first extract web page regions via segmentation and then to match and compare these regions pairwise based on geometry and pixel density distribution. Additional accuracy is achieved by post-processing the output of the region comparison step via supervised machine learning techniques. In this way, compatibility checking is performed based purely on screenshots rather than relying on the Document Object Model (DOM), an alternative that often leads to missed incompatibilities. Detected incompatibilities in Browserbite are overlaid on top of screenshots in order to assist users during cross-browser testing.

This emphasises the need for developing machine learning algorithms that are able to tackle both the high-dimensionality and the complex structure of the data. Our work in this paper, focuses on extending a feature ranking algorithm that can be used as a filter method for a specific type of structured data. More specifically, we adapt the RReliefF algorithm for regression, for the task of hierarchical multi-label classification (HMC). We evaluate this algorithm experimentally in a filter-like setting by employing ensembles of predictive clustering trees for HMC as a classifier. In the experimental evaluation, we consider datasets from two prominent domains for HMC - functional genomics and image annotation. The results show that HMC-ReliefF can identify the relevant features present in the data and produces a ranking where they are placed among the top ranked ones.

Machine learning techniques are often used to predict the non-linear wind evolution. In this context, this paper proposes a short term wind data prediction model based on support vector machines in their regression mode, which have the advantage of being simple, fast and well adapted for the short term. This research tries also to prove how wind direction may influence power generation, and why it is important to predict it. A real data set of wind speed and direction historical values is used, from Sidi Daoud wind farm, north-eastern Tunisia, in order to evaluate the proposed model. This forecasting system predicts wind speed and direction for the short term, from one to 10 hours in advance, using a set of past samples.

When the data come from a Gaussian distribution, the MD uses the covariance matrix to evaluate the distance between a data point and the distribution mean. In this paper, we generalize the MD for general unimodal distributions, introducing a particular class of Mercer kernel, the density kernel, based on the underlying data density. Density kernels induce distances that generalize the MD and that are useful when data do not fit to the Gaussian distribution. We study the theoretical properties of the proposed distance and show its performance on a variety of artificial and real data analysis problems.

A sensor configuration is considered optimal when it is able to predict the product quality (dimension, warpage, etc.) with a good accuracy (from experimental data provided by these sensors). Initially, plastic engineers integrated sensors in moulds to acquire knowledge about their processes and to have better understanding of physical phenomenon. This article presents a numerical methodology to identify optimal combinations of sensors. The methodology is firstly based on polymer injection molding simulation to collect virtual sensor data. In a second step, virtual sensor data are analyzed by modern data-driven modeling techniques to identify optimal sensor configurations.

An accurate segmentation of the coronary arteries, an essential ingredient for blood flow modeling methods, is currently attained by a combination of automated algorithms with human review and editing. However, not all portions of the coronary artery tree affect blood flow and pressure equally, and it is of significant importance to direct human review and editing towards regions that will most affect the subsequent simulations. We present a data-driven approach for real-time estimation of sensitivity of blood-flow simulations to uncertainty in lumen segmentation. A machine learning method is used to map patient-specific features to a sensitivity value, using a large database of patients with precomputed sensitivities. We validate the results of the machine learning algorithm using direct 3D blood flow simulations and demonstrate that the algorithm can predict sensitivities in real time with only a small reduction in accuracy as compared to the 3D solutions. This approach can also be applied to other medical applications where physiologic simulations are performed using patient-specific models created from image data.

One of the bottlenecks so far, however, has been the availability of training data, typically generated by medical experts with very limited resources. Crowdsourcing is a new trend that is based on outsourcing cognitive tasks to many anonymous untrained individuals from an online community. In this work, we investigate the potential of crowdsourcing for segmenting medical instruments in endoscopic image data. Our study suggests that (1) segmentations computed from annotations of multiple anonymous non-experts are comparable to those made by medical experts and (2) training data generated by the crowd is of the same quality as that annotated by medical experts. Given the speed of annotation, scalability and low costs, this implies that the scientific community might no longer need to rely on experts to generate reference or training data for certain applications. To trigger further research in endoscopic image processing, the data used in this study will be made publicly available.

To further our understanding of complex MS pathology, we aim to build a statistical model of brain images that can automatically discover spatial patterns of variability in brain morphology and lesion distribution. We propose building such a model using a deep belief network (DBN), a layered network whose parameters can be learned from training images. In contrast to other manifold learning algorithms, the DBN approach does not require a prebuilt proximity graph, which is particularly advantageous for modeling lesions, because their sparse and random nature makes defining a suitable distance measure between lesion images challenging. Our model consists of a morphology DBN, a lesion DBN, and a joint DBN that models concurring morphological and lesion patterns. Our results show that this model can automatically discover the classic patterns of MS pathology, as well as more subtle ones, and that the parameters computed have strong relationships to MS clinical scores.

Recently several authors investigated how clinical trials for AD can be made more efficient (i.e., smaller sample size) using predictive measures from such classification methods. In this paper, we explain why predictive measures given by such SVM type objectives may be less than ideal for use in the setting described above. We give a solution based on a novel deep learning model, randomized denoising autoencoders (rDA), which regresses on training labels y while also accounting for the variance, a property which is very useful for clinical trial design. Our results give strong improvements in sample size estimates over strategies based on multi-kernel learning. Also, rDA predictions appear to more accurately correlate to stages of disease. Separately, our formulation empirically shows how deep architectures can be applied in the large d, small n regime - the default situation in medical imaging. This result is of independent interest.

Intracardiac echocardiograpy (ICE) is an emerging modality with the promise of removing sedation or general anesthesia associated with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). We introduce a novel 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) pose estimation approach for catheters (equipped with radiopaque ball markers) in single X-Ray fluoroscopy projection and investigate the method's application to a prototype ICE catheter. Machine learning based catheter detection is implemented in a Bayesian hypothesis fusion framework, followed by refinement of ball marker locations through template matching. Marker correspondence and 3D pose estimation are solved through iterative optimization. The method registers the ICE volume to the C-arm coordinate system. Experiments are performed on synthetic and porcine in-vivo data. Target registration error (TRE), defined in the echo cone, is the basis of our preliminary evaluation. The method reached 8.06 +/- 7.2 mm TRE on 703 cases. Potential uses of our hybrid system include structural heart disease interventions and electrophysiologycal mapping or catheter ablation procedures.

Spatial Modeling of Multiple Sclerosis for Disease Subtype Prediction	MEDICAL IMAGE COMPUTING AND COMPUTER-ASSISTED INTERVENTION - MICCAI 2014, PT II	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	17th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI)	SEP 14-18, 2014	Boston, MA	Harvard Med Sch	Massachusetts Inst Technol		BINARY	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and managing of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Currently, the assessment of MS is based on a combination of clinical scores and subjective rating of lesion images by clinicians. In this work we present an objective 5-way classification of MS disease subtype as well as a comparison between three different approaches. First we propose two spatially informed models, a Bayesian Spatial Generalized Linear Mixed Model (BSGLMM) and a Log Gaussian Cox Process (LGCP). The BSGLMM accounts for the binary nature of lesion maps and the spatial dependence between neighboring voxels, and the LGCP accounts for the random spatial variation in lesion location. Both improve upon mass univariate analyses that ignore spatial dependence and rely on some level of arbitrarily defined smoothing of the data. As a comparison, we consider a machine learning approach based on multi-class support vector machine (SVM). For the SVM classification scheme, unlike previous work, we use a large number of quantitative features derived from three MRI sequences in addition to traditional demographic and clinical measures. We show that the spatial models outperform standard approaches with average prediction accuracies of up to 85%.

Implementing the vision of the Semantic Web thus requires transforming this unstructured data into structured data. One key step during this process is the recognition of named entities. Previous works suggest that ensemble learning can be used to improve the performance of named entity recognition tools. However, no comparison of the performance of existing supervised machine learning approaches on this task has been presented so far. We address this research gap by presenting a thorough evaluation of named entity recognition based on ensemble learning. To this end, we combine four different state-of-the approaches by using 15 different algorithms for ensemble learning and evaluate their performace on five different datasets. Our results suggest that ensemble learning can reduce the error rate of state-of-the-art named entity recognition systems by 40%, thereby leading to over 95% f-score in our best run.

Due to the time consuming and tedious nature of manual classification and indexing, there is a need for better methods to automate this process. This thesis proposes an approach which leverages encyclopedic background knowledge for enriching domain-specific ontologies with textual and structural information about the semantic vicinity of the ontologies' concepts. The proposed approach aims to exploit this information for improving both ontology-based methods for classifying and indexing documents and methods based on supervised machine learning.

The method uses the Plain HDMR philosophy in partitioning the given multivariate data set into less variate data sets and then constructing an analytical structure through these partitioned data sets to represent the given multidimensional problem. Indexing HDMR makes HDMR be applicable to classification problems having real world data. Mostly, we do not know all possible class values in the domain of the given problem, that is, we have a non-orthogonal data structure. However, Plain HDMR needs an orthogonal data structure in the given problem to be modelled. In this sense, the main idea of this work is to offer various forms of Indexing HDMR to successfully model these real life classification problems. To test these different forms, several well-known multivariate classification problems given in UCI Machine Learning Repository were used and it was observed that the accuracy results lie between 80% and 95% which are very satisfactory.

The precise forecasting of ticket sales in OTA companies is beneficial to budget control and service quality. The paper develops an integrated forecasting model by combining the internal factors immediately influencing the ticket sales and the external factors reflecting the ticket sales market. The internal factors are selected such as the number of calling in certain duration, while the external factors include the attention of relevant search engine query data. After several key features are extracted using feature selection model, the machine learning algorithms can get the more accurate prediction, in contract to the basic experiments to explore the inherent rule of the sales data itself. Our proposed user behavior-based prediction model provides a feasible and efficiency tool for ticket sales prediction.

The social tools provided by the content sharing applications allow online users to interact, to express their opinions and to read opinions from other users. However, spammers provide comments which are written intentionally to mislead users by redirecting them to web sites to increase their rating and to promote products less known on the market. Reading spam comments is a bad experience and a waste of time for most of the online users but can also be harming and cause damage to the reader. Research has been performed in this domain in order to identify and eliminate spam comments. Our goal is to detect comments which are likely to represent spam considering some indicators: a discontinuous text flow, inadequate and vulgar language or not related to a specific context. Our approach relies on machine learning algorithms and topic detection.

In this work, some models to predict three relevant physical attributes of rubber blends - modulus at 100% deformation, Shore A hardness, and tensile strength - are built by machine learning methods and subsequently evaluated. Linear regression, artificial neural networks, support vector machine, and regression trees are used to generate the models. The number of used samples and the values for the input variables is determined by a Taguchi design of experiments, and prior to the modeling the uncertainty of the experimental data was analyzed.

Consequently, it is important to develop sophisticated and robust fraud detection techniques that can recognize the subtle differences between fraudulent and legitimate transactions. Current fraud detection techniques mainly operate at the transaction level or account level. However, neither strategy is foolproof against fraud, leaving room for alternative techniques and improvements to existing techniques. Transaction-level approaches typically involve the analysis and aggregation of previous transaction data to detect credit card fraud. However, these approaches usually consider all the transaction attributes to be equally important. The conditional weighted transaction aggregation technique described in this paper addresses this issue by leveraging supervised machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions. Empirical comparisons with existing transaction level methods and other transaction aggregation based methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.									9	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	1868-4238		978-3-662-44951-6	IFIP ADV INF COMM TE			2014	433						3	16				14	Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BB8ZT	WOS:000347890700001

Invadopodia are specifically identified by microscopy as proteolytic invasive protrusions containing TKS5 and cortactin. The increasing complexity in models for the study of invadopodia, including engineered 3D environments, explants, or animal models in vivo, entails a higher level of microenvironment complexity as well as cancer cell heterogeneity. Such experimental setups are rich in information and offer the possibility of contextualizing invadopodia and other motility-related structures. That is, they hold the promise of revealing more realistic microenvironmental conditions under which the invadopodium assembles and functions or in which tumor cells switch to a different cellular phenotype (focal adhesion, lamellipodia, proliferation, and apoptosis). For such an effort, we need a systemic approach to microscopy, which will integrate information from multiple modalities. While the individual technologies needed to achieve this are mostly available, data integration and standardization is not a trivial process. In a systems microscopy approach, microscopy is used to extract information on cell phenotypes and the microenvironment while -omics technologies assess profiles of cancer cell and microenvironment genetic, transcription, translation, and protein makeups. Data are classified and linked via in silico modeling (including statistical and mathematical models and bioinformatics). Computational considerations create predictions to be validated experimentally by perturbing the system through use of genetic manipulations and molecular biology. With such a holistic approach, a deeper understanding of function of invadopodia in vivo will be reached, opening the potential for personalized diagnostics and therapies.

The training and test data sets consist of images with labeled pixels of the joint region. Feature descriptors based on a pixel's neighborhood, are selected among SURF, SIFT, FAST, ORB, BRISK, FREAK descriptors, and their mixtures, to define the feature vectors for a trainable pixel classifier. Multiple pixel classifiers, including k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and decision tree classifier, are constructed by supervised learning. The AUC measure computed from ROC curves is used as the performance criterion for evaluation. The measure is used to compare and select the best mixture of image descriptors, forming a feature vector for the classifier, the best classifier and the best chain of image preprocessing operations.

J	Dave, K; Varma, V				Dave, Kushal; Varma, Vasudeva			Computational Advertising: Techniques for Targeting Relevant Ads	FOUNDATIONS AND TRENDS IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Article								Computational Advertising, popularly known as online advertising or Web advertising, refers to finding the most relevant ads matching a particular context on the Web. The context depends on the type of advertising and could mean - content where the ad is shown, the user who is viewing the ad or the social network of the user. Computational Advertising (CA) is a scientific sub-discipline at the intersection of information retrieval, statistical modeling, machine learning, optimization, large scale search and text analysis. The core problem addressed in Computational Advertising is of match-making between the ads and the context. CA is prevalent in three major forms on the Web. One of the forms involves showing textual ads relevant to a query on the search page, known as Sponsored Search. On the other hand, showing textual ads relevant to a third party webpage content is known as Contextual Advertising. The third form of advertising also deals with the placement of ads on third party webpages, but the ads in this form are rich multimedia ads - image, video, audio, flash. The business model with rich media ads is slightly different from the ones with textual ads. These ads are also called banner ads, and this form of advertising is known as Display Advertising. Both Sponsored Search and Contextual Advertising involve retrieving relevant ads for different types of content (query and Web page). As ads are short and are mainly written to attract the user, retrieval of ads pose challenges like vocabulary mismatch between the query/content and the ad. Also, as the user's probability of examining an ad decreases with the position of the ad in the ranked list, it is imperative to keep the best ads at the top positions. Display Advertising poses several challenges including modeling user behaviour and noisy page content and bid optimization on the advertiser's side. Additionally, online advertising faces challenges like false bidding, click spam and ad spam. These challenges are prevalent in all forms of advertising. There has been a lot of research work published in different areas of CA in the last one and a half decade. The focus of this survey is to discuss the problems and solutions pertaining to the information retrieval, machine learning and statistics domain of CA. This survey covers techniques and approaches that deal with several issues mentioned above. Research in Computational Advertising has evolved over time and currently continues both in traditional areas (vocabulary mismatch, query rewriting, click prediction) and recently identified areas (user targeting, mobile advertising, social advertising). In this study, we predominantly focus on the problems and solutions proposed in traditional areas in detail and briefly cover the emerging areas in the latter half of the survey. To facilitate future research, a discussion of available resources, list of public benchmark datasets and future directions of work is also provided in the end.

Lamb wave response of thin aluminium plate with or without damage is simulated using finite element. Simulations are carried out at different frequencies for various kinds of damage. The procedure is divided into two parts - signal processing and machine learning. Firstly, MP is used for denoising and to maintain the sparsity of the dataset. In this study, MP is extended by using a combination of time-frequency functions as the dictionary and is deployed in two stages. Selection of a particular type of atoms lead to extraction of important features while maintaining the sparsity of the waveform. The resultant waveform is then passed as input data for SVM classifier. SVM is used to detect the location of the potential damage from the reduced data. The study demonstrates that SVM is a robust classifier in presence of noise and more efficient as compared to Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Out-of-sample data is used for the validation of the trained and tested classifier. Trained classifiers are found successful in detection of the damage with more than 95% detection rate.

Specifically, it addresses the implementation and experimental validation aspects of a salient feature extraction methodology that was recently proposed for laser-based diagnostics and leverages the wavefield spatial reconstruction capability offered by scanning laser vibrometers. The methodology consists of two steps. The first is a spatiotemporal windowing strategy designed to partition the structural domain in small sub-domains and replicate impinging wave conditions at each location. The second is the construction of a low-rank-plus-outlier model of the regional data set using principal component analysis. Regions are labeled salient when their behavior does not belong to a common low-dimensional subspace that successfully describes the typical behavior of the anomaly-free portion of the surrounding medium. The most attractive feature of this method is that it requires virtually no knowledge of the structural and material properties of the medium. This property makes it a powerful diagnostic tool for the inspection of media with pronounced heterogeneity or with unknown or unreliable material property distributions, e.g., as a result of severe material degradation over large portions of their domain.

Robust evaluation of time series classification algorithms for structural health monitoring	HEALTH MONITORING OF STRUCTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS 2014	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Health Monitoring of Structural and Biological Systems	MAR 10-13, 2014	San Diego, CA	SPIE, Amer Soc Mech Engineers		Structural health monitoring; time series classification; feature extraction; info-gap decision theory; robustness	RELIABILITY	Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems provide real-time damage and performance information for civil, aerospace, and mechanical infrastructure through analysis of structural response measurements. The supervised learning methodology for data-driven SHM involves computation of low-dimensional, damage-sensitive features from raw measurement data that are then used in conjunction with machine learning algorithms to detect, classify, and quantify damage states. However, these systems often suffer from performance degradation in real-world applications due to varying operational and environmental conditions. Probabilistic approaches to robust SHM system design suffer from incomplete knowledge of all conditions a system will experience over its lifetime. Info-gap decision theory enables non-probabilistic evaluation of the robustness of competing models and systems in a variety of decision making applications. Previous work employed info-gap models to handle feature uncertainty when selecting various components of a supervised learning system, namely features from a pre-selected family and classifiers. In this work, the info-gap framework is extended to robust feature design and classifier selection for general time series classification through an efficient, interval arithmetic implementation of an info-gap data model. Experimental results are presented for a damage type classification problem on a ball bearing in a rotating machine. The info-gap framework in conjunction with an evolutionary feature design system allows for fully automated design of a time series classifier to meet performance requirements under maximum allowable uncertainty.

The aim of the study was to obtain the pattern of percentage impervious surface coverage, valid for the period of 2009-2010. Imperviousness index map generation was a two-stage procedure. The first step was classification, which divided the study area into categories: i) completely permeable (imperviousness index less than 1%) and ii) fully or partially impervious areas. For pixels classified as impervious, the percentage of impervious surface coverage in pixel area was estimated. The root mean square errors (RMS) of determination of the percentage of the impervious surfaces within a single pixel were 11.0% for C.5.0/Cubist method, 11.3% for Random Forest method and 12.6% using artificial neural networks. The introduction of the initial hard classification into completely permeable areas (with imperviousness index <1%) and impervious areas, allowed to improve the accuracy of imperviousness index estimation on poorly urbanized areas covering large areas of the Dobczyce Reservoir catchment. The effect is also visible on final imperviousness index maps.

An ensemble consists of a set of independently trained classifiers whose predictions are combined when classifying novel instances. Previous research has shown that an ensemble as a whole is often more accurate than any of the single classifiers in the ensemble. In this paper we use applied technology to built an ensemble using a voting methodology of Boosting-BAN and Boosting-MultiTAN ensembles with 10 sub-classifiers in each one. We performed a comparison with Boosting-BAN and Boosting-MultiTAN ensembles with 25 sub-classifiers on standard benchmark datasets and the proposed technique was the most accurate. These results argue that boosting algorithms deserve more attention in machine learning and data mining communities.

The higher the phi number, the greater the likelihood for needed attention in the visual examination. The method developed for the phi estimation extracts a connected component with image properties that are similar to those of a typical tooth fracture. That is, in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images, a fracture appears as a dark canyon inside the tooth. In order to start the visual examination process, the method provides a plane across the geometric center of the suspicious fracture component, which maximizes the number of pixels from that component inside the plane. During visual examination, the user (doctor) can change plane orientations and locations, by manipulating the mouse toward different graphical elements that represent the plane on a 3-D rendition of the tooth, while the corresponding image of the plane is shown at its side. The visual examination aims at confirming or disproving the fracture-detection event. We have designed and implemented these algorithms using the image-foresting transform methodology.

The approach of ELM is characterized by a unified formulation for regression, binary, and multiclass classification problems, and the related solution is given in an analytical compact form. In order to address the selection issue that is associated with the ELM, we have developed an automatic method to solve the model selection issue that is associated with this classifier based on the jDE optimization. The self-adaptive control mechanism is used to change control parameters, i.e. select weighting factor F and crossover constant CR, during the run.

One of the widespread countermeasures against these attacks is the masking approach. In 2012, Nassar et al. [21] presented a new lightweight (low-cost) Boolean masking countermeasure to protect the implementation of the AES block-cipher. This masking scheme represents the target algorithm of the DPAContest V4 [30]. In this article, we present the first machine learning attack against a masking countermeasure, using the dataset of the DPAContest V4. We succeeded to extract each targeted byte of the key of the masked AES with 26 traces during the attacking phase. This number of traces represents roughly twice the number of traces needed compared to an unmasked AES on the same cryptographic device. Finally, we compared our proposal to a stochastic attack and to a strategy based on template attack. We showed that an attack based on a machine learning model reduces the number of traces required during the attacking step with a factor two and four compared respectively to template attack and to stochastic attack when analyzing the same leakage information. A new strategy based on stochastic attack reduces this number to 27.8 traces (in average) during the attack but requires a larger execution time in our setting than a learning model.

Members of OHCs interact online with those who face similar problems and are involved in different types of social supports, such as informational support, emotional support and companionship. Using a case study of an OHC among breast cancer survivors, we first use machine learning techniques to reveal the types of social support embedded in each post from an OHC. Then we generate each user's contribution profile by aggregating the user's involvement in various types of social support and reveal that users play different roles in the OHC. By comparing online activities for users with different roles and conducting survival analysis on users' time span of online activities, we illustrate that users' levels of engagement in an OHC are related to various types of social support in different ways.

Different numerical analysis techniques were applied on the raw symptom data to extract clinically symptom information which in turn were then used in a machine learning process to be mapped to the standard clinician-based measures. The methods for quantitative and automatic assessment of symptoms were then evaluated for their clinimetric properties such as validity, reliability and sensitivity to change.

From an educational perspective, it has been argued that programming supports intellectual development and knowledge building. In this paper, we give a short overview of a system created to automatically detect the creativity of solutions to programming exercises that address general mathematical and algorithmic skills. A first step to make these artefacts susceptible to automatic analysis was the definition a descriptive feature set that captures both structural and procedural aspects of each solution. Secondly, machine learning techniques have been used to form higher-level metrics simulating expert judgments on a given set of solutions. It turned out that expert judgments of program creativity differ considerably and systematically. This also led to a classification of the experts.	[Manske, Sven; Hoppe, H.

Bringing expertise into educational in-production systems is complicated because companies are reluctant to invest a lot of effort into integrating new technology that they do not fully trust, while the technology cannot prove its worth without access to real, valid data. In this paper we explore the requirements that machine learning systems have to be applied to specific learning problems (sequencing and performance prediction), and then propose a minimally invasive protocol for sequencing (based on web services) to easily integrate Learning Analytics Services into e-learning systems.

Then we applied K-means clustering algorithm to divide the feature space into 2 classes: going straight and turning. After that, we used supervised learning algorithm to analyze these labeled data and build a model to recognize vehicle moving state. The experimental results showed that the model built in this way has good generalization. Based on the above research achievement, we designed and implemented a vehicle moving state recognition learning system for dynamic in-car navigation systems and applied this learning system to the map-matching field. The improved map-matching algorithm was tested on a complex urban road network and the result showed that the new algorithm can significantly improve the performance of the junction match.

A key idea behind complex system constructed by intelligent agents is to establish cooperation between different agents so as to solve problems more effectively and efficiently than a single agent can do. Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that promote and maintain cooperative behavior is recognized as a major theoretical problem where the intricacy increases with the complexity of the participating individuals. We presents current research on the effect of the "probability of learning" (Pl) and the "probability of reconnecting" (Pr) in NIPD game in evolution experiment based on complex network system, static and dynamic. We show that the "probability of learning" (Pl) is not the decisive factor on static network but it plays an important role on dynamic network where the "probability of reconnecting" (Pr) is not zero.

LOCALIZATION; IDENTIFICATION; MITIGATION	Accurate positioning in harsh environments can enable many application, such as search-and-rescue in emergency situations. For this problem, 11 ltra-wideband (MB) technology can provide the most accurate range estimates, which are required for range-based positioning. However, it still faces a problem in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments, in which range estimates based on time-of-arrival (TOA) are positively biased. There are many techniques that try to address this problem, mainly based on NLOS identification and NLOS error mitigation. However, these techniques do not exploit all available information from the UWB channel impulse response. In this paper, we propose a novel ranging technique based on kernel principal component analysis (kPCA), in which the selected channel parameters are projected onto nonlinear orthogonal high-dimensional space, and a subset of these projections is then used for ranging. We tested this technique using UWB measurements obtained in a basement tunnel of Linkoping university, and found that it provides much better ranging performance comparing with standard techniques based on PCA and TOA.

The problem may be summarized as follows: Given two rankings and a positive cost function on transpositions that depends on the similarity of the elements involved, find a smallest cost sequence of transpositions that converts one ranking into another. Our focus is on costs that may be described via special tree structures and on rankings modeled as permutations. The presented results include a quadratic-time algorithm for finding a minimum cost transform for a single cycle; and a linear time, 5/3-approximation algorithm for permutations that contain multiple cycles.

In this paper, we build on our previous work with the goal to develop a faster transcoder from H.264/AVC to HEVC. The transcoder is built around an established two-stage transcoding. In the first stage, called the training stage, full re-encoding is performed while the H.264/AVC and the HEVC information are gathered. This information is then used to build a CU classification model that is used in the second stage (called the transcoding stage). The solution is tested with well-known video sequences and evaluated in terms of rate-distortion and complexity. The proposed method is 3.4 times faster, on average, than the trivial transcoder, and 1.65 times faster than a previous transcoding solution.

The aim of this method is to learn relations between content of cellular tissue including tumor cells and aspect of specimen image removed by the needle aspiration. For this purpose, a stationary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to classify the local statistics of the specimen images, because stationary GMM is known to be effective to estimate universal model. In this paper, some specimen images with their definitive diagnosis information are used as training images in GMM learning. The training images are also used in the supervised learning with their diagnosis information as teacher data, i.e. the rank of tumor cells content. Thus, the learning of statistical relation between the local image aspect and its rank of tumor cells content may be linked by the class index of GMM, using the training images. A simulation result shows that the proposed method is effective to assist on-site visual inspection of cellular tissue in ROSE for EUS-FNA, indicating highly probable area including tumor cells.

Our system comprises three sensors: pad sensors installed under a bed mat, a pillow sensor to detect head movements, and a bolt sensor mounted to a bed handrail. We used a triaxial accelerometer for a pillow sensor and piezoelectric elements for the pad sensors and bolt sensor. The salient features of these sensors are their easy installation, low cost, high reliability, and toughness. Moreover, we developed a method of recognizing bed-leaving behavior patterns using machine-learning algorithms from signals obtained using the sensors. We evaluated our system by examining ten subjects in an environment representing a clinical site. The mean recognition accuracy for seven behavior patterns was 75.5%. Furthermore, the recognition accuracies for longitudinal sitting, terminal sitting, and left the bed were 83.3%, 98.3%, and 95.0%, respectively. In contrast, falsely recognized patterns remained inside of respective categories of sleeping and sitting. We believe that our system is applicable to an actual environment as a novel sensor system with no restraint of patients.

In this paper, a vision-based drivable region labeling method is proposed. The method is based on an adaptive growing-based approach combining color features restrictions from an indicated drivable region in an efficient, stable, and precise method that can work in various scenes. The proposed method demonstrates that it distinguishes robustly and precisely between drivable region and non-drivable region in freeway, urban, rural road scenes with illuminant variance conditions, using color features restrictions estimated from indicated drivable region without specific machine learning algorithms.

Automatic Extrapolation of User Intention for Internet Image Search without Duplication	Advancements in Automation and Control Technologies	Applied Mechanics and Materials		English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Advancements in Automation and Control (ICAAC)	APR 11-12, 2014	Ramanathapuram, INDIA		Syed Ammal Engn Coll	Kernel; online learning; machine learning; support vector machine; pedestrian detection; online classifier		Image search engines (e.g. Google Image Search, Bing Image Search) mostly depends on the given query surrounding text features. It increases complexity to interpret users' search intention only by giving single query keywords and this leads to ambiguous and noisy search results. To solve the ambiguity in the image search, consider visual information along with the text features. In this approach user has to click a single search return image and the search results are re-ranked based on the similarity in visual and textual content. Our work is to capture user search intention by doing one-click image search has four steps. Adaptive weight categories are predefined to category the query image and this helps to re-rank the text based search results. Keywords are expanded based on the selected query image visual content that helps to capture user intention. Based on the expanded keywords image pool get expanded that contain more relevant images with the query image. Expanded keywords are also used to expand the query image that lead to multiple positive similar images and the similarity metrics are learned for page re-ranking. Re-ranking of similarity images to the query image based on photo quality assessment to provide better search results.

A Robust Pedestrian Detection Approach Based on Support Vector Machine Using Convex Hull	Advancements in Automation and Control Technologies	Applied Mechanics and Materials		English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Advancements in Automation and Control (ICAAC)	APR 11-12, 2014	Ramanathapuram, INDIA		Syed Ammal Engn Coll	Kernel; online learning; machine learning; support vector machine; pedestrian detection; online classifier	ONLINE; ALGORITHM	The support vector machine (SVM), an assuring new method for the classification, has been widely used in many areas efficiently. However, the online learning issue of SVM is still not addressed satisfactorily since when a new sample arrives to retrain the SVM to adjust the classifier. This may not be feasible for real-time applications due to the expensive computation cost for retraining the SVM. This paper propose an Online SVM classifier algorithm known as OSVM-CH, which is based on the convex hull vertices selection depends on geometrical features of SVM. From the theoretical point of view, the first d+1(d is the dimension of the input samples) selected samples are proved to be vertices of the convex hull. This guarantees that the selected samples in our method keep the greatest amount of information of the convex hull. From the pedestrian detection application point of view, the new algorithm can update the classifier without reducing its classification performance.	[Revathi, M.

Failure of the wind turbine (WT) in general could cause massive financial losses but especially for structures that are operating in offshore sites. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of WTs is essential in order to ensure not only structural safety but also avoidance of overdesign of components that could lead to economic and structural inefficiency. A preliminary analysis of a machine learning approach in the context of WT SHM is presented here; it is based on results from a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of Lillgrund Wind farm. The analysis is based on neural network regression and is used to predict the measurement of each WT from the measurements of other WTs in the farm. Regression model error is used as an index of abnormal response.	[Dervilis, N.; Antoniadou, I.; Barthorpe, R.

In order to detect pathological information from tongue diagnosis rapidly, noninvasively and objectively, a near infrared spectral identification model is proposed based on SVM. The tongue spectral data of healthy people and hepatitis patients were collected. Twenty two samples were obtained for individual groups, and for each group, fifteen samples were randomly selected and used as the training sets, while the other seven were taken as the prediction sets. For the data sets, The effects of the principal component number, kernel parameters, and kernel functions on the identification model were investigated respectively. The results showed that the penalty parameter c was always 0.25, not related to the values of the principal component number and kernel parameter g. The kernel parameter g decreased along with the increased number of principal components, and ultimately reached a relatively stable value. When the Radial Basis Function (RBF) was applied, the established model was the best, indicating that the SVM approach is feasible to classify and recognize tongue near infrared spectroscopy, as along as right parameters are selected. This can provide a novel tongue spectral analysis method to distinguish healthy individuals from hepatitis patients.

In this paper, we propose a supervised data-driven experimental approach to develop Amharic morphological analyzer. We use a memory-based supervised machine learning method which extrapolates new unseen classes based on previous examples in memory. We treat morphological analysis as a classification task which retrieves the grammatical functions and properties of morphologically inflected words. As the task is geared towards analyzing the vowelled inflected Amharic words with their grammatical functions of morphemes, the morphological structure of words and the way how they are represented in memory-based learning is exhaustively investigated. The performance of the model is evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation with IB1 and IGtree algorithms resulting in the over all accuracy of 93.6% and 82.3%, respectively.

Our main assumption is that synonym pairs show similar semantic and dependency relation by the definition. They share same meronym/holonym and hypernym/hyponym relations. Contrary to synonymy, hypernymy and meronymy relations can probably be acquired by applying lexico-syntactic patterns to a big corpus. Such acquisition might be utilized and ease detection of synonymy. Likewise, we utilized some particular dependency relations such as object/subject of a verb, etc. Machine learning algorithms were applied on all these acquired features. The first aim is to find out which dependency and semantic features are the most informative and contribute most to the model. Performance of each feature is individually evaluated with cross validation. The model that combines all features shows promising results and successfully detects synonymy relation. The main contribution of the study is to integrate both semantic and dependency relation within distributional aspect. Second contribution is considered as being first major attempt for Turkish synonym identification based on corpus-driven approach.

The main methods of predicting miRNA are biological experimental approaches and computational approaches. MiRNAs that have very low expression levels or that are expressed at specific stage are difficult to find by biological experiments. Computational approaches, especially machine learning approaches, can effectively overcome these difficulties. SVM (Support vector machine), which is one of the effective machine learning approaches, has a good performance on miRNA prediction. At present, the number of miRNA precursors that are experimentally validated is limited; however, the number of the sequence segment, which is similar to real miRNA precursors, is up to millions and millions. This caused classification imbalance when the samples are learned in the SVM. In this paper, the authors applied ensemble learning to solve this problem and achieve satisfactory performance.

Here we present a complete machine learning framework for automatic estimation of mammographic density (MD) and robust feature extraction for breast cancer risk analysis. Our framework is able to simultaneously classify the breast region, fatty tissue, pectoral muscle, glandular tissue and nipple region. Integral to our method is the extraction of measures of breast density (as the fraction of the breast area occupied by glandular tissue) and mammographic pattern. A novel aspect of the segmentation framework is that a probability map associated with the label mask is provided, which indicates the level of confidence of each pixel being classified as the current label. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the estimated MD value and the ground truth is 0.8012 (p-value<0.0001). We demonstrate the capability of our methods to discriminate between women with and without cancer by analyzing the contralateral mammograms of 50 women with unilateral breast cancer, and 50 controls. Using MD we obtained an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.61; however our texture-based measure of mammographic pattern significantly outperforms the MD discrimination with an AUC of 0.70.

Interpretation can be difficult due to the highly sensitive but non-specific nature of bone tumor appearance on bone scans. In this paper we present a machine learning approach to segmenting tumors on bone scans, using intensity and context features aimed at addressing areas prone to false positives. We computed the context features using landmark points, identified by a modified active shape model. We trained a random forest classifier on 100 and evaluated on 73 prostate cancer subjects from a multi-center clinical trial. A reference segmentation was provided by a board certified radiologist. We evaluated our learning based method using the Jaccard index and compared against the state of the art, rule based method. Results showed an improvement from 0.50 +/- 0.31 to 0.57 +/- 0.27. We found that the context features played a significant role in the random forest classifier, helping to correctly classify regions prone to false positives.

The ability to consider the colour of an object in terms of "red" or "blue", rather than spatial distributions of reflected light wavelengths, is vital in processing and communicating information about important features within our local environment. The real-time identification of such features in image processing necessitates the software implementation of such a process; segmenting an image into regions of salient colour, and in doing so reducing the information stored and processed from 3-dimensional pixel values to a simple colour class label. This paper details a method by which colour segmentation may be performed offline and stored in a static look-up table, allowing for constant time dimensionality reduction in an arbitrary environment of coloured features. The machine learning framework requires no human supervision, and its performance is evaluated in terms of feature classification performance within a RoboCup robot soccer environment. The developed system is demonstrated to yield an 8% improvement over slower traditional methods of manual colour mapping.

Its target is to secure internal networks by identifying unusual access or attacks. Machine learning techniques have been playing a significant role in intrusion detection. Considering the large size of training data and time-consuming labeling task, it is wise to select some informative data to train a classifier. Active learning is a family of approaches selecting samples for labeling to build classifier with maximum prediction accuracy. So it is able to improve the performance of intrusion detection while it is not time-costing and labor-consuming. In this paper, definition and some efficient query strategies of active learning are reviewed and suggested. Some popular algorithms of intrusion detection and the combination of active learning and intrusion detection are also introduced. But existing work of active learning for intrusion detection is very limited. We propose more active learning methods should be developed for intrusion detection.

Different classifiers (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, or classification trees) have been investigated in the last decade. The results achieved so far are sometimes contrasting and do not show a clear winner. In this paper we present an empirical study aiming at statistically analyzing the equivalence of different defect predictors. We also propose a combined approach, coined as CODEP (COmbined DEfect Predictor), that employs the classification provided by different machine learning techniques to improve the detection of defect-prone entities. The study was conducted on 10 open source software systems and in the context of cross-project defect prediction, that represents one of the main challenges in the defect prediction field. The statistical analysis of the results indicates that the investigated classifiers are not equivalent and they can complement each other. This is also confirmed by the superior prediction accuracy achieved by CODEP when compared to stand-alone defect predictors.

It is also the most vulnerable platform due to allowing of software downloads from 3rd party sites, loading additional code at runtime, and lack of frequent updates to known vulnerabilities. Securing such devices from malware that targets users is paramount. In this paper, we present a Jade agent based framework targeted towards protecting Android devices. We also focus on scenarios of use where such agents can be dynamically launched. We believe, a detection technique has to be intelligent due to limited battery constraints of these devices. Moreover, battery utilization might become secondary in certain settings where detection accuracy is given a higher preference. In this framework, the expensive analysis components utilizing machine-learning algorithms are pushed to server side, while agents on the Android client are used mainly for intelligent feature gathering.

Nowadays, people are motivated to share their experiences and feelings on social media, so we propose to sense SWB from the vast user generated data on social media. By utilizing 1785 users' social media data with SWB labels, we train machine learning models that are able to "sense" individual SWB. Our model, which attains the state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, can then be applied to identify large amount of social media users' SWB in time with low cost.

Therefore, the task of understanding, modelling and predicting spatial-temporal patterns of air pollution in urban zones is an interesting and challenging topic having many research axes from science-based modelling to geostatistics and data mining. Recently, the application of land use regression models (LUR) for air pollution analysis and mapping in urban zones has demonstrated their efficiency. The present research deals with a new development of nonlinear LUR models based on machine learning algorithms. A special attention is paid to the Multi-Layer Perceptron and Random Forest algorithms and their abilities to model the NO2 pollutant in the urban zone of Geneva.

It describes the impact of a bug on functionality of the software. In the available literature, machine learning techniques based prediction models have been proposed to assess the severity level of a bug. These prediction models have been developed by using summary of a reported bug i.e. the description of a bug reported by a user. This work has been also extended in cross project context to help the projects whose historical data is not available. Till now, the literature reveals that bug triager assess the severity level based on only the summary report of a bug but we feel that the severity level of a bug may change its value during the course of fixing and moreover, the severity level is not only characterized by the summary of bug report but also by other attributes namely priority, number of comments, number of dependents, number of duplicates, complexity, summary weight and cc list. In this paper, we have developed prediction models for determining the severity level of a reported bug based on these attributes in cross project context.

Although the belief that they negatively impact maintainability is widely accepted, there are still relatively few objective results that would support this theory. In this paper we show our approach of detecting antipatterns in source code by structural analysis and use the results to reveal connections among antipatterns, number of bugs, and maintainability. We studied 228 open-source Java based systems and extracted bug-related information for 34 of them from the PROMISE database. For estimating the maintainability, we used the ColumbusQM probabilistic quality model. We found that there is a statistically significant, 0.55 Spearman correlation between the number of bugs and the number of antipatterns. Moreover, there is an even stronger, -0.62 reverse Spearman correlation between the number of antipatterns and code maintainability. We also found that even these few implemented antipatterns could nearly match the machine learning based bug-predicting power of 50 class level source code metrics. Although the presented analysis is not conclusive by far, these first results suggest that antipatterns really do decrease code quality and can highlight spots that require closer attention.

For data intensive batch jobs, MapReduce provided its impact. To build consistent, hi-availability (HA) and scalable data management system to serve peta bytes of data for the massive users, are the main focused objects. MapReduce is a programming model that enables easy development of scalable parallel applications to process vast amount of data on large cluster. Through a simple interface with two functions map and reduce, this model facilities parallel implementation of real world tasks such as data processing for search engine and machine learning. Earlier version of Hadoop MapReduce has several performance problems like connection between Map to Reduce task, data overload and time consumption. In this paper, we proposed a modified MapReduce architecture MRA (MapReduce Agent) which is a fusion of iSCSI protocol and the downloaded reference code of Hadoop*. Our developed MRA can reduce completion time, improve system utilization and give better performance.

Machine learning method can optimize parameters and evolve satellite attitude control law automatically under certain criterion. Single axis satellite attitude simulation system with noise was built up, which included satellite attitude dynamic model, sensors and actuators model. The control law's inputs were attitude error, attitude error's integral and angular velocity error, and outputs were actuators' control instructions. Control law's fitness function was an attitude error's statistical function. With suitable function set selected for genetic programming (GP) and parse tree used to represent a control law expression, GP was used to evolve control law expression automatically. Simulation result shows that this method can evolve control law with uncertainties noise better. The evolved control law response and control precision are better than PID, and it can be used in satellite attitude control.

The proposed parts surface defect detection systems is made up of six parts, and the main ideas of our method lie in that we exploit computer vision and machine learning in the research field of mechanical manufacturing and automation. We convert the parts surface defect detection problem to the classification problem, and the images of parts surface are used as testing samples. The SVM algorithm regards the classification problem as the constrained optimization problem. The classification accuracy is determined by the quality of parameters selection. Hence, particle swarm optimization is exploited to make parameters selection for SVM by defining two fitness functions. Afterwards, the best particle of the current population and the gbest is obtained. Utilizing the output from the particle swarm optimization then the parameters for SVM can be obtained. Finally, experiments are conducted based on a dataset with 563 samples, and experimental results illustrate that the proposed is quite effective for parts surface defect detection.

It is suitable for solving the nonlinear and higher-dimensional pattern recognition problem with a small amount of samples. SVM is mainly used to solve classification problems (SVC) and regression problems (SVR). If we regard the securities market trend prediction as a classification of rise or fall, the securities market trend prediction can be converted into a classification problem. In this paper, a kind of securities market month K line forecast model based on SVC was put forward. Eighty times of simulation experiment were performed. The comprehensive accuracy of the forecast model was 61.90%, and the rise forecast accuracy was 64.00%. If we trade stock according to the prediction, the income will be 11.82% a year. The simulation experiment results proved that the securities market month K line forecast model based on SVC was feasible and had certain practical significance.

Automatically identifying mental states from language text using deeper linguistic features	INTERACTION STUDIES			English	Article						mental state; linguistic features; mindprint; natural language processing; information extraction		Humans routinely transmit and interpret subtle information about their mental states through the language they use, even when only the language text is available. This suggests humans can utilize the linguistic signature of a mental state (its mindprint), comprised of features in the text. Once the relevant features are identified, mindprints can be used to automatically identify mental states communicated via language. We focus on the mindprints of eight mental states resulting from intentions, attitudes, and emotions, and present a mindprint-based machine learning technique to automatically identify these mental states in realistic language data. By using linguistic features that leverage available semantic, syntactic, and valence information, our approach achieves near-human performance on average and even exceeds human performance on occasion. Given this, we believe mindprints could be very valuable for intelligent systems interacting linguistically with humans.

Since the introduction of floating-point computations in mainstream processors, table lookups, division, square root, and piecewise approximations were essential components of elementary functions implementations. However, we suggest that these operations can not deliver high throughput on modern processors, and argue that algorithms which rely only on multiplication, addition, and integer operations would achieve higher performance. We propose 4 design principles for high-throughput elementary functions and suggest how to apply them to implementation of log, exp, sin, and tan functions. We evaluate the performance and accuracy of the new algorithms on three recent x86 microarchitectures and demonstrate that they compare favorably to previously published research and vendor-optimized libraries.

Five different types of features likely permissions, count of permission, hardware features, software features as well as API calls from 1175. apk files are mined for performing the investigation. The objective of this work is to evaluate if independent features are effective in comparison to ensemble features. Feature reduction is performed to investigate the impact of varied feature length on classification accuracy. Feature selection techniques such as Bi- Normal Separation, Mutual Information, Relevancy score, Kolmogorov dependence and Kullback Leibler are administered to choose the significant attributes. The proposed method introduced here using dimensionality reduction and machine learning algorithms produces an overall classification accuracy of 93.02% with ensemble features. Comparing the empirical results of ensemble features with individual features, the former improved the classification accuracy with Bi-Normal Separation.	[Aswini, A.

Reasons for this include applying Quality of Service (QoS), network planning, prohibiting its use in some networks and lawful interception of communications. Researchers have addressed VoIP traffic classification from different viewpoints, such as classifier accuracy, building time, classification time and online classification. This previous research tested their models using the same version of a VoIP product they used for training the model, giving generalizability only to that version of the product. This means that as new VoIP versions are released, these classifiers become obsolete. In this paper, we address if this approach is applicable to detecting new, untrained, versions of Skype. We suggest that using cost-sensitive classifiers can help to improve the accuracy of detecting untrained versions, by testing compared to other algorithms. Our experiment demonstrates promising preliminary results to detect Skype version 4, by building a cost sensitive classifier on Skype version 3, achieving an F-measure score of 0.57. This is a drastic improvement from not using cost sensitivity, which scores an F-measure of 0. This approach may be enhanced to improve the detection results and extended to improve detection for other applications that change protocols from version to version.

Many researchers are searching for mechanisms that can reduce power consumption and pollution in the city environment. This paper addresses the issue of public lighting and how it can be improved in order to achieve a more energy efficient city. This work is focused on making the process of turning the streetlights on and off more intelligent so that they consume less power and cause less light pollution. The proposed solution is comprised of a radar device and an expert system implemented on a low-cost platform based on a DSP. By analyzing the radar echo in both the frequency and time domains, the system is able to detect and identify objects moving in front of it.

To achieve this, researchers have suggested many detection systems that rely on host-monitoring techniques and require deep packet inspection or which are trained by malware samples by applying machine learning and clustering techniques. To our knowledge, most approaches are either lack of being deployed easily to real enterprise networks, because of practicability of their training system which is supposed to be trained by malware samples or dependent to host-based or deep packet inspection analysis which requires a big amount of storage capacity for an enterprise. Beside this, honeypot systems are mostly used to collect malware samples for analysis purposes and identify coining attacks. Rather than keeping experimental results of hot detection techniques as theory and using honeypots for only analysis purposes, in this paper, we present a novel automated hot-infected machine detection system BFH (BotFinder through Honeypots), based on BotFinder, that identifies infected hosts in a real enterprise network by learning approach. Our solution, relies on NetFlow data, is capable of detecting hots which are infected by most-recent malwares whose samples are caught via 97 different honeypot systems. We train BFH by created models, according to malware samples, provided and updated by 97 honeypot systems. BFH system automatically sends caught malwares to classification unit to construct family groups. Later, samples are automatically given to training unit for modeling and perform detection over Net Flow data. Results are double checked by using full packet capture of a month and through tools that identify rogue domains. Our results show that BFH is able to detect infected hosts with very few false-positive rates and successful on handling most-recent malware families since it is fed by 97 Honey pot and it supports large networks with scalability of Hadoop infrastructure, as deployed in a large-scale enterprise network in Turkey.

Due to the complexity and size of hyperspectral imagery and the enormous number of wavelength channels, the need for combining compact representations with image segmentation and superpixel estimation has emerged in this area. Here, we present an approach to superpixel estimation in hyperspectral images by adapting the well known UCM approach to hyperspectral volumes. This approach benefits from the channel information at each pixel of the hyperspectral image while obtaining a compact representation of the hyperspectral volume using principal component analysis. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the additional information of spectral channels will substantially improve superpixel estimation from a single "monochromatic" channel. Furthermore, superpixel estimation performed on the compact hyperspectral representation outperforms the same when executed on the entire volume.

The concentration levels of hemoglobin and blood oxygenation under the skin vary due to changes in a person's emotional and physical state; this produces subtle changes in the hue and saturation components of their skin color. In this paper, we present an evaluation of facial skin color changes as the only feature to infer the emotional state of a person. We created a dataset of spontaneous human emotions with a wide range of human subjects of different ages and ethnicities. We used three different types of video clips as stimuli: negative, neutral, and positive to elicit emotions on subjects. We performed experiments using various machine learning algorithms including decision trees, multinomial logistic regression and latent- dynamic conditional random field. Our preliminary results show that facial skin color changes can be used to infer the emotional state of a person in the valence dimension with an accuracy of 77.08%.

To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first work in the area of intelligent tutoring systems, which focuses on spatial localization of deictic gestural activity, i. e. where the deictic gesture is pointing on the workspace. A new dataset called SDMATH is first introduced. The motivation for detecting deictic gestures and their spatial properties is established, followed by techniques for automatic localization of deictic gestures in a workspace. The techniques employ computer vision and machine learning steps such as GBVS saliency, binary morphology and HOG-SVM classification. It is shown that the method localizes the deictic tip with an accuracy of over 85 % accuracy for a cut off distance of 12 pixels. Furthermore, a detailed discussion using examples from the proposed dataset is presented on high-level inferences about the student-tutor interactions that can be derived from the integration of spatial and temporal localization of the deictic gestural activity using the proposed techniques.

The ever evolving new intrusion types pose a serious threat to network security. Although numerous network security tools have been developed, yet the fast growth of intrusive activities is still a serious issue. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are used to detect intrusive activities on the network. Machine learning and classification algorithms help to design "Intrusion Detection Models" which can classify the network traffic into intrusive or normal traffic. In this paper we present the comparative performance of NSL-KDD based data set compatible classification algorithms. These classifiers have been evaluated in WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) environment using 41 attributes. Around 94,000 instances from complete KDD dataset have been included in the training data set and over 48,000 instances have been included in the testing data set. Garrett's Ranking Technique has been applied to rank different classifiers according to their performance. Rotation Forest classification approach outperformed the rest.

Nowadays WABN becomes an integral component of healthcare management system where a patient needs to be monitors both inside and outside home or hospital. These applications are responsible for gathering and managing heterogeneous data in terms of both for real time and non-real time traffic. Heterogeneous traffic classification plays an important role in various application of WBAN. Due to the ineffectiveness of traditional port-based and payload-based methods, recent work were proposed using machine learning methods to classify flows based on statistical characteristics. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of integral concept of machine learning in terms of binary decision tree and genetic algorithm for classification of heterogeneous traffic flow according to rules. We have also designed an Earliest Deadline based flexible dynamic scheduling algorithm, which has been proven to be an optimal prioritized scheduling for problem like starvation.

Advanced data mining modeling techniques can help overcome these conditions. The health care knowledge management, especially in heart disease, can be improved through the integration of data mining with decision support system. Almost 60% of the world population fall victim to the heart disease. Heart disease management is a complex task requiring much experience and knowledge. Traditional way of predicting heart disease is through physician's examination or a number of medical tests such as ECG Stress test, Heart MRI, CT etc., Computer based information along with advanced data mining techniques are used for appropriate results. The main aim of this study is to detect the various causes of cardiovascular diseases by means of machine-learning techniques with the help of clinical diagnosis. For detecting these image analysis data is used. The aim of this research work is to develop a framework for detecting causes by means of data mining and machine-learning techniques.	[Mohan, K.

It is able to obtain superior performance by increasing the diversity of the single classifiers. However, in the more challenging context of evolving data streams, the classifier has also to be adaptive and work under very strict constraints of space and time. Furthermore, the computational load of using a large number of classifiers can make its application extremely expensive. In this work, we present a method for building Random Forests that use Very Fast Decision Trees for data streams on GPUs. We show how this method can benefit from the massive parallel architecture of GPUs, which are becoming an efficient hardware alternative to large clusters of computers. Moreover, our algorithm minimizes the communication between CPU and GPU by building the trees directly inside the GPU. We run an empirical evaluation and compare our method to two well know machine learning frameworks, VFML and MOA. Random Forests on the GPU are at least 300x faster while maintaining a similar accuracy.
