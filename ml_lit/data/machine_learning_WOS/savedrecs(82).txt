We compare our system with the Topiary system which, in contrast, uses a statistical learning approach to finding topic descriptors for headlines. Both of these systems combine these topic descriptors with a compressed version of the lead sentence. The performance of these systems is evaluated using the ROUGE evaluation suite on the DUC 2004 news stories collection.

Clustering techniques have been studied extensively in E-Commerce, statistics, pattern recognition, and machine learning. This increases the need for efficient and effective analysis methods to make use of this information. Traditional DENCLUE is an important clustering algorithm. But it is difficult to make its two global parameters (sigma, xi) be globally effective. A new Algorithm based on KNN and DENCLUE is proposed in this paper, which offers DENCLUE the appropriate and globally effective parameters based on KNN and DENCLUE. At the first, the window-width (WW) of each data point is determined and the whole data set is partitioned into some fuzzy cluster (FC) by KNN based on KDE. Then, the local a of each FC is unsupervised determined according to the entropy theory. At the last, each local a is mapped to the global sigma and each FC is independently clustered, which makes the global sigma and xi have the global validity. The analysis and experiment prove that our clustering method achieves better performance on the quality of the resulting clustering and the results are not sensitive to the parameter k.

The learning process SUPE is customized to the instance to be classified called query instance. Given a query instance, the training data is transformed into a query matrix, from which useful patterns are discovered for learning. The final prediction of the class label is performed by combining some statistics of the discovered useful patterns. We show that SUPE conducts the search from specific to general in a significantly reduced hypothesis space. It also facilitates extremely easy training instance maintenance and updates. We have evaluated our method with a real-world problem and benchmark data sets. The results demonstrate that SUPE can achieve good performance and high reliability.

Therefore it is important to organize the unrelated rules that were generated by rough set. So this paper is focus on how to simulate some classical algorithm of rough set theory by MATLAB and how to construct the satisfactory minimal description rules from given data by partitioning the data according to the discernibility matrix. Then the algorithm of extracting these satisfactory rules is obtained, which can construct the parallel testing model, for replacing the unrelated rules in knowledge base.

These methods can do well in a web site but fail in the others without adding new rules or inputting new training pages manually. Furthermore, if the template of the web site is changed, it has to redesign the extracting rules or re-inputting the training pages. It is hard to be maintained and used to extract information from large number of different web sites. In the paper, there is a new method that is based on the keywords of a certain topic, instead of rules and training pages. Experimental evaluation on a large of web pages from different web sites indicates that this method correctly and automatically extracts the information ignoring which web sites the pages come from. This method has been applied to the system of intelligent searching and mining of electronic business successfully.

To deal with the problem, we propose a machine learning approach. First, all likely acronyms are identified from text. Second, candidate expansions against likely acronyms are generated from their surrounding text. Last, we employ Support Vector Machines (SVM) to select the genuine expansions for acronyms. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms baseline method of using patterns. Experimental results also show that the trained SVM model is generic and performs well on different domains.

In general, there are two types of decision tree induction, i.e., crisp decision trees and fuzzy decision trees. Both decision tree inductions based on real-world data are unlikely to find the entirely accurate training set. This means noise existing in the training set. It should be noted that the noise can either cause attributes to become inadequate, or make the decision tree more complicated. It is necessary to further investigate decision trees where the influence of noise data is considered. Experimentally, the paper analyzes the effect of three types of noises, compares the tolerance capability of noise between fuzzy decision trees and crisp decision trees, discusses the modified degree of pruning methods in both fuzzy and crisp decision trees, and addresses the adjustable capability on noise by using different fuzzy reasoning operators in the fuzzy decision tree. Finally the empirical results show fuzzy decision tree is more robust than the crisp decision tree and the post-pruning crisp decision tree.

Thus, on the one hand, user's fatigue, the key issue of IGA, can be alleviated, since some individuals with higher preference weight are added in each generation through relevance feedback technology. On the other hand, the two mapping functions between the low-level parameter space and the high-level users' psychological space can be built during interactions. An instance of this frame, which uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the machine learning method in RF, is also provided. The effectiveness of our approach is first evaluated through simulation tests using two benchmark functions. The experimental results show that the convergence speed of the proposal is much faster than that of normal IGA. Then, the approach is applied to retrieve images with emotion semantics queries. The subject experiments also demonstrate that the proposal algorithm can alleviate user fatigue. Furthermore, SVM constructs an individual emotion user model though learning.

We first prove that every consistent hypothesis is maximum a posterior hypothesis (MAP hypothesis) under some proper assumption; then, under three different zero-mean noise distributions (Laplace distribution, uniform distribution, and normal distribution), we obtain the MAP hypothesis of output about one kind of machine learning problem.

ROC graphs have become increasingly popular in machine learning, because they offer a more robust framework for evaluating classifier performance than the traditional accuracy measure. In this paper, we investigate the relation between a probabilistic classifier and its corresponding predictor in a view of ROC analysis. A method of generating ROC curves for prediction (or regression) problems is proposed and some properties of ROC curves for prediction are discussed with examples.

It is necessary for manufacturing enterprises to detect the states of production process in real time, in order to rind the early faults in machines, so that the losses of production failure and investments of facility maintenance can be minimized. This paper proposes a new fault diagnosis model, which extracts multi-dimension features from the detected signal to supervise the different features of the signal simultaneously. Based on the model, the method of inductive learning is adopted to obtain the statistical boundary vectors of the signal automatically, and then a normal feature space is built, according to which an abnormal signal can be detected, and consequently the faults in a complicated system can be found easily. Furthermore, under the condition of without existing fault samples, the precise results of fault diagnosis can also be achieved in real time. The theoretical analysis and simulation example demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

The standard STI method relies on noisy test signals and thus hinders in-use measurements. Alternative methods to accurately estimate the STI from naturally occurring speech signals have been developed over the past few years using artificial neural networks. This paper presents a new machine learning based method to more accurately estimate the STI from arbitrary running speech using a purpose design signal pre-processor and support vector machines. When compared with the neural network approaches to the problem, the new method exhibits improved estimation accuracy and generalisation capability to arbitrary speech, providing a more applicable method to facilitate in-situ measurements.

Most traditional PNs recognition systems use lexical resources such as name list, as new names are constantly coming into existence, these are necessarily incomplete. Therefore machine learning methods are used to identify PNs automatically. In the framework of MaxEnt model, semantic and lexical information of surrounding words and word itself acting as atomic features comprises feature templates and forms feature without requiring extra expert knowledge. The test on WSJ of Penn Treebank II shows that this method guarantees high precision and recall, and at the same time it can reduce the quantity of features dramatically, downsize system space consumption, and decrease the time of training and testing, so as to improve the efficiency considerably. The method in this paper can be transformed to identify other specific noun easily because the principle of methods is universal.

LSI can resolve the problems of polysemy and synonymy, and can reduce noise in the raw document-term matrix. But LSI is not an optimal approach to text classification. Because LSI is a complete unsupervised method which ignores categories discrimination, it often drops the performance of text classification when it is applied to the whole training documents [1]. In this paper, in order to prevent the spreading of the unsolicited email and harmful message, under multi-languages (Chinese and English) circumstance we have developed a system based on customized email topic being filtered, and we represented topic in Latent Semantic model, and abstract features from predefined email categories and document categories in LSI method. It is able to filter and recognize customized or special unwanted Chinese and English emails in positive examples supervised learning approach. We propose an improving LSI to improve the classification performance by a separate Single Value Decomposition (SVD) on the transformed local region of each category. We apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method to recognize and filter email based on text classifier. The result of the experiment showed that our approach is very effective and has a good filtering performance.

The intrusion features are represented as graph-ere nodes, with the edges between them denoting the adding of the next feature. Ants traverse through the graph to add nodes until the stopping criterion is satisfied. The fisher discrimination rate is adopted as the heuristic information for ants' traversal. In order to avoid training of a large number of SVM classifier, the Least Square based SVM estimation is adopted. Initially, the SVM is trained based on grid search method to obtain discrimination function using the training data based on all features available. Then the feature subset produced during the ACO search process is evaluated based on their abilities to reconstruct the reference discriminative function using linear least square estimation. Finally SVM is retrained using the train data based on the obtained optimal feature subset to obtain intrusion detection model. The MIT's KDD Cup 99 dataset is used to evaluate our present method, the results clearly demonstrate that the method can be an effective way for intrusion feature selection and detection.

The architecture of the CAT and CAD model and experimental feature extraction and pattern recognition by WT-SVM system are presented. The features of special frequency segment of the signal picked up by the method of wavelet decomposition are used as the inputs of SVM. The analysis of the experimental data proves that the model proposed is efficient and simple to recognize exceptional signals. The experimental result indicated that the error rate of SVM is lower than the one obtained by applying KNN classifier and Fisher classifier methods whether the training set is small or huge. The experiment also demonstrates that SVM can be extremely effective in minimizing the error rate lower than LVQ and BP neural network methods.

Machine learning techniques for IDS usually yield high false alarm rate. In this work, we propose to construct a host-based IDS for flooding-based Denial Of Service (DoS) attacks by minimizing the generalization error bound of the IDS to reduce its false alarm rate and increase its precision. Experiments using artificial datasets support our claims.

In this paper, a methodology based on structural risk minimization is presented which trades off between training error and the model complexity.

The approach, named 'symbiotic learning', focuses on the exploitation of relevant gameplay experiences. The results of an experiment in the game QUAKE III show the symbiotic learning approach to be able to successfully learn effective agent behaviour. We conclude that symbiotic learning can be used during game development practice to automatically validate and produce AI, and, provided a good balance is found between exploitation and exploration, the approach can be applied in practice for the purpose of online learning in commercial computer games.

The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of three policies in feature term structure representing case-based learning, which underlies an improved technique - SSU-LID. The outcome of SSU-LID is assessed with experiments on the Toxicology dataset.

Traditional coordinate transformation is a level-wised process consisting of several sets of equations obtained by geographical survey. Each level of coordinate transformation takes care of a step of geometric or geographic transformation Of coordinates, which makes the whole process complicated. Also, the equations for coordinate transformation are unique with respect to different geographic regions. In this paper, we try to eliminate the steps of coordinate transformation using symbolic regression and genetic programming so that the receiver's position can be obtained much faster with less computation complexity. We test this concept on different areas in Taiwan and find several new equations that can effectively and better produce accurate coordinates.

We explain how these three seemingly independent AI specialties are inextricably linked through the science of randomization and reuse. Computational intelligence is shown to imply soft computing, whose bounds are soft or fuzzy only because they need be adaptively formed (e.g., Type II fuzzy logic). Data mining implies the compression of data (including anomalous data) to its simplest form. Such randomization operations are inherently incomplete and thus are necessarily domain-specific or adaptive as a consequence. Finally, machine learning is the study of computational adaptation. For example, a machine that plays master-level chess is not necessarily computationally intelligent - unless it is capable of adaptive improvement in its play. This paper will attempt to make it clear that intelligence and the capability for learning are in fact synonyms for an AI.

Ontologies are a key building block of the semantic web, and can enable applications to have a shared understanding of data, and to be semantically interoperable. However, ontologies from heterogeneous sources may use different terms to represent the same concept. This can present problems for applications which are required to work interoperably with independently produced ontologies. Manually determining semantically equivalent terms between ontologies is a laborious and error-prone process. In this paper, we present an architecture which uses machine-learning techniques to produce mappings between semantically equivalent terms in heterogeneous ontologies. The architecture combines the results of several machine-learning algorithms, in order to be effective with a wider range of data than if a single algorithm were used.

This paper presents a systematic approach to constructing a self-organizing fuzzy identifier The proposed identifier is built on a fuzzy system consisting of a quantum clustering network and radial basis function network. We develop the corresponding self-organizing algorithms. Quantum clustering network, a new fuzzy clustering neural network model, combines the idea of quantum mechanics and the structure of Kohonen clustering network. The strategy proposed in our approach for the update rules of Kohonen clustering network is derived from the fixed-point iteration for the solution of nonlinear equations. The model eliminates the sensitivity to the choice of the initial configuration and yields a dynamic fuzzy clustering solution. Quantum clustering network is used for the generation of fuzzy rules as well as the construction of radial basis function network for fuzzy inference. Furthermore, the complex dynamical behavior in the proposed quantum learning systems is investigated. The concept of self-organization in complex dynamical systems and the role of quantum mechanics are presented It provides us with efficient tools to get better insight into learning dynamics. Simulation results show that the proposed method can provide the fuzzy models with satisfactory accuracy.								Duda R.

In this paper, we modify AdaBoost.M1 for Chinese word sense disambiguation. Unlike AdaBoost.M1 that adapts weights of training sets, in our modified algorithm, we provide a new method to adapt the classifiers' weights. The base classifiers are trained on a small set of labeled examples, and then augmented by a large number of unlabeled examples. We report the results of systematic experimentation performed on a standard Chinese People Daily corpus (co-developted by Institute of Computational Linguistics (ICL) of Peking University, People's Daily and Fujitsu Limited) of 12 thousand articles. These experiments demonstrate the advantage of our new weight adaptation method and its ability to overcome the noise factor within the unlabeled examples.

MCB contains the bilingual bootstrapping as its kernel algorithm that leads to incremental knowledge acquisition. EM model is performed to train parameters in base learner. Feature translation model is improved by semantic correlation estimation. In addition we use multi-engine to produce qualified starting seeds from parallel corpora and monolingual corpora. Those seeds that are generated through unsupervised machine learning approaches can also ensure bootstrapping effectiveness in contrast with manual selected seeds in spite of their different selection mechanisms. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of MCB. Some factors including feature space and starting seed number are concerned in our experiments because EM algorithm is sensible to starting values. Limitation of resources is also concerned.

Word sense disambiguation system using Boosting acquired the state-of-the-art performance. This paper explores the primary but unavoidable problem of rules selection in Adaboost applied to word sense disambiguation system, presenting the relations among rules selection, iteration number and the performance of the system on sparse data. The results show the increment of the iteration number in Adaboost trained on a small set of examples without noise is neither helpful nor harmful. The algorithm is sensitive to weak rules selection in two aspects: on one hand, some rules make the training error converge more quickly and have higher generalization ability simultaneously, on the other hand, conflictions may occur among weak rules built on different features causing trouble to the whole system.

The algorithm disambiguates and aggregates WordNet synsets of a verb's noun phrase (NP) arguments in the training data. It was then used to filter out irrelevant WordNet semantic features introduced by the ambiguity of verb NP arguments. Experimental results showed that our new feature selection method boosted our system's performance on verbs whose meanings depended heavily on their NP arguments. Furthermore, our method outperformed two standard feature selection methods, indicating its effectiveness and advantages, especially for small-sample machine learning tasks like supervised WSD.

The parser's ability to skip words and rule symbols, however, results in a much bigger search space and greatly increases the parse ambiguity [1]. Previous approaches resolved these issues through manually labeling the types of rule symbols, or by utilizing heuristic scores or statistical probabilities. However, these approaches have certain drawbacks. This paper proposes to exploit embedded machine learning techniques to help with pruning and disambiguation in robust parsers. An embedded machine learning system is integrated with the heuristic score and the strategy of basing the types of rule symbols upon their correspondence to the domain model. This integration can considerably relieve the reliance of robust parser development on linguistic expert handerafting. Our experiments show that this integration offers stronger capability in ambiguity resolution, thereby enabling the robust parser to achieve better parsing accuracy.

In this paper, we attempt to automatically annotate the Penn Chinese Treebank with semantic dependency structure. Initially a small portion of the Penn Chinese Treebank was manually annotated with headword and dependency relations. Two supervised machine learning algorithms with varying features were then used to learn the relations. Finally, a set of rules were created based on features of Chinese to solve some problem patterns that were found in the Penn Chinese Treebank dealing with ambiguous structures. The experimental results show that the algorithms and proposed approach are effective for determining semantic dependency structure automatically.

The first system does not split shallow parsing into any sub-tasks, and it is called one-phase shallow parsing system. The second one is called two-phase system that decomposes shallow parsing into two main sub-tasks, recognition (chunk) and classification (chunk), which are performed sequentially and independently with separate modules. Both systems are machine learning based systems, making the use of SVM classifiers. The main focus of this paper is to investigate the impact of different methods to the performance of shallow parsing. Experimental results show that one-phase method is quite effective; in fact it yields better performance between the two methods. Although each individual model was quite strong to begin with, we found that the two-phase method actually degraded the performance, or brought zero improvement. Although more sophisticated linguistic features will be helpful, we use the same features in two shallow parsing methods.

Understanding its temporal semantics is important in many NLP applications, such as information extraction, document summarization and question answering. Temporal expression normalization involves mapping from the different classes of expressions to the values of certain temporal attributes. A temporal expression may belong to one or more classes, but each class of expressions normally shares the same mapping procedure. In this paper, we explore the possibility of applying multi-label classification techniques in the context of temporal expression normalization. More specifically, two models, named independent binary classification model and compared binary classification model, are evaluated, compared and analyzed. Once the possible class(es) of a temporal expression is determined, the corresponding mapping rules are called to transform it into the corresponding attribute(s). Experiments on a substantiate data collection show that, based on the result of machine learning classification, the performance of temporal expression normalization is comparable with that of deliberate rule set.

Using KAFTIE, a knowledge base was built based on a small data set that outperforms machine learning algorithms trained on a much bigger data set for the task of recognizing temporal relations. In particular this can be incorporated to bootstrap the process of labeling data for domains where annotated data is not available.

The character itself, character-based part-of-speech (POS) tag, the information whether a character appears in the location name characteristic word table and context information are extracted as the features of the vectors. A model based on SVM is set up for extracting location names. To improve the accuracy of SVM classifier, KNN algorithm is introduced; furthermore, to fit the unbalanced data, a modified SVM-KNN classifier is proposed. The experimental results show that this model is efficient in identifying location names from Chinese texts. The recall, precision and F-measure are up to 90.38%, 92.12% and 91.24% respectively in open test. The hybrid machine learning model based on SVM and KNN can be used for recognizing location names and other unknown words such as person names and organization names in Chinese texts. The modified SVM-KNN model can be generalized to the fields of machine learning with unbalanced class distribution.

B	Bracewell, DB; Ren, FJ; Kuriowa, S			IEEE	Bracewell, DB; Ren, FJ; Kuriowa, S			Multilingual single document keyword extraction for information retrieval	Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering (IEEE NLP-KE'05)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering	OCT 30-NOV 01, 2005	Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, AAI, CIPSC, Chinese Assoc Artificial Intelligence, IEEE Signal Proc Soc, IEEE Beijing Sect				Keywords play an important role in many aspects of information retrieval (IR). From web searches to text summarization good keywords are a necessity. In a typical IR system algorithms are used which require the entire document collection to be built beforehand. While some research has been done on extracting keywords from a single document, the quality of the keywords was not based on how well they perform in IR tasks. Moreover, they are designed for only one language and the applicability to other languages is unknown. As such, this paper proposes a new algorithm that is applicable to multiple languages and extracts effective keywords that, to a high degree, uniquely identify a document. It needs only a single document to extract keywords and does not rely on machine learning methods. It was tested on a Japanese-English bilingual corpus and a portion of the Reuter's corpus using a keyword search algorithm. The results show that the extracted keywords do a good job at uniquely identifying the documents.

A main reason is the existence of outliers in training data, such as non-sense documents, documents mislabeled or lying on the border between different categories, and documents that are out of the defined categories, etc. Therefore, in a text categorization task, outlier learning technique could be adopted to improve text categorization. In this paper, an outlier learning based text categorization system is proposed, where AdaBoost algorithm is adopted for outlier identifying. Simulation results reveal that the new system is successful in improving learning performance for text categorization.

Chinese question classification is the process that analyzes a question and labels it based on its question type and expected answer type. In this paper, we propose an integrated knowledge-based and machine learning approach for Chinese question classification that focuses on factoid question answering. We develop a Chinese question classification scheme for CLQA C-C (Cross Language Question Answering Chinese to Chinese) factoid question answering, and define a coarse-grained and fine-grained classification taxonomy for a Chinese question-answering system. We adopt INFOMAP inference engine to support the knowledge-based approach for Chinese questions, which can be formulated as templates and use SVM (Support Vector Machines) as the machine learning approach for large collections of labeled Chinese questions. Our experimental results show that the accuracy of Chinese question classification using INFOMAP alone is 88%, and 73.5% with SVM alone. In contrast, classification based on a hybrid approach that incorporates SVM and INFOMAP yields an accuracy rate of 92%.

It classifies sequences by aggregating the information about their subsequences predicted by a classifier derived by machine learning from a random sample of training subsequences. This generic approach is combined with decision tree based ensemble methods, scalable both with respect to sample size and vocabulary size. The method is applied to three families of problems: DNA sequence recognition, splice junction detection, and gene regulon prediction. With respect to standard approaches based on n-grams, it appears competitive in terms of accuracy, flexibility, and scalability. The paper also highlights the possibility to exploit the resulting models to identify interpretable patterns specific of a given class of biological sequences.

The most common way of predicting disorder is based on binary classification with machine learning. Since amino acid composition has different propensities in the N-term, C-term, and internal regions, the accuracy of prediction increases by dividing training data into these three regions and predicting them separately. However, previous work has lacked discussion about a concrete definition of the N-term and C-term regions, and has only used the heuristic length from the terminal. Other previous work has shown that general physicochemical properties rather than specific amino acids are important factors contributing to disorder, and a reduced amino acid alphabet can maintain excellent precision in predicting disorder. In this paper, we redefine a suitable length and position for the N-term and C-term regions for predicting disorder. Moreover, we show that each region has different physicochemical properties, which are important factors contributing to disorder. We also suggest a region-specificreduced set of amino acid and modified PSSM based on that for predicting disorder. We implemented our method and (1) compare it with the conventional division method, (2) compare our feature selection with all physicochemical features, on casp6 benchmark, PDB dataset, and DisProt. The result supports that the method of new data separation is effective, and indicates each region has different physicochemical properties that are important factors for predicting protein disorders.

Specifically, we propose to build classifiers in the space of domain pairs, which are purely based on sequence data. We designed a novel way to select negative samples using a classification-based iterative voting procedure, and systematically compared the effects of negative sample selection on the performance of classification. We also propose an approach to estimate the probabilities for the predictions by SVM. Based on the selected negative samples, we compared nonlinear SVM based on gaussian kernel, linear SVM and linear logistic regression for both classification performance and probability assignments. Our results show that the probability assigned by SVM is more natural than logistic regression, and SVM also outperforms logistic regression for prediction.

It is possible to classify normal and DLBCL patients using the data from cDNA microarrays technique that monitoring gene expression. Machine learning techniques are well-known methods for classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a Genetic Programming based method to generate classifiers with high accuracy. The proposed method employs cluster of classifiers to vote for the result. Furthermore, the classifier is presented in form of a mathematical equation which is amendable to human interpretation.

Large protein families represent natural libraries of analogues of a given catalytic or protein function, thus making them ideal targets for the investigation of structure-function relationships in proteins. To this end, we have developed a new technique for analyzing large amounts of detailed molecular structure information focusing on the functional centers of homologous proteins. Our approach uses unsupervised machine learning, in particular, self-organizing maps. The information captured by a self-organizing map and stored in its reference models highlights the essential structure of the proteins under investigation and can be effectively used to study detailed structural differences and similarities among homologous proteins. Our preliminary results obtained with a prototype based on these techniques demonstrate that we can classify proteins and identify common and unique structures within a family and, more importantly, identify common and unique structural features of different conformations of the same protein. The approach developed here outperforms many of today's structure analysis tools. These tools are usually either limited by the number of proteins they can process at the same time or they are limited by the structural resolution they can accommodate, that is, many of the structural analysis tools that can handle multiple proteins at the same time limit themselves to secondary structure analysis and therefore miss fine structural nuances within proteins. It is worthwhile noting that the ability of our approach to analyze different conformations of the same protein is beyond the capabilities of multiple residue sequence alignment techniques.

SCHEMA was introduced by Frances Arnold and colleagues as a method for determining putative recombination sites of a protein on the basis of the full. (PDB) description of its structure. The present method provides an alternative to SCHEMA that is able to determine the same score from sequence data only. Circumventing the need for resolving the full structure enables the exploration of yet unresolved and even hypothetical sequences. p for protein design efforts. Deriving the SCHEMA score from a primary structure is achieved using a two step approach: first predicting a secondary structure from the sequence and then predicting the SCHEMA score from the predicted secondary structure. The correlation coefficient for the prediction is 0.88 and indicates the feasibility of replacing SCHEMA with little loss of precision.

Traditional analysis based on linear correlation between predicted and experimental data reveals their primitive relationships. Recently, some machine learning techniques such as artificial neural network (ANN)-based methods were applied to rind an accurate predictor. However, the ANN-predictor without interpretability is insufficient in knowledge discovery. This paper proposes an interpretable predictor using a rule-based decision tree method (named iPTREE) for accurately predicting protein stability changes upon single point mutations. Besides being a sign predictor, iPTREE can be used both as a model for verifying attributes effect, and as a rules miner in the protein stability change study. iPTREE is depending on features including mutation type (deleted and introduced residues), the relative solvent accessibility value (RSA), the experimental conditions (pH and temperature) and the local spatial environment. To evaluate the performance of iPTREE, a thermodynamic dataset consisting of 1615 mutations generated from ProTherm is used. The computer simulation shows that iPTREE has an accurate prediction for the direction of stability changes as high as 87%, which is significantly better than the ANN-predictor for the same features.

GBI has been extended to 1) Beam-wise GBI (B-GBI) by incorporating a beam search to improve its search capability, and 2) Decision Tree Graph-Based Induction (DT-GBI) to construct a decision tree for graph-structured data We applied B-GBI and DT-GBI to analyze the effectiveness of interferon therapy in the hepatitis dataset provided by Chiba University Hospital. Descriptive patterns were extracted by B-GBI and discriminative ones by DT-GBI using only the time sequence data of blood inspection and urinalysis. The discriminative patterns extracted by DT-GBI tend to be included in only relatively small number of patients and thus too specific. Thus, we tried to extract patterns which are both discriminative and descriptive by B-GBI. Furthermore, since there are exceptional situations (patients) with the extracted patterns, these patterns are further utilized to extract refined knowledge from the dataset. The preliminary results are reported with some of extracted patterns.

On the other hand, knowledge acquisition from data is called machine learning. These two are studied by separate research communities. We have proposed a method to utilize these two different knowledge sources and fuse them into an operational classifier under a framework of Ripple Down Rules (RDR) method. The method is further extended to a situation where an environment changes over time. The principle that unifies all of these is minimum description length principle. In this paper we report the performance evaluation of our method for two kinds of situations where: 1) the knowledge source is changed from the expert to data and vice versa at any time, and 2) both the knowledge source and environment is changed. Experiments were conducted to simulate building RDR trees for the above two situations using the datasets in UCI repository (with appropriate modification to simulate the environment change). The results are encouraging and indicate that our method works well in a situation in which the changes of the knowledge source and environment are coupled.

Our approach consists of obtaining a set of rules for generating presentation sheets by applying machine learning techniques to many pairs of technical papers and their presentation sheets collected from the World Wide Web. As a first step, in this paper, we propose a method for aligning technical papers and presentation sheets. Our method is based on Jing's method, which uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Although her method is useful to align short sentences in newspaper articles, it is inapplicable to align sentences in a paper including charts and long sentences. Therefore, we analyse features of papers and sheets, such as information from text appearance, and propose an alignment method that combines the use of these features and her method. The evaluation shows that our alignment method performed effectively.

Many methods have been proposed, such as Rocchio method, Naive bayes based method, and SVM based text classification method. These methods learn labeled text documents and then construct a classifier. A new coming text document's category can be predicted. However, these methods do not give the description of each category. In the machine learning field, there are many concept learning algorithms, such as, ID3 and CN2. This paper proposes a more robust algorithm to induce concepts from training examples, which is based on enumeration of all possible keywords combinations. Experimental results show that the rules produced by our approach have more precision and simplicity than that of other methods.

Least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) is an SVM version which involves equality instead of inequality constraints and works with a least squares cost function. This paper discusses least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) estimation algorithm and introduces applications of the novel method for the nonlinear control systems. Then identification of MIMO models and soft-sensor modeling based on least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM). is proposed. The simulation results show that the proposed method provides a powerful tool for identification and soft-sensor modeling and has promising application in industrial process applications.

A relatively simple and effective method to solve the imbalance problem is re-sampling, which contains under-sampling and over-sampling. A representative over-sampling approach is SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). However, it is not easy to decide the best distribution of minority and majority samples included in a given training set when SMOTE is applied to the imbalance situation. This paper presents an over-sampling expert system to ensemble classifiers trained on the data sets over-sampled at different rates. The proposed combination method, C-SMOTE, applied to several highly and moderately imbalanced data sets can automatically and intelligently obtain an optimal SMOTE rate, and shows improvement in prediction accuracy and overall F-measure on the minority class.

An outlier is a pattern that was either mislabeled in the training data, or inherently ambiguous and hard to recognize, therefore, it usually brings extra trouble for a learning task, either in debasing the performance or leading the learning process to be more complicated. In order to tackle the outlier problem, in this study, two strategies, i.e. restraining and eliminating, are presented regarding to ensemble learning methodology.

This paper presents a novel SVM-based approach for damage location identification in beam-like structures. The curvature mode shapes are used as inputs of the SVM. The proposed approach involves two steps. The first step uses support vector classification to obtain the structural damage probability distribution. The second step uses support vector regression to identify the precise damage location after reconstructing the training set. Furthermore, a series of simulations in the cantilever beams involving different damage scenarios (at different location and different extent), have been conducted to verify this method. In order to check the robustness of the input used in the analysis and to simulate the experimental uncertainties, artificial random noise has been generated numerically and added to noise-free data during the training of the SVM. The results show that this approach is a promising method for damage diagnosis.

The attributes of feature vectors based on characters are extracted. A training set is established and the machine learning models of automatic identification of transliterated names are obtained by testing polynomial Kernel functions; the knowledge cannot be acquired completely if we only use the machine learning model, which will affect the recall. Through careful error analysis, the base of recognition-rules is constructed as post-processing steps to overcome the-shortcoming of machine learning model. The results show that the method is efficient for identifying transliterated names from Chinese texts.

But the unpractical condition independence assumption of NBC greatly degrades its performance. There are two primary ways to improve NBC's performance. One is to relax the condition independence assumption in NBC. This method improves NBC's accuracy by searching additional condition dependencies among attributes of the samples in a scope. It usually involves in very complex search algorithms. Another is to change the representation of the samples by creating new attributes from the original attributes, and construct NBC from these new attributes while keeping the condition independence assumption. Key problem of this method is to guarantee strong condition independencies among the new attributes. In the paper, a new means of making attribute set, which maps the original attributes to new attributes according to the information geometry and Fisher score, is presented, and then the FS-NBC on the new attributes is constructed. The condition dependence relation among the new attributes theoretically is discussed. We prove that these new attributes are condition independent of each other under certain conditions. The experimental results show that our method improves performance of NBC excellently.

In this paper, we will discuss the quotient space model based bottom-up induction, i.e., hierarchical learning. Some approaches for learning the structural knowledge from data are presented. The main advantage of hierarchical induction is its efficiency, that is, the whole structure of data can be abstracted at once.

Processing and transforming such data to intelligible form for the human user is becoming one of the most urgent problems in near future. Neural networks and related statistical machine learning methods have turned out to be promising solutions. In many cases, the data matrix has both a spatial and a temporal dimension. Removing correlations and thus reducing the dimensionality is typically the first step in the processing. After this, higher-order statistical methods such as independent component analysis can often reveal the structure of the data by finding hidden factors. This can sometimes be enhanced by semi-blind techniques such as temporal filtering in order to use prior knowledge. Examples to be covered in the talk are biomedical fMRI data and long-term climate data, both having dimensionatities in the tens of thousands. Recent results are shown on brain activations to stimuli and on climate patterns.

Each decision variable is handled by an optimizer that uses a machine learning technique. At the beginning of each iteration, the decisions are selected randomly from their decision distributions. The performance evaluation is estimated during a short simulation run. The optimizers modify their selection-distributions for the decisions that prove to be "good" performance judged against an advancing threshold value. Then, a new set of decisions is generated for the next run. When the average performance reaches a good competency., the threshold value is advanced to a higher level. Thus, the optimizers are forced to learn toward the optimal solution. In this paper, after brief explanation of the approach, we present an application to a challenging engineering problem dealing with pressure-vessel design.

These catalog queries are defined as known item queries. As known item queries search for specific resources, it is important to manage them differently from other search types, such as area searches. We study how to identify known item queries in the context of a large academic institution's online public access catalog (OPAC), in which queries are issued via a simple keyword interface. We also examine how to recognize when a known item query has retrieved the item in question. Our approach combines techniques in machine learning, language modeling and machine translation evaluation metrics to build a classifier capable of distinguishing known item queries and correctly classifies titles for whether they are the known item sought with an 80% and 95% correlation to human performance, respectively on each task. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such work, which has the potential to streamline the user interface of both OPACs and digital libraries in support of known item searches.

This study follows a similar approach, but is in the area of sentiment classification-automatically classifying on-line review documents according to the overall sentiment expressed in them. This paper presents a prototype system that has been developed to perform sentiment categorization of Web search results. It assists users to quickly focus on recommended (or non -recommended)information by classifying Web search results into four categories: positive, negative, neutral, and non-review documents, by using an automatic classifier based on a supervised machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM).

By general documents, we mean documents that can belong to any one of a number of specific genres, including presentations, book chapters, technical papers, brochures, reports, and letters. Previously, methods have been proposed mainly for title extraction from research papers. It has not been clear whether it could be possible to conduct automatic title extraction from general documents. As a case study, we consider extraction from Office including Word and PowerPoint. In our approach, we annotate titles in sample documents (for Word and PowerPoint respectively) and take them as training data, train machine learning models, and perform title extraction using the trained models. Our method is unique in that we mainly utilize formatting information such as font size as features in the models. It turns out that the use of formatting information can lead to quite accurate extraction from general documents. Precision and recall for title extraction from Word is 0.810 and 0.837 respectively, and precision and recall for title extraction from PowerPoint is 0.875 and 0.895 respectively in an experiment on intranet data. Other important new findings in this work include that we can train models in one domain and apply them to another domain, and more surprisingly we can even train models in one language and apply them to another language. Moreover, we can significantly improve search ranking results in document retrieval by using the extracted titles.

This situation is common in "portal" style digital libraries, which are built by harvesting content from many disparate sources, typically using the Open Archives Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). By studying the activity of users in an experimental system, we find that taxonomies built or populated using machine-learning (or "AI") techniques provide a potentially useful avenue for browsing in this digital library scenario.

The outcome is a multi-layer tool, which has shown the capability to accomplish detection and prediction tasks with tractable results. An example of identification and prediction of volatility clusters in currency-exchange time returns is summarized.

Boosting was recently proposed as a simple and efficient framework for intelligent combination of the clarity and stability of the analytical and parsimonious statistical models with accuracy of the adaptive data-driven models. Encouraging results of the boosting application to symbolic volatility forecasting have also been reported. However, accurate volatility modeling does not always warranty optimal decision making that leads to acceptable performance of the portfolio strategy. In this work, a boosting-based framework for a direct trading strategy and portfolio optimization is introduced. Due to inherent adaptive control of the parameter space dimensionality, this technique can work with very large pools of base strategies and financial instruments that are usually prohibitive for other portfolio optimization frameworks. Unlike existing approaches, this framework can be effectively used for the coupled optimization of the portfolio capital/asset allocation and dynamic trading strategies. Generated portfolios of trading strategies not only exhibit stable and robust performance but also remain interpretable. Encouraging preliminary results based on real market data are presented and discussed.

This paper focuses on one important case - computerized decision whether a certain scientific article contains numerical data of interest for a specialized research database or not. The area of applications covers activities of most major research data centers, with applications ranging from proteomics to fusion plasma research. As a part of coordinated research on plasma-process bibliography databases at the National Institute for Fusion Science in Japan (NIFS), we have recently developed a linux system that automates the process of data collection, data extraction and database input, with a customizable interface to relevance-assessment software modules. Here we deal with the article relevance assessment from two major viewpoints: a rule-based decision making system based on the analysis of figure and table caption texts, and a machine learning system that analyzes html abstracts of the articles. It is demonstrated that a combination of the two methods may result in a highly specific and sensitive relevance assessment system. Features unique in atomic and molecular data mining are also discussed.

The q-matrix method is a fault-tolerant teaching tool that uses machine learning techniques to automatically assess and correct student knowledge. This method creates a concept model of an instructional topic, based solely on student responses to tutorial questions, and uses this model to evaluate and redirect student learning. We describe the q-matrix method and present an experiment to verify that the method can effectively predict which concepts need further review, and may identify areas of concern better than students do on their own.

At the same time, it is typical for practice that there are several viewpoints at the numerical pair-wise comparison of entities. In this work, we systematically exploit the fact that any kernel function on a set of entities of arbitrary kind embeds that set into a linear space in which it plays the role of inner product. To fuse the kernels heuristically suggested by different experts into an entire learning technique, we propose to consider Cartesian product of the respective number of linear spaces, each supplied with a specific kernel as specific inner product. The main requirement placed upon the fusion principle is avoidance of discrete selection in eliminating redundant kernels with the purpose of achieving acceptable computational complexity. A real-valued feature on the given set of entities defines, actually, a simplest kernel, therefore, the proposed kernel fusion principle is, at the same time, a principle of minimizing the feature space dimensionality in feature-based machine learning.

The process generally involves one or more radiologists labelling regions of the lung parenchyma as representative of a particular condition. The character of these regions falls broadly into two groups: those which the radiologists present and, it is supposed, all others would agree are highly representative of a particular pattern; and the regions which, although deemed to belong to the class in question, are not necessarily perfect examples and need not possess an homogeneous texture throughout. In short, the data can be clean or contain noise. There are circumstances in which information from only one of these categories may be available and it may be necessary to train a machine learning algorithm and classify regions which belong to the other type or are of unknown origin. Here we evaluate the decrease in accuracy associated with such incomplete information using a number of common classifiers.

In this work we investigate a class of latent factor models with hidden noisy-or units that let us decouple high dimensional vectors of observable binary random variables using a 'small' number of hidden binary factors. Since the problem of learning of such models from data is intractable, we develop its variational approximation. We analyze special properties of the optimization problem, in particular its "built-in" regularization effect and discuss its importance for model recovery. We test the noisy-or model on an image deconvolution problem and illustrate the ability of the variational method to succesfully learn the underlying image components. Finally, we apply the latent noisy-or model to analyze citations in a large collection of Statistical Machine Learning papers and show the benefit of the model and algorithms by discovering useful and semantically sound components characterizing the dataset.

Many classifiers have been developed recently. However, the performance of these classifiers is proportional to the knowledge obtained from the training data. As a result, traditional classifiers can not perform very well when the training data space is very limited. In this paper, we propose a new approach to expand the training data space (ETDS) using emerging patterns (EPs) [4] and genetic methods (GMs) [7]. EPs are those itemsets whose supports in one class are significantly higher than their supports in the other classes. GMs are evolutionary methods that incorporate computational techniques inspired by biology [8]. We combine the power of EPs and GMs to expand the training data space before applying standard classifiers. The expansion process is performed by generating more training instances using four techniques. An extensive experimental evaluation carried out on a number of datasets shows that our approach has a great impact on the performance of many traditional classifiers.

This is an important problem in developing generally applicable methods in machine learning and data mining for classification and prediction. This paper intorduces a new technique for discretization based on successive pseudo deletion of instances to reduce the conflicting instances, i.e., by reduction of noise in the database. Such successive pseudo deletions in the database are performed by introducing threshold points on maximum information gain boundary points of the continuous attributes. Our empirical experiments show that the state of the art algorithms for learning, such as CN2, C4.5, Naive-Bayes and RISE give improvement in performances with the cliscretized output from our method than outputs with other state of the art discretization algorithms.

Recent advances in applications of CI methods to data understanding are presented, implementation of methods in the GhostMiner data mining package [1] developed in our laboratory described, new directions outlined and challenging open problems posed. To illustrate the advantages of different techniques, a single dataset is exposed to the many-sided analysis.

It has been used in many practical applications. A characteristic of the USM that is affected by friction is strong nonlinearity, which makes it difficult to control. This paper proposes a position control method for the USM using Support Vector Regression (SVR), which is a regression method for Support Vector Machines. It is a newly proposed method of machine learning that does not have the disadvantages of a Neural Network such as a large number of learning times, local-minima, overfitting and so on. The proposed method uses an SVR controller combined with a PI controller. The SVR controller performs nonlinear input-output mapping of the USM. The learning of the SVR controller uses training data obtained from experiments. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is confirmed by experiments.

In most applications the result of applying a single filter is usually unsatisfactory. Appropriate fusion of the results of several different filters, such as median, local average, and Wiener filters can resolve this difficulty. Many different techniques already exist in literatures. In this work, a reinforcement learning agent will be proposed. We use this novel method as an effective way to find appropriate weights for various filters. During learning, the agent takes some actions (i.e., different weights for filters) to change the environment (the image quality). Using the reference image, the RL agent is provided by a scalar evaluation determined objectively. The agent uses these objective rewards-punishments to explore/exploit the solution space. The values obtained using this method can be used as very valuable knowledge to initiate weights for a Q-matrix. A subjective reinforcement learning method can use such initial weights to start its work from an acceptable level of knowledge.

In addition, uncertainty in the prediction of the financial time series has attracted interest from mangy researchers. In this study, we present recent developments in stock market prediction models, and discuss their strengths and limitations. In addition, we investigate diverse macroeconomic factors and their issues in the prediction of stock market. From this study, we found that incorporating event information into the prediction models plays important roles for more accurate prediction.

A multi-step damage identification approach based on support vector machine (SVM) and modal frequencies is presented to locate and estimate the severity of the damage in beam-like structures. In the first section, the basic theory of the support vector machines is briefly reviewed. Damage features formed by vibration modal frequencies are used as characteristic parameters. Firstly, the possible damage locations are detected using support vector classification according to the probability distribution. Then after reconstructing the training set, the precise damage position is identified using support vector regression. Finally the damage severity is also identified. A series of experiments involving different damage scenarios (including cracks at different location and different sizes in the supported beams), have been conducted to verify this method. The results show that the support vector machine is a powerful and promising method for damage detection.

Hort16A fruit are most susceptible to developing physiological pit disorder. Prediction was based on various measurements made on samples of fruit assessed at maturity clearance and information that describes the geographic location and general information about the orchard where the fruit were grown. As a classification problem, the importance of variables and predictive accuracy was assessed using a range of machine learning algorithms. The various analysis techniques used tended to agree that the collection date when an orchard line,vas cleared for harvest, orchard locational attributes, fruit dry matter content and fruit firmness measurements were the variables most useful in formulating predictions about development physiological pit disorder during storage. Estimation of the achievable prediction accuracy demonstrated that fruit lines susceptible to physiological pit could be identified by applying machine learning techniques to industry databases, and that a 30% improvement in predictability over chance was possible.

After the training procedure, the adaptive system weights are fixed and the system is tested with unlabeled data. Recently, exploiting the unlabeled data to improve classification performance has been proposed in the machine learning community. In this paper, we present an information theoretic approach based on density divergence minimization to obtain an extended training algorithm using unlabeled data during testing. The simulations for classification problems suggest that our method can improve the performance of adaptive system in the application phase.

Recently, it was shown that cortical neurons are not simple threshold devices, emitting an AP each time a fixed voltage threshold is reached, but that the emission of an AP partly depends on the rate of change of the membrane potential preceeding an AP. In this paper we investigate systematically which features of the membrane potential lead to an AP by means of Machine Learning methods. We use Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to discriminate between trajectories of the membrane potential which lead to an AP within the next ms and trajectories which do not lead to the initiation of an AP. For every point in a trajectory of the membrane potential (MP) we compute a set of 11 features and use a forward selection algorithm to find out the relevant features for the occurence of an AP. Based on the results we construct a reduced prediction model. This model suggests that AP occurences can be predicted best by a combination of the 1st temporal derivative of the MP at distance to the AP maximum, the MP itself and the mean MP over a longer range.

To infer gene regulatory networks from these data with effective computational tools has attracted intensive efforts from artificial intelligence and machine learning. Here, we use a recurrent neural network (RNN), trained with particle swarm optimization (PSO), to investigate the behaviors of regulatory networks. The experimental results, on a synthetic data set and a real data set, show that the proposed model and algorithm can effectively capture the dynamics of the gene expression time series and are capable of revealing regulatory interactions between genes.

It is a machine learning approach by integrating probabilistic neura network (PNN) with conformational energy function (CEF) based on chemico-physical knowledge of amino acids. In this method, firstly, the principal components are extracted from selected protein structures with lower sequence identity, and an initial matrix of contact map is constructed by K-L expansion. Secondly, PNN is used for predicting the long-range interaction of amino acids in protein. In particular, this method uses the CEF and chemico-physical characteristics of amino acids to run the PNN predictor. Consequently, it was found that our proposed method is better than the existed methods, such as the hybrid method of HMMSTR and the correlated mutation analysis method. As a result, this method can accurately predict 31% of contacts at a distance cutoff of 8 angstrom for proteins whose sequence length is up to 200.

One of the strengths of this approach is the ability to deal easily with arbitrarily structured data by means of the kernel function. In this paper we propose a kernel for chemical compounds which is based on the idea of computing optimal assignments between atoms of two different molecules including information about their neighborhood. As a byproduct this leads to a new class of kernel functions. We demonstrate how the necessary computations can he carried out efficiently. We compare our method against the marginalized graph kernels by Kashima et al. and show its good performance on classifying toxicological and human intestinal absorption data.

Gaussian Process(GP) can be viewed as an RBF neural network which have infinite number of hidden neurons. On regression problems, they can predict both the mean value and the variance of the given sample. Boosting is one of the most important recent developments in machine learning. Classification problems have dominated research on boosting to date. On the other hand, the application of boosting of regression has received less investigation. In this paper, we develop two boosting methods of GPs for regression according to the characteristic of them. We compare the performance of our ensembles with other boosting algorithms and find that our methods are more stable and essentially have less over-fitting problems than the other methods.

This paper is dedicated to considering problems on the estimation of a density function simply from its marginal distributions. The possibility of the learning problem is first investigated and a uniqueness proposition involving a large family of distribution functions is proposed. The learning problem is then reformulated into an optimization task which is studied and applied to Gaussian mixture models (GMM) via the generalized expectation maximization procedure (GEM) and Monte Carlo method. Experimental results show that our approach for GMM, only using partial information of the coordinates of the samples, can obtain satisfactory performance, which in turn verifies the proposed reformulation and proposition.

The key idea is to perform simultaneous incremental optimization of both the weight parameters and their prior hyperparameters using data arriving successively one at a time. Algorithms for efficient sequential regularized dynamic learning rate training of the weights and gradient-descent training of their corresponding individual priors are derived. It is shown that this fast sequential RVM can outperform similar Bayesian kernel methods, like: batch RVM, fast RVM, variational RVM, and Gaussian Processes on multistep ahead forecasting of time series.

These algorithms compare an unseen protein sequence with all the identified protein sequences and returned the higher scored protein sequences. As the sizes of the protein sequence databases are very large, it is a very time consuming job to perform exhaustive comparison of existing protein sequence. Therefore, there is a need to build an improved classification system for effectively identifying protein sequences. In this paper, a recently developed machine learning algorithm referred to as the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used to classify protein sequences with ten classes of super-families downloaded from a public domain database. A comparative study on system performance is conducted between ELM and the main conventional neural network classifier - Backpropagation Neural Networks. Results show that ELM needs up to four orders of magnitude less training time compared to BP Network. The classification accuracy of ELM is also higher than that of BP network.

A special strength is the use of a kernel function to introduce nonlinearity and to deal with arbitrarily structured data. Usually the kernel function depends on certain parameters, which, together with other parameters of the SVM, have to be tuned to achieve good results. However, finding good parameters can become a real computational burden as the number of parameters and the size of the dataset increases. In this paper we propose an algorithm to deal with the model selection problem, which is based on the idea of learning an Online Gaussian Process model of the error surface in parameter space and sampling systematically at points for which the so called expected improvement is highest. Our experiments show that on this way we can find good parameters very efficiently.

But it requires to solve a quadratic optimization(QP) problem so that its training time increases dramatically with the increase of training set. Hence, standard SVM with batch learning has difficulty in handling large scale problems. In this paper, we introduce a SVM accelerator, called Sequential Bootstrapped SVM (SeqSVM), to speed up the training of SVM. At the beginning, the SeqSVM trains a SVM classifier on a small part of all training samples and then keeps on selecting the so-called convex hull samples from the given large training set to retrain this SVM until all convex hull samples are selected. The key principle in our method is to help the SVM pick the convex hull sample that is wrongly classified by the current SVM and furthest from the current SVM solution. The convex hull sample, which disagrees most with the SVM solution, will fie on the convex hull of each class distribution and all support vectors lie on the convex hull in the case of linearly separable classes. Two difficulties have to be overcome. The first is that the SeqSVM's iterations will take too many if there are too many support vectors. The second is that when the class distributions are not separable, it is not easy to pick convex hull samples. In this paper, we show how these two difficulties are overcome. Experimental results on both artificial database and benchmark databases demonstrated the effectiveness of proposed algorithm to reduce the learning time of SVM on the whole training set.

We have developed a genetic algorithm based fuzzy ID3 method, which can build a fuzzy decision tree to summarize the regularities existing in the data set. Using this method, we then propose a road scene analysis system, by which natural element segmentation rules can be learned from several road scene images. In the image analysis phase, the natural element regions are obtained through inference on these learned rules. Moreover, we can apply image groundtruthing to further improve the classification accuracy. The testing results have demonstrated that the object segmentation accuracy is quite high.

The system is implemented via self-learning using a self-organizing tree map (SOTM) neural network. Our proposed method involves the construction of regions of interest from retrieved images using Edge Flow model, and the grouping of the regions into a single perceptually significant entity. This knowledge is fed into a set of unsupervised relevance feedback learning modules based on the SOTM to guide the adaptation of relevance feedback parameters through a machine learning approach without user interaction. Optimal tradeoff between the user workload in the interactive process and user subjectivity is then be explored by incorporating a semi-automatic retrieval strategy. Experimental results indicate that this system, with automatic and semiautomatic adaptations, can minimize user interaction, optimize precision, as well as reduce performance errors caused user subjectivity.

Despite the significant research, these methods remain only loosely related. In this paper, we give theoretically an explicit relation between spectral clustering and weighted kernel principal component analysis (WKPCA). We show that spectral clustering is not only a method for data clustering, but also for feature extraction. We are then able to reinterpret the spectral clustering algorithm in terms of WKPCA and propose our spectral feature analysis (SFA) method. The spectral features extracted by SFA can capture the distinguishing information of data from different classes effectively. Finally some experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of our method.

We investigate the effect of curriculum, i.e., a selection of tasks and the order in which they are learned, on the consolidation of task knowledge. Relevant background material on knowledge transfer and consolidation using multiple task learning (MTL) neural networks is reviewed. A large MTL network is used as the long-term memory structure and task rehearsal overcomes the stability-plasticity problem and the loss of prior knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that curriculum has an noticeable effect on the accuracy of consolidated knowledge particularly for the first few tasks that are learned. The results also suggest that, for given set of tasks and training examples, the mean accuracy of consolidated domain knowledge converges to the same level regardless of the curriculum. This is caused by the averaging effect of sequential consolidation.

Typically, several data sources, including historical usage, billing, payment, network, customer service, and demographic data, can be used in a predictive model. However, in some cases, e.g., in the prepaid customer segment, there is often little data available except for the Call Detail Record (CDR) data. In this paper, we tackle this challenging problem, using significantly delayed CDR data as the primary data source to predict customer behavior. We extract calling links, i.e., who called whom, from the CDR data, and propose several distance measures based on calling links. We demonstrate that, by using information derived from the calling links alone as inputs to a neural network model, an acceptable accuracy for predicting churn (customer switching from one service provider to another) can be achieved. Calling links can also be used to identify calling communities, which may be used for targeted marketing campaigns and help predict acceptance of marketing offers.

The important factors affecting the sedimentation process such as waves, wind, tides, surge, river discharge, etc. are studied, the corresponding time series data is analysed and the most important variables behind the process are chosen as the inputs. Two ML methods are used: MLP ANN and M5 model tree. The latter is a collection of piece-wise linear regression models, each being an expert for a particular region of the input space. The models are trained on the data collected during 1992-1998 and tested by the data of 1999-2000. The predictive accuracy of the models is found to be adequate for the potential use in the operational decision making.

Classification in this case needs involvement of an expert who observes the magnitude and trends of the signals in addition to any a priori information that might be available. In this paper an approach for automating this classification procedure is presented. Firstly, a segmentation algorithm is applied to segment the measured signals. Secondly, the salient features of these segments are extracted using boundary energy method. Based on the measured data and extracted features classifiers to assign classes to the segments are built; they employ Decision Trees, ANNs and Support Vector Machines. The methodology was tested for classifying sub-surface soil using measured data from Cone Penetration Testing and satisfactory results were obtained.

In it, first the prediction intervals for in-sample data using clustering techniques to identify the distinguishable regions in input space with similar distributions of model errors are constructed. Then regression model is built for in-sample data using computed prediction intervals as targets, and, finally, this model is applied to estimate the prediction intervals for out-of-sample data. The method was tested on artificial and real hydrologic data sets using various machine learning techniques. Preliminary results show that the method is superior to other methods estimating the prediction intervals. A new method for evaluating performance for estimating prediction intervals is proposed as well.

However, in case the dimension of the data set is high, then the conventional kernel density estimators suffer poor convergence rates of the pointwise mean square error (MSE) and the integrated mean square error (IMSE). Therefore, design of a novel kernel density estimator that overcomes this problem has been a great challenge for many years. This paper proposes a relaxed model of the variable kernel density estimation and analyzes its performance in data classification applications. It is proved in this paper that, in terms of pointwise MSE, the convergence rate of the relaxed variable kernel density estimator can approach O(n) regardless of the dimension of the data set, where it is the number of sampling instances. Experiments with the data classification applications have shown that the improved convergence rate of the pointwise MSE leads to higher prediction accuracy. In fact, the experimental results have also shown that the data classifier constructed based on the relaxed variable kernel density estimator is capable of delivering the same level of prediction accuracy as the SVM with the Gaussian kernel.

Three different data projection techniques, namely, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Local Linear Embedding (LLE) were experimented to project the facial motion onto lower dimensional subspace to estimate the intrinsic dimension of the facial expression data. The classification approach relies on a two-step strategy on the top of projected facial motion information obtained from sequence of facial expression images. First, a bank of linear classifier was applied on projected data and decision made by the linear classifiers was coalesced to produce a characteristic signature for each universal facial expressions. The signatures thus computed from the training data set were used to train discrete Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to learn the underlying model for each facial expression. The performances of each data representations in classifying the facial expressions were compared using five fold cross validation on a database of 488 video sequences that include 97 subjects. To further illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach and to better understand the effects of a number of factors that are detrimental to the facial expression recognition using only visual data were conducted. The first empirical analysis was conducted on a database consisting of 108 facial expressions collected from TV broad cast and labeled by human coder for subsequent analysis. The second experiment was conducted on facial expressions obtained from 21 subjects by showing the subjects six different clips of movies chosen in a manner to arouse spontaneous emotional reactions that would produce natural facial expression.

How to construct a solution to a multiclass problem by efficiently combining the outputs of binary classifiers is a very important issue in neural network and machine learning research. In this paper, we present three different algorithms for selecting binary classifiers for min-max modular classifier to improve its response performance. We also give a theoretical performance estimation of the proposed algorithms. We prove that quadratic complexity of original min-max combination can be reduced to the level of linear complexity in the number of binary classifiers. The experimental results indicate that our proposed algorithms are efficient and effective.

For classification tasks, it can lead to increased accuracy or to reduced computational costs. In this paper we present an experimental study that shows how a very simple heuristic, namely using C4.5 for variable selection, can maintain classification accuracy in many benchmark problems while significantly reducing running times. In addition, we construct an ensemble that combines classifiers using the variables selected by C4.5 with classifiers that use the full variable set. Experimental results show that by using the selected variable set with C4.5, the classification accuracy is similar to that obtained by using the full variable set. This suggests that using C4.5 is a good approach for variable selection in classification tasks.

In spite of the wide-ranged applications and many learning algorithms, the theoretical properties have not been clarified. When the grammar is parametrized, we can regard the production system of words with the grammar as a statistical learning machine, which falls into a singular machine. In this paper, the performance of the system is revealed based on the algebraic geometrical method, which enables us to analyze singular machines. The result helps to estimate the grammar structure.

To prevent this, new biological therapies, such as Infliximab, have been developed. The present analysis is based on an expanded access program in which 511 RA patients with chronic refractory disease were treated with Infliximab. They received a standard dose of 3 mg/kg on weeks 0, 6, 14 and 22. On week 22, the treating rheumatologist had to evaluate the progress of every patient and decide whether the current dose should be increased or not. This decision can be considered as a measure of insufficient response. In the present analysis, two machine learning classification techniques (support vector machines and multilayered perceptrons) are implemented to model the decision to give a dose increase. Their performance on increasingly multivariate real-life data will be studied and compared to classical statistics. Results show that both classical statistics, SVM and MLP - if configured well show good classification performance. However, as the number of features increases, the performance decreases. SVMs suffer to a lesser degree from this curse of dimensionality.

Generally, time series forecasting methods such as exponential smoothing are commonly used for sales forecasting and have made great contribution in practice, but efforts on looking for superior forecasting method are still made by practitioners and academia. This paper deals with the application of a novel neural network technique, support vector machines (SVMs), in sales forecasting. The objective of this paper is to examine the feasibility of SVMs in sales forecasting. A data set from a manufacturing firm in China is used for the experiment to test the validity of SVMs. The experiment shows SVMs a better method in sales forecasting.

The trajectories are represented as motion time series and modelled using Chebyshev polynomial approximations. Trajectory clustering is then performed to discover patterns of similar object motion. The coefficients of the basis ftinctions are used as an input feature vector to a Self-Organising Map which can learn similarities between object trajectories in an unsupervised manner. It is shown that applying machine learning techniques in the Chebyshev parameter subspace leads to significant performance gains over previous approaches that encode trajectories as point-based flow (PBF) vectors. Experiments using the PETS'04 tracking dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of clustering in the parameter subspace and improvements in overall classification accuracy in comparison with PBF vector encoding.

Approximations of Kolmogorov complexity or entropy of biological sequences are already well known to be useful in extracting similarity information between such sequences in the interest, for example, of ortholog detection. As is well known, the exact Kolmogorov complexity is not algorithmically computable. In practice one can approximate it by computable compression methods. However, such compression methods do not provide a good approximation to Kolmogorov complexity for short sequences. Herein is suggested a new approach to overcome the problem that compression approximations may not work well on short sequences. This approach is inspired by new, conditional computations of Kolmogorov entropy. A main contribution of the empirical work described shows the new set of entropy-based machine learning attributes provides good separation between positive (ortholog) and negative (non-ortholog) data - better than with good, previously known alternatives (which do not employ some means to handle short sequences well). Also empirically compared are the new entropy based attribute set and a number of other, more standard similarity attributes sets commonly used in genomic analysis. The various similarity attributes are evaluated by cross validation, through boosted decision tree induction C5.0, and by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The results point to the conclusion: the new, entropy based attribute set by itself is not the one giving the best prediction; however, it is the best attribute set for use in improving the other, standard attribute sets when conjoined with them.

Evolutionary Approach for Automated Discovery of Censored Production Rules	PROCEEDINGS OF WORLD ACADEMY OF SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY, VOL 10	Proceedings of World Academy of Science Engineering and Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference of the World-Academy-of-Science-Engineering-and-Technology	DEC 16-18, 2005	Cracow, POLAND			Censored Production Rule; Data Mining; Machine Learning; Evolutionary Algorithms	ALGORITHM; KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEM	In the recent past, there has been an increasing interest in applying evolutionary methods to Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) and a number of successful applications of Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Genetic Programming (GP) to KDD have been demonstrated. The most predominant representation of the discovered knowledge is the standard Production Rules (PRs) in the form If P Then D. The PRs, however, are unable to handle exceptions and do not exhibit variable precision. The Censored Production Rules (CPRs), an extension of PRs, were proposed by Michalski & Winston that exhibit variable precision and supports an efficient mechanism for handling exceptions. A CPR is an augmented production rule of the form: If P Then D Unless C, where C (Censor) is an exception to the rule. Such rules are employed in situations, in which the conditional statement 'If P Then D' holds frequently and the assertion C holds rarely. By using a rule of this type we are free to ignore the exception conditions, when the resources needed to establish its presence are tight or there is simply no information available as to whether it holds or not. Thus, the 'If P Then D' part of the CPR expresses important information, while the Unless C part acts only as a switch and changes the polarity of D to similar to D. This paper presents a classification algorithm based on evolutionary approach that discovers comprehensible rules with exceptions in the form of CPRs. The proposed approach has flexible chromosome encoding, where each chromosome corresponds to a CPR. Appropriate genetic operators are suggested and a fitness function is proposed that incorporates the basic constraints on CPRs. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

However, an alternative approach orthogonal to this approach comes out, which is called a reduction. In general for a given specific problem this reduction approach studies how to convert an original problem into subproblems. This paper proposes a formal modeling language to support this reduction approach. We show three examples from the wide area of learning problems. The benefit is a fast prototyping of algorithms for a given new problem.

Two methods are combined, one qualitative or symbolic and the other quantitative or numeric, which are deemed suitable for many clustering contexts, data analysis, concept exploring and knowledge discovery. These two methods may be classified as inductive learning techniques. In this model, they are introduced to build "long term" knowledge about past queries and concepts in a collection of documents. The "long term" knowledge can guide and assist the user to formulate an initial query and can be exploited in the process of retrieving relevant information. The different kinds of knowledge are organized in different points of view. This may be considered an enrichment of the exploration level which is coherent with the concept of document/query structure.

At the same time, our approach can reduce dimensionality by constructing more relevant attributes. Fitness of each projection measures how easy is to classify the dataset after applying the projection. This is quickly computed by a Simple Linear Perceptron.

Word sense disambiguation is a current area of investigation in which verbs have the dominant role. Generally verbs have more senses than the other types of words in the average and detecting these features for verbs may lead to some improvements for other word types. In this paper we have considered only the syntactical features that can be obtained from the corpus and tested by using some famous machine learning algorithms.

A Cumulative Learning Approach to Data Mining Employing Censored Production Rules (CPRs)	PROCEEDINGS OF WORLD ACADEMY OF SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY, VOL 7	Proceedings of World Academy of Science Engineering and Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference of the World-Academy-of-Science-Engineering-and-Technology	AUG 26-28, 2005	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC			Censored production rules; cumulative learning; data mining; machine learning		Knowledge is indispensable but voluminous knowledge becomes a bottleneck for efficient processing. A great challenge for data mining activity is the generation of large number of potential rules as a result of mining process. In fact sometimes result size is comparable to the original data. Traditional data mining pruning activities such as support do not sufficiently reduce the huge rule space. Moreover, many practical applications are characterized by continual change of data and knowledge, thereby making knowledge voluminous with each change. The most predominant representation of the discovered knowledge is the standard Production Rules (PRs) in the form If P Then D. Michalski & Winston proposed Censored Production Rules (CPRs), as an extension of production rules, that exhibit variable precision and supports an efficient mechanism for handling exceptions. A CPR is an augmented production rule of the form: If P Then D Unless C, where C (Censor) is an exception to the rule. Such rules are employed in situations in which the conditional statement 'If P Then D' holds frequently and the assertion C holds rarely. By using a rule of this type we are free to ignore the exception conditions, when the resources needed to establish its presence, are tight or there is simply no information available as to whether it holds or not. Thus the 'If P Then D' part of the CPR expresses important information while the Unless C part acts only as a switch changes the polarity of D to similar to D. In this paper a scheme based on Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) interpretation of a CPR is suggested for discovering CPRs from the discovered flat PRs. The discovery of CPRs from flat rules would result in considerable reduction of the already discovered rules. The proposed scheme incrementally incorporates new knowledge and also reduces the size of knowledge base considerably with each episode. Examples are given to demonstrate the behaviour of the proposed scheme. The suggested cumulative learning scheme would be useful in mining data streams.

As the monogenetic strategy retains only the optimum individual, the memory requirement is dramatically reduced and no crossover circuitry is needed, thereby ensuring the requisite silicon area is kept to a minimum. Consequently, depending on application requirements, OIMGA allows the investigation of solutions that warrant either larger GA populations or individuals of greater length. The results given in this paper demonstrate that both the performance of OIMGA and its convergence time are superior to those of existing hardware GA implementations. Local convergence is achieved in OIMGA by retaining elite individuals, while population diversity is ensured by continually searching for the best individuals in fresh regions of the search space.

In our previous work, a number of approaches to bias and guide the learning process have been proposed aiming at more stable learning results and less susceptibility to overfitting. Those methods support the learner by incorporating background knowledge into the optimisation process. In this paper, we focus on one specific form of knowledge, namely vocabulary knowledge implicitly contained in the model of the respective application domain, as a source to enhance the learning of similarity measures.

However, the complexity of the alignment task especially for large ontologies requires automated support for the creation of alignment methods. When looking at current ontology alignment methods one can see that they are either not optimized for given ontologies or their optimization by machine learning means is mostly restricted to the extensional definition of ontologies. With APFEL (Alignment Process Feature Estimation and Learning) we present a machine learning approach that explores the user validation of initial alignments for optimizing alignment methods. The methods are based on extensional and intensional ontology definitions. Core to APFEL is the idea of a generic alignment process, the steps of which may be represented explicitly. APFEL then generates new hypotheses for what might be useful features and similarity assessments and weights them by machine learning approaches. APFEL compares favorably in our experiments to competing approaches.

We consider the MIPS FunCat classification scheme, in which each gene is annotated with one or more classes selected from a given functional class hierarchy. This setting presents two important challenges to machine learning: (1) each instance is labeled with a set of classes instead of just one class, and (2) the classes are structured in a hierarchy; ideally the learning algorithm should also take this hierarchical information into account. Predictive clustering trees generalize decision trees and can be applied to a wide range of prediction tasks by plugging in a suitable distance metric. We define an appropriate distance metric for hierarchical multi-classification and present experiments evaluating this approach on a number of data sets that are available for yeast.

A pre-processing step uses Laws' convolution kernels to reveal microstructural patterns of water temperature. Given a map point, a numerical vector containing information on local structural properties is generated. This vector is forwarded to a multi-layer perceptron classifier that is trained to recognise texture patterns generated by positive and negative instances of eddy structures. The proposed system achieves high recognition accuracy with fast and robust learning results over a range of different combinations of statistical measures of texture properties. Detection results are characterised by a very low rate of false positives. The latter is particularly important since meddies occupy only a small portion of SST map area.

Responding to this problem, many researchers have made a substantial amount of effort to improve Naive Bayes via selecting relevant attributes subsets in which attributes are conditionally independent. Interested in this approach, we present a novel algorithm called Evolutional Naive Bayes (simply ENB). Our algorithm, selects relevant attributes subsets by carrying an evolutional search through the whole space of attributes. Our motivation is to improve Naive Bayes ' accuracy in domains that include redundant attributes without degrading Naive Bayes ' accuracy in domains that don ' t. We experimentally tested our algorithm measured by accuracy, using the whole 36 UCI datasets recommended by Weka([1]), and compared it to Naive Bayes, SBC[2] and WRAP([3]). The experimental results shows that our algorithm outperforms Naive Bayes measured by classification accuracy significantly and retains the conceptual simplicity and direct theoretical foundation of Naive Bayes.

But it can only deal with the discrete attributes. Many discretization algorithms have been used at present, but there is not the complete criterion of the best discretization, it is difficult to get more satisfactory result for most algorithms. A new method for discretization based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is presented in this paper. We look upon the position of one kind demarcation points as a particle to search for its best position on the premise of keeping the primary partition capability in the discrete decision table, and there is little conflictive data. The experimental results prove the validity of this method.

In practice, some dental implants do not succeed. Important questions in this regard concern whether machine learning techniques could be used to predict if an implant will be successful and which are the best techniques for this problem. This paper presents a comparative study on three machine learning techniques for prediction of success of dental implants. The techniques compared here are: (a) support vector machines (SVM); (b) weighted support vector machines; and (c) constructive RBF neural networks (RBF-DDA) with parameter selection. We present a number of simulations using real-world data. The simulations were carried out using 10-fold cross-validation and the results show that the methods achieve comparable performance, yet RBF-DDA had the advantage of building smaller classifiers.

S	Kecman, V		Negoita, MG; Reusch, B		Kecman, V			Basics of machine learning by support vector machines	Real World Applications of Computational Intelligence	STUDIES IN FUZZINESS AND SOFT COMPUTING		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Knowledge-Based Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems	SEP, 2004	Wellington, NEW ZEALAND	Royal Soc New Zealand, IPENZ, New Zealand Trade & Enterprise, Telecom, Allied Telesyn, Positively Wellington Business	Wellington Inst Technol			Here, we talk about the (machine) learning from empirical data (i.e., examples, samples, measurements, records, patterns or observations) by applying support vector machines (SVMs) a.k.a. kernel machines'. The basic aim of this chapter is to give, as far as possible, a condensed (but systematic) presentation of a novel learning paradigm embodied in SVMs. Our focus Will be on the constructive learning algorithms for both the classification (pattern recognition) and regression (function approximation) problems. Consequently, we will not go into all the subtleties and details of the statistical learning theory (SLT) and structural risk minimization (SRM) which are theoretical foundations for the learning algorithms presented below. This seems more appropriate for the application oriented readers. The theoretically minded and interested reader may find all extensive presentation of both the SLT and SRM in 4, 15, 23, 31, 33]. Instead of diving into a theory, a quadratic programming based learning leading to parsimonious SVMs will be presented in a gentle way - starting with linear separable problems, through the classification tasks having overlapped classes but still a linear separation boundary, beyond the linearity assumptions to the nonlinear separation boundary, and finally to the linear and nonlinear regression problems. Here, the adjective "parsimonious" denotes a SVM with a small number of support vectors ("hidden layer neurons"). The scarcity of the model results from a sophisticated, QP based, learning that matches the model capacity to the data complexity ensuring a good generalization, i.e., a good performance of SVM on the future, previously, during the training unseen, data. Same as the neural networks (or similarly to them), SVMs possess the well-known ability of being universal approximators of any multivariate function to any desired degree of accuracy. Consequently, they are of particular interest for modeling the unknown, or partially known, highly nonlinear, complex systems, plants or processes. Also, at the very beginning, and just to be sure what the whole booklet is about, we should state clearly when there is no need for an application of SVMs' model-building techniques. In short, whenever there exists an analytical closed-form model (or it is possible to devise one) there is no need to resort to learning from empirical data by SVMs (or by any other type of a learning machine).

A bilattice is a set which owns two lattices orderings. They have been used in Artificial Intelligence in order to model incomplete information. We present a framework for Bilattice-valued Constraint Programming which allows to represent incomplete or conflicting information and to combine constraints with a set of operators. It allows to model a variety of situation such as open constraints and the integration of machine learning into constraint programming, reconciliation of divergent opinions in distributed systems or constraint modules in a software engineering perspective.

Often, however, sufficient data axe not available, which may be compensated for by eliciting background knowledge from experts. This paper explores the trade-offs between modelling using background knowledge from domain experts and machine learning using a small clinical dataset in the context of Bayesian classifiers. We utilized background knowledge to improve Bayesian classifier performance, both in terms of classification accuracy and in terms of modelling the structure of the underlying joint probability distribution. Relative differences between models of differing structural complexity, which were learnt using varying amounts of background knowledge, are explored. It is shown that the use of partial background knowledge may significantly improve the quality of the resulting classifiers.

We use a modern large-margin machine learning approach, based on boosting, to enable feature selection from the high-dimensional search space of candidate binding sequences while avoiding overfitting. At each iteration of the algorithm, MEDUSA builds a motif model whose presence in the promoter region of a gene, coupled with activity of a regulator in an experiment, is predictive of differential expression. In this way, we learn motifs that are functional and predictive of regulatory response rather than motifs that are simply overrepresented in promoter sequences. Moreover, MEDUSA produces a model of the transcriptional control logic that can predict the expression of any gene in the organism, given the sequence of the promoter region of the target gene and the expression state of a set of known or putative transcription factors and signaling molecules. Each motif model is either a k-length sequence, a dimer, or a PSSM that is built by agglomerative probabilistic clustering of sequences with similar boosting loss. By applying MEDUSA to a set of environmental stress response expression data in yeast, we learn motifs whose ability to predict differential expression of target genes outperforms motifs from the TRANSFAC dataset and from a previously published candidate set of PSSMs. We also show that MEDUSA retrieves many experimentally confirmed binding sites associated with environmental stress response from the literature.

This idea lead us in the past to propose an approach to acquire models of opponents, based only on the observation of their input-output behavior. If opponent outputs could be accessed directly, a model can be constructed by feeding a machine learning method with traces of the opponent. However, that is not the case in the Robocup domain. To overcome this problem, in this paper we present a three phases approach to model low-level behavior of individual opponent agents. First, we build a classifier to label opponent actions based on observation. Second, our agent observes an opponent and labels its actions using the previous classifier. From these observations, a model is constructed to predict the opponent actions. Finally, the agent uses the model to anticipate opponent reactions. In this paper, we have presented a proof-of-principle of our approach, termed OMBO (Opponent Modeling Based on Observation), so that a striker agent can anticipate a goalie. Results show that scores are significantly higher using the acquired opponent's model of actions.

In particular, solution to this has found successful application in tasks that involve datasets containing huge numbers of features (in the order of tens of thousands), which would be impossible to process further. Recent examples include text processing and web content classification. Rough set theory has been used as such a dataset pre-processor with much success, but current methods are inadequate at finding minimal reductions, the smallest sets of features possible. This paper proposes a technique that considers this problem from a propositional satisfiability perspective. In this framework, minimal subsets can be located and verified.

In this paper, we develop a new computation model based on relative attribute dependency that is defined as the proportion of the projection of the decision table on a subset of condition attributes to the projection of the decision table on the union of the subset of condition attributes and the set of decision attributes. To find an optimal reduct, we use information entropy conveyed by the attributes as the heuristic. A novel algorithm to find optimal reducts of condition attributes based on the relative attribute dependency is implemented using Java, and is experimented with 10 data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository. We conduct the comparison of data classification using C4.5 with the original data sets and their reducts. The experiment results demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm.

In the first Rough Set situation, what we have seen is as follows: 1) The "granularity" should be taken so as to divide equally the unseen tuples out of the information table, 2) The traditional "Reduction" sense accords with the above insistence, and 3) The "stable" subsets of tuples, which are defined through a "Galois connection" between the subset and the corresponding attribute subset, may play an important role to capture some characteristics that can be read from the given information table. We show these with some illustrative examples.

The data fusion model is a system of matrix inequalities of the rough sets covariances. Rough sets variance allows to explicitly assess only health degradations assuring increased signal-to-noise ratio, thus high accuracy of processing. The matrices of inequalities fuse measured health degradation levels and influences on these degradations. Adaptations mechanisms are by a new machine learning approach determining weights of the terms of the inequalities at the time of key events found in the historical data. Prognostic is always time-sequenced, therefore methods based on time sequences are incorporated, e.g. a new data fusion model exploiting time-dependency of events, assuring high quality of prediction. Deterministic prognostic is by estimating the pattern of health degradation in question, finding the match with degradation pattern in historical data, and then tracing this historical degradation pattern up to its conclusion. The model is hierarchical: the right sides of the data fusion expressions substitute for endogenous variables of higher-level expressions.

In this paper, the notions of tolerance relation based information granular space are introduced and formalized mathematically. It is a uniform model to study problems in model recognition and machine learning. The key strength of the model is the capability of granulating knowledge in both consecutive and discrete attribute space based on tolerance relation. Such capability is reestablished in granulation and an application in information classification is illustrated. Simulation results show the model is effective and efficient.

In the traditional "reduction" sense, the goal is to find the smallest number of attributes such that they enable us to discern each tuple or each decision class. However, once we pay attention to the number of attribute values too, that is, the size of each attribute, another criterion is needed. Indeed, we should ask ourselves about which one is better in the following two situations: 1) we can discern them with a single attribute of size ten, and 2) we can do this with two attributes of size five. This study answers this question with some criteria. Especially, we deal with continuous attributes. If we evaluate this difference in the light of understandability, we may prefer the latter, because they give more simple descriptions. Such a combination of simple nominal description helps us as a language or as a Kansei representation. To do this, we propose some criteria and algorithms to find near-optimal solutions for those criteria. In addition, we show some results for some databases in UCI Machine Learning Repository.

One of the crucial issues is to find a right mixture of them. For discovering this type of knowledge, we consider "rule + exception", or rule-plus-exception, strategies. Results from psychology, expert systems, genetic algorithms, and machine learning and data mining are summarized and compared, and their implications to knowledge management and discovery are examined. The study motivates and establishes a basis for the design and implementation of new algorithms for the discovery of "rule + exception" type knowledge.

In this paper we present a method to improve even more the accuracy: ML-CIDIM. This method has been developed by using a multiple classifier system which basic classifier is CIDIM, an algorithm that induces small and accurate decision trees. CIDIM makes a random division of the training set into two subsets and uses them to build an internal bound condition. ML-CIDIM induces some multiple classifier systems based on CIDIM and places them in different layers, trying to improve the accuracy of the previous layer with the following one. In this way, the accuracy obtained thanks to a unique multiple classifier system based on CIDIM can be improved. In reference to the accuracy of the classifier system built with ML-CIDIM, we can say that it competes well against bagging and boosting at statistically significant confidence levels.

In this paper, we try to predict protein-protein interactions in parallel on a 12-node PC-cluster using domains of a protein. For this, we use a hydrophobicity among protein's amino acid's physicochemical feature and a support vector machine (SVM) among machine learning techniques. According to the experiments, we get approximately 60% average accuracy with 5 trials and we obtained an average speed-up of 5.11 with a 12-node cluster using a proximal SVM.

Our aim is to show the development of a method of estimation of the financial risk when a credit is granted to a firm, having into account its countable status. This is a classical example of inference of classification/prediction rules, that is the kind of problem in which the adequacy of Rough Sets methods has been proved. Coming from data concerning industrial companies that were given to us by the Banks that granted the credits, we have obtained a set of classification rules to be used to predict the result of future credit operations.

Due to the complexity of the alignment task, manually defined methods for (semi)automatic alignment rarely constitute an optimal configuration of substrategies from which they have been built. In fact, scrutinizing current ontology alignment methods, one may recognize that most are not optimized for given ontologies. Some few include machine learning for automating the task, but their optimization by machine learning means is mostly restricted to the extensional definition of ontology concepts. With APFEL (Alignment Process Feature Estimation and Learning) we present a machine learning approach that explores the user validation of initial alignments for optimizing alignment methods. The methods are based on extensional and intensional ontology definitions. Core to APFEL is the idea of a generic alignment process, the steps of which may be represented explicitly. APFEL then generates new hypotheses for what might be useful features and similarity assessments and weights them by machine learning approaches. APFEL compares favorably in our experiments to competing approaches.

The latter is achieved via largely unsupervised machine learning, boot-strapped from oracles, such as web-site wrappers. It is backed up by 'evidential reasoning', which allows evidence to be gained from the redundancy in the Web as well as inaccuracies in information, also characteristic of today's Web, to be circumvented. In this paper we sketch how the architecture of Armadillo has now been reinterpreted as workflow templates that compose semantic web services and show how the porting of Armadillo to new domains, and furthermore the application of new tools, has thus been simplified and benefits from semantic discovery and automatic orchestration.

Most approaches have suggested using ontologies to either describe the Web services or to annotate syntactical descriptions of Web services. Earlier approaches are typically manual, and the capability to support automatic or semi-automatic annotation is needed. The METEOR-S Web Service Annotation Framework (MWSAF) created at the LSDIS Lab at the University of Georgia leverages schema matching techniques for semi-automatic annotation. In this paper, we present an improved version of MWSAF. Our preliminary investigation indicates that, by replacing the schema matching technique currently used for the categorization with a Naive Bayesian Classifier, we can match web services with ontologies faster and with higher accuracy.

The biometric or forensic performance task answers the question of whether or not a sample belongs to a known person. Two different learning paradigms are discussed: person-independent (or general learning) and person-dependent (or person-specific learning). In the first paradigm, learning is from a general population of ensemble of pairs, each of which is labelled as being from the same person or from different persons- the learning process determines the range of variations for given persons and between different persons. In the second paradigm the identity of a person is learnt when presented with multiple known samples of that person- where the variation and similarities within a particular person are learnt. The person-specific learning strategy is seen to perform better than general learning (5% higher performace with signatures). Improvement of person-specific performance with increasing number of samples is also observed.

In the extended Ritz method, sets of admissible solutions are approximated by their intersections with sets of linear combinations of all n-tuples of functions from a given basis. This alternative scheme, called variable-basis approximation, includes functions computable by trigonometric polynomials with free frequencies, free-node splines, neural networks, and other nonlinear approximating families. Estimates of rates of approximate optimization by the extended Ritz method are derived. Upper bounds on rates of convergence of suboptimal solutions to the optimal one are expressed in terms of the degree n of variable-basis functions, the modulus of continuity of the functional to be minimized, the modulus of Tikhonov well-posedness of the problem, and certain norms tailored to the type of basis. The results are applied to convex best approximation and to kernel methods in machine learning.

Many segmentation methods have been studied, but there is still no satisfactory effectiveness measure which makes it hard to compare different segmentation methods, or even different parameterizations of a single method. A good segmentation evaluation method not only would enable different approaches to be compared, but could also be integrated within the target recognition system to adaptively select the appropriate granularity of the segmentation which in turn could improve the recognition accuracy. A few stand-alone effectiveness measures have been proposed, but these measures examine different fundamental criteria of the objects, or examine the same criteria in a different fashion, so they usually work well in some cases, but poorly in the others. We propose a co-evaluation framework, in which different effectiveness measures judge the performance of the segmentation in different ways, and their measures are combined by using a machine learning approach which coalesces the results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method performs better than the existing methods.

Those tools have been de facto parallel programming libraries for cluster computing where a cluster consists of usually homogeneous uniprocessor machines. Recent advances in processor technologies made it possible to build a cluster of multiprocessor machines more economically. In addition, a new programming language, Java, and its associated technologies opened a door to flourish of new and more efficient development of distributed computing software. Virtual Cluster Computing (VCluster) library is a portable parallel runtime system we have developed to support parallel programs that run on the cluster of heterogeneous uni- and multi-processors. In this paper, we briefly introduce the features of VCluster system and describe how parallel programs can be developed efficiently with VCluster. We also present the experimental results showing the performance of the developed system on two exemplary applications, heat diffusion and back propagation neural network, and compare them with other systems.

The concept of cognition of the domain theory is derived for the reprehensive measurement theory (RMT). We show that a Relational Data Mining approach we proposed previously performs cognition of domain theories in accordance with the RMT and produces the relational methodology for analysis of cognitive capabilities of data mining methods. In this methodology a domain theory includes a metadata ontology. This ontology contains various data types formalized in the first-order logic in accordance with the RMT. To represent the knowledge theory we use the concept of the Logical Empirical Theory that is defined in the paper.

These tables are often carefully designed for easy reading by analysts, and then mechanically produced by an OLAP database system. The general practice of extracting attribute-value pairs from statistical tables does not ensure high accuracy when they are used as a database for an information retrieval system. In this paper, we show how a human may visualize a statistical table as an multidimensional object, defined by a suitably modified OLAP model. In this way, the keywords are classified into semantically distinct groups, i.e., dimension hierarchies, without any ontological knowledge or resorting to machine learning. A prototype system which mimics the human reasoning for table processing has been implemented Experiments on 150 randomly chosen tables from Statistics Canada have confirmed the validity of this approach.

In this paper, we propose a new structural parameter identification method based on the Support Vector Regression (SVR) which has been found working very well in many fields as an exclusively data based non-linear modeling method. Machine learning technologies such as Neural Networks has been applied widely in the field of health monitoring field. However, most papers just obtain the 'block-box' model of the studied structures from Neural Network training but the structural parameters are not identified actually. In our work, we not only generate the 'block-box' model but also identify the structural parameters by combining ARMA model together with SVR. Due to the "max-margin" idea used, SVR showed powerful properties in ARMA and structural identification under different kinds and amplitude noise. Furthermore, how to choose the parameters of SVR is also studied in this paper.

A rational bridge monitoring requires a good knowledge of the actual condition of various structural components. Fatigue analysis of concrete bridges is one of the most important problems. Concrete bridges are often undergoing a fatigue deterioration. starting with cracking and ending with large holes through the web. There is a need for the development of efficient health assessment system for fatigue evaluation and prediction of the remaining life. This information has clear economical consequences, as deficient bridges must be repaired or closed. The goal of this research is to provide a practical expert system in bridge health evaluation and improve the understanding of bridge behavior during their service. Efforts to develop a functional bridge monitoring system have mainly been concentrated upon successful implementation of experienced-based machine learning. The reliability of the techniques adopted for damage assessment is also important for bridge monitoring systems. By applying the system to an in-service PC bridge, it has been verified that this fuzzy logic expert system is effective and reliable for the bridge health evaluation.

Because it can implement standardized document management, establish new workflows and working modes, improve work efficiency and accelerate the process of enterprise informazation. In this paper a framework, with a new document structure description language -DSDL language, a syntax model and a semantic model, for application-oriented document processing supported by knowledge database is proposed. Using this framework, we have implemented a prototype system and successfully run many examples.

The problem of fatigue usually arises out of intensive interaction between the IEA system and the respondent. Consequently, due to lack of interest or attention, the respondent will provide biased answers either intentionally or unintentionally. To reduce the times of interaction in IEAs effectively, we adopt a learning approach to learn responedent's preference model and then use this model to predict the fitness values of any given individuals. Unlike other research, we propose a novel system called ALP-IGA that integrates the theorem of incremental machine learning, the Algorithmic Probability (ALP), with Interactive Genetic Algorithm (IGA). Since the ALP model will utilize each interaction effectively to improve the accuracy of prediction, it is very likely our ALP-IGA system can predict respondent's preferences precisely just after a few interactions. We have investigated the performance of our ALP-IGA via a Monte Carlo simulation. Experimental results indicated that the number of interactions needed by ALP-IGA is very small for some cases. In addition, we have also compared the prediction correctness of ALP-IGA with a contrast IEA system whose learning scheme is implemented by a neural network algorithm. The results showed that ALP-IGA is superior to IEA with neural network for all cases.

This paper considers the multiple concept learning which are extended from binary concept learning. Our main contribution in this paper is to propose a new framework for multiple concept learning. To this end, two sparseness and semantic measures are proposed in order to characterize the scatter and the concentration of concepts in a system. Using both of these two measures, a general strategy of multiple concept learning is given and applied to feature selection in text categorization problem. The experimental results implemented to two benchmark datasets 20Newsgroups and Reuters-21578 show that our approach improve the performances using the Rochio and naive Bayes algorithms compared to conventional methods in the system.

When input space dimensions are many, the number of distinct patterns in the data is not known a priori, and feature scales are different, then the problem becomes much harder. In this paper we deal with such a problem. Our approach is based on an extension to hierarchical clustering that makes it suitable for data sets with numerous independent features. The results of this initial clustering are refined via a reclassification step. The issue of evaluation of hierarchical clustering methods is also discussed. The performance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through the application to a synthetic data set and verified through application to a variety of well known machine learning data sets.

However, this assumption may not be true in practical applications. In some cases, if human being is involved in providing training samples, there may be errors in the training set. In this paper, we study the effect of imperfect training samples on the supervised machine learning framework. We focus on the mathematical framework that describes the learnability of noisy training data. We study theorems to estimate the error bounds of generated models and the required amount of training samples. These errors are dependent on the amount of data trained and the probability of the accuracy of training data. Based on the effectiveness of learnability on imperfect annotation, we describe an autonomous learning framework, which uses cross-modality information to learn concept models. For instance, visual concept models can be trained based on the detection result of Automatic Speech Recognition, Closed Captions, or prior detection results of the same modality. Those detection results on an unsupervised training set serve as imperfect labeling for the models-to-build. A prototype system based on this learning technique has been built. Promising results have been shown on these experiments.

This approach concentrates on structural information that is present in the sentences. This information is extracted using machine learning techniques and the patterns found are used to classify the sentences. The approach fits in between the existing machine learning and hand-crafting of regular expressions approaches, and it combines the best of both. The sequential information present in the sentences is used directly, classifiers can be generated automatically and the output and intermediate representations can be investigated and manually optimised if needed.

We employ hierarchical Bayesian modelling, which provides a powerful and principled solution. We point out some shortcomings of parametric hierarchical Bayesian modelling and thus focus on a nonparametric approach. Nonparametric hierarchical Bayesian modelling has its roots in Bayesian statistics and, in the form of Dirichlet process mixture modelling, was recently introduced into the machine learning community. In this chapter, we hope to provide an accessible introduction to this particular branch of statistics. We present the standard sampling-based learning algorithms and introduce a particular EM learning approach that leads to efficient and plausible solutions. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in context of a, recommendation engine where our approach allows the principled combination of content-based and collaborative filtering.

Training flow fields are constructed using range images of natural scenes and 3D camera motions recovered from handheld and car-mounted video sequences. A detailed analysis of optical flow statistics in natural scenes is presented and machine learning methods are developed to learn a Markov random field model of optical flow. The prior probability of a flow field is formulated as a Field-of-Experts model that captures the higher order spatial statistics in overlapping patches and is trained using contrastive divergence. This new optical flow prior is compared with previous robust priors and is incorporated into a recent, accurate algorithm for dense optical flow computation. Experiments with natural and synthetic sequences illustrate how the learned optical flow prior quantitatively improves flow accuracy and how it captures the rich spatial structure found in natural scene motion.

This approach models document layout as a grammar and performs a global search for the optimal parse based on a grammatical cost function. Our contribution is to utilize machine learning to discriminatively select features and set all parameters in the parsing process. Therefore, and unlike many other approaches for layout analysis, ours can easily adapt itself to a variety of document analysis problems. One need only specify the page grammar and provide a set of correctly labeled pages. We apply this technique to two document image analysis tasks: page layout structure extraction and mathematical expression interpretation. Experiments demonstrate that the learned grammars can be used to extract the document structure in 57 files from the UWIII document image database. We also show that the same framework can be used to automatically interpret printed mathematical expressions so as to recreate the original LaTeX.

However given the complexity of large variations of the appearance of the object and the background in a typical aerial image, a robust and efficient detection is still considered as an open and challenging problem. In this paper, we present the Enhanced Semi-Supervised Learning (ESL) framework and apply this framework to revising an object detection methodology we have developed in a previous effort. Theoretic analysis and experimental evaluation using the UCI machine learning repository clearly indicate the superiority of the ESL framework The performance evaluations of the revised object detection methodology against the original one clearly demonstrate the promise and superiority of this approach.

S	Sebastiani, F		Zanasi, A		Sebastiani, F.			Text categorization	TEXT MINING AND ITS APPLICATIONS TO INTELLIGENCE, CRM AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT	Advances in Management Information		English	Article; Book Chapter							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CLASSIFICATION; DOCUMENTS; GENRE	Text categorization (also known as text classification, or topic spotting) is the task of automatically sorting a set of documents into categories from a predefined set. This task has several applications, including automated indexing of scientific articles according to predefined thesauri of technical terms, filing patents into patent directories, selective dissemination of information to information consumers, automated population of hierarchical catalogues of Web resources, spam filtering, identification of document genre, authorship attribution, survey coding, and even automated essay grading. Automated text classification is attractive because it frees organizations from the need of manually organizing document bases, which can be too expensive, or simply not feasible given the time constraints of the application or the number of documents involved. The accuracy of modern text classification systems rivals that of trained human professionals, thanks to a combination of information retrieval (IR) technology and machine learning (ML) technology. This chapter will outline the fundamental traits of the technologies involved, of the applications that can feasibly be tackled through text classification, and of the tools and resources that are available to the researcher and developer wishing to take up these technologies for deploying real-world applications.

In particular, the identification of break indices formulates the intonational phrase breaks that affect all the forthcoming prosody-related procedures. In the present paper we use tree-structured predictors, and specifically the commonly used in similar tasks CART and the introduced C4.5 one, to cope with the task of break placement in the presence of shallow textual features. We have utilized two 500-utterance prosodic corpora offered by two Greek universities in order to compare the machine learning approaches and to argue on the robustness they offer for Greek break modeling. The evaluation of the resulted models revealed that both approaches were positively compared with similar works published for other languages, while the C4.5 method accuracy scaled from 1% to 2,7% better than CART.

JUPITER was built to explore three basic ideas. First, how to use controller synthesis so as to find the exact conditions under which a particular constraint will be satisfied Second, how to successively refine the models used for the controller synthesis so as to obtain a series of more easily understandable and more robust controllers. Last but not least, how to structure & explain the synthesised controllers and provide hints to designers for further optimisations through the use of Machine Learning techniques. Thus, JUPITER can help in the design and analysis of multi-constraint systems through the automatic synthesis of control logic for certain of the constraints and the aid it provides to designers for discovering further optimisations. The controllers it synthesises can be easily implemented on top of a standard real-time OS [7, 6].

Framework documentation plays a major role in facing the above challenges. It directly affects the learning curve, maintainability, and defect removal aspects of the application frameworks. We have studied various documenting approaches and concluded that the current approaches are not very effective in overcoming the above challenges, especially on the efficiency problem. So, in this paper we are going to apply machine learning using case-based reasoning (CBR) and rule-based reasoning (RBR) to framework documentation. We will come up with a documentation architecture that combines both techniques in order to come up with improved framework documentation.

Relevance feedback is an active area of research that seeks to find algorithms that are robust with only a small number of examples. Much work has been done in both the machine learning and pattern recognition communities to develop algorithms that learn a high-level semantic concept in a low-level image feature space. In this paper we seek to leverage techniques from both these communities to explore a hybrid relevancefeedback system which combines the insight gained from discriminant analysis and active learning. Our technique uses a diversity based pool-query technique along with biased discriminant analysis to improve the query refinement process. Comparative results are observed and thoughts for future work are presented.

First, each vowel is determined, whether it is stressed or unstressed, and a type of lexical stress is assigned for every stressed vowel. Then, some corrections are made on the word level, according the number of stressed vowels and the length of the word. We applied a machine-learning technique (decision trees or boosted decision trees). The accuracy achieved by decision trees significantly outperforms all previous results. However, the sizes of the trees indicate that the accentuation in the Slovenian language is a very complex problem and a simple solution in the form of relatively simple rules is not possible.

On the other hand, there is also a lack of control of the content accessed by users when browsing Web pages. In some situations this lack of control may be undesired For instance, parents may not desire their children to have access to offensive content available on the Web. In particular accessing Web pages with nude images is among the most common problem of this son. One way to tackle this problem is by using automated offensive image detection algorithms which can filter undesired images. Recent approaches on nude image detection use a combination of features based on color, texture, shape and other low level features in order to describe the image content. These features are then used by a classifier which is able to detect Offensive images accordingly. In this paper we propose SNIF - Simple Nude Image Finder - which uses a color based feature only, extracted by an effective and efficient algorithm for image description, the Border/Interior pixel Classification (BIC), combined with a machine learning technique, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM). SNIF uses a simpler feature model when compared to previously proposed methods, which makes it a fast image classifier The experiments carried out depict that the proposed method, despite its simplicity, is capable to identify up to 98% of nude images from the test set. This indicates that SNIF is as effective as previously proposed methods for detecting nude images.

In this method, the set of states satisfying a fixpoint property is learnt as opposed to being iteratively computed. We extend the machine learning based approach to verifying general omega-regular properties that include both safety and liveness. To achieve this, we first develop a new fixpoint based characterization for the verification of omega-regular properties. Using this characterization, we present a general framework for verifying infinite state systems. We then instantiate our approach to the context of regular model checking where states are represented as strings over a finite alphabet and the transition relation of the system is given as a finite state transducer; unlike previous learning based algorithms, we make no assumption about the transducer being length-preserving. Using Angluin's L* algorithm for learning regular languages, we develop an algorithm for verification of w-regular properties of such infinite state systems. The algorithm is a complete verification procedure for systems for whom the fixpoint can be represented as a regular set. We have implemented the technique in a tool called LEVER and use it to analyze some examples.

We have built an end-to-end intelligent tutoring system, premised on the above goal, with a graphical user interface (GUI) front-end, an agent powered by case-based reasoning (CBR), and a mySQL database backend. We use a casebase to store the pedagogical strategies, embedded in the individual cases and the similarity retrieval and adaptation heuristics. Each case has situation, solution and outcome parameters. The situation parameters include the students' static and dynamic profiles and the instructional content's characteristics while the solution parameters specify the characteristics of the example or problem to be delivered to the student. We developed a set of CSI content that includes five topics and deployed our system in the laboratories. Our results show that when the machine learning mechanism is activated, our agent is able to learn to tutor students more efficiently.

Our proposal falls in the category of multiple experts, a machine learning technique that -under the assumption of absent or negative correlation in experts' errors-may outperform monolithic classifier systems. The prediction activity results from the interaction of a population of experts, each integrating genetic and neural technologies. Roughly speaking, an expert of this kind embodies a genetic classifier designed to control the activation of a feedforward artificial neural network. Genetic and neural components (i.e., guard and embedded predictor, respectively) are devoted to perform different tasks and are supplied with different information: Each guard is aimed at (soft-) partitioning the input space, insomuch assuring both the diversity and the specialization of the corresponding embedded predictor, which in turn is devoted to perform the actual prediction. Guards deal with inputs that encode information strictly related with relevant domain knowledge, whereas embedded predictors process other relevant inputs, each consisting of a limited window of residues. To investigate the performance of the proposed approach, a system has been implemented and tested on the RS126 set of proteins. Experimental results point to the potential of the approach.

KXtractor overcomes the problem of the single Part-Of-Speech (POS) HMMs with modeling the rich representation of text where features overlap among state units such as word, line, sentence, and paragraph. KXtractor also resolves issues with the traditional HMMs for IE that operate only on the semi-structured data such as HTML documents and other text sources in which language grammar does not play a pivotal role. We compared KXtractor with three IE techniques: 1) RAPIER, an inductive learning-based machine learning system, 2) a Dictionary-based extraction system, and 3) single POS HMM. Our experiments showed that KXtractor outperforms these three IE systems in extracting protein-protein interactions. In our experiments, the F-measure for KXtractor was higher than for RAPIER, a dictionary-based system, and single POS HMM respectively by 16.89%,16.28%, and 8.58%. In addition, both precision and recall of KXtractor are higher than those systems.

This database is the most comprehensive online rough sets bibliography currently available and is accessible from the RSDS website at http://www.rsds.wsiz.rzeszow.pl. This service has been developed to facilitate the creation of a rough sets bibliography for various types of publications. At the moment the bibliography contains over 1900 entries from more than 815 authors. It is possible to create the bibliography in HTML or BibTeX format. In order to broaden the service contents it is possible to append new data using a specially dedicated online form. After appending data online the database is updated automatically. If one prefers sending a data file to the database administrator, please be aware that the database is updated once a month. In the present version of the RSDS system, we have broadened information about the authors as well as the Statistics sections, which facilitates precise statistical analysis of the service. In order to widen the abilities of the RSDS system we added new features including: - Detailed information concerning the software connected with the rough sets methodology. - Scientific biographies of the outstanding people who work on rough sets.

A specific similarity based method is the k nearest neighbors (k-nn) classification algorithm. In the k-nn algorithm, a decision about a new object x is inferred on the basis of a fixed number k of the objects most similar to x in a given set of examples. The primary contribution of the dissertation is the introduction of two new classification models based on the k-nn algorithm. The first model is a hybrid combination of the k-nn algorithm with rule induction. The proposed combination uses minimal consistent rules defined by local reducts of a set of examples. To make this combination possible the model of minimal consistent rules is generalized to a metric-dependent form. An effective polynomial algorithm implementing the classification model based on minimal consistent rules has been proposed by Bazan. We modify this algorithm in such a way that after addition of the modified algorithm to the k-nn algorithm the increase of the computation time is inconsiderable. For some tested classification problems the combined model was significantly more accurate than the classical k-nn classification algorithm. For many real-life problems it is impossible to induce relevant global mathematical models from available sets of examples. The second model proposed in the dissertation is a method for dealing with such sets based on locally induced metrics. This method adapts the notion of similarity to the properties of a given test object. It makes it possible to select the correct decision in specific fragments of the space of objects. The method with local metrics improved significantly the classification accuracy of methods with global models in the hardest tested problems. The important issues of quality and efficiency of the k-nn based methods are a similarity measure and the performance time in searching for the most similar objects in a given set of examples, respectively. In this dissertation both issues are studied in detail and some significant improvements are proposed for the similarity measures and for the search methods found in the literature.

Although there has been steady progress using these methods, these systems suffer from several limitations that cannot be overcome with 3D sensing and planning alone. Geometric sensing alone has no ability to distinguish between compressible and non-compressible materials. As a result, these systems have difficulty in heavily vegetated environments and require sensitivity adjustments across different terrain types. On the planning side, these systems have no ability to learn from their mistakes and avoid problematic environmental situations on subsequent encounters. We have implemented an adaptive terrain classification system based on the Artificial Immune System (AIS) computational model, which is loosely based on the biological immune system, that combines various forms of imaging sensor inputs to produce a "feature labeled" image of the scene categorizing areas as benign or detrimental for autonomous robot navigation. Because of the qualities of the AIS computation model, the resulting system will be able to learn and adapt on its own through interaction with the environment by modifying its interpretation of the sensor data. The feature labeled results from the AIS analysis are inserted into a map and can then be used by a planner to generate a safe route to a goal point. The coupling of diverse visual cues with the malleable AIS computational model will lead to autonomous robotic ground vehicles that require less human intervention for deployment in novel environments and more robust operation as a result of the system's ability to improve its performance through interaction with the environment.

Single molecule kinetic information can be directly obtained with this approach via observation of single-molecule channel current blockades. A nanopore-based detector can also measure molecular characteristics indirectly, by changes in the blockades resulting from a changing bound-molecule complex. In essence, the heart of chemistry - the nature of the chemical bond - is now accessible via a new, computationally intensive, single-molecule observation method. In this work: (i) analysis of blockade signals is done using a variety of bioinformatics and machine learning tools; (ii) antibody blockade signals are examined and preliminary data on the characterization of antibody-antigen binding is briefly explored; and (iii) aptamer-based drug-discovery screening prospects are explored. The initial feature identification and extraction of blockade signals involves HMMs for level identification, HMM-EM for level projection, and time-domain FSAs for processing of the level-projected waveform. HMMs are then used for feature extraction and an SVM decision tree for multiclass discrimination. A new family of SVM variants is used, based on regularized-divergence kernels and restriction is also made to feature vectors that can be interpreted as probability vectors. A web interface to the Channel Current Cheminformatics tools (unoCCC) and the Support Vector Machine classifier (unoSVM) will also be described.

In case the training set consists of instances, chosen randomly from the instance space, the posterior probability estimates are random variables. Their statistical properties can be used to calculate confidence intervals around them, enabling more refined classification strategies than the usual argmax-operator. This may alleviate the cold-start problem and provide additional feedback to the user. In this paper, we give an explicit expression to estimate the variances of the posterior probability estimates from the training data and investigate the strategy that refrains from classification in case the confidence interval around the largest posterior probability overlaps with any of the other intervals. We show that the classification error rate can be significantly reduced at the cost of a lower coverage, i.e., the fraction of classifiable instances, in a TV-program recommender.

A geometric formulation of this genre of problems could be modeled with help of perceptual psychology. In this article, we outline one approach for a special case where video segments are to be classified according to expression of emotion or other similar facial motions. The encoding of realistic facial motions that convey expression of emotions for a particular person P forms a parameter space X-P whose study reveals the "objective geometry" for the problem of unsupervised feature detection from video. The geometric features and discrete representation of the space X-P are independent of subjective evaluations by observers. While the "subjective geometry" of X-P varies from observer to observer, levels of sensitivity and variation in perception of facial expressions appear to share a certain level of universality among members of similar cultures. Therefore, statistical geometry of invariants of X-P for a sample of population could provide effective algorithms for extraction of such features. In cases where frequency of events is sufficiently large in the sample data, a suitable framework could be provided to facilitate the information-theoretic organization and study of statistical invariants of such features. This article provides a general approach to encode motion in terms of a particular genre of dynamical systems and the geometry of their flow. An example is provided to illustrate the general theory.

An equivalence class is composed of a reference image and all its variations (or replicas). For each reference image, a decision function is built. The latter determines if a given image belongs to its corresponding equivalence class. This function is built in three steps: synthesis, projection, and analysis. In the first step, the reference image is replicated using different image operators (like JPEG compression, average filtering, etc). During the projection step, the replicas are projected onto a distance space. In the final step, the distance space is analyzed, using machine learning algorithms, and the decision function is built. In this study, three machine learning approaches are compared: orthotope, support vectors machine (SVM), and support vectors data description (SVDD). The orthotope is a computationally efficient ad-hoc method. It consists in building a generalized rectangle in the distance space. The SVM and SVDD are two more general learning algorithms.

Different from the prior expression cloning or image analogy approaches, we try to hallucinate the person's plausible facial expression with the help of a face expression database. In the first step, nonlinear manifold learning technique is used to obtain a smooth estimation for the expressive face image. In the second step, Markov network is adopted to learn the low-level local facial feature's relationship between the residual neutral and the expressional face image's patches in the training set, then belief propagation is employed to infer the expressional residual face image for that person. By integrating the two approaches, we obtain the final result. The experimental results show that the hallucinated facial expression is not only expressive but also close to the ground truth.

In this paper, we examine the utility of such techniques for the scientifically-important problem of detecting and catloging impact craters in planetary images gathered by spacecraft. Various supervised learning algorithms, including ensemble methods (bagging and AdaBoost with feed forward neural networks as base learners), support vector machines (SVM), and continuously-scalable template models (CSTM), are employed to derive crater detectors from ground-truthed images. The resulting detectors are evaluated on a challenging set of Viking Orbiter images of Mars containing roughly one thousand craters. The SVM approach with normalized image patches provides detection and localization performance closest to that of human labelers and is shown to be substantially superior to boundary-based approaches such as the Hough transform.

Based on fiducial detection for robustness, we show how a machine-learning approach allows the development of significantly more reliable fiducial detection than has previously been demonstrated. We calibrate fiducial positions using a structure-from-motion solver We then show how nonlinear optimization of the camera position during tracking gives accuracy comparable with full bundle adjustment but at significantly reduced cost.

Until recently, designing such systems required extensive subject matter and computer vision expertise resulting in poor cross-domain portability and expensive maintenance. Recently, a machine-learned system ADORE (Adaptive Object Recognition) was successfully applied in an aerial image interpretation domain. In this paper we evaluate an extended version of this system, applied for the first time to a natural image interpretation domain. Performance of MR ADORE system is compared to the Hierarchical Hidden Markov Random Field (HHRMF) algorithm for supervised image annotation. We show that a hybrid system, easily constructed by utilizing the HHMRF models as operators within MR ADORE, performs significantly better than either of the systems on their own. To the best of our knowledge this is the first successful case of learning both vision operators and an adaptive control policy guiding their application in a single system.

Researchers have proposed many machine learning methods to solve the problem in the past. In this paper, we describe a wavelet transform system that predicts protein secondary structure. A primary sequence is only needed to perform the prediction. The determination of protein secondary structure region is implemented through the based wavelet signal analysis of fixed length window hydrophobic profile and low pass filter of structure-based propensity factor sequence. Using the periodical region of alpha-helix structure the method is applied to globular proteins obtaining better result. The method gives a prediction accuracy of 73.89% when using a database of 98 non-homology globular proteins.

Machine learning-based classifiers and a new classifier using the structure and the semantics of the OWL ontologies are proposed. Our method has been implemented and evaluated on an independent test set provided by an international ontology alignment contest. We provide the results of this evaluation with respect to the other competitors.

However, most early research works such as Vector Space Model or Latent Semantic Index only used single relationship to measure the similarity of data objects. In this paper, we first use an Intra- and Inter- Type Relationship Matrix (IITRM) to represent a set of heterogeneous data objects and their inter-relationships. Then, we propose a novel similarity-calculating algorithm over the Inter- and Intra- Type Relationship Matrix. It tries to integrate information from heterogeneous sources to serve their purposes by iteratively computing. This algorithm can help detect latent relationships among heterogeneous data objects. Our new algorithm is based on the intuition that the intrarelationship should affect the inter-relationship, and vice versa. Experimental results on the MSN logs dataset show that our algorithm outperforms the traditional Cosine similarity.

In this paper, we present a novel architecture for relatedness evaluation among texts. In this work we employed several text classifiers using support vector machines (SVM) to acquisition of relatedness among texts. Firstly, we employ our developed algorithm to deal with text pre-processing, training and subsequently, the texts of unknown category go through several different SVM classifiers to generate new vectors of decision features made by the classification results. Essentially, the resulting class vectors can be compared to obtain semantic relatedness among texts. In addition, we perform the tasks of classification of multimedia data based on MPEG-7 standard by the derived SVM methods. These techniques have been tested in applications of text classification and works from large corpora, resulting in substantial improvement in overall correctness. The results indicate that this approach can also be used to other research work, such as word sense disambiguation, and lexical selection.

Hence, huge volumes of data are being generated in attempt to detect incipient faulty conditions and avoid abnormal process behavior. Most widely used techniques in fault detection and diagnosis are based on exploiting linear correlations in multidimensional data. Unfortunately, in situations where higher-order correlations play an important role, these methods are less effective. The problem of fault detection is discussed from a machine learning perspective using kernel methods. The fault detection problem is formulated to solve what is formulated as a quantile estimation problem. In this paper, a conceptual framework is proposed that extends the one-class problem to a related fault diagnosis problem, an issue that has received little attention in this context. Simulated data will be used to illustrate the methodology.

This necessitates the need for dynamic dependability assessment to ensure that these systems will perform as specified and will not fail in catastrophic ways. One approach in achieving this is to dynamically assess the modules in the synthesized code using software defect prediction techniques. Statistical models, such as Stepwise Multi-linear Regression models and multivariate models, and machine learning approaches, such as Artificial Neural Networks, Instance-based Reasoning, Bayesian-Belief Networks, Decision Trees, and Rule Inductions, have been investigated for predicting software quality. However, there is still no consensus about the best predictor model for software defects. In this paper, we evaluate different predictor models on four different real-time software defect data sets. The results show that a combination of 1R and Instance-based Learning along with the Consistency-based Subset Evaluation technique provides a relatively - better consistency in accuracy prediction compared to other models. The results also show that "size" and "complexity" metrics are not sufficient for accurately predicting real-time software defects.

In these approaches, first-principle prioritization criteria are replaced by a pairwise preference elicitation process. Nevertheless case-based approaches, using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique, become impractical when the size of the collection of requirements is greater than about twenty since the elicitation effort grows as the square of the number of requirements. We adopt a case-based framework for requirements prioritization, called Case-Based Ranking, which exploits machine learning techniques to overcome the scalability problem. This method reduces the acquisition effort by combining human preference elicitation and automatic preference approxtmation. Our goal in this paper is to describe the framework in details and to present empirical evaluations which aim at showing its effectiveness in overcoming the scalability problem. The results prove that on average our approach outperforms AHP with respect to the trade-off between expert elicitation effort and the requirement prioritization accuracy.

Several different models have been proposed to estimate the reliability growth, however none of them has proven to perform well considering different project characteristics. In this work, we explore Genetic Programming (GP) as an alternative approach to derive these models. GP is a powerful machine learning technique based on the idea of genetic algorithms and has been acknowledged as a very suitable technique for regression problems. The main motivation to choose GP for this task is its capability of learning from historical data, discovering an equation with different variables and operators. In this paper experiment were conducted to confirm this hypotheses and the results were compared with traditional and Neural Network models.

Classifying requirements: Towards a more rigorous analysis of natural-language specifications	16th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering, Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering	NOV 08-11, 2005	Chicago, IL	IEEE Comp Soc, Reliabil Soc				Requirements play a pivotal role in planning, selection, development, testing and operation of NASA's missions. Starting from mission objectives, requirements are successively decomposed intofiner detail and ultimately allocated to individual components. This decomposition process is sometimes referred to as "requirements flowdown" between successive levels. The correctness of this decomposition is obviously critical to mission success: if a higher level requirement is improperly decomposed into lower level requirements, the subsequent development-from that stage onwards will be jeopardized. A task to determine how to improve the rigor of requirements flowdown analyses has recently been completed. Since requirements continue to be written in natural language, the task focused on examining only natural language specifications for a JPL space mission system. One particular aspect of flow down analysis examined was classifying requirements by type - subsetting a collection of requirements in this fashion may significantly reduce the effort required to analyze a flowdown by restricting the number of requirements analyzed at any one time, and may increase the accuracy of the flow down analysis. The application of natural language processing techniques and machine learning techniques has resulted in classifiers that perform well in distinguishing between temporal and non-temporal requiremerits written in natural language. Such a capability could reduce the effort required to analyze requirements of a given type. Current plans call for extending this capability to improving automated tracing of related requirements and checking a set of related requirements for consistency.

It is coupled with a classifier based on support vector machines. The proposed approach determines automatically the optimal size of the feature set and chooses the most relevant features from a feature pool. Its performance was tested using a lung nodule database (66 true nodules and 123 false ones) acquired by multi-slice CT scans. From 23 features calculated for each detected structure, the suggested method determined 9 as the optimal feature subset size and selected the nine features. A support vector machine-based classifier trained with the optimal feature subset has resulted in 92.4% sensitivity and 85.4% specificity using leave-one-out cross validation. Experiments also showed significant improvement achieved by a system incorporating the proposed method over a system without it. It can be also applied to other machine learning problems: e.g. computer-aided diagnosis of lung nodules.

We analyze how properties of the domain theory, such as partialness and vagueness, influence classification accuracy. Experiments in a simple domain suggest that partial knowledge is more useful than vague knowledge. However, for data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we show that vague domain knowledge that in isolation performs at chance level can substantially increase classification accuracy when being incorporated into similarity-based classification.

Of particular interest is the way in which new beliefs are acquired and determined and old beliefs are retained or discarded. A parallel can be drawn to symbolic machine learning approaches where examples to be categorised are presented to the learning system and a theory is subsequently derived, usually over a number of iterations. It is therefore not surprising that the term 'theory revision' is used to describe this process [Ourston and Mooney, 1994]. Viewing a machine learning system as a rational reasoner allows us to begin seeing these seemingly disparate mechanisms in a similar light. In this paper we are concerned with characterising the well known inverse resolution operations [Muggleton, 1987; 1992] (and more recently, inverse entailment [Muggleton, 1995]) as AGM-style belief change operations. In particular, our account is based on the abductive expansion operation [Pagnucco et al., 1994; Pagnucco, 1996] and characterised by using the notion of epistemic entrenchment [Gardenfors and Makinson, 1988] extended for this operation. This work provides a basis for reconciling work in symbolicmachine learning and belief revision. Moreover, it allows machine learning techniques to be understood as forms of nonmonotonic reasoning.

We present techniques for addressing these challenges. First, we show a novel application of machine-learning decision-tree to efficiently map multi-featured observations to matching plan steps. Second, we provide efficient lazy-commitment recognition algorithms that avoid enumerating hypotheses with every observation, instead only carrying out bookkeeping incrementally The algorithms answer queries as to the current state of the agent, as well as its history of selected states. We provide empirical results demonstrating their efficiency and capabilities.

Ensembles allow us to achieve higher accuracy, which is often not achievable with single models. One technique, which proved to be effective for constructing an ensemble of diverse classifiers, is the use of feature subsets. Among different approaches to ensemble feature selection, genetic search was shown to perform best in many domains. In this paper, a new strategy GAS-SEFS, Genetic Algorithm-based Sequential Search for Ensemble Feature Selection, is introduced. Instead of one genetic process, it employs a series of processes, the goal of each of which is to build one base classifier. Experiments on 21 data sets are conducted, comparing the new strategy with a previously considered genetic strategy for different ensemble sizes and for five different ensemble integration methods. The experiments show that GAS-SEFS, although being more time-consuming, often builds better ensembles, especially on data sets with larger numbers of features.

Therefore, semi-supervised learning algorithms such as co-training have attracted much attention. Previous research mainly focuses on semi-supervised classification. In this paper, a co-training style semi-supervised regression algorithm, i.e. COREG, is proposed. This algorithm uses two k-nearest neighbor regressors with different distance metrics, each of which labels the unlabeled data for the other regressor where the labeling confidence is estimated through consulting the influence of the labeling of unlabeled examples on the labeled ones. Experiments show that COREG can effectively exploit unlabeled data to improve regression estimates.

TimeML-an emerging standard for temporal annotation as a language capturing properties and relationships among time-denoting expressions and events in text-is a good starting point for bridging the gap between temporal analysis of documents and reasoning with the information derived from them. Hard as TimeML-compliant analysis is, the small size of the only currently available annotated corpus makes it even harder. We address this problem with a hybrid TimeML annotator, which uses cascaded finite-state grammars (for temporal expression analysis, shallow syntactic parsing, and feature generation) together with a machine learning component capable of effectively using large amounts of unannotated data.

This knowledge is represented using publicly available ontologies that contain hundreds of thousands of concepts, such as the Open Directory; these ontologies are further enriched by several orders of magnitude through controlled Web crawling. Prior to text categorization, a feature generator analyzes the documents and maps them onto appropriate ontology concepts, which in turn induce a set of generated features that augment the standard bag of words. Feature generation is accomplished through contextual analysis of document text, implicitly performing word sense disambiguation. Coupled with the ability to generalize concepts using the ontology, this approach addresses the two main problems of natural language processing-synonymy and polysemy. Categorizing documents with the aid of knowledge-based features leverages information that cannot be deduced from the documents alone. Experimental results confirm improved performance, breaking through the plateau previously reached in the field.

In this approach, the system first learns to distinguish different uses of instances of the word one; in the second stage, the antecedents of those instances of one that are classified as anaphoric are then determined. We evaluated our approach on written texts drawn from the informative domains of the British National Corpus (BNC), and achieved encouraging results. To our knowledge, this is the first learning-based system for the identification and resolution of one-anaphora.

Beyond TFIDF Weighting for Text Categorization in the Vector Space Model	19TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (IJCAI-05)			English	Proceedings Paper	19th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 05)	JUL 30-AUG 05, 2005	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	BCS, Scottish Enterprise, QinetiQ, BTO, Foresight, Microsoft Research, ERCIM, Intelligent Applications Ltd, IBM, CologNET, Intel, Google				KNN and SVM are two machine learning approaches to Text Categorization (TC) based on the Vector Space Model. In this model, borrowed from Information Retrieval, documents are represented as a vector where each component is associated with a particular word from the vocabulary. Traditionally, each component value is assigned using the information retrieval TFIDF measure. While this weighting method seems very appropriate for IR, it is not clear that it is the best choice for TC problems. Actually, this weighting method does not leverage the information implicitly contained in the categorization task to represent documents. In this paper, we introduce a new weighting method based on statistical estimation of the importance of a word for a specific categorization problem. This method also has the benefit to make feature selection implicit, since useless features for the categorization problem considered get a very small weight. Extensive experiments reported in the paper shows that this new weighting method improves significantly the classification accuracy as measured on many categorization tasks.

So far much of the research has been focused on English due to the lack of semantically annotated resources in other languages. In this paper, we report first results on semantic role labeling using a pre-release version of the Chinese Proposition Bank. Since the Chinese Proposition Bank is superimposed on top of the Chinese Treebank, i.e., the semantic role labels are assigned to constituents in a treebank parse tree, we start by reporting results on experiments using the hand-crafted parses in the treebank. This will give us a measure of the extent to which the semantic role labels can be bootstrapped from the syntactic annotation in the treebank. We will then report experiments using a fully automatic Chinese parser that integrates word segmentation, POS-tagging and parsing. This will gauge how successful semantic role labeling can be done for Chinese in realistic situations. We show that our results using hand-crafted parses are slightly higher than the results reported for the state-of-the-art semantic role labeling systems for English using the Penn English Proposition Bank data, even though the Chinese Proposition Bank is smaller in size. When an automatic parser is used, however, the accuracy of our system is much lower than the English state-of-the-art. This reveals an interesting cross-linguistic difference between the two languages, which we attempt to explain. We also describe a method to induce verb classes from the Proposition Bank "frame files" that can be used to improve semantic role labeling.

Approximating Pseudo-Boolean Functions on Non-Uniform Domains	19TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (IJCAI-05)			English	Proceedings Paper	19th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 05)	JUL 30-AUG 05, 2005	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	BCS, Scottish Enterprise, QinetiQ, BTO, Foresight, Microsoft Research, ERCIM, Intelligent Applications Ltd, IBM, CologNET, Intel, Google				In Machine Learning (ML) and Evolutionary Computation (EC), it is often beneficial to approximate a complicated function by a simpler one, such as a linear or quadratic function, for computational efficiency or feasibility reasons (cf. [Jin, 2005]). A complicated function (the target function in ML or the fitness function in EC) may require an exponential amount of computation to learn/evaluate, and thus approximations by simpler functions are needed. We consider the problem of approximating pseudo-Boolean functions by simpler (e. g., linear) functions when the instance space is associated with a probability distribution. We consider {0; 1}(n) as a sample space with a (possibly non-uniform) probability measure on it, thus making pseudo-Boolean functions into random variables. This is also in the spirit of the PAC learning framework of Valiant [Valiant, 1984] where the instance space has a probability distribution on it. The best approximation to a target function f is then defined as the function g (from all possible approximating functions of the simpler form) that minimizes the expected distance to f. In an example, we use methods from linear algebra to find, in this more general setting, the best approximation to a given pseudo-Boolean function by a linear function.	[Lax, R.

We use datasets to build and validate prediction systems of software development effort, for example. However it is not uncommon for datasets to contain missing values. When using machine learning techniques to build such prediction systems, handling of incomplete data is an important issue for classifier learning since missing values in either training or test set or in both sets can affect prediction accuracy. Many works in machine learning and statistics have shown that combining (ensemble) individual classifiers is an effective technique for improving accuracy of classification. The ensemble strategy is investigated in the context of incomplete data and software prediction. An ensemble Bayesian multiple imputation and nearest neighbour single imputation method, BAMINNSI, is proposed that constructs ensembles based on two imputation methods. Strong results on two benchmark industrial datasets using decision trees support the method.

We need to systematically address missing data values, feature subset selection and the continuous evolution of predictions as the project unfolds, and all of this in the context of data-starvation and noisy data. However in this paper we particularly focus on feature subset selection and effort prediction at an early stage of a project. We propose a novel approach of using Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) of Grey System Theory (GST), which is a recently developed system engineering theory based on the uncertainty of small samples. In this work we address some of the theoretical challenges in applying GRA to feature subset selection and effort prediction, and then evaluate our approach on five publicly available industrial data sets using stepwise regression as a benchmark. The results are very encouraging in the sense of being comparable or better than other machine learning techniques and thus indicate that the method has considerable potential.

Our goal in this paper is to investigate the problem of finding such a set of protein pairs in an organism by machine learning methods. Yeast genome was taken for this study and support vector machine was adopted as the classification model. Domain information of each protein was extracted and transformed into features of a protein pair. We specifically analyzed the effect of negative sample selection based on different principles. We also evaluated the feasibility to adjust the intercept parameter of a trained SVM model to improve the ratio of predicted true positive. Our result shows that the approximate 1:3 ratio of positive samples to negative ones in the testing data can be significantly improved to 2:1 of the positive to negative in the predicted data.

In addition to their application in cancer class prediction and discovery, gene expression data can be used for the prediction of patient survival. Here, we use particle swarm optimization (PSO) to address one of the major challenges in gene expression data analysis, the curse of dimensionality, in order to discriminate high risk patients from low risk patients. A discrete binary version of PSO is used for gene selection and dimensionality reduction, and a probabilistic neural network (PNN) is implemented as the classifier. The experimental results on the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma data set demonstrate the effectiveness of PSO/PNN system in survival prediction.

While cross sectional images of distribution of optical properties can now be generated easily, clinical interpretation of these images remains a challenge. In this paper, we apply and analyse two machine learning methods for optimal identification and severity classification of RA in a data set of 78 joints. The methods surveyed include Fisher Face with Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Transformed Mixtures of Gausians (TMG). It appears that TMG methods outperform the approach using Fisher Face with SVMs; however, the results need to be further validated in studies involving larger patient populations.

SVM can be used for classification and regression. Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a very important branch of Support Vector Machine. Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) have been successfully treated by using SVR in previous works. The forward problems of EIT are the basis of EIT inverse problems. The forward problem's essence is to solve PDEs. The method has been successfully tested on the forward problems of EIT and has yielded accurate results.

However, the extraction of key features from massive EEG data for mental fatigue identification remains a challenge. The objective of this study is to identify the key EEG features in relationship to mental fatigue, from a broad pool of EEG features generated by quantitative EEG (qEEG) techniques, using Random Forests (RF), which is a recently developed machine learning algorithm. The method is applied to key EEG feature extraction for 5-level mental fatigue identification using the five subjects' EEG data recorded in 25-hour fatigue experiments. RF produces significant feature reduction with little compromise of the classification performance. The identified key EEG features also indicate that electrode locations in frontal and occipital regions of the brain are most important for adequate representation of the deactivation of functional lobes of the brain, which is consistent with the anatomical areas known to be involved in mental fatigue. It is also interesting to discover that the four frequency bands are all important for the mental fatigue identification.

Different to most previous methods which are designed to predict the exposure state (exposed/buried, exposed/intermediate/buried, etc) of a particular residue according to its relative solvent accessibility, this method predicts the real value of RSA, by which more information about residue location in protein 3D structure can be retained than state assignment. Measurements for prediction performance, i.e. the mean absolute error (MAE) and correlation coefficient (CC), were compared with a former RVP-Net method, which was based on a multilayer feed-forward neural network. With 3-fold cross validation test, the MAE and CC of the SVR method for all data sets were consistently better than those obtained by the RVP-Net. In addition, we used the profile of multiple sequence alignment as input and achieved a significant improvement in prediction performance comparing with using only single sequence information. The final prediction result on the CB-513 data set by our method was 16.8% for MAE and 0.562 for CC. The results demonstrate that SVR is a useful tool for protein sequence analyses.

In this regard, the search for attributes and features characterizing these sites is of prime consequence. Here, we present an implementation of a kernel-based machine learning protocol for identifying residues on a DNA-binding protein form the interface with the DNA. Sequence and structural features including solvent accessibility, local composition, net charge and electrostatic potentials are examined. These features are then fed into Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict the DNA-binding residues on the surface of the protein. In order to compare with published work, we predict binding residues by training on other binding and non-binding residues in the same protein for which we achieved an accuracy of 79%. The sensitivity and specificity are 59% and 89%. We also consider a more realistic approach, predicting the binding residues of proteins entirely withheld from the training set achieving values of 66%, 43% and 81%, respectively. Performances reported here are better than other published results. Moreover, since our protocol does not lean on sequence or structural homology, it can be used to annotate unclassified proteins and more generally to identify novel binding sites with no similarity to the known cases.

In contrast to hospital or urgent care scheduling systems, ambulatory health care centers offer different challenge for scheduling optimization. The aim is similar, i.e. to reduce the average waiting time and maintain high resource utilization, but the concept is different. In this paper we present a multiagent based system for long-term scheduling, where agents use their time-series forecasting and pattern recognition abilities to predict possible patient flow peaks and inform the main scheduling agent of these events. To ease such peaks, we use adaptive nurse scheduling by adapting the nurse schedules each week-end. Our multi-agent system helps the personnel managers and other staff in health centers to adapt the nurse and patient scheduling in dependence of the current patient flow.

Experimental identification of protein kinases' (PKs) substrates with their phosphorylation sites is time-consuming and often restricted by the availabitity of enzymatic reactions. Phosphorylation sites prediction with their specific kinase from machine learning approaches based on their primary sequences is favorably needed, for these methods can provide fast and automatic annotations, which can be used as guidelines for further experimental consideration. In this paper, we presented a modified k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) method measured by the Manhattan distance for phosphonlation site prediction. BLOSUM62-based similarity scores between two phosphorylation sites were adopted as the input vectors. Leave-one-out testing on two PK groups, PKA and CK2, shows that it outperforms two existing methods, Scansite and NetPhosK, which suggests that this method is another competitive computational approach in this branch of bioinformatics.

In this work, an algorithm based on gradient boosting is presented, that detects event-related potentials in single electroencephalogram (EEG) trials. The algorithm is used to detect the P300 in the human EEG and to build a brain-computer interface (BCI), specifically a spelling device. Important features of the method described here are its high classification accuracy and its conceptual simplicity. The algorithm was tested with datasets recorded in our lab and one benchmark dataset from the BCI Competition 2003. The number of correctly inferred symbols with the P300 speller paradigm varied between 90% and 100%. In particular, all of the inferred symbols were correct for the BCI competition dataset.

Although the computational demand is considerably higher, this approach could allow the simultaneous classification of a multitude of conditions. We present an extension of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) - based source localization that is fully automatic, and apply this method to the classification of EEG data generated by imaginary movements of the right and left index finger.

This difference might arise out of users' perceptual confusion. We use a machine learning approach to learn the difference of this perceptual characteristic, and employ the classifier to aid classification in P300 speller. Experiments show that our method remarkably improves the performance.

For such datasets, a class prediction model could be very successful in classifying one type of dataset but may fail to perform in a similar fashion for other datasets. This paper presents a Stacked Regression Ensemble (SRE) model for cancer class prediction. Results indicate that SRE has provided performance stability for various microarray datasets. The performance of SRE has been cross validated using the k-fold cross validation method (leave one out) technique for BRCA1, BRCA2 and Sporadic classes for ovarian and breast cancer microarray datasets. The paper also presents comparative results of SRE with most commonly used SVM and GRNN. Empirical results confirmed that SIZE has demonstrated better performance stability as compared to SVM and GRNN for the classification of assorted cancer data.

Ordinal optimization offers an efficient framework for simulation based optimization approaches. In this paper, a new constrained ordinal optimization method is presented for solving remanufacturing planning problems. The scheme of "Horse Race" with Feasibility Model (HRFM) is developed to select the set of good enough plans. The rough set method in machine learning and knowledge discovery is applied to generate rules for feasibility determination. This method is compared with the Blind Picking with Feasibility Model (BPFM) method. Numerical testing of a practical remanufacturing system shows that the HRFM method presented in this paper is more efficient to meet the same required alignment probability.

The method is based on a growing, neural network that initially produces senseless signals but later associates rewarding signals and quasi-rewarding signals with recent perceptions and motor activities and, based on these data, incorporates new cells and creates new connections. The rewarding signals are produced in a device that plays a role of a "pleasure center", whereas the quasi-rewarding signals (that represent pleasure expectation) are generated by the network itself. The network was tested using a simulated mobile robot equipped with a pair of motors, a set of touch sensors, and a camera. Despite a lack of innate wiring for a useful behavior, (lie robot learned without an external guidance how to avoid obstacles and approach an object of interest, which is fundamental for creatures and usually handcrafted in traditional robotic systems.

In this paper, a method is presented for estimating human pose from a sequence of images taken by a single camera. The method is based on a machine learning technique and it partitions human body into a number of clusters. Body parts are tracked over the image sequence while satisfying body constraints. An active sensing hardware is used in both methods to capture a stream of depth images at video rates, which are consequently analyzed for pose extraction. Experimental results are shown to validate our approach and characteristics of our approach are discussed.			kfujimura@honda-ri.com; zhu.81@osu.edu; vng@honda-ri.com					Agarwal A., 2004, CVPR; Athitsos V., 2002, Proceedings of Fifth IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face Gesture Recognition, DOI 10.1109/AFGR.2002.1004129; Bretzner L., 2002, Proceedings of Fifth IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face Gesture Recognition, DOI 10.1109/AFGR.2002.1004190; CHEUNG K, 2005, INT J COMPUT VISION, P225; Dontcheva M, 2003, ACM T GRAPHIC, V22, P409, DOI 10.1145/882262.882285; Gavrila D.

Our aim is to develop a prototype fusion capability that can categorise, fuse and present intelligence information to military officers. To date, our focus has been on text information categorisation using both existing text classification techniques (e.g. Weighted Feature Vector (WFV) classification) and machine learning algorithms based on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) and natural language processing techniques. The algorithms have been used to automatically assign documents to a pre-existing set of categories by correlating text within the documents to text relating to classifications/categories. Once text documents are categorised according to their content, then fusion can begin. The results of initial experiments indicate that the ILP approach performs at least as well as the WFV technique, and outperforms it in one set of experiments. Both techniques have the scope for further improvements which we outline in this paper.

Different PD sources have different effects on the insulation performance of power apparatus. Therefore, identification of PD sources is of interest to both the power equipment manufacturers and utilities. A method based on machine learning theory, namely the support vector machine (SVM) was used for PD identification. Obtained experimental results from different partial discharge sources were pre-processed by using phase based information and wavelet analysis. Pre-processed data were also used as the SVM's input vectors, which was initially trained by known discharge source data, and then applied to identify different types of discharge sources. Initial results indicate that, by using appropriate kernels and parameters, the automatic identification results obtained using the SVM technique is encouraging.

Our goal is to use automatic recognition of animal vocalizations to census the populations of native frogs and the invasive introduced species, the Cane Toad (see Fig. 1). This is a challenging application because it requires high frequency acoustic sampling, complex signal processing and wide area sensing coverage. We set up two prototypes of wireless sensor networks that recognize vocalizations of up to 9 frog species found in northern Australia. Our first prototype is simple and consists of only resource-rich Stargate devices. Our second prototype is more complex and consists of a hybrid mixture of Stargates and inexpensive, resource-poor Mica2 devices operating in concert. In the hybrid system, the Mica2s are used to collect acoustic samples, and expand the sensor network coverage. The Stargates are used for resource-intensive tasks such as Fast Fourier Mransforms (FFTs) and machine learning. The hybrid system incorporates three algorithms designed to account for the sampling, processing and communication bottlenecks of the Mica2s (i) high frequency sampling, (ii) compression and noise reduction, to reduce data transmission by up to 90%, and (iii) sampling scheduling, which exploits the sensor network redundancy to increase the effective sample processing rate. We evaluate the performance of both systems over a range of scenarios, and demonstrate that the feasibility and benefits of a hybrid systems approach justify the additional system complexity.

Automated learning of genome sequences by computational intelligence	2005 ICSC CONGRESS ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE METHODS AND APPLICATIONS (CIMA 2005)			English	Proceedings Paper	ICSC Congress on Computational Intelligence Methods and Applications	DEC 15-17, 2005	Istanbul, TURKEY	ICSC		protein function; classification		Advent of high-throughput sequencing technology has led to an exploration of DNA sequence data available. Structures and functions of protein sequence coded for by sequenced genomes remain largely unknown. Automated identification of protein functions and interactions have been largely relying on the known 3-D structures or sequence homologues. In particular, intrinsic unstructured or disordered proteins lack specific 3-D structures and are unconserved during evolution, but play central roles in diseases characterized by protein misfolding and aggregation. Can we assign protein functions to sequences without relying on 3-D structures, to provide useful information for the study of diseases? We developed machine learning techniques to rapidly assess protein functions from sequences. The problem of assigning functional classes to proteins is complicated by the fact that a single protein can participate in several different pathways and thus can have multiple functions (due to complex interactions among proteins). It follows that the instances in the resulting classification problem can carry multiple class labels. We have developed a tree-based classifier that capable of classifying multiply-labeled data and gained an insight into the multi-functional nature of proteins. The algorithm has been used with ensemble methods in connection with other computational intelligence to form a committee machine. Results have been compared favorably to those achieved algorithms such as decision trees and Support Vector Machines.

The assessment of the dilatation is done by comparing the size of the bronchus and accompanying artery. Previous work has shown that the success of an automatic bronchial dilatation detection method is limited by high measurement error rate of small bronchi and arteries. This paper presents a new method for automatic detection of accompanying arteries and assessment of bronchial dilatation. A knowledge-guided template matching is used to approximately locate the accompanying artery of a bronchus. A seeded region growing, with leaking prevention and correction, is used to precisely segment the artery. Bronchus-artery lumen area ratio (LAR) and their shortest diameter ratio (SDR) are used to compare the sizes of a bronchus and the accompanying artery. Machine learning is used to determine the suitable severity thresholds for different sizes of bronchi. The method was evaluated using 324 images from 64 patient studies. the results were compared with manual identification and classification, which were verified by an experienced radiologist. The method achieved 90% and 82% accuracies for artery detection and dilatation assessment, respectively.

We derive an MML model selection criterion for invertible MA time series models using the Wallace and Freeman (1987) MML approximation, MML87. The MML model order selection performance is compared with other well-known model selection criteria such as Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), Corrected AIC (AICc), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Minimum Description Length (MDL, 1978), and the Hannan-Quinn (HQ) criterion. Our experiments show that the MML-based criterion achieves the lowest average mean squared prediction error and the best average log likelihood, and has the best ability to choose the true MA model order for smaller sample sizes.

The knowledge of gene functions is crucial for understanding many fundamental biological mechanisms such as regulatory, pathways, cell cycles and diseases. Our major goal is to accurately infer functions of putative genes or ORFs (Open Reading Frames) from existing databases using computational methods. However, this task is intrinsicallv difficult since the underlying biological processes represent complex interactions of multiple entities. Therefore many functional links would be missing when only one or two source of data is used in the prediction. Our hypothesis is that integrating evidence from multiple and complementary sources could significantly improve the prediction accuracy. In this paper, our experimental results not only suggest that the above hypothesis is valid, but also provide guidelines for using the WNB system for data collection, training and predictions. The combined training data sets contain information from gene annotations, gene expressions, clustering outputs, keyword annotations and. sequence homology from public databases. The current system is trained and tested on the genes of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our WNB model can also be used to analyze the contribution of each source of information toward the prediction performance through the weight training process. The contribution analysis. could potentially lead to significant scientific discovery by the interpretation and understanding of the complex relationships between biological entities.

We validate our method by, applying it to distinguish diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) from follicular lymphoma (FL) on two independent datasets: the HuGeneFL Affmetrixy dataset of Shipp et al. (www. genome.wi.mit.du/MPR/lymphoma) and the Hu95Av2 Affymetrix dataset (DallaFavera's laboratory, Columbia University). Our meta-classification technique achieves higher predictive accuracies than each of the individual classifiers. trained on the same dataset and is robust against various data perturbations. We also find that combinations of p53 responsive genes (e.g., p53, PLK1 and CDK2) are highly predictive of the phenotype.

Images are classified using randomly extracted subwindows that are suitably normalized to yield robustness to certain image transformations. Our method is evaluated on four very different, publicly available datasets (COIL-100, ZuBuD, ETH80, WANG). Our results show that our automatic approach is generic and robust to illumination, scale, and viewpoint changes. An extension of the method is proposed to improve its robustness with respect to rotation changes.

These 47K shots with 433K labels from over 1000 visual concept categories comprise the largest publicly available ground truth for this domain. Our analysis of this data, combining the tools of statistical natural language processing, machine learning, and computer vision, finds significant novel statistical patterns that can be exploited for the accurate tracking of the episodes of a given news story over time, by using semantic labels that are solely visual. We find that the ground "truth" is very muddy, but by using the feature selection tool of information gain, we extract 14 reliable visual concepts with mid-frequency use,all but one are visual concepts that refer to settings, rather than actors, objects, or events. We discover that the probability of another episode of a named story to recur after a gap of d days is proportional to 1/(d + 1). We define a novel similarity measure incorporating both semantic and temporal properties between episodes i and j as: Dice(i, j)/(1+gap(i, j)). We exploit a low-level computer vision technique, normalized cut (Laplacian eigenmaps), for clustering these episodes into stories, and in the process document a weakness of this popular technique. We use these empirical results to make specific recommendations on how better visual semantic ontologies for news stories, and how better video annotation tools, should be designed.

FMRI provides a sequence of 3D brain images with intensities representing brain activations. Standard techniques for fMRI analysis traditionally focused on finding the area of most significant brain activation for different sensations or activities. In this paper, we explore a new application of machine learning methods to a more challenging problem: classifying subjects into groups based on the observed 3D brain images when the subjects are performing the same task. Here we address the separation of drug-addicted subjects from healthy non-drug-using controls. In this paper we explore a number of classification approaches. We introduce a novel algorithm that integrates side information into the use of boosting. Our algorithm clearly outperformed well-established classifiers as documented in extensive experimental results. This is the first time that machine learning techniques based on 3D brain images are applied to a clinical diagnosis that currently is only performed through patient self-report. Our tools can therefore provide information not addressed by traditional analysis methods and substantially improve diagnosis.(1).

We report results on a series of experiments comparing recognition engines, including AdaBoost, support vector machines, linear discriminant analysis. We also explored feature selection techniques, including the use of AdaBoost for feature selection prior to classification by SVM or LDA. Best results were obtained by selecting a subset of Gabor filters using AdaBoost followed by classification with Support Vector Machines. The system operates in real-time, and obtained 93% correct generalization to novel subjects for a 7-way forced choice on the Cohn-Kanade expression dataset. The outputs of the classifiers change smoothly as a function of time and thus can be used to measure facial expression dynamics. We applied the system to to fully automated recognition of facial actions (FRCS). The present system classifies 17 action units, whether they occur singly or in combination with other actions, with a mean accuracy of 94.8%. We present preliminary results for applying this system to spontaneous facial expressions.

It is often beneficial to derive the projections not only based on the inputs but also on the target values in the training data set. This is of particular importance in predicting multivariate or structured outputs. which is an area of growing interest. In this paper we introduce a novel projection framework which is sensitive to both input features and outputs. Based on the derived features prediction accuracy can be greatly improved. We validate our approach in two applications. The first is to model users ' preferences on a set of paintings. The second application is concerned with image categorization where each image may belong to multiple categories. The proposed algorithm produces very encouraging results in both settings.

Some of the demanding characteristic of semiconductor data include high dimensionality, mixtures of categorical and numerical data, non-randomly Gaussian data, non-Gaussian and multi-modal distributions, highly non-linear complex relationships, noise and outliers in both x and y dimensions, temporal dependencies, etc. These challenges are becoming particularly crucial as the quantity of available data is-growing dramatically. This paper addresses the problem of automatic wafer manufacturing process error detection based on electrical wafer sort (EWS) parametric tests. A wafer-to-wafer analysis is presented that automatically detect possible errors in the manufacturing process that causes systematic damage to the product as it passes through some step in the process. Possible causes are equipment mishandling, operator error, material issues such as contamination, etc. These manufacturing errors are reflected on the physical and electrical properties of the wafers, which are measured by the parametric tests in the EWS process. The core of this research is a novel classifier system based on the benefits arising from the interaction between evolutionary algorithms and artificial neural networks. Experimental results demonstrates that this system is able to detect defective wafers with an accuracy of 82%. Prior to the EWS classification, the proposed system is evaluated with three classification benchmark problems: Iris dataset, Australian credit card problem, and the Pumas diabetes dataset.

We present Sycophant, a context learning calendaring application program which is designed to learn a mapping from user-related contextual features to reminder actions. In this paper, we consider the feasibility of using a genetics-based machine learning technique, XCS, for the purpose of learning this mapping from a set of context features to reminder actions as a predictive data-mining task. We compare XCS's performance with a decision tree algorithm on this learning task and show that XCS outperforms the decision tree learner.

Typically, agents are programmed by hand, but it would be a great advantage to transfer human experience into football agents. The first aim of our paper is to use Machine Learning techniques to obtain models of humans playing Robosoccer. These models can be used later to control a Robosoccer agent. However, models did not play as smoothly and optimally as the human. To solve this problem, the second goal of this paper is to incrementally correct models by means of evolutionary techniques, and to adapt them against more difficult opponents than the ones beatable by the human.

It has generally been assumed that initializing a learning algorithm with previously learned solutions will be helpful if the new problem is similar to the old. We will show that this assumption sometimes does not hold for many reasonable similarity metrics. Using a more traditional machine learning perspective, we explain why seeding is sometimes not helpful by looking at the learning-experience bias produced by the previously evolved solutions.

One of the causes for the unfulfilled expectations is the discrepancy between the external problem solving goal and the internal mechanisms of the algorithm. In this paper, we investigate in a principled way the relationships between the internal subjective metric used as fitness by a co-evolutionary algorithm and the external objective metric measuring the algorithm's progress towards the envisioned goal. We point out the complexity of these relationships and explain their causes.

The comparison includes linear regression, neural networks, regression trees, k-nearest neighbors, and locally-weighted regression, tested on the same historical data. In spite of the expected superiority of non-linear methods over Unear regression, the only non-linear method that could consistently outperform linear regression was locally-weighted regression. This suggests that novel iterative linear regression algorithms should be a preferred prediction methods for large-scale travel time prediction.

The differences between these features can be used to calculate relative acoustic distances between phonemes. However, when speech signals are spectrally degraded, as in electric hearing with cochlear implants, it is unclear whether these acoustic distances can predict speech recognition performance. The present study measured acoustic distances between spectrally degraded vowel tokens and investigated the relation between acoustic vowel space and perceptual vowel space. After processing vowel tokens using a cochlear implant simulation, Mel-frequency cepstrum was extracted from each token; features were then time aligned and the weighted Euclidean distance was calculated between all tokens. Results demonstrated a significant correlation between vowel perception data and averaged acoustic distance between vowel tokens, for a variety of experimental conditions. These results suggest that acoustic distance between phonemes may well predict recognition performance of spectrally degraded speech.

The blind image deconvolution was formulated as a machine learning problem. From the training set, the mapping between the noisy blurred image and the original image are learned by support vector regression (SVR). With the acquired mapping, the degraded image can be restored. Our approach was experimentally compared with the adaptive Lucy-Richardson maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm. In terms of ISNR (Improvement of Signal to Noise Ratio), SVR outperformes ML in blind deblurring tests in which the types of blurs, point spread function (PSF) support, and noise energy are all unknown.

Recent work demonstrated how to automatically identify a speaker's choice between full and reduced pronunciations using acoustic modeling techniques from speech recognition. Here, we extend this approach and show flow its results can be used to predict a speaker's choice of pronunciations for synthesis. We apply machine learning techniques to the automatically categorized data to produce a pronunciation variation prediction model given only the utterance text - allowing the system to synthesize novel phrases with variations like those the speaker would make. Empirical studies emphasize that we can improve automatic pronunciation labels and successfully utilize the results for prediction of future synthesized examples. The prediction results based on these automatic labels are very similar to those trained from human labeled data - allowing us to reduce manual effort while still achieving comparable results.

This paper presents an innovative missing value estimation technique, called Collateral Missing Value Estimation (CMVE) which has demonstrated superior estimation performance compared with the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) imputation algorithm, the Least Square Impute (LSImpute) and Bayesian Principal Component Analysis (BPCA) techniques. Experimental results confirm that CMVE provides an improvement of 89%, 12% and 10% for the BRCA1, BRCA2 and Sporadic ovarian cancer mutations respectively compared to the average error rate of KNN, LSImpute and BPCA imputation methods, over a range of randomly selected missing values. The underlying theory behind CMVE also means that it is not restricted to bioinformatics data, but can be successfully applied to any correlated data set.

The approach is named as large margin HMM. Firstly, we will show that this type of large margin HMM estimation problem can be formulated as a standard constrained minimax optimization problem. Secondly, we propose an iterative localized optimization approach to perform the above minimax optimization for one model at each time to guarantee that the optimal value of the objective function always exists in the course of model parameter optimization. Then, we show that during each step the optimization can be solved by the GPD (generalized probabilistic descent) algorithm if we approximate the objective function by a differentiable function, such as summation of exponential functions. The large margin HMM-based classifiers are evaluated in a speaker-independent E-set speech recognition task by using the OGI ISOLET database. Experimental results show that the large margin HMMs can achieve significant word error rate (WER) reduction over the conventional HMM training methods, such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and minimum classification error (MCE) training.

In this paper, we consider symbol detection with time-varying unknown phase. We propose a solution based on expectation propagation (EP). EP is an extension to belief propagation and developed in machine learning. We point out that the developed EP solution can be considered as iterated extended Kalman smoother (EKS). However, a crucial step of recycling the likelihoods in EP makes possible the further improvement over EKS. We show in the simulation that EP can produce very good performance with relatively low complexity. Since it produce soft information, the EP solution can be readily applied to iterative detection of coded systems.

Classification is one of the important research topics on these research areas. Most of the researches on classification concern that a complete data set is given as a training set and the test data know all values of attributes clearly. Unfortunately, incomplete data are commonly seen in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a new strategy to deal with the incomplete quantitative data and introduce a supervised learning method based on genetic programming to handle the classification problem with incomplete data in the attributes. Two experiments are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

In order to improve the efficiency, we develop a new computation model based on relative attribute dependency defined as the proportion of the projection of the decision table on a condition attributes subset to the projection of the decision table on the union of the condition attributes subset and the decision attributes set. Two novel algorithms to find optimal reducts of condition attributes based on the relative attribute dependency are implemented using Java 1.4, and are experimented with 10 data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The experiment results demonstrate their usefulness and are analyzed for further research.

In this paper, a novel adaptive discretizer is proposed to discretize attributes with continuous values so that granular computing and rough set theory can avoid dealing with huge number of continuous values. It is demonstrated that this adaptive discretizer can improve quality of reducts and reduce the number of basic granules in an information system with continuous attributes. The experimental results on benchmark data sets show that the adaptive discretizer can improve the decision accuracy for the machine learning approaches based rough sets.

One of the main characters of intelligence agent is that it can adapt to the unknown environment. The ability to learn is the key property of agent. Because the learning act of agent is dynamic and fuzzy, this paper uses the conception of dynamic fuzzy logic[1]. First, it gives the conception of agent learning based on DFL. Then, it supplies a multi-agent learning model based on DFL, namely a multi-agent learning model planned on a whole. Furthermore, the paper validates that the model is an useful model by an example.

In this paper, the notions of tolerance relation based information granular space are introduced and formalized mathematically. It is a uniform model to study problems in model recognition and machine learning. The key strength of the model is the capability of granulating knowledge in both consecutive and discrete attribute space based on tolerance relation. Such capability is re-established in granulation and an application in image texture-shape recognition is illustrated. Simulation results show the model is effective and efficient.

Therefore we prefer to incremental learning algorithms especially when the data available are obtained at different intervals. The key of SVM to incremental training is to assure the final results consists of almost all support vectors. This paper proposes a divisional incremental training algorithm of SVM, considering the possible impact of new training data to history learning results. Training data are divided into smaller sets to decrease the computation complexity and the support vectors are obtained in a crossed way. The experiment results on the real-world test dataset show that the classification accuracy is satisfying, and the efficiency of proposed incremental algorithm is superior to that of batch SVM model.

One attribute of an efficient fixture plan is to know the optimum values of clamping forces. To solve this optimization problem, this study along investigating utilization of support vector machines (SVM) for fixture optimization, presents a hybrid method that uses finite element analysis (FEA) with a supportive combination of artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA). A frictional model of workpiece-fixture system under cutting and clamping forces is solved through FEA. The results of this analysis are used for training and querying SVM and ANN where they are required to recognize a pattern between the clamping forces and state of contact in the workpiece-fixture system and workpiece maximum elastic deformation. Using the identified pattern a GA based program determines the optimum values for clamping forces that do not cause excessive deformation or stress in the component. The advantage of this work to similar studies is predicting the contact status between clamps and the workpiece. The results contribute to automation of fixture design task and computer aided process planning.

One of the most significant areas affected by the disease is the capacity for functional communication as linguistic skills break down. These methods often do note capture the true nature of language deficits in spontaneous speech. We address this issue by exploring novel automatic and objective methods for diagnosing patients through analysis of spontaneous speech. We detail several lexical approaches to the problem of detecting and rating DAT. The approaches explored rely on character n-gram-based techniques, shown recently to perform successfully in a different, but related task of automatic authorship attribution. We also explore the correlation of usage frequency of different parts of speech and DAT. We achieve a high 95% accuracy of detecting dementia when compared with a control group, and we achieve 70% accuracy in rating dementia in two classes, and 50% accuracy in rating dementia into four classes. Our results show that purely computational solutions offer a viable alternative to standard approaches to diagnosing the level of impairment in patients. These results are significant step forward toward automatic and objective means to identifying early symptoms of DAT in older adults.

Naturally, videos include multimodality data Such as audio, speech, Visual and text, which are combined to infer therein the overall semantic concepts. However, in the literature, most researches were conducted within only one single domain. In this paper we propose an unsupervised technique that builds context-independent keyword lists for desired Visual concept modeling using WordNet. Furthermore, we propose an Extended Speech-based Visual Concept (ESVC) model to reorder and extend the above keyword lists by Supervised learning based on multimodality annotation. Experimental results show that the context-independent models can achieve comparable performance compared to conventional supervised learning algorithms, and the ESVC model achieves about 53% and 28.4% improvement in two testing subsets of the TRECVID 2003 corpus over a state-of-the-art speech-based video concept detection algorithm.

This paper presents an automated approach to analyzing and representing artistic color concepts such as color temperature, color palette and color contrasts in paintings domain. The color concept definitions rely on the widely accepted color theory of Itten. Our approach starts with the extraction of homogeneous color/texture regions from paintings, and employs image processing and machine learning techniques to characterize regions in terms of artistic color concepts. We evaluate the proposed method using collection of 1,000 paintings, which exhibit vast variety of painting styles and artistic color concepts.

Given a set of contact points and a certain robot arm and gripper, the goal is to select both the best assignment of gripper fingers to contact points and the best joint values that allow the fingers to reach such contact points. The system proposed is based on the generation of an inverse kinematics tree where fast searches can be performed in order to find the optimum configuration. Optimality is defined as similarity to previously stored examples over a hierarchical structure of configuration data, which includes finger assignments and robot joints.

A common heuristic is to declare a query infeasible if a path is not found in a fixed amount of time. In applications where many queries must be processed - for instance, robotic manipulation, multi-limbed locomotion, and contact motion - a critical question arises: what should this time limit be? This paper presents a machine-learning approach to deal with this question. In an off-line learning phase, a classifier is trained to quickly predict the feasibility of a query. Then, an improved multi-step motion planning algorithm uses this classifier to avoid wasting time on infeasible queries. This approach has been successfully demonstrated in simulation on a four-limbed, free-climbing robot.

In this paper we construct a wavelet transform to hybrid support vector machine and hidden Markov models (WSVM/HMM) speech recognition system to deal with arbitrary nonlinear functions. The proposed hybrid system has overcome the problem of acoustic modeling in state-of-the-art speech recognition systems that usually relies on UMM with Gaussian emission densities. HMMs suffer from intrinsic limitations, mainly due to their arbitrary parametric assumption. Artificial neural networks appear to be a promising alternative, but they historically failed as a general solution to the acoustic modeling problem. The proposed system has successfully exploited the benefits of wavelet technique, HMM and SVM in a unified framework. In this hybrid system, the WSVM is trained to estimate the emission probabilities of the states of the HMM. Simulations on benchmark databases show that speech recognition systems built around the hybrid WSVM/HMM provide excellent word recognition ratio and have performance superior than many other systems.

I propose an architecture which learns a hierarchy of increasingly abstract, invariant features. Invariance is achieved by selecting information which reflects distinctions present in supervisory signals conveyd by contextual inputs. The main hypothesis is that the right contextual information can be efficiently distributed by associations and attentional process. The original sources of contextual information are specialised systems which reflect the innate, hard-wired behavioural goals of the system. Sensorimotor coordination generates structured sensory stimuli and the intrinsic contextual signals can select the behaviourally significant structures.

The purpose of the classi er pound is to provide physical context to a separate system that mitigates unnecessary distractions, allowing the driver to maintain focus during periods of high dif culty pound. While watching videos of driving, we asked different users to indicate their perceptions of the current situation. We then trained a classi er pound to emulate the human recognition of driving situations using the Sandia Cognitive Framework. In unstructured conditions, such as driving in urban areas and the German autobahn, the classi er pound was able to correctly predict human perceptions of driving situations over 95% of the time. This paper focuses on the learning algorithms used to train the driving-situation classi er pound. Future work will reduce the human efforts needed to train the system.

Many algorithms for resource management in sensor networks require complete knowledge of the external environment and the sensor network system, are rule-based and cannot handle rapidly changing environments; this restricts their use in real-world environments. We present an event based control optimization formulation of the resource management problem and discuss a method to adaptively change desired system performance of the sensor network in response to events. This functionality is critical in field-deployable sensor networks where the available energy is extremely limited. This limitation disallows continuous operation as a very expensive option and necessitates system adaptation as a means to extend operational lifetime in the face of dynamic external events. We show results on synthetic sensor networks where only partially accurate information about the external world and the sensing system is available and illustrate the efficacy of the control algorithm in handling dynamic events with guaranteed minimum system lifespan via efficient usage of energy resources. We show that the control algorithm makes effective control decisions about the use of energy resources with varying sensor reliabilities.

Recognizing affective states from physiological cues is an effective way of implementing implicit human-robot interaction. Several machine learning techniques have been successfully employed in affect-recognition to predict the affective state of an individual given a set of physiological features. However, a systematic comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of these methods has not yet been done. In this paper we present a comparative study of four machine learning methods- K-Nearest Neighbor, Regression Tree, Bayesian Network and Support Vector Machine as applied to the domain of affect recognition using physiological signals. The results showed that Support Vector Machine gave the best classification accuracy even though all the methods performed competitively.

Meta-learning is a technique that generates local classifiers (concepts or models) from distributed data sets to use in producing a global classifier. This inherently distributed nature of meta-learning provides much advantage in implementing practical DDM systems. Currently machine learning techniques such as supervised neural networks, decision trees, rules and genetic algorithms are used in the meta-learning process. Inspired by the cognitive representation of human memory, this paper presents a novel mechanism known as Concept-Episodic Associative Memory with a Neighborhood Effect (C-EAMwNE) to compute meta-classifiers. C-EAMwNE is an enhanced version of EAMwNE model previously developed by the authors which overcomes practical limitations of other existing cognitive representations. C-EAMwNE is applied to a multi-agent DDM system with learning agents and a central administrator agent. Learning agents use C-EAMwNE to generate meta-classifiers at distributed data sites and communicate them to the central administrator agent (CAA). CAA produces a final concept description from the distributed classifiers to be used in classification tasks.

This is a challenging problem since an agent does not know a priori which information source would provide high quality information for particular topics. In this paper we utilize machine learning techniques to allow a set of distributed agents to use their past experience and collaborate with others to identify information sources with the best payoff. The proposed method allows an individual agent to estimate the next payoff based on its own history of interactions with the information source and also on collaboration with other agents whose individual analysis of the next payoff the agent trusts. Q-learning is applied for stochastic updates to the payoff. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides the best results when an individual agent collaborates with a moderate number of neighbors.

There is a shift from manual schema matching, done by human experts, to automatic matching, using various heuristics (schema matchers). In this work, we consider the problem of linearly combining the results of a set of schema matchers. We propose the use of machine learning algorithms to learn the optimal weight assignments, given a set of schema matchers. We also suggest the use of genetic algorithms to improve the process efficiency.	Univ Haifa, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel	Berkovsky, S (reprint author), Univ Haifa, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel.

But elaborating these resources is a heavy and time-consuming task. This paper is two-fold: it describes EADS DCS text-mining platform, in particular its service to annotate documents with semantic tags and it presents its extension for incremental learning of ontologies. Domain experts are assisted in the ontology population task by recent machine learning techniques (i.e. Conditional Random Fields). Comparisons are made between annotations from the ontology and from a trained CRF model, so as to detect candidate instances. An iterative process controlled by the experts results in knowledge discovery and constitution of an accurate ontology.			bruno.grilheres@eads.com; christophe.beauce@eads.com; scanu@insa-rouen.fr; stephan.brunessaux@eads.com					ALANI H, 2003, P KNOWL CAPT K CAP 0; BILENKO M, 2005, P MACH LEARN SEM WEB; Bowers A.F., 2000, P 17 INT C MACH LEAR, P81; BOZSAK E, 2002, E COMMERCE WEB TECHN; CELJUSKA D, 2004, SEMIAUTOMATIC POPULA; CRAVEN M, 1999, ARTIF INTELL, V18, P69; GRILHERES B, 2004, COUPLING APPROACHES; JALAM R, 2001, ACT C EXTR GEST CONN; JIN Y, 2004, TEXT MINING APPROACH; KRISTJANNSON T, 2004, 19 NAT C ART INT AAA; Lafferty J., 2001, P 18 INT C MACH LEAR, P282; LEVENSHT.VI, 1965, DOKL AKAD NAUK SSSR+, V163, P845; OMELAYENKO B, 2003, P INT WORKSH WEB DYN; PENG F, 2004, P HUM LANG TECHN C N; PORTER MF, 1980, PROGRAM-AUTOM LIBR, V14, P130, DOI 10.1108/eb046814; SARAWAGI S, 2004, P 18 ANN C NEUR INF; Sha F., 2003, P 2003 HUM LANG TECH; Soderland S., 1995, P 14 INT JOINT C ART, P1314; SPERBERGMCQUEEN C, 2002, BURNARD TEI, P4; Valarakos AG, 2004, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3257, P144; WALLACH H, 2002, EFFICIENT TRAINING C	21	1	1	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA		0-7695-2415-X				2005							790	793		10.1109/WI.2005.10		4	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems	Computer Science	BDM68	WOS:000234321300150

In this paper, we propose a novel method for early detection of AD using only electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings for patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) without any clinical symptoms of the disease who later developed AD. In our method, first a blind source separation algorithm is applied to extract the most significant spatiotemporal uncorrelated components; afterward these components are wavelet transformed; subsequently the wavelets or more generally time frequency representation (TFR) is approximated with sparse bump modeling approach. Finally, reliable and discriminant features are selected and reduced with orthogonal forward regression and the random probe methods. The proposed features were finally fed to a simple neural network classifier. The presented method leads to a substantially improved performance (93% correctly classified - improved sensitivity and specificity) over classification results previously published on the same set of data.

This provides a good tradeoff between ability to generalize well in areas of sparse training vectors and ability to fit fine detail of the decision surface in areas where the training vector density is sufficient to provide this information. Our algorithm is a sequential machine learning method in that progressively finer kernel functions are incorporated in successive stages of the learning process. Its key advantage is the ability to find the appropriate kernel scale for every local region of the input space.

The main drawback of using minimization of output error entropy for adaptive system training is the computational load when fixed-size kernel estimates are employed. Entropy estimators based on sample spacing, on the other hand, have lower computational cost, however they are not differentiable, which makes them unsuitable for adaptive learning. In this paper, a nonparametric entropy estimator that blends the desirable properties of both techniques in a variable-size finite-support kernel estimation methodology. This yields an estimator suitable for adaptation, yet has computational complexity similar to sample spacing techniques. The estimator is illustrated in supervised adaptive system training using the minimum error entropy criterion.

The current state-of-the-art in clustering is widely accepted to be the so-called spectral clustering. Spectral clustering, based on pairwise affinities of samples imposes very large computational requirements. In this paper, we propose a vector quantization preprocessing stage for spectral clustering similar to the classical mean-shift principle for clustering. This preprocessing reduces the dimensionality of the matrix on which spectral techniques will be applied, resulting in significant computational savings.

It has been recognized that genes (even though they may belong to the same gene group) may be co-expressed via a diversity of coherence models. One convincing argument is that a gene may participate in multiple pathways that may or may not be co-active under all conditions. It is biologically more meaningful to cluster both genes and conditions in gene expression data - leading to the so-called biclustering analysis. In addition, we have developed a set of systematic preprocessing methods to effectively comply with various coherence models. This paper will show that the proposed framework enjoys a vital advantage of case of visualization and analysis. Because a gene may follow more than one coherence models, a multivariate biclustering analysis based on fusion of scores derived from different preprocessing methods appears to be very promising. This is evidenced by our simulation study. In summary, this paper shows that machine learning techniques offers a viable approach to identifying and classifying biologically relevant groups in genes and conditions.

MEBML substitutes similartaxis and dissimilation for crossover and mutation operators used in GA. It possesses rapider convergence and higher calculation accuracy. In this paper, MEBML was used as an approach for dynamic quality control of coal jigging in a coal-preparing plant. The dynamic quality control system based on MEBML for jigger can control the ashes of three products and their product ratios, the system can raise the fine coal quality effectively. The system can also realize expert control and neuro-PID control for feeding, discharging, winding, watering loop control. Results presented in the paper clearly demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme.

In this paper, we propose the use of a recently developed machine learning technique - relevance vector machine (RVM) - for automatic detection of MCs in digitized mammograms. RVM is based on Bayesian estimation theory, and as a feature it can yield a decision function that depends on only a very small number of so-called relevance vectors. The proposed method is tested using a database of 141 clinical mammograms, and compared with a support vector machine (SVM) classifler which we developed previously. It is demonstrated that the RVM classifier achieves essentially the same detection performance as the SVM classifier, but does so with a much sparser kernel representation. Consequently, the RVM classifier greatly reduces the computational complexity, making it more suitable for real-time implementation.

Blotches can be modeled as temporal intensity discontinuities, hence false detection results originate from object motion (e.g. occlusion), non-rigid objects or erroneous motion estimation. In practice, usually, after the automatic detection step the false alarms are removed manually by an operator, significantly decreasing the efficiency of the restoration process. Our post-processing method classifies each detected blotch by its image features to minimize false results and the necessity of human intervention. The proposed method is tested on real archive sequences.

It is more and more important to some practical applications in large state space control problems because of needing the agent to fit more complex environment, specially, in the area of studying for machine learning. We always regard the Markov Decision Processes (MDP) as the environment model of reinforcement learning agent. Bellman optimal control equation is the base to solving this problem in simulating experiments and practical applications. This paper introduces a kind of more complex and practical environment that refers to multi-time scale MDP with the risk-sensitive. We first propose the concept of multi-time scale risk-sensitive Markov Decision Processes. This is a new problem, and the model satisfies the basic Bellman optimal control equation or not which is the key to solving the problem. Our goal is how to establish this optimal equation and then we prove this environment model to satisfy this equation.

B	Hewett, R			IEEE	Hewett, R			Learning from software reuse experience	2005 International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering (ISESE), Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering	NOV 17-18, 2005	Noosa Heads, AUSTRALIA	IEEE Comp Soc, ACM SIGSOFT			SUCCESS	What makes certain software reuse practices successful is not currently well understood. This is partly because experience with reuse is scarce. Furthermore, data on reuse experience often includes many qualitative factors. These factors limit the applicability of statistical analysis. This paper presents an empirical study that investigates and evaluates an approach to extracting information from past software reuse experience. Specifically, a machine learning system, SORCER is introduced and applied to survey data on 24 software reuse projects. The data has 29 attributes, and was obtained from 19 companies over a three-year period. Results show that, as expected, some management actions are crucial for success of a project. Interestingly, most factors influencing the implementation of reuse programs and company profiles relevant to reuse projects have little impact on project success. Instead, some of the reuse program implementation factors (e.g., reuse approach, independence of the reuse development and presence of domain analysis) appear to have impact on project failure.

This algorithm has three steps: first, a machine learning algorithm Support Vector Machines (SVM), is trained with spectral observations to initialize the classification and estimate pixel-by-pixel class conditional probabilities for each individual image; second, Markov Random Fields (MRF) are used to model the spatial-temporal contextual prior probabilities of images; and finally, an iterative algorithm is used to update the classification based on the combination of the spectral class conditional probability and the spatial-temporal contextual prior probability. Increased accuracies from the contributions of spatial-temporal contextual evidence confirmed the importance of spatial-temporal modeling in multi-temporal remote sensing.

To make the speed of large image compression faster in condition of not increasing the cost of computational resource and time, evaluating mechanism in the field of machine learning was used to help Genetic Programming, and the scalability issue was mapped to the task of making the approach accuracy best from lower speed sampling to higher speed sampling in the field of signal processing. In experiments for compressing large images, the cost of computational time was reduced evidently and efficiently.

This approach consists in splitting the task in two layers. The first layer receives the sequence of input data and stores statistics of this data, using a higher number of intervals than what is usually required. The final discretization is generated by the second layer, based on the statistics stored by the previous layer. The proposed architecture processes streaming examples in a single scan, in constant time and space even for infinite sequences of examples. We demonstrate with examples that incremental discretization achieves better results than batch discretization, maintaining the performance of learning algorithms. The proposed method is much more appropriate to evaluate incremental algorithms, and in problems where data flows continuously as most of recent data mining applications.

POIsmarts can be considered as the convergence between virtual points of interest (web bookmarks) and physical points of interest (gps bookmarks). We provide a XML schema defining the structure and properties of POIsmarts and we show how these objects can be stored, shared, searched and accessed in a uniform way independently from the user device. Tire paper also reports preliminary results on performing automatic categorization and search (in personal or shared POIsmart hierarchies) using machine learning techniques.

It is proved that this kernel is an admissible support vector kernel. The main advantage of the auto-correlation of a compactly supported wavelet is that it satisfies the translation invariant property, which is very important for signal processing. Also, we can choose a better wavelet from different choices of wavelet families for our auto- correlation wavelet kernel. Experiments on signal regression show that this method is better than the existing SVM function regression with the scalar wavelet kernel, the Gaussian kernel, and the exponential radial basis function kernel. It can be easily extended to other applications such as pattern recognition by using this newly developed auto- correlation wavelet SVM.

Past sensor network research has focused on security and communication, but largely ignored the overall dynamic resource management issue of such distributed systems. Our contribution is in integrated control optimization and resource management algorithms to ensure proper functioning of distributed sensors in extremely limited bandwidth, power, and storage. In this paper, we present a novel genetic algorithm for real-time system control and resource management that handles multiple conflicting objectives and constraints in the distributed system. Our framework is suitable for dynamic environments where the desired system performance and resource usage changes dynamically while being constrained by limited amount of resources.

Modelling-based approaches have proved very successful for provisioning the web and application server tiers in dynamic content servers. On the other hand, accurately modelling the behavior of the back-end database server tier is a daunting task. Hence, automated provisioning of database replicas has received comparatively less attention. This paper introduces a novel pro-active scheme based on the classic K-nearest-neighbors (KNN) machine learning approach for adding database replicas to application allocations in dynamic content web server clusters. Our KNN algorithm uses lightweight monitoring of essential system and application metrics in order to decide how many databases it should allocate to a given workload. Our pro-active algorithm also incorporates awareness of system stabilization periods after adaptation in order to improve prediction accuracy and avoid system oscillations. We compare this pro-active self-configuring scheme for scaling the database tier with a reactive scheme. Our experiments using the industry-standard TPC-W e-commerce benchmark demonstrate that the pro-active scheme is effective in reducing both the frequency and peak level of SLA violations compared to the reactive scheme. Furthermore, by augmenting the pro-active approach with awareness and tracking of system stabilization periods induced by adaptation in our replicated system, we effectively avoid oscillations in resource allocation.

In this paper, we apply machine learning to automatically fingerprint polymorphic worms, which are able to change their appearance across every instance. Using real Internet traces and synthetic polymorphic worms, we evaluated the performance of several advanced machine learning algorithms, including naive Bayes, decision-tree induction, rule learning (RIPPER), and support vector machines. The results are very promising. Compared with Polygraph, the state of the art in polymorphic worm fingerprinting, several machine learning algorithms are able to generate more accurate signatures, tolerate more noise in the training data, and require much shorter training time. These results open the possibility of applying machine learning to build a fast and accurate online worm fingerprinting system.

This is done through simulation program having capabilities of natural language understanding, automated reasoning, machine lemming and knowledge representation. It is a vast field consisting of various techniques. Which, among these techniques, is applicable depends on the nature of the problem and requires domain specific knowledge about that problem. The idea here is to apply this concept in Music Therapy for the treatment of patients having any kind of disease except surgical category. More explicitly, the objective is to create intelligence incorporated simulation software that can diagnose the disease of the patient through direct interaction and prescribe various music modules as medicine.

Our reductions imply that for these problems, given an optimal (or beta-approximation) algorithm for the standard algorithmic problem, we can convert it into a (1+is an element of)-approximation (or beta(1+1/4)-approximation)for the incentive-compatible mechanism design problem, so long as the number of bidders is sufficiently large as a function of an appropriate measure of complexity of the comparison class of solutions. We apply these results to the problem of auctioning a digital good, the attribute auction problem, and to the problem of item-pricing in unlimited-supply combinatorial auctions. From a learning perspective, these settings present several challenges: in particular, the loss function is discontinuous and asymmetric, and the range of bidders' valuations may be large.

Adaptive Educational Systems can support different learning characteristics by building a model of the student's learning behaviour and subsequently adapting the learning environment to match different needs. However major challenges exist, as it is not clear how a student model of learning style can be accurately built. One solution may be in the use of machine learning techniques. This paper presents 'First Aid For you, a novel adaptive educational system that dynamically determines learning style using machine learning techniques. The paper describes how it uses the Felder & Solomon Index of Learning Style to design an environment for different learning styles. It also describes how, as the student interacts with the learning environment, it uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to predict the student's preferred learning style and adoptively customize the learning environment.

The learning model of MALESAbrain is built on the notions of threshold and knowledge-weight from the discipline of machine learning. MALESAbrain encourages learners to judge or critically evaluate the solutions posted by others before exploring further knowledge-content. The intelligent MALESAbrain then sums up the judgment scores as its knowledge-weight to pass the thresholds set up for ranking/arranging the learning issues. This constraint design for judgment, therefore, becomes a mechanism for critical thinking in a problem-based learning activity. The intelligent system transforms the forum and chat room into rich learning environments. MALESAbrain advances online discussion services more efficient and effective in PBL.

Not only does it aids the student's learning process but also prevents problems, such as student frustration and floundering. Students' key demographic characteristics and their marks in a small number of written assignments can constitute the training set for a regression method in order to predict the student's performance. The scope of this work compares some of the state of the art regression algorithms in the application domain of predicting students' marks. A number of experiments have been conducted with six algorithms, which were trained using datasets provided by the Hellenic Open University. Finally, a prototype version of software support tool for tutors has been constructed implementing the M5rules algorithm, which proved to be the most appropriate among the tested algorithms.

We show a behavior based alarm reduction by using a memory-based machine learning technique - instance based learner. Our extended form of IBL (XIBL) examines SNORT alarm signals if that signal is worthy sending signals to security manager. A preliminary experiment shows that these exists an apparent difference between true alarms and false alarms with respect to XIBL behavior and the full experiment successfully exhibits the power of hybrid system is there is a rich set of analyzed data such as DARPA 1998 data set we used.

The use and management of these databases therefore sometimes requires their integration into a single database. The main issue in this integration process is the ability to analyse and understand the differences among the multiple representations. These differences can of course be explained by the various specifications but can also be due to updates or errors during data capture. In this paper, we propose an new approach to interpret the differences in representation in a semiautomatic way. We consider the specifications of each database as the "knowledge" to evaluate the conformity of each representation. This information is grasped from existing documents but also from data, by means of machine learning tools. The management of this knowledge is enabled by a rule-based system. Application of this approach is illustrated with a case study from two IGN databases. It concerns the differences between the representations of traffic circles.

The task includes partitioning the text on a web page into information blocks and identifying their semantic categories. We employed two machine learning techniques, Adaboost and SVMs, to learn from a labeled web page corpus. We evaluated our approach on general web pages from the World Wide Web and obtained encouraging results. This work can be beneficial to a number of web-driven applications such as search engines, web-based question answering, web-based data mining as well as voice enabled web navigation.

J	Kauko, T				Kauko, T			Using the self-organising map to identify regularities across country-specific housing-market contexts	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING & DESIGN			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK; REGIONS; PRICES; AREAS	The aim of exploring and monitoring housing-market fundamentals (prices, dwelling features, area density, residents, and so on) on a macrolocational level relates to both public and private sector policyrnaking. Housing market segmentation (that is, the emergence of housing submarkets), a concept with increasing relevance, is defined as the differentiation of housing in terms of the income and preferences of the residents and in terms of administrative circumstances. In order to capture such segmentation empirically, the author applies a fairly new and emerging technique known as the 'self-organising' map (SOM), or 'Kohonen map' : The SOM is a type of (artificial) neural network-a nonlinear and flexible (that is, nonparametric or semiparametric) regression and 'machine learning' technique. By utilising the ability of the SOM to visualise patterns, one can analyse various dimensions within the variation of the dataset. Segmentation may then be detected depending on the resulting patterns across the map layers, each of which represents the data variation for one input variable. Utilising an inductive modelling strategy, the author runs cross-sectional and nationwide data on the owner-occupied housing markets of Finland (documentation presented elsewhere), the Netherlands, and Hungary with the SOM technique. On the basis of the resulting configurations certain regularities (similarities and differences) across the three national contexts are identified. In all three cases the segments are determined by physical and institutional differences between the housing bundles and localities. The exercise demonstrates how the inductive SOM-based approach is well-suited for illustrating the contextual factors that determine housing market structure.

But most of researches are focused on improving the performance of classifier. Selecting important features from input data lead to a simplification of the problem, faster and more accurate detection rates. Thus selecting important features is an important issue in intrusion detection. Another issue in intrusion detection is that most of the intrusion detection systems are performed by off-line and it is not proper method for realtime intrusion detection system. In this paper, we develop the realtime intrusion detection system which combining on-line feature extraction method with Least Squares Support Vector Machine classifier. Applying proposed system to KDD CUP 99 data, experimental results show that it have remarkable performance compared to off-line intrusion detection system.

Traditional methods of visitor classification involve tracking individual users over many sessions via a unique identifier such as the IP address or a cookie. These methods are either too general or strip the visitor of a level of privacy. In this paper we use machine learning techniques to classify visitors of a data-centric website using a minimal amount of information and without a unique identifier. We are able to group visitors into groups without extended user tracking.

Machine learning techniques have played a significant role by handling the inherent complexity of such systems. Robotic Soccer is a typical multi-agent system, wherein the challenge is to develop and hone the skills of the agents that take part in the game. For an in depth and sophisticated understanding of the game, soccer playing agents must possess the capability to learn and acquire low-level skills. These skills can later be put together and used to emulate the expertise of experienced players. This paper describes the use of reinforcement learning, a machine learning technique, to acquire the base level skills of intercepting a moving ball. Results of simulation runs using the Robocup Soccer server have also been presented.

Two popular approaches have come to dominate. Content-based techniques leverage the availability of rich item descriptions to identify new items that are similar to those that a user has liked in the past. In contrast, collaborative filtering techniques rely on the availability of user profiles in which sets of items have been rated. They recommend new items to a target user on the basis that similar users have preferred these items in the past. In this paper we will present two case-studies of how association rule mining techniques have been used to significantly enhance the power of content-based and collaborative filtering recommender systems.

With the standard rough set method, the cause of formation of multi-faults cannot be induced. In order to obtain this kind of knowledge, the standard rough set based methods should be rebuilt. In this paper, we propose a new rough set based algorithm for generating this kind of knowledge. Other machine learning theories such as SVM, ANN and Bayesian networks cannot be used in this case.

The context for this study is to examine patterns of urbanization in Mahoning County, OH in relation to several independent driving variables of urban development. These independent variables were constructed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and were compared to the dependent variable of the spatial locations of urban areas in Mahoning County. The classification techniques were used in conjunction with the GIS-created variables to predict the location of urban areas within Mahoning County. A comparison of the accuracy of the techniques is presented and conclusions drawn concerning which of the variables are the most influential on urban patterns in the region. Lastly, a spatial analysis of the prediction error is performed for each method.

Such expert-generated rules are then evaluated and refined in clinical tests. Once verified, these knowledge-driven rules are used to expedite diagnosis and treatment for the serious cases and to limit unnecessary tests for low-probability cases. Alternatively, machine learning techniques can be used for automated induction of comprehensible data-driven rules from vast amount of existing clinical data. This paper investigates how the rules generated by the clinical experts compare with the data-driven rules. The paper describes three outcomes: rule confirmation, contradiction, and expansion. The study concentrates on prediction rules for the diagnosis of obstructive steep apnea using three clinical data sets with 1,318 records. The prototype system, Hypnos, includes both a framework for rule definition, and also a mechanism for rule induction.								Douglas N.

For many applications it is very essential that decisions made by machine learning algorithms were as accurate as it is possible. The proposed approach consists in applying a monitoring mechanism only to results of classification, what not cause an additional computational overhead. The empirical evaluation of monitoring method is presented based on data extracted from simulated robotic soccer as an example of autonomous agent domain and synthetic data that stands for standard industrial application.

To get their performance evaluation, we often use simulation method or to build an analytical model which can approximate the performance result. These two method all have their own shortcomings. For example, simulation method is resource intensive and it may take a long time to get a result. And the analytical methods need much expertise and their results usually have perceptible error. In this paper, we try to study the complex queuing networks by CART which is a machine learning tool. After being trained by the performance data gotten from simulation method, the fitted binary tree can be used to predict the performance of the queuing model when inputted by workload parameters. We do some experiments on M/M/1 model and the fork-join structure. The results show that this method can have little average relative error while dealing with them. Using this method needs not much expertise and can predict the queuing network's performance very quickly. It may be a promising method to study the difficult queuing networks.

J	Gangal, R; Sharma, P				Gangal, R; Sharma, P			Human pol II promoter prediction: time series descriptors and machine learning (vol 33, pg 1332, 2005)	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Correction							SEQUENCES; RECOGNITION; GENOMES; ENTROPY	Although several in silico promoter prediction methods have been developed to date, they are still limited in predictive performance. The limitations are due to the challenge of selecting appropriate features of promoters that distinguish them from non-promoters and the generalization or predictive ability of the machine learning algorithms. In this paper we attempt to define a novel approach by using unique descriptors and machine-learning methods for the recognition of eukaryotic polymerase II promoters. In this study, non-linear time series descriptors along with nonlinear machine-learning algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM), are used to discriminate between promoter and non-promoter regions. The basic idea here is to use descriptors that do not depend on the primary DNA sequence and provide a clear distinction between promoter and non-promoter regions. The classification model built on a set of 1000 promoter and 1500 non-promoter sequences, showed a 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 87% and an independent test set had an accuracy > 85% in both promoter and non-promoter identification. This approach correctly identified all 20 experimentally verified promoters of human chromosome 22. The high sensitivity and selectivity indicates that n-mer frequencies along with non-linear time series descriptors, such as Lyapunov component stability and Tsallis entropy, and supervised machine-learning methods, such as SVMs, can be useful in the identification of pol II promoters.

Given a data point, the SVM can classify the data point to either positive class or negative class. However, in some cases, some data points belong to neither positive class nor negative class. They should be treated as one new class. So this paper proposes one method that can rind isolated data points and separate them into new classes based on F-test and the experimental results show that the method is effective.

This dependence would result in more time for training, more support vectors and more decision time. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a new v-SVM. This new v-SVM multiplies each slack variable in the objective function by a weight factor, and automatically computes each weight factor by the number of corresponding samples with same value before training. Theoretical analysis and the results of experiments show that the new v-SVM has the same classification precision rate as the standard v-SVM and the new v-SVM is faster than the v-SVM in training and decision if the training sets have same value samples.

In this work, a machine learning approach is proposed to overcome this problem. In the machine learning approach, the gene data set is clustered by a self-organizing map (SOM). Then a phylogenetically informative core gene set is created by combining the maximum entropy gene from each cluster to conduct phylogenetic analysis. Using the same data set, this approach performs better than the previous random gene concatenation method. The SOM based information visualization is also employed to compare the species patterns in the phylogenetic tree constructions.

A key requirement is the acquisition of metadata about the objects to enable future access and usage, as well as the migration of digital files from obsolete formats to newer ones. "Metadata", is data about data. It typically consists of information about the intellectual content of a digital object, the data required for appropriate digital representation and interpretation, security or rights management information, and their relation to other digital objects. The manual recording of these metadata elements is highly labor-intensive and automated means for doing this are key to successful preservation.

Recent studies have shown that SVM method performed better than traditional statistical techniques in the classification problems. This paper tried to construct a corporate evaluation model based on SVM methods in attempt to provide a better model for financial performance prediction. In this paper, we used five categories of financial ratios as predictor attributes. The difference between return on asset and price is used as the to-be-predicted variables. Financial ratios Of 200 companies are extracted and calculated from the Database of Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation. Experimental results showed that the SVM-based evaluating model had better prediction accuracy. Based on the prediction model, the investors can make a right investment decision.

Hierarchical classification is performed top-down and in each node a flat classifier decides if a document should be further propagated or not. As flat classifiers BoosTexter, CentroidBooster and Support Vector Machines are used, were CentroidBooster is an AdaBoost.MH based alternative similar to BoosTexter. Experiments on the Reuters Corpus Volume 1 and the OHSUMED data set show that the F-1-measure increases if the hierarchal structure of a data set is taken into account. Regarding time complexity we show, that depending on the structure of a hierarchy, learning and classification time can be reduced. Besides these hard classification approaches we also investigate the ranking performance of hierarchical classifiers. Ranking, which can be achieved by providing a meaningful score for each classification decision, is important in most practical settings. We investigate an approach based on using a sigmoid function for calculating a meaningful score, where parameter estimation is based on error bounds from computational learning theory.

Interpretation of the word to be considered as a noun or a verb depends on the presence of contextual cues. To interpret words we need to be able to discriminate between different usages. This paper proposes a hybrid of based-rules and a machine learning method for tagging Arabic words. The particularity of Arabic word that may be composed of stem, plus affixes and clitics, a small number of rules dominate the performance (affixes include inflexional markers for tense, gender and number/ clitics include some prepositions, conjunctions and others). Tagging is closely related to the notion of word class used in syntax. This method is based firstly on rules (that considered the post-position, ending of a word, and patterns), and then the anomaly are corrected by adopting a memory-based learning method (MBL). The memory based learning is an efficient method to integrate various sources of information, and handling exceptional data in natural language processing tasks. Secondly checking the exceptional cases of rules and more information is made available to the learner for treating those exceptional cases. To evaluate the proposed method a number of experiments has been run, and in order, to improve the importance of the various information in learning.

Autonomic systems adapt both to their environment and to the demands placed upon them as a consequence of the use of the system(s) within their purview. Data and voice networks function in a changing environment with varying use cases; hence, autonomic systems must be deployed with both a significant a priori knowledge base and the capability to continuously upgrade that knowledge base. The system must engage in some amount of unsupervised learning and hypothesize as to nature of its functioning. Maintenance of hypotheses and theories is intrinsic to the system, especially in evolutionary scenarios. This paper explores how knowledge maintenance is done for voice and data communications networks applications that use autonomic system approaches.

However improving performance of the classifier is still attractive. Combining multiple classifiers is an effective technique for improving accuracy. There are many general combining algorithms, such as Bagging, Boosting, or Error Correcting Output Coding that significantly improve the classifier such as decision trees, rule learners, or neural networks. Unfortunately, these combining methods developed do not improve the nearest neighbor classifiers. In this paper first, we present a new approach to combine multiple KNN classifiers based on different distance functions, in which we apply multiple distance functions to improve the performance of the k-nearest neighbor classifier Second, we develop a combining method, in which the weights of the distance function, are learnt by genetic algorithm. Finally, combining classifiers in error correcting output coding, are discussed The proposed algorithms seek to increase generalization accuracy when compared to the basic k-nearest neighbor algorithm. Experiments have been conducted on some benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The results show that the proposed algorithms improve the performance of the k-nearest neighbor classification.

However, many discretization algorithms developed in this field focus on univariate only, which is inadequate to handle the critical problems especially owned by medical domain. In this paper we propose a new multivariate discretization method called Mullivariate Interdependent Discretization for Continuous Attributes - MIDCA. Our novel algorithm can minimize the uncertainty between the interdependent attribute and the continuous-valued attribute, and at the same time to maximize their correlation. The empirical results demonstrate a comparison of performance of various decision tree algorithms on twelve real-life dalasets from UCI repository.								Bay S. D., 2000, Proceedings. KDD-2000.

If a question is posed, 'How does one tell a successful swimmer apart from other athletes'. The answer would usually be formulated in the following manner: 'A swimmer is of a lean body type, with broad shoulders, narrow waist, long arms, well defined abdominal muscles, wild hair and is a bit extraordinary in nature'. The research focuses strictly on sprint freestyle swimmers on the NCAA II, III, and NAIA division levels. There are many variables that can be collected about a particular swimmer. In this paper, the implementation of a feature selection method using a genetic algorithm to improve classifier prediction for sprint freestyle swimmers is presented.

Unfortunately, to perform this search the change of the peptide must be known, and current charge state-determination algorithms only discriminate singly from multiply-charged spectra: distinguishing +2 from +3, for example, is unreliable. Thus, search software is forced to search multiply-charged spectra multiple times. To minimize this inefficiency, we present a support vector machine (SVM) that quickly and reliably classifies multiply charged spectra as having either a +2 or +3 precursor peptide ion. By classifying a multiply-charged spectra, we obtain a 40% reduction in search time while maintaining an average of 99% of peptide and 99% of protein identifications originally-obtained from these spectra.

The RVM represents, a Bayesian extension of the widely applied Support Vector, Machine (SVM), one of the leading approaches to pattern. recognition and machine learning. Both the SVM and the RVM. use a linear combination of kernel functions centered on a subset of the training data to make regressions or classifications. In the SVM, the number of vectors in the subset grows linearly with the size of the available training data, while in the RVM, only the most relevant vectors will be captured. So the RVM yields a much sparser approximation of the Bayesian kernel than the SVM. Our preliminary experimental results show that the RVM overall outperforms the SVM on speaker recognition while being, advantageous over the latter for its exceptionally sparse nature, classification accuracy, and Bayesian probabilistic framework, Comparisons are also made for the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), a widely used non-discriminative approach to speaker recognition.

Machine learning of of grammars finds a variety of applications in syntactic pattern recognition and natural language acquisition. Grammatical Inference has become one of the key methods for organizing online information, since hard-coding the classification rules is costly or even unpractical. The paper presents a new approach to perforin grammatical inference using support vector machines (SVM). SVMs are a class of algorithms that combine the principles of statistical learning theory with the optimisation techniques and the idea of a kernel mapping. The paper considers replacing the inference algorithm with Support Vector Machines and the grammar is that of English Language. The accuracy is found to be 97.8 % which is much better than conventional machine learning-methods.

Unfortunately, the control systems of these machines share very little in terms of computer software, hardware, or system data. In this paper, the author takes the position that horizontal (inter-institution) integration of anthropoid control systems is essential to efficient production of future advanced robots. He reviews several existing designs, then discusses techniques for achieving systems convergence. He proposes the creation of a generally accepted, high quality, reusable anthropoid robot control platform, with organizational support to promulgate it.

J	Giles, CL; Councill, IG				Giles, CL; Councill, IG			Who gets acknowledged: Measuring scientific contributions through automatic acknowledgment indexing	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						acknowledgment analysis; information extraction; machine learning	INFORMATION; SCIENCE	Acknowledgments in research publications, like citations, indicate influential contributions to scientific work. However, acknowledgments are different from citations; whereas citations are formal expressions of debt, acknowledgments are arguably more personal, singular, or private expressions of appreciation and contribution. Furthermore, many sources of research funding expect researchers to acknowledge any support that contributed to the published work. Just as citation indexing proved to be an important tool for evaluating research contributions, we argue that acknowledgments can be considered as a metric parallel to citations in the academic audit process. We have developed automated methods for acknowledgment extraction and analysis and show that combining acknowledgment analysis with citation indexing yields a measurable impact of the efficacy of various individuals as well as government, corporate, and university sponsors of scientific work.

The proposed learning scheme uses only the sign of the gradient, and combines adaptive stepsize local searches with global search steps that make use of an annealing schedule inspired from nonextensive statistics, as proposed by Tsallis. The performance of the hybrid approach is empirically investigated through simulation in benchmark problems from the UCI Repository of Machine Learning Databases. Preliminary results provide evidence that the synergy of techniques from nonextensive statistics provide neural learning schemes with significant benefits in terms of learning speed and convergence success.

J	Albert, I; Albert, R				Albert, I; Albert, R			Conserved network motifs allow protein-protein interaction prediction	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							COMPLEX NETWORKS; YEAST; MAP	Motivation: High-throughput protein interaction detection methods are strongly affected by false positive and false negative results. Focused experiments are needed to complement the large-scale methods by validating previously detected interactions but it is often difficult to decide which proteins to probe as interaction partners. Developing reliable computational methods assisting this decision process is a pressing need in bioinformatics. Results: We show that we can use the conserved properties of the protein network to identify and validate interaction candidates. We apply a number of machine learning algorithms to the protein connectivity information and achieve a surprisingly good overall performance in predicting interacting proteins. Using a 'leave-one-out' approach we find average success rates between 20 and 40% for predicting the correct interaction partner of a protein. We demonstrate that the success of these methods is based on the presence of conserved interaction motifs within the network.

J	Piramuthu, S				Piramuthu, S			Feature construction for reduction of tabular knowledge-based systems	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						feature construction; tabular knowledge-based system; machine learning	DECISION TABLES; VERIFICATION; INFORMATION; VALIDATION; INDUCTION; TRANSFORMATION; ACQUISITION; EXTRACTION; DISCOVERY; CHOICE	Tabular knowledge-based systems are known to be extremely versatile for verification and validation of knowledge bases. However, a major disadvantage of these systems is the combinatorial explosion that accompanies addition of new attributes or condition entries in the table. One of the means of alleviating this problem in tabular knowledge-based systems is through modularization, which is the process of breaking a big comprehensive table into smaller tables that are easy to deal with. In this study, we propose and illustrate another means to deal with this problem through use of feature construction methodology. The proposed method can be used synergistically with modularization to alleviate problems associated with combinatorial explosion in tabular knowledge bases. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

J	Zhang, WR; Zhang, LL				Zhang, WR; Zhang, LL			A multiagent data warehousing (MADWH) and multiagent data mining (MADM) approach to brain modeling and neurofuzzy control	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						multiagent data warehousing and mining; agent similarity and orthogonality; neurofuzzy agents; mining agent association in first-order logic; brain modeling; robot control		Based oil the hypothesis that the brain is a society of semiautonomous neural agents and full autonomy is the result of coordination of semiautonomous functionalities, a multiagent data warehousing (MADWH) and multiagent data mining (MADM) approach is presented I-or brain modeling and illustrated with robot motion control. An algorithm named Neighbor-Miner is proposed for MADWH and MADM. The algorithm is defined in an evolving dynamic environment with semiautonomous neurofuzzy agents. Instead of mining frequent itemsets from customer transactions, the new algorithm discovers new neurofuzzy agents and mines agent associations ill first-order logic for coordination that was once considered impossible in traditional data mining. While the Apriori algorithm uses frequency as a priori threshold, Neighbor-Miner uses agent similarity as a priori knowledge. The concept of agent similarity leads to the notions of agent cuboid, orthogonal MADWH, and MADM. Based on agent similarities and action similarities, Neighbor-Miner is presented and illustrated with brain modeling for robot control. The novelty of a multiagent data warehouse lies in its ability to systematically combine neurofuzzy systems, multiagent systems, database systems, machine learning, data mining, information theory, neuroscience, decision, cognition, and control all together into a modern multidimensional information system architecture that is ideal for brain modeling of different animal species with manageable complexity. Although examples in robot control are used to illustrate the basic ideas, the new approach is generally suitable for data mining tasks where knowledge can be discovered collectively by a set of similar semiautonomous or autonomous agents from a geographically, geometrically, or timely distributed environment, especially in high-dimensional scientific and engineering data environments.

Similar to previous laboratory analytical methods including immunohistochemistry, PCR and in situ hybridization, this new technology may also find its niche in routine diagnostics. Outcome predictors discovered by these methods may be quite different from previous single-gene markers. These novel tests will probably combine the infornation embedded in the expression of multiple genes with mathematical prediction algorithms to formulate classification rules and predict outcome. The performance of machine learning-algorithm-based diagnostic tests may improve as they are trained on larger and larger sets of samples, and several generations of tests with improving accuracy may be introduced sequentially. Several gene-expression profiling -technology platforms are mature enough for clinical testing. The most important next step that is needed for further progress is the development and validation of multigene predictors in prospectively designed clinical trials to determine the true accuracy and clinical value of this new technology. This manuscript reviews methodological and statistical issues relevant to clinical trial design to discover and validate multigene predictors of response to therapy.

Objects were selected from the Northern Sky Variability Survey (NSVS) covering the entire sky above declination delta=-38degrees in a single unfiltered photometric band corresponding to a V-band magnitude range of similar to8-15.5 mag. After quality cuts, the number of measurements for a typical star is approximately 150, but it ranges up to similar to1000 for high-declination stars. We show that the use of support vector machines, a modern machine-learning algorithm, can reliably distinguish Mira variables from other types of red variables, namely, semiregular and irregular. We also identify a region of parameter space that is dominated by carbon stars. Our classification is based on period, amplitude, and three independent colors possible with photometry from the NSVS and the Two Micron All Sky Survey. The overall classification accuracy is similar to90% despite the relatively short survey baseline of 1 yr and limited set of features. There are 6474 stars in our sample without identifications in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars, which, as such, are most likely new discoveries.

ClassX is based on a machine-learning technology. It represents a system of classifiers, each classifier consisting of a considerable number of oblique decision trees. These trees are built as the classifier is "trained'' to recognize various classes of objects using a training sample of sources of known object types. Each source is characterized by a preselected set of parameters, or attributes; the same set is then used as the classifier conducts classification of sources of unknown identity. The ClassX pipeline features an automatic search for X-ray source counterparts among heterogeneous data sets in online data archives using Virtual Observatory protocols; it retrieves from those archives all the attributes required by the selected classifier and inputs them to the classifier. The user input to ClassX is typically a file with target coordinates, optionally complemented with target IDs. The output contains the class name, attributes, and class probabilities for all classified targets. We discuss ways to characterize and assess the classifier quality and performance, and we present the respective validation procedures. On the basis of both internal validation and external verification, we conclude that the ClassX classifiers yield reasonable and reliable classifications for ROSAT sources and have the potential to broaden class representation significantly for rare object types.

J	Smith, L; Wilbur, WJ				Smith, L; Wilbur, WJ			Retrieving definitional content for ontology development	COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						ontology development; definitional content; expert writing		Ontology construction requires an understanding of the meaning and usage of its encoded concepts. While definitions found in dictionaries or glossaries may be adequate for many concepts, the actual usage in expert writing could be a better source of information for many others. The goal of this paper is to describe an automated procedure for finding definitional content in expert writing. The approach uses machine learning on phrasal features to learn when sentences in a book contain definitional content, as determined by their similarity to glossary definitions provided in the same book. The end result is not a concise definition of a given concept, but for each sentence, a predicted probability that it contains information relevant to a definition. The approach is evaluated automatically for terms with explicit definitions, and manually for terms with no available definition. (C) 2004, Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the increasing volumes of data generated by molecular profiling experiments pose formidable challenges to investigate an overwhelming mass of information and turn it into predictive, deployable markers. Advanced biostatistics and machine learning methods from computer science have been applied to analyze and correlate numerical values of profiling intensities to physiological states. This article reviews the application of artificial neural networks, an information-processing tool, to the identification of sets of diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers from high-throughput profiling data.

J	Beal, CR				Beal, CR			Adaptive user displays for intelligent tutoring software	CYBERPSYCHOLOGY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article								Intelligent tutoring software (ITS) holds great promise for K-12 instruction. Yet it is difficult to obtain rich information about users that can be used in realistic educational delivery settings-public school classrooms-in which eye tracking and other user sensing technologies are not suitable. We are pursuing three "cheap and cheerful" strategies to meet this challenge in the context of an ITS for high school math instruction. First, we use detailed representations of student cognitive skills, including tasks to assess individual users' proficiency with abstract reasoning, proficiency with simple math facts and computational skill, and spatial ability Second, we are using data mining and machine learning algorithms to identify instructional sequences that have been effective with previous students, and to use these patterns to make decisions about current students. Third, we are integrating a simple focus-of-attention tracking system into the software, using inexpensive, web cameras. This coarse-grained information can be used to time the display of multimedia hints, explanations, and examples when the user is actually looking at the screen, and to diagnose causes of problem-solving errors. The ultimate goal is to create non-intrusive software that can adapt the display of instructional information in real time to the user's cognitive strengths, motivation, and attention.

Molecular haplotyping methods are labor-intensive, low-throughput, and very costly. Therefore, algorithms based on formal statistical theories were shown to be very effective and cost-efficient for haplotype reconstruction. This review covers 1) population-based haplotype inference methods: Clark's algorithm, expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, coalescence-based algorithms (pseudo-Gibbs sampler and perfect/imperfect phylogeny), and partition-ligation algorithm implemented by a fully Bayesian model (Haplotyper) or by EM (PLEM); 2) family-based haplotype inference methods; 3) the handling of genotype scoring uncertainties (i.e., genotyping errors and raw two-dimensional genotype scatterplots) in inferring haplotypes; and 4) haplotype inference methods for pooled DNA samples. The advantages and limitations of each algorithm are discussed. By using simulations based on empirical data on the G6PD gene and TNFRSF5 gene, I demonstrate that different algorithms have different degrees of sensitivity to various extents of population diversities and genotyping error rates. Future development of statistical algorithms for addressing haplotype reconstruction will resort more and more to ideas based on combinatorial mathematics, graphical models, and machine learning, and they will have profound impacts on population genetics and genetic epidemiology with the advent of the human HapMap.

J	Prati, RC; Monard, MC; de Carvalho, ACPLF				Prati, RC; Monard, MC; de Carvalho, ACPLF			Looking for exceptions on knowledge rules induced from HIV cleavage data set	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology	MAY 14-16, 2003	Ribeirao Preto, BRAZIL			data mining; exceptions; HIV; protease	PROTEASE; SITES	The aim of data mining is to find useful knowledge out of databases. In order to extract such knowledge, several methods can be used, among them machine learning (ML) algorithms. In this work we focus on ML algorithms that express the extracted knowledge in a symbolic form, such as rules. This representation may allow us to "explain" the data. Rule learning algorithms are mainly designed to induce classification rules that can predict new cases with high accuracy. However, these sorts of rules generally express common sense knowledge, resulting in many interesting and useful rules not being discovered. Furthermore, the domain independent biases, especially those related to the language used to express the induced knowledge, could induce rules that are difficult to understand. Exceptions might be used in order to overcome these drawbacks. Exceptions are defined as rules that contradict common beliefs. This kind of rule can play an important role in the process of understanding the underlying data as well as in making critical decisions. By contradicting the user's common beliefs, exceptions are bound to be interesting. This work proposes a method to find exceptions. In order to illustrate the potential of our approach, we apply the method in a real world data set to discover rules and exceptions in the HIV virus protein cleavage process. A good understanding of the process that generates this data plays an important role in the research of cleavage inhibitors. We believe that the proposed approach may help the domain expert to further understand this process.

Depending on the issue under investigation, this large amount of data makes analysis impractical. Thus, it is important to select subsets of relevant genes to work with. This paper investigates different metrics for gene selection. The metrics are evaluated based on their ability in selecting genes whose expression profile provides information to distinguish between tumor and normal tissues. This evaluation is made by constructing classifiers using the genes selected by each metric and then comparing the performance of these classifiers. The performance of the classifiers is evaluated using the error rate in the classification of new tissues. As the dataset has few tissue samples, the leave-one-out methodology was employed to guarantee more reliable results. The classifiers are generated using different machine learning algorithms. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and the C4.5 algorithm are employed. The experiments are conduced employing SAGE data obtained from the NCBI web site. There are few analysis involving SAGE data in the literature. It was found that the best metric for the data and algorithms employed is the metric logistic.

A number of works are currently concerned with analyzing these data. One of the analyses carried out is the identification of genes' structures on the sequences obtained. As such, one can search for particular signals associated with gene expression. Splice junctions represent a type of signal present on eukaryote genes. Many studies have applied Machine Learning techniques in the recognition of such regions. However, most of the genetic databases are characterized by the presence of noisy data, which can affect the performance of the learning techniques. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of five data pre-processing algorithms in the elimination of noisy instances from two splice junction recognition datasets. After the pre-processing phase, two learning techniques, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines, are employed in the recognition process.

J	Li, Q; Zheng, NN; Cheng, H				Li, Q; Zheng, NN; Cheng, H			Springrobot: A prototype autonomous vehicle and its algorithms for lane detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems	2004	Washington, DC	IEEE		autonomous vehicle; lane-boundary detection; machine learning; randomized Hough transform (HT)	HOUGH TRANSFORM	This paper presents the current status of the Springrobot autonomous vehicle project, whose main objective is to develop a safety-warning and driver-assistance system and an automatic pilot for rural and urban traffic environments. This system uses a high precise digital map and a combination of various sensors. The architecture and strategy for the system are briefly described and the details of lane-marking detection algorithms are presented. The R and G channels of the color image are used to form graylevel images. The size of the resulting gray image is reduced and the Sobel operator with a very low threshold is used to get a grayscale edge image. In the adaptive randomized Hough transform, pixels of the gray-edge image are sampled randomly according to their weights corresponding to their gradient magnitudes. The three-dimensional (3-D) parametric space of the curve is reduced to the two-dimensional (2-D) and the one-dimensional (1-D) space. The paired parameters in two dimensions are estimated by gradient directions and the last parameter in one dimension is used to verify the estimated parameters by histogram. The parameters are determined coarsely and quantization accuracy is increased relatively by a multiresolution strategy. Experimental results in different road scene and a comparison with other methods have proven the validity of the proposed method.

J	Jensen, R; Shen, Q				Jensen, R; Shen, Q			Semantics-preserving dimensionality reduction: Rough and fuzzy-rough-based approaches	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						dimensionality reduction; feature selection; feature transformation; rough selection; fuzzy-rough selection	SETS; CATEGORIZATION; ATTRIBUTES; MODEL	Semantics-preserving dimensionality reduction refers to the problem of selecting those input features that are most predictive of a given outcome; a problem encountered in many areas such as machine learning, pattern recognition, and signal processing. This has found successful application in tasks that involve data sets containing huge numbers of features ( in the order of tens of thousands), which would be impossible to process further. Recent examples include text processing and Web content classification. One of the many successful applications of rough set theory has been to this feature selection area. This paper reviews those techniques that preserve the underlying semantics of the data, using crisp and fuzzy rough set-based methodologies. Several approaches to feature selection based on rough set theory are experimentally compared. Additionally, a new area in feature selection, feature grouping, is highlighted and a rough set-based feature grouping technique is detailed.

J	Hu, HJ; Pan, Y; Harrison, R; Tai, PC				Hu, HJ; Pan, Y; Harrison, R; Tai, PC			Improved protein secondary structure prediction using support vector machine with a new encoding scheme and an advanced tertiary classifier	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NANOBIOSCIENCE			English	Article						binary classifier; BLOSUM62; encoding scheme; orthorgonal matrix; Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM); support vector machine (SVM); tertiary classifier	NEURAL-NETWORKS	Prediction of protein secondary structures is an important problem in bioinformatics and has many applications. The recent trend of secondary structure prediction studies is mostly based on the neural network or the support vector machine (SVM). The SVM method is a comparatively new learning system which has mostly been used in pattern recognition problems. In this study, SVM is used as a machine learning tool for the prediction of secondary structure and several encoding schemes, including orthogonal matrix, hydrophobicity matrix, BLOSUM62 substitution matrix, and combined matrix of these, are applied and optimized to improve the prediction accuracy. Also, the optimal window length for six SVM binary classifiers is established by testing different window sizes and our new encoding scheme is tested based on this optimal window size via sevenfold cross validation tests. The results show 2% increase in the accuracy of the binary classifiers when compared with the instances in which the classical orthogonal matrix is used. Finally, to combine the results of the six SVM binary classifiers, a new tertiary classifier which combines the results of one-versus-one binary classifiers is introduced and the performance is compared with those of existing tertiary classifiers. According to the results, the Q(3) prediction accuracy of new tertiary classifier reaches 78.8% and this is better than the best result reported in the literature.

KASER is a creative expert system. It is capable of deductive, inductive, and mixed derivations. Its qualitative creativity is realized by using a tree-search mechanism. The system achieves creative reasoning by using a declarative representation of knowledge consisting of object trees and inheritance. KASER computes with words and phrases. It possesses a capability for metaphor-based explanations. This capability is useful in explaining its creative suggestions and serves to augment the capabilities provided by the explanation subsystems of conventional expert systems. KASER also exhibits an accelerated capability to learn. However, this capability depends on the particulars of the selected application domain. For example, application domains such as the game of chess exhibit a high degree of geometric symmetry. Conversely, application domains such as the game of craps played with two dice exhibit no predictable pattern, unless the dice are loaded. More generally, we say that domains whose informative content can be compressed to a significant degree without loss (or with relatively little loss) are symmetric. Incompressible domains are said to be asymmetric or random. The measure of symmetry plus the measure of randomness must always sum to unity.

J	Jung, KY; Lee, JH				Jung, KY; Lee, JH			User preference mining through hybrid collaborative filtering and content-based filtering in recommendation system	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; collaborative filtering; content-based filtering; machine learning; retrieval information; hybrid filtering	WEB	The growth of the Internet has resulted in an increasing need for personalized information systems. The paper describes an autonomous agent, the Web Robot Agent or WebBot, which integrates with the web and acts as a personal recommendation system that cooperates with the user in order to identify interesting pages. The Apriori algorithm extracts the characteristics of the web pages in the form of association words that are semantically related and mines a bag of association words. Using hybrid components from collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, this hybrid recommendation system can overcome the shortcomings associated with traditional recommendation systems. In this paper, we present an improved recommendation system, which uses the user preference mining through hybrid 2-way filtering. The proposed method was tested on a database, and its effectiveness compared with existent methods was proven in on-line experiments.

Several bootstrapping methods such as co-training have been proposed as a solution. In this paper, we present a different approach using the Web resources. A Named Entity (NE) tagged corpus is generated from the Web using about 3,000 names as seeds. The generated corpus may have a lower quality than the manually tagged corpus but its size can be increased sufficiently. Several features are developed and the decision list is learned using the generated corpus. Our method is verified by comparing it to both the decision list learned on the manual corpus and the DL-CoTrain method. We also present a two-level classification by cascading highly precise lexical patterns and the decision list to improve the performance.

J	Qian, GL; Yeung, D; Tsang, ECC; Shu, WH				Qian, GL; Yeung, D; Tsang, ECC; Shu, WH			Feature selection for Chinese character recognition based on inductive learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						feature selection; inductive learning; Chinese character recognition; extension matrix; information entropy; cost of feature extraction		Feature selection is a difficult but important issue in the field of machine learning and pattern recognition. In this paper, features for Chinese character recognition are selected by using inductive learning algorithms. The existing inductive learning method based on extension matrix requires precise consistency between positive example and negative example sets, which is very difficult to maintain in most practical cases. The traditional decision tree algorithm ID3 considers only the performance of the discriminating power while selecting features. However, in actual practice the consideration of the associated cost of feature extraction may become a significant concern. In addressing these problems we propose a modified extension matrix approach to select feature subset from the training example set with noises. A decision tree algorithm based on information gain and cost evaluation is also proposed to facilitate cost consideration. The comparative experiments show that the proposed algorithms perform better than the existing inductive learning algorithms to a certain extent.

J	Mahdavi, A; Gurtekin, B				Mahdavi, A; Gurtekin, B			Generating the design-performance space via simulation and machine learning	JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL AND PLANNING RESEARCH			English	Article								It is generally believed that improvement of building design in view of its performance is more likely if the designer is provided with effective simulation tools and evaluation environments. This paper describes a specific computational framework for performance-guided design explorations. It relies on the concept of the "design-performance space," which denotes a virtual space defined by multiple design and performance dimensions. Each design dimension accommodates the range of possible values of a discrete design variable, and each performance dimension accommodates the range of the values of a specific performance indicator. Performance indicators represent the results of simulation-assisted behavioral analyses of designs (energy use, reverberation time in rooms, and illuminance levels on working planes). Design variables can capture various geometric (volume, shape, and compactness) and semantic (thermal transmittance of the building enclosure, thermal mass, and internal loads) features of design. This paper presents a method for the effective generation of the design-performance space, using both simulation and machine learning methods. This method relies on the observation that specialized neural network copies of detailed simulation programs may be derived that could yield dependable results for a typologically and contextually well-defined set of buildings. Such neural networks can facilitate the rapid generation of the design-performance space around an initial design. Once constructed, the design-performance space can be visualized and used by the designer to explore the relationship between a specific constellation of design variables and the resulting performance attributes. The paper concludes with a number of case studies that demonstrate the functionality of the system via illustrative design exploration trajectories in the design performance space.

J	Tsuruoka, Y; Tsujii, J				Tsuruoka, Y; Tsujii, J			Improving the performance of dictionary-based approaches in protein name recognition	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						protein name recognition; naive Bayes classifier; approximate string search; spelling variant generator	GENE	Dictionary-based protein name recognition is often a first step in extracting information from biomedical documents because it can provide ID information on recognized terms. However, dictionary-based approaches present two fundamental difficulties: (1) false recognition mainly caused by short names; (2) low recall due to spelling variations. In this paper, we tackle the former problem using machine learning to filter out false positives and present two alternative methods for alleviating the latter problem of spelling variations. The first is achieved by using approximate string searching, and the second by expanding the dictionary with a probabilistic variant generator, which we propose in this paper. Experimental results using the GENIA corpus revealed that filtering using a naive Bayes classifier greatly improved precision with only a slight loss of recall, resulting in 10.8% improvement in F-measure, and dictionary expansion with the variant generator gave further 1.6% improvement and achieved an F-measure of 66.6%.

J	Spasic, I; Ananiadou, S				Spasic, I; Ananiadou, S			Using automatically learnt verb selectional preferences for classification of biomedical terms	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						term recognition; term classification; ontologies; machine learning; genetic algorithms; similarity measures; corpus processing	INFORMATION-EXTRACTION; MOLECULAR-BIOLOGY; ONTOLOGY	In this paper, we present an approach to term classification based on verb selectional patterns (VSPs), where such a pattern is defined as a set of semantic classes that could be used in combination with a given domain-specific verb. VSPs have been automatically learnt based on the information found in a corpus and an ontology in the biomedical domain. Prior to the learning phase, the corpus is terminologically processed: term recognition is performed by both looking up the dictionary of terms listed in the ontology and applying the C/NC-value method for on-the-fly term extraction. Subsequently, domain-specific verbs are automatically identified in the corpus based on the frequency of occurrence and the frequency of their co-occurrence with terms. VSPs are then learnt automatically for these verbs. Two machine learning approaches are presented. The first approach has been implemented as an iterative generalisation procedure based on a partial order relation induced by the domain-specific ontology. The second approach exploits the idea of genetic algorithms. Once the VSPs are acquired, they can be used to classify newly recognised terms co-occurring with domain-specific verbs. Given a term, the most frequently co-occurring domain-specific verb is selected. Its VSP is used to constrain the search space by focusing on potential classes of the given term. A nearest-neighbour approach is then applied to select a class from the constrained space of candidate classes. The most similar candidate class is predicted for the given term. The similarity measure used for this purpose combines contextual, lexical, and syntactic properties of terms. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We propose a general method for constructing a kernel following the syntactic structure of the data, as defined by its type signature in a higher-order logic. Our main theoretical result is the positive definiteness of any kernel thus defined. We report encouraging experimental results on a range of real-world data sets.

Using an evolutionary algorithm, a computer program has teamed to play chess by playing games against itself The program learned to evaluate chessboard configurations by using the positions of pieces, material and positional values, and neural networks to assess specific sections of the chessboard. During evolution, the program improved its play by almost 400 rating points. Testing under simulated tournament conditions against Pocket Fritz 2.0 indicated that the evolved program performs above the master level.

J	Motro, A; Berlin, J; Anokhin, P				Motro, A; Berlin, J; Anokhin, P			Multiplex, fusionplex and autoplex - Three generations of information integration	SIGMOD RECORD			English	Article							DATABASES	We describe three generations of information integration systems developed at George Mason University. All three systems adopt a virtual database design: a global integration schema, a mapping between this schema, and the schemas of the participating information sources, and automatic interpretation of global queries. The focus of Multiplex is rapid integration of very large, evolving, and heterogeneous collections of information sources. Fusionplex strengthens these capabilities with powerful tools for resolving data inconsistencies. Finally, Autoplex takes a more proactive approach to integration, by "recruiting" contributions to the global integration schema from available information sources. Using machine learning techniques it confronts a major cost of integration, that of mapping new sources into the global schema.

J	Boros, E; Menkov, V				Boros, E; Menkov, V			Exact and approximate discrete optimization algorithms for finding useful disjunctions of categorical predicates in data analysis	DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						machine learning; feature generation; binary optimization	LOGICAL ANALYSIS	We discuss a discrete optimization problem that arises in data analysis from the binarization of categorical attributes. It can be described as the maximization of a function F(l(1) (x), l(2)(x)), where l(1) (x) and l(2)(x) are linear functions of binary variables x epsilon {0. 1}", and F : R(2) --> R. Though this problem is NP-hard, in general, an optimal solution x* of it can be found, under some mild monotonicity conditions on F, in pseudo-polynomial time. We also present an approximation algorithm which finds an approximate binary solution x(epsilon), for any given epsilon > 0, such that F(l(1) (x*), l(2) (x*)) - F(l(1) (x(epsilon)), l(2)(x(epsilon))) < epsilon, at the cost of no more than O(n log n + 2(C/rootepsilon)n) operations. Though in general C depends on the problem instance, for the problems arising from [en]binarization of categorical variables it depends only on F, and for all functions considered we have C less than or equal to 1/root2.

J	Hammer, PL; Kogan, A; Simeone, B; Szedmak, S				Hammer, PL; Kogan, A; Simeone, B; Szedmak, S			Pareto-optimal patterns in logical analysis of data	DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						extremal patterns; data mining; machine learning; classification accuracy; Boolean functions	OCCAMS RAZOR; INDUCTION	Patterns are the key building blocks in the logical analysis of data (LAD). It has been observed in empirical studies and practical applications that some patterns are more "suitable" than others for use in LAD. In this paper, we model various such suitability criteria as partial preorders defined on the set of patterns. We introduce three such preferences, and describe patterns which are Pareto-optimal with respect to any one of them, or to certain combinations of them. We develop polynomial time algorithms for recognizing Pareto-optimal patterns, as well as for transforming an arbitrary pattern to a better Pareto-optimal One with respect to any one of the considered criteria, or their combinations. We obtain analytical representations characterizing some of the sets of Pareto-optimal patterns, and investigate the computational complexity of generating all Pareto-optimal patterns. The empirical evaluation of the relative merits of various types of Pareto-optimality is carried out by comparing the classification accuracy of Pareto-optimal theories on several real life data sets. This evaluation indicates the advantages of "strong patterns", i.e. those patterns which are Pareto-optimal with respect to the "evidential preference" introduced in this paper.

Due to the complexity of representing the process in any mathematical model. an intelligent system needs to analyse and make a decision on the process. An intelligent system was recommended to acquire the skilled of machinists on-line, while performing turning process. A recurrent Artificial Neural Network was developed and incorporated into the machine learning strategy for the ability of learning and obtain a new knowledge in turning process.

Owing to the amount and complexity of the generated experimental data, machine learning techniques provide a promising approach to investigate novel patterns in high-dimensional metabolic data which form the source for constructing classification rules with high discriminatory power. Results: Six machine learning techniques have been investigated for their classification accuracy focusing on two metabolic disorders, phenylketo nuria (PKU) and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD). Logistic regression analysis led to superior classification rules (sensitivity >96.8%, specificity >99.98%) compared to all investigated algorithms. Including novel constellations of metabolites into the models, the positive predictive value could be strongly increased (PKU 71.9% versus 16.2%, MCADD 88.4% versus 54.6% compared to the established diagnostic markers). Our results clearly prove that the mined data confirm the known and indicate some novel metabolic patterns which may contribute to a better understanding of newborn metabolism.

J	Saetrom, P				Saetrom, P			Predicting the efficacy of short oligonucleotides in antisense and RNAi experiments with boosted genetic programming	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							SMALL INTERFERING RNAS; THERMODYNAMIC PARAMETERS; ALGORITHMS; SEQUENCE; DUPLEXES; SIRNAS; MODEL	Motivation: Both small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and antisense oligonucleotides can selectively block gene expression. Although the two methods rely on different cellular mechanisms, these methods share the common property that not all oligonucleotides (oligos) are equally effective. That is, if mRNA target sites are picked at random, many of the antisense or siRNA oligos will not be effective. Algorithms that can reliably predict the efficacy of candidate oligos can greatly reduce the cost of knockdown experiments, but previous attempts to predict the efficacy of antisense oligos have had limited success. Machine learning has not previously been used to predict siRNA efficacy. Results: We develop a genetic programming based prediction system that shows promising results on both antisense and siRNA efficacy prediction. We train and evaluate our system on a previously published database of antisense efficacies and our own database of siRNA efficacies collected from the literature. The best models gave an overall correlation between predicted and observed efficacy of 0.46 on both antisense and siRNA data. As a comparison, the best correlations of support vector machine classifiers trained on the same data were 0.40 and 0.30, respectively.

J	Yuan, Z; Huang, BX				Yuan, Z; Huang, BX			Prediction of protein accessible surface areas by support vector regression	PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						protein structure prediction; machine learning; accessible surface area; solvent accessibility; support vector; protein sequence analysis	RELATIVE SOLVENT ACCESSIBILITY; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; DATA-BANK; SEQUENCE; ENVIRONMENT; INFORMATION; RESIDUES; MACHINES; PROFILES	A novel support vector regression (SVR) approach is proposed to predict protein accessible surface areas (ASAs) from their primary structures. In this work, we predict the real values of ASA in squared angstroms for residues instead of relative solvent accessibility. Based on protein residues, the Mean and median absolute errors are 26.0 Angstrom(2) and 18.81 Angstrom(2), respectively. The correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed ASAs is 0.66. Cysteine is the best predicted amino acid (mean absolute error is 13.8 Angstrom(2) and median absolute error is 8.37 Angstrom(2)), while arginine is the least predicted amino acid (mean absolute error is 42.7 Angstrom(2) and median absolute error is 36.31 Angstrom(2)). Our work suggests that the SVR approach can be directly applied to the ASA prediction where data preclassification has been used. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We approximate the decision surface in terms of a reduced set of expansion vectors and propose a cascaded evaluation which has the property that the full support-vector expansion is only evaluated on the face-like parts of the image, while the largest part of typical images is classified using a single expansion vector (a simpler and more efficient classifier). As a result, only three reduced-set vectors are used, on average, to classify an image patch. Hence, the cascaded evaluation, presented in this paper, offers a thirtyfold speed-up over an evaluation using the full set of reduced-set vectors, which is itself already thirty times faster than classification using all the support vectors.

Because most outcome studies are observational rather than randomized, risk adjustment is necessary to account for case mix. This has usually been accomplished through the use of standard logistic regression models, although Bayesian models, hierarchical linear models, and machine-learning techniques such as neural networks have also been used. Many factors are essential to insuring the accuracy and usefulness of such models, including selection of an appropriate clinical database, inclusion of critical core variables, precise definitions for predictor variables and endpoints, proper model development, validation, and audit. Risk models may be used to assess the impact of specific predictors on outcome, to aid in patient counseling and treatment selection, to profile provider quality, and to serve as the basis of continuous quality improvement activities.

Traditional feature selection methods resort to random sampling in dealing with data sets with a huge number of instances. In this paper, we introduce the concept of active feature selection, and investigate a selective sampling approach to active feature selection in a filter model setting. We present a formalism of selective sampling based on data variance, and apply it to a widely used feature selection algorithm Relief. Further, we show how it realizes active feature selection and reduces the required number of training instances to achieve time savings without performance deterioration. We design objective evaluation measures of performance, conduct extensive experiments using both synthetic and benchmark data sets, and observe consistent and significant improvement. We suggest some further work based on our study and experiments. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Material: Past data representing (a) successful diagnosis of aphasia's subtypes from collaborating medical experts through a free interview per patient, and (b) correctly classified smears (images of cells) by cyto-technologists, previously stained using the Papanicolaou method. Methods: Initially a hybrid approach is proposed, which combines standard genetic programming and heuristic hierarchical crisp rule-base construction. Then, genetic programming for the production of crisp rule based systems is attempted. Finally, another hybrid intelligent model is composed by a grammar driven genetic programming system for the generation of fuzzy rule-based systems. Results: Results denote the effectiveness of the proposed systems, while they are also compared for their efficiency, accuracy and comprehensibility, to those of an inductive machine learning approach as well as to those of a standard genetic programming symbolic expression approach. Conclusion: The proposed GP-based intelligent methodologies are able to produce accurate and comprehensible results for medical experts performing competitive to other intelligent approaches. The aim of the authors was the production of accurate but also sensible decision rules that could potentially help medical doctors to extract conclusions, even at the expense of a higher classification score achievement.

J	Zhu, XQ; Wu, XD				Zhu, XQ; Wu, XD			Class noise vs. attribute noise: A quantitative study of their impacts	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						attribute noise; class noise; machine learning; noise impacts	DATA QUALITY	Real-world data is never perfect and can often suffer from corruptions (noise) that may impact interpretations of the data, models created front the data and decisions made based on the data. Noise can reduce system performance in terms of classification accuracy, time in building a classifier and the size of the classifier. Accordingly, most existing learning algorithms have integrated various approaches to enhance their learning abilities from noisy environments, but the existence of noise can still introduce serious negative impacts. A more reasonable solution might be to employ sonic preprocessing mechanisms to handle noisy instances before a learner is formed. Unfortunately, rare research has been conducted to systematically explore the impact of noise, especially from the noise handling point of view. This has made various noise processing techniques less significant, specifically when dealing with noise that is introduced in attributes. In this paper, we present a systematic evaluation on the effect of noise in machine learning. Instead of taking any unified theory of noise to evaluate the noise impacts, we differentiate noise into two categories: class noise and attribute noise, and analyze their impacts on the system performance separately. Because class noise has been widely addressed in existing research efforts, we concentrate on attribute noise. We investigate the relationship between attribute noise and classification accuracy, the impact of noise at different attributes, and possible solutions in handling attribute noise. Our conclusions can be used to guide interested readers to enhance data quality by designing various noise handling mechanisms.

A decision function is constructed that allows arbitrary initial states to be queried for inclusion within the stability region. Data essential to the construction process are generated by simulating the nonlinear system with multiple initial states. Using special procedures based on known properties of the stability region, the state data are randomly selected so that they are concentrated in desirable locations near the boundary of the stability region. Selected states belong either to the stability region or do not, thus producing a two-class pattern recognition problem. Support vector machine learning, applied to this problem, determines the decision function. Special techniques are introduced that significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of the learning process. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the overall approach.

J	Liu, YF; Yang, UC				Liu, YF; Yang, UC			SCA db: spinocerebellar ataxia candidate gene database	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							EXPANSION; RESOURCES; REPEATS; DISEASE; GENOME; LOCUS; MICE; MAP	The positional candidate gene approach accelerates the discovery of genes involved in disease. However, the properties of such disease genes are very diverse and the sample size of known disease genes is too small and does not warrant success by the use of a machine-learning approach. A user-defined scoring system may thus help to determine the priority of candidate genes. Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a good model to test this approach because most SCA subtypes are caused by an expansion of short tandem repeats (STRs). The SCA db is a candidate gene database for SCA, which collected 3185 genes for 17 types of SCA. Those SCA subtypes that have known disease genes can be used as positive controls to optimize the parameters. The users may browse the candidate genes of a given SCA subtype by using the default parameters. The known disease genes were found to be the top three candidates using the default parameters.

J	Gong, YH; Han, M; Hua, W; Xu, W				Gong, YH; Han, M; Hua, W; Xu, W			Maximum entropy model-based baseball highlight detection and classification	COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING			English	Article						baseball highlight detection; event detection; video content analysis; machine learning; maximum entropy method		In this paper, we propose a novel system that is able to automatically detect and classify baseball highlights by seamlessly integrating image, audio, and speech clues using a unique framework based on maximum entropy model (MEM). What distinguishes our system is that we emphasize on the integration of multimedia features and the acquisition of domain knowledge through automatic machine learning processes. Our MEM-based framework provides a simple platform capable of integrating multimedia features as well as their contextual information in a uniform fashion. Unlike the Hidden Markov Model and the Bayes Network-based approaches, this framework does not need to explicitly segment and classify the input video into states during its data modeling process, and hence remarkably simplifies the training data creation and the highlight detection/classification tasks. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed baseball highlight detection system in its capability of detecting more major baseball highlights, and in its overall accuracy of detecting these major highlights.

Success in characterizing genetic architecture will depend on our ability to address nonlinearttles In the genotype-to-phenotype mapping relationship as a result of gone-gene Interactions, or epistasis. This review addresses the challenges associated with the detection and characterization of epistasis. A novel strategy known as muttifactor dimensionality reduction that was specifically designed for the Identification of multilocus genetic effects Is presented. Several case studies that demonstrate the detection of gene-gene Interactions In common diseases such as atrial fibrillation, Type 11 diabetes and essential hypertension are also discussed.

For cross-sectional screening of patient populations, all three approaches have achieved sensitivities and specificities within the 60-80th percentile in various studies, with occasional specificities greater than 90% in select populations. Nevertheless, these methods are not likely to provide useful assistance for the experienced examiner at their present level of performance. For longitudinal change detection in individual patients, strategies for clinically specific change detection have been rigorously evaluated for confocal scanning laser tomography only. While these initial studies are encouraging, applying these algorithms in larger numbers of patients is now necessary. Future directions for these technologies are likely to include ultra-high resolution optical coherence tomography, the use of neural network/machine learning classifiers to improve clinical decision-making, and the ability to evaluate the susceptibility of individual optic nerve heads to potential damage from a given level of intraocular pressure or systemic blood pressure.

J	Garcia, C; Delakis, M				Garcia, C; Delakis, M			Convolutional face finder: A neural architecture for fast and robust face detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						face detection; neural networks; machine learning; convolutional networks	RECOGNITION; NETWORK; IMAGES; FEATURES	In this paper, we present a novel face detection approach based on a convolutional neural architecture, designed to robustly detect highly variable face patterns, rotated up to +/-20 degrees in image plane and turned up to 9+/-60 degrees, in complex real world images. The proposed system automatically synthesizes simple problem-specific feature extractors from a training set of face and nonface patterns, without making any assumptions or using any hand-made design concerning the features to extract or the areas of the face pattern to analyze. The face detection procedure acts like a pipeline of simple convolution and subsampling modules that treat the raw input image as a whole. We therefore show that an efficient face detection system does not require any costly local preprocessing before classification of image areas. The proposed scheme provides very high detection rate with a particularly low level of false positives, demonstrated on difficult test sets, without requiring the use of multiple networks for handling difficult cases. We present extensive experimental results illustrating the efficiency of the proposed approach on difficult test sets and including an indepth sensitivity analysis with respect to the degrees of variability of the face patterns.

J	Agarwal, S; Awan, A; Roth, D				Agarwal, S; Awan, A; Roth, D			Learning to detect objects in images via a sparse, part-based representation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV 2002)	MAY 28-31, 2002	COPENHAGEN, DENMARK	IT Univ Copenhagen, Univ Copenhagen, Lund Univ		object detection; image representation; machine learning; evaluation/methodology	FACE DETECTION; RECOGNITION; COMPONENTS; SINGLE	We study the problem of detecting objects in still, gray-scale images. Our primary focus is the development of a learning-based approach to the problem that makes use of a sparse, part-based representation. A vocabulary of distinctive object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest; images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, together with spatial relations observed among the parts. Based on this representation, a learning algorithm is used to automatically learn to detect instances of the object class in new images. The approach can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration; it is evaluated here on difficult sets of real-world images containing side views of cars, and is seen to successfully detect objects in varying conditions amidst background clutter and mild occlusion. In evaluating object detection approaches, several important methodological issues arise that have not been satisfactorily addressed in previous work. A secondary focus of this paper is to highlight these issues and to develop rigorous evaluation standards for the object detection problem. A critical evaluation of our approach under the proposed standards is presented.

J	Kim, HS; Cha, SD				Kim, HS; Cha, SD			Efficient masquerade detection using SVM based on common command frequency in sliding windows	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						intrusion detection; masquerade detection; anomaly detection; machine learning; SVM (Support Vector Machine); user command		Masqueraders who impersonate other users pose serious threat to computer security. Unfortunately, firewalls or misuse-based intrusion detection systems are generally ineffective in detecting masqueraders. Anomaly detection techniques have been proposed as a complementary approach to overcome such limitations. However, they are not accurate enough in detection, and the rate of false alarm is too high for the technique to be applied in practice. For example, recent empirical studies on masquerade detection using UNIX commands found the accuracy to be below 70%. In this research, we per-formed a comparative study to investigate the effectiveness of SVM (Support Vector Machine) technique using the same data set and configuration reported in the previous experiments. In order to improve accuracy of masquerade detection, we used command frequencies in sliding windows as feature sets. In addition, we chose to ignore commands commonly used by all the users and introduce the concept of voting engine. Though still imperfect, we were able to improve the accuracy of masquerade detection to 80.1% and 94.8%, whereas previous studies reported accuracy of 69.3% and 62.8% in the same configurations. This study convincingly demonstrates that SVM is useful as an anomaly detection technique and that there are several advantages SVM offers as a tool to detect masqueraders.

Recently, a number of classifier creation methods, known as ensemble methods, have been proposed in the field of machine learning. It has been shown that these methods are able to substantially improve recognition performance in complex classification tasks. In this paper we examine the influence of the vocabulary size and the number of training samples on the performance of three ensemble methods in the context of handwritten word recognition. The experiments were conducted with two different offline hidden Markov model based handwritten word recognizers.

Rapid and Global Bridge Assessment for the Military	JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bridges; Bearing capacity; Assessment; Military engineering		Prior to any military operation, a critical task of military engineers involves the ability to quickly assess the load-carrying capacity of bridges. These assessments are required to facilitate the selection of movement corridors for troops, equipment, and supplies. Assessments are complicated when bridges are located in areas that are inaccesible or where information regarding design standards is unobtainable. The U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center has developed a systematic methodology to provide rapid, accurate bridge assessments on a large scale and in all regions. The methodology uses a machine learning approach designed to discover regional construction and condition tendencies given a sample of onsite inspections. Learning occurs based on the notion of bridge similarity. This approach allows for the completion of bridge assessments in a timely and effective manner. A brief description of the systematic methodology is provided, and the results and analysis of this approach are presented using an actual case study that illustrates the effectiveness of the approach. The results indicate that construction tendencies can be captured and applied to reduce the data collection effort while improving bridge assessments.

J	Liu, Y				Liu, Y			Active learning with support vector machine applied to gene expression data for cancer classification	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article							ROC CURVE	There is growing interest in the application of machine learning techniques in bioinformatics. The supervised machine learning approach has been widely applied to bioinformatics and gained a lot of success in this research area. With this learning approach researchers first develop a large training set, which is a time-consuming and costly process. Moreover, the proportion of the positive examples and negative examples in the training set may not represent the real-world data distribution, which causes concept drift. Active learning avoids these problems. Unlike most conventional learning methods where the training set used to derive the model remains static, the classifier can actively choose the training data and the size of training set increases. We introduced an algorithm for performing active learning with support vector machine and applied the algorithm to gene expression profiles of colon cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer samples. We compared the classification performance of active learning with that of passive learning. The results showed that employing the active learning method can achieve high accuracy and significantly reduce the need for labeled training instances. For lung cancer classification, to achieve 96% of the total positives, only 31 labeled examples were needed in active learning whereas in passive learning 174 labeled examples were required. That meant over 82% reduction was realized by active learning. In active learning the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were over 0.81, while in passive learning the areas under the ROC Curves were below 0.50.

J	Klon, AE; Glick, M; Davies, JW				Klon, AE; Glick, M; Davies, JW			Application of machine learning to improve the results of high-throughput docking against the HIV-1 protease	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article							ENRICHMENT; DESIGN	We have previously reported that the application of a Laplacian-modified naive Bayesian (NB) classifier may be used to improve the ranking of known inhibitors from a random database of compounds after High-Throughput Docking (HTD). The method relies upon the frequency of substructural features among the active and inactive compounds from 2D fingerprint information of the compounds. Here we present an investigation of the role of extended connectivity fingerprints in training the NB classifier against HTD studies on the HIV-1 protease using three docking programs: Glide. FlexX. and GOLD. The results show that the performance of the NB classifier is due to the presence of a large number of features common to the set of known active compounds rather than a single structural or substructural scaffold. We demonstrate that the Laplacian-modified naive Bayesian classifier trained with data from high-throughput docking is superior at identifying active compounds from a target database in comparison to conventional two-dimensional substructure search methods alone.

In one of configurations this technique is compared to multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (ANN). It is shown that model trees, being analogous to piecewise linear functions, have certain advantages compared to ANNs-they are more transparent and hence acceptable by decision makers, are very fast in training and always converge. The accuracy of M5 trees is similar to that of ANNs. The improved accuracy in predicting high floods was achieved by building a modular model (mixture of models); in it the flood samples with special hydrological characteristics are split into groups for which separate M5 and ANN models are built. The hybrid model combining model tree and ANN gives the best prediction result.

J	Rupp, B; Wang, JW				Rupp, B; Wang, JW			Predictive models for protein crystallization	METHODS			English	Article						high throughput crystallization; statistical analysis; machine learning; structural genomics; predictive models	STRUCTURAL GENOMICS; MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLIZATION; VAPOR-DIFFUSION; BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES; CRYSTAL-GROWTH; MICROBATCH; DATABASE; DISCOVERY; STRATEGY; FACILITY	Crystallization of proteins is a nontrivial task, and despite the substantial efforts in robotic automation, crystallization screening is still largely based on trial-and-error sampling of a limited subset of suitable reagents and experimental parameters. Funding of high throughput crystallography pilot projects through the NIH Protein Structure Initiative provides the opportunity to collect crystallization data in a comprehensive and statistically valid form. Data mining and machine learning algorithms thus have the potential to deliver predictive models for protein crystallization. However, the underlying complex physical reality of crystallization, combined with a generally ill-defined and sparsely populated sampling space, and inconsistent scoring and annotation make the development of predictive models non-trivial. We discuss the conceptual problems, and review strengths and limitations of current approaches towards crystallization prediction, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive and valid sampling protocols. In view of limited overlap in techniques and sampling parameters between the publicly funded high throughput crystallography initiatives, exchange of information and standardization should be encouraged, aiming to effectively integrate data mining and machine learning efforts into a comprehensive predictive framework for protein crystallization. Similar experimental design and knowledge discovery strategies should be applied to valid analysis and prediction of protein expression, solubilization, and purification, as well as crystal handling and cryo-protection.

As a result, the relational data mining approach, the authors proposed in the preceding books, was improved. We present the approach as an implementation of the cognitive process as the measurement theory perceived. We analyse the cognitive process in the first part of the paper and present the theory and method of the logically most powerful empirical theory discovery in the second. The theory is based on the notion of 'law-like' rules, which conform to all the properties of laws of nature, namely generality, simplicity, maximum refutability and minimum number of parameters. This notion is defined for deterministic and probabilistic cases. Based on the method, the 'discovery' system is developed, The system was successfully applied to many practical tasks.

In this work, we use machine learning to associate low level colour representations of digital colour photos with their high level semantic categories. We investigate the redundancy and performance of a number of histogram-based colour image content representations in the context of automatic colour photo categorization using support vector machines. We use principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of (high dimensional) histogram based colour descriptors and use support vector machines to learn to classify the images into various high level categories in the histograms subspaces. We present experimental results to demonstrate the usefulness of such an approach to organizing colour photos into semantic categories. Our results show that the colour content descriptors constructed in different ways perform quite differently and the performances are data dependent hence it is difficult to pick a "winning" descriptor. Our results demonstrate conclusively that all descriptors studied in this paper are highly redundant and that regardless of their performances, the dimensionalities of these histogram based colour content descriptors can be significantly reduced without affecting their classification performances.

J	Meinicke, P; Tech, M; Morgenstern, B; Merkl, R				Meinicke, P; Tech, M; Morgenstern, B; Merkl, R			Oligo kernels for datamining on biological sequences: a case study on prokaryotic translation initiation sites	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							ESCHERICHIA-COLI; CODON; PREDICTION; EFFICIENCY; GENOME	Background: Kernel-based learning algorithms are among the most advanced machine learning methods and have been successfully applied to a variety of sequence classification tasks within the field of bioinformatics. Conventional kernels utilized so far do not provide an easy interpretation of the learnt representations in terms of positional and compositional variability of the underlying biological signals. Results: We propose a kernel-based approach to datamining on biological sequences. With our method it is possible to model and analyze positional variability of oligomers of any length in a natural way. On one hand this is achieved by mapping the sequences to an intuitive but high-dimensional feature space, well-suited for interpretation of the learnt models. On the other hand, by means of the kernel trick we can provide a general learning algorithm for that high-dimensional representation because all required statistics can be computed without performing an explicit feature space mapping of the sequences. By introducing a kernel parameter that controls the degree of position-dependency, our feature space representation can be tailored to the characteristics of the biological problem at hand. A regularized learning scheme enables application even to biological problems for which only small sets of example sequences are available. Our approach includes a visualization method for transparent representation of characteristic sequence features. Thereby importance of features can be measured in terms of discriminative strength with respect to classification of the underlying sequences. To demonstrate and validate our concept on a biochemically well-defined case, we analyze E. coli translation initiation sites in order to show that we can find biologically relevant signals. For that case, our results clearly show that the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is the most important signal upstream a start codon. The variability in position and composition we found for that signal is in accordance with previous biological knowledge. We also find evidence for signals downstream of the start codon, previously introduced as transcriptional enhancers. These signals are mainly characterized by occurrences of adenine in a region of about 4 nucleotides next to the start codon. Conclusions: We showed that the oligo kernel can provide a valuable tool for the analysis of relevant signals in biological sequences. In the case of translation initiation sites we could clearly deduce the most discriminative motifs and their positional variation from example sequences. Attractive features of our approach are its flexibility with respect to oligomer length and position conservation.

As with most forms of trading, the activity is influenced by many random parameters so that the creation of a system that effectively emulates the trading process will be very helpful. A major issue for traders in the deregulated Foreign Exchange Market is when to sell and when to buy a particular currency in order to maximize profit. This paper presents novel trading strategies based on the machine learning methods of genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning.

In this paper, methodologies are presented for systematizing and representing knowledge about the chemical and physical properties of additives used in crystallization experiments. A novel autonomous discovery program is introduced as a method to prune rule-based models produced from crystallization data augmented with such knowledge. Computational experiments indicate that such a system can retain and present informative rules pertaining to protein crystallization that warrant further confirmation via experimental techniques.

Some cultures were exposed to concentrations of a number of antifungal substances with different targets or modes of action (sterol biosynthesis, respiratory chain, amino acid synthesis, and the uncoupler). Culture supernatants were taken and analyzed for their "metabolic footprints" by using direct-injection mass spectrometry. Discriminant function analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis allowed these antifungal compounds to be distinguished and classified according to their modes of action. Genetic programming, a rule-evolving machine learning strategy, allowed respiratory inhibitors to be discriminated from others by using just two masses. Metabolic footprinting thus represents a rapid, convenient, and information-rich method for classifying the modes of action of antifungal substances.

This approach is carried out in two stages: (1) induction of a qualitative model from numerical examples of the behaviour of a physical system, and (2) induction of a numerical regression function that both respects the qualitative constraints and fits the training data numerically. We call this approach Q(2) learning, which stands for Qualitatively faithful Quantitative learning. Induced numerical models are "qualitatively faithful" in the sense that they respect qualitative trends in the learning data. Advantages of Q(2) learning are that the induced qualitative model enables a (possibly causal) explanation of relations among the variables in the modelled system, and that numerical predictions are guaranteed to be qualitatively consistent with the qualitative model which alleviates the interpretation of the predictions. Moreover, as we show experimentally the qualitative model's guidance of the quantitative modelling process leads to predictions that may be considerably more accurate than those obtained by state-of-the-art numerical learning methods. The experiments include an application of Q(2) learning to the identification of a car wheel suspension system-a complex, industrially relevant mechanical system. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Here we forecast the potential distribution of zebra mussels in the United States by applying a machine-learning algorithm for nonparametric prediction of species distributions (genetic algorithm for rule-set production, or GARP) to data about the current distribution of zebra mussels in the United States and 11 environmental and geological covariates. Our results suggest that much of the American West will be uninhabitable for zebra mussels. Nonetheless, some catchments along the West Coast and in the southeastern United States exhibit considerable risk of invasion and should be monitored carefully. Possible propagule dispersal to these places should be managed proactively.

J	Liu, H; Liu, D; Zheng, G; Liang, YM				Liu, H; Liu, D; Zheng, G; Liang, YM			Research on natural gas short-term load forecasting based on support vector regression	CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						structure risk minimization; support vector machines; support vector regression; load forecasting; neural network	NEURAL-NETWORK	Natural gas load forecasting is a key process to the efficient operation of pipeline network. An accurate forecast is required to guarantee a balanced network operation and ensure safe gas supply at a minimum cost. Machine learning techniques have been increasingly applied to load forecasting. A novel regression technique based on the statistical learning theory, support vector machines (SVM), is investigated in this paper for natural gas shortterm load forecasting. SVM is based on the principle of structure risk minimization as opposed to the principle of empirical risk minimization in conventional regression techniques. Using a data set with 2 years load values we developed prediction model using SVM to obtain 31 days load predictions. The results on city natural gas short-term load forecasting show that SVM provides better prediction accuracy than neural network. The software package natural gas pipeline networks simulation and load forecasting (NGPNSLF) based on support vector regression prediction has been developed, which has also been applied in practice.

J	Mao, PL; Liu, TF; Kueh, K; Wu, P				Mao, PL; Liu, TF; Kueh, K; Wu, P			Predicting the efficiency of UAG translational stop signal through studies of physicochemical properties of its composite mono- and dinucleotides	COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						artificial intelligence; computational biology; computer modelling; physicochemical properties; amber stop codon	RELEASE FACTOR RF3; CHEMICAL-ELEMENT PROPERTIES; PEPTIDYL-TRANSFER-RNA; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; NASCENT PEPTIDE; DFT CALCULATIONS; TERMINATION; CODON; SEQUENCE; CONTEXT	In this study, we explored the problem of predicting the UAG stop-codon read-through efficiency. The reported nucleotide sequences were first converted into physicochemical property vectors before being presented to a machine learning algorithm. Two sets of physicochemical properties were applied: one for mononucleosides (in terms of steric bulk, hydrophobicity and electronics) and another for dinucleotides. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of how dinucleotides are converted into principle components derived from NMR chemical shift data. A few efficiency prediction models were then derived and a comparison between mononucleoside and dinucleotide-based models was shown. In the derived models, the coefficients of these property based predictors lend themselves to bio-physical interpretations, an advantage which is demonstrated in this study via a prediction model based on the steric bulk factor. Although it is quite simple, the steric bulk factor model explained well the effect of sequence variations surrounding the amber stop codon and the tRNA bearing UCCU anticodon. We further proposed new alternatives at position -1 and +4 of a UAG stop codon sequence to enhance the readthrough efficiency. This research may contribute to a better understanding of the readthrough mechanisms and may also help to study the normal translation termination process. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A novel molecular detector is used-one based on current blockade measurements through a nanometer-scale ion channel (alpha-hemolysin). Classification results are described for blockades caused by DNA molecules in the alpha-hemolysin nanopore detector, with signal analysis and pattern recognition performed using a combination of methods from bioinformatics and machine learning. Due to the size of the alpha-hemolysin protein channel, the blockade events report on one DNA molecule at a time, which enables a variety of reproducible, single-molecule biophysical experiments. To capture the full sensitivity of the nanopore detector's blockade signal, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were used with Expectation/Maximization for denoising and for associating a feature vector with the ionic current blockade of each captured DNA molecule. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that employ novel kernel designs were then used as discriminators. With SVM training performed off-line, and economical HMM processing on-line, blockade classification was possible during capture. HMMs were also used in conjunction with a time-domain finite state automaton (off-line) for feature discovery and kinetics analysis. Analysis of the DNA data indicates a variety of binding (DNA-protein), fraying, and conformational shifts that are consistent with data obtained from thermodynamic analyses (melting curves), X-ray crystallography, and NMR studies. The software tools are designed for analysis of generic blockades in ionic channels, including those in other biological pore-forming toxins, other biological channels in general, and semiconductor-based channels.

Case-based methods are especially well suited to situations where a single class is represented by more than one cluster, or a class fills an irregular shape in the feature space. Case-based ecological mapping relies on the assumption of finding a species (or other phenomenon) in locations similar to those where this species has already been registered. Lazy learning is a machine learning approach for fitting case-based prediction systems, which prefers raw data to generalizations. An overview of lazy learning methods: feature selection and weighting, fitting the number of exemplars or kernel extent used for decisions, indexing the case-base, learning new and forgetting useless exemplars, and exemplar weighting, is given. A case study of habitat and forest composition mapping was accomplished in Otepaa Upland in South-East Estonia. Habitat classes were predicted and mapped on the whole study area; five characteristics of stand composition, presence/absence of Quercus robur, total coverage of forest stand, coverage of coniferous trees, and eight main tree species separately, were mapped on non-agricultural and non-settlement areas. The explanatory variables were derived from: Landsat 7 ETM image, greyscale and colour orthophotos, elevation model, 1:10 000 digital base map, and soil map. One thousand random locations were described in the field in order to obtain training data. Four methods of machine learning were compared. In calculations of similarity, exemplar and feature weights regulated both the influence of particular exemplars and features, and kernel extent. Goodness-of-fit of predictions was estimated using leave-one-out cross-validation. A machine learning method combining stepwise feature selection, feature weighting, and exemplar weighting reached the best results in the case of 10 response variables. A method involving iterative random sampling proved to be the best for the other seven variables. The best fit was found for variables: habitat class (kappa = 0.85), oak presence/absence (mean true positive + mean true negative - 1 = 0.72), coverage of coniferous trees (R-2 = 0.80), coverage of Pinus sylvestris (R-2 = 0.72), and coverage of Picea abies (R-2 = 0.73). In most cases, less than a half of training instances were retained as exemplars after case filtering, and less than half of the explanatory variables were used in predictive sets. All 31 explanatory variables were included in a predictive set of features at least once. The most valuable predictor was land cover category according to the 1:10,000 base map.

J	Whiteson, S; Stone, P				Whiteson, S; Stone, P			Adaptive job routing and scheduling	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						autonomic computing; reinforcement learning; q-learning; routing; scheduling		Computer systems are rapidly becoming so complex that maintaining them with human support staffs will be prohibitively expensive and inefficient. In response, visionaries have begun proposing that computer systems be imbued with the ability to configure themselves, diagnose failures, and ultimately repair themselves in response to these failures. However, despite convincing arguments that such a shift would be desirable, as of yet there has been little concrete progress made towards this goal. These challenges are naturally suited to machine learning methods. Hence, this article presents a new network simulator designed to study the application of machine learning methods from a system-wide perspective. Also, learning-based methods for addressing the problems of job routing and CPU scheduling in the simulated networks are introduced. Experimental results verify that methods using machine learning outperform reasonable heuristic and hand-coded approaches on example networks designed to capture many of the complexities that exist in real systems.

In this paper, a multi-class SVM is used for classification of DAIS hyperspectral remotely sensed data. Results show that the SVM performs better than maximum likelihood, univariate decision tree and backpropagation neural network classifiers, even with small training data sets, and is almost unaffected by the Hughes phenomenon.

J	Muneesawang, P; Guan, L				Muneesawang, P; Guan, L			An interactive approach for CBIR using a network of radial basis functions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA			English	Article						content-based image retrieval; digital library; relevance feedback; machine learning; radial basis function network; nonlinear human perception	IMAGE RETRIEVAL; RELEVANCE FEEDBACK; FEATURES	An important requirement for constructing effective content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems is accurate characterization of visual information. Conventional nonadaptive models, which are usually adopted for this task in simple CBIR systems, do not adequately capture all aspects of the characteristics of the human visual system. An effective way of addressing this problem is to adopt a "human-computer" interactive approach, where the users directly teach the system about what they regard as being significant image features and their own notions of image similarity. We propose a machine learning approach for this task, which allows users to directly modify query characteristics by specifying their attributes in the form of training examples. Specifically, we apply a radial-basis function (RBF) network for implementing an adaptive metric which progressively models the notion of image similarity through continual relevance feedback from users. Experimental results show that the proposed methods not only outperform conventional CBIR systems in terms of both accuracy and robustness, but also previously proposed interactive systems.

A strong feature of FCA is its capability of producing graphical visualizations of the inherent structures among data. High-risk systems have some special characteristics that result in inevitable accidents. This research utilizes FCA to investigate vessel accidents on the lower Mississippi river. FCA identifies the concepts that are vital indicators of a special type of accident, a collision. It is possible to analyze navigation environments and thereby gain a better understanding of these accidents. Such accidents may not be completely eliminated, though it is beneficial to identify when they were most likely to occur and take appropriate control measures. Furthermore, identification of the most dangerous environments might suggest specific safety regimens and regulatory control designs. The FCA suggests three groups of policy decisions, representing a series of increasingly dangerous situations for vessel traffic in a treacherous inland waterway. The three groups are made of: two sets of "cautionary" conditions, three sets of "serious" conditions, and one set for "prohibitive" action, respectively. The FCA does not make decisions; it clearly identifies distinct environments that require guidelines (i.e. regimens) for safe navigation to lessen or eliminate normal or system accidents.

J	Feng, XT; Zhao, HB; Li, SJ				Feng, XT; Zhao, HB; Li, SJ			Modeling non-linear displacement time series of geo-materials using evolutionary support vector machines	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES			English	Article						evolutionary support vector machine; genetic algorithm; slope; tunnel; non-linear time series; displacement		Evaluation of the non-linear deformation behavior of geo-materials is an important aspect of the safety assessment for geotechnical engineering in complex conditions. This paper presents a novel machine learning method, termed support vector machine (SVM), to obtain a global optimization model in conditions of large project dimensions, small sample sizes and nonlinearity. A new idea is put forward to combine the SVM with a genetic algorithm. The method has been used in the analysis of the high rock slope of the permanent shiplock of the Three Gorges Project and the horizontal deformation at depth in the Bachimen landslide in Fujian Province, China. The 92 non-linear SVMs in total were constructed with their kernel functions and the parameters were recognized using a genetic algorithm. The results indicate that the established SVMs can appropriately describe the evolutionary law of deformation of geo-materials at depth and provide predictions for the future 6-10 time steps with acceptable accuracy and confidence.

One important example is knowledge engineering, a term that is used in a broad sense to encompass artificial intelligence, computational intelligence, knowledge bases, data mining, and machine learning [13]. Many typical software development issues can benefit from these disciplines. For this reason, we will employ computational intelligence approach to classify software component repository into similar component cluster groups with the help of Rival Penalized Competitive Learning algorithm. The center of each cluster will be used to construct the coarse grain classification indexing structure. Subsequent retrieval requirements of software components are compared with all the indexed cluster centers. Any software components belonging to the cluster partition whose center is closest to the required software component will be retrieved and participated in selecting the most suitable software component at the fine grain level. This approach not only is suitable for multi-dimensional data, but also automatically decides the correct model classification.

J	Bray, M; Han, D				Bray, M; Han, D			Identification of support vector machines for runoff modelling	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS			English	Article						flood forecasting; model identification; parameter optimisation; rainfall runoff; support vector machines	NEURAL-NETWORK	This paper describes an exploration in using SVM (Support Vector machine) models, which were initially developed in the machine Learning community, in flood forecasting, with the focus on the identification of a suitable model structure and its relevant parameters for rainfall runoff modelling. SVM has been applied in many fields and has a high success rate in classification tasks such as pattern recognition, OCR, etc. The applications of SVM in regression of time series are relatively new and they are more problematic in comparison with classifications. This study found that exhaustive search of an optimum model structure and its parameter space is prohibitive due to their sheer size and unknown characteristics. Some parameters are very sensitive and can increase the CPU load tremendously (and hence result in very long computation times). All these make it very difficult to efficiently identify SVM models, which has been carried out by manual operations in all study cases so far. The paper further explored the relationships among various model structures (xi-SV or v-SV regression), kernel functions (linear, polynomial, radial basis and sigmoid), scaling factor, model parameters (cost C, epsilon) and composition of input vectors. These relationships should be able to provide useful information for more effective model identification in the future. The unit response curve from SVM was compared with a transfer function model and it is found that a TF model outperforms SVM in short-range predictions. it is still unclear how the unit response curve could be utilised for model identification processes and future exploration in this area is needed.

A typical fMRI experiment can produce a three-dimensional image related to the human subject's brain activity every half second, at a spatial resolution of a few millimeters. As in other modern empirical sciences, this new instrumentation has led to a flood of new data, and a corresponding need for new data analysis methods. We describe recent research applying machine learning methods to the problem of classifying the cognitive state of a human subject based on fRMI data observed over a single time interval. In particular, we present case studies in which we have successfully trained classifiers to distinguish cognitive states such as ( 1) whether the human subject is looking at a picture or a sentence, ( 2) whether the subject is reading an ambiguous or non-ambiguous sentence, and ( 3) whether the word the subject is viewing is a word describing food, people, buildings, etc. This learning problem provides an interesting case study of classifier learning from extremely high dimensional (10(5) features), extremely sparse ( tens of training examples), noisy data. This paper summarizes the results obtained in these three case studies, as well as lessons learned about how to successfully apply machine learning methods to train classifiers in such settings.

In our work, we investigated two meta-learning approaches, each one used in a different case study. Initially, we used a single machine learning algorithm to select among two models to forecast stationary time series (case study I). Following, we used the NOEMON approach, a more recent work in the meta-learning area, to rank three models used to forecast time series of the M3-Competition (case study II). The experiments performed in both case studies revealed encouraging results. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The LBP model involves parameters that balance the competing goals of maximizing the log-likelihood and minimizing the penalized basis pursuit terms. These parameters are selected to minimize a proxy of misclassification error. namely, the randomized, generalized approximate cross validation (ranGACV) function. The ranGACV function is not easily represented in compact form; its functional values can only be obtained by solving two instances of the LBP model, which may be computationally expensive. A grid search is typically used to find appropriate parameters, requiring the solutions to hundreds or thousands of instances of the LBP model. Since only parameters (data) are changed between solves, the resulting problem is a nonlinear slice model in the parameter space. We show how slice-modeling techniques significantly improve the efficiency of individual solves and thus speed-up the grid search. In addition, we consider using derivative-free optimization algorithms for parameter selection, replacing the grid search. We show how, by seeding the derivative-free algorithms with a coarse grid search, these algorithms can find better solutions with fewer function evaluations. Our interest in this area comes directly from the seminal work that Olvi and his collaborators have carried out designing and applying optimization techniques to problems in machine learning and data mining.

The proposed learning approach consists of an adaptive incremental learning strategy and distance-based fitness functions for generating the discriminant functions using genetic programming. To classify data using the discriminant functions effectively, the mechanism called Z-value measure is developed. Based on the Z-value measure, we give two classification algorithms to resolve ambiguity among the discriminant functions. The experiments show that the proposed approach has less training time than previous GP learning methods. The learned classifiers also have high accuracy of classification in comparison with the previous classifiers. (C) 2004 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Iyatomi, H; Hagiwara, M				Iyatomi, H; Hagiwara, M			Adaptive fuzzy inference neural network	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						neural network; fuzzy inference; machine learning; fuzzy modeling and rule extraction	SYSTEM	An adaptive fuzzy inference neural network (AFINN) is proposed in this paper. It has self-construction ability, parameter estimation ability and rule extraction ability. The structure of AFINN is formed by the following four phases: (1) initial rule creation, (2) selection of important input elements, (3) identification of the network structure and (4) parameter estimation using LMS (least-mean square) algorithm. When the number of input dimension is large, the conventional fuzzy systems often cannot handle the task correctly because the degree of each rule becomes too small. AFINN solves such a problem by modification of the learning and inference algorithm. (C) 2004 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The main weakness of most existing algorithms is their poor ability to handle data containing noise. This problem is even more severe when inductive learning techniques are applied to real engineering data. The paper presents a new pruning technique that improves significantly the performance of the RULES family of inductive learning algorithms. The technique is designed for RULES-5, the latest algorithm in the family, but could readily be applied to rule sets created by other algorithms.

Reliable, noninvasive methods for early detection of liver cirrhosis are not availabe. Using a three-step approach, we classified sera from rats with liver cirrhosis following different treatment insults. The approach consisted of: (i) protein profiling using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) technology; (ii) selection of a statistically significant serum biomarker set using machine learning algorithms; and (iii) identification of selected serum biomarkers by peptide sequencing. We generated serum protein profiles from three groups of rats: (i) normal (n = 8), (ii) thioacetamide-induced liver cirrhosis (n = 22), and (iii) bile duct ligation-induced liver fibrosis (n = 5) using a weak cation exchanger surface. Profiling data were further analyzed by a recursive support vector machine algorithm to select a panel of statistically significant biomarkers for class prediction. Sensitivity and specificity of classification using the selected protein marker set were higher than 92%. A consistently down-regulated 3495 Da protein in cirrhosis samples was one of the selected significant biomarkers. This 3495 Da protein was purified on-chip and trypsin digested. Further structural characterization of this biomarkers candidate was done by using cross-platform matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight/time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Combined data from PMF and MS/MS spectra of two tryptic peptides suggested that this 3495 Da protein shared homology to a histidine-rich glycoprotein. These results demonstrated a novel approach to discovery of new biomarkers for early detection of liver cirrhosis classification of liver diseases.

J	Lange, S; Zilles, S				Lange, S; Zilles, S			Formal language identification: query learning vs. Gold-style learning	INFORMATION PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						formal languages; query learning; Gold-style learning		A natural approach towards powerful machine learning systems is to enable options for additional machine/user interactions, for instance by allowing the system to ask queries about the concept to be learned. This motivates the development and analysis of adequate formal learning models. In the present paper, we investigate two different types of query learning models in the context of learning indexable classes of recursive languages: Angluin's original model and a relaxation thereof, called learning with extra queries. In the original model the learner is restricted to query languages belonging to the target class, while in the new model it is allowed to query other languages, too. As usual, the following standard types of queries are considered: superset, subset, equivalence, and membership queries. The learning capabilities of the resulting query learning models are compared to one another and to different versions of Gold-style language learning from only positive data and from positive and negative data (including finite learning, conservative inference, and learning in the limit). A complete picture of the relation of all these models has been elaborated. A couple of interesting differences and similarities between query learning and Gold-style learning have been observed. In particular, query learning with extra superset queries coincides with conservative inference from only positive data. This result documents the naturalness of the new query model.

J	Dominguez-Lopez, JA; Damper, RI; Crowder, RM; Harris, CJ				Dominguez-Lopez, JA; Damper, RI; Crowder, RM; Harris, CJ			Adaptive neurofuzzy control of a robotic gripper with on-line machine learning	ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS			English	Article						robotics; grasping; neurofuzzy systems; intelligent control; on-line learning	FUZZY-LOGIC	Pre-programming complex robotic systems to operate in unstructured environments is extremely difficult because of the programmer's inability to predict future operating conditions in the face of unforeseen environmental conditions, mechanical wear of parts, etc. The solution to this problem is for the robot controller to learn on-line about its own capabilities and limitations when interacting with its environment. At the present state of technology, this poses a challenge to existing machine learning methods. We study this problem using a simple two-fingered gripper which learns to grasp an object with appropriate force, without slip while minimising chances of damage to the object. Three machine learning methods are used to produce a neurofuzzy controller for the gripper. These are off-line supervised neurofuzzy learning and two on-line methods, namely unsupervised reinforcement learning and an unsupervised/supervised hybrid. With the two on-line methods, we demonstrate that the controller can learn through interaction with its environment to overcome simulated failure of its sensors. Further, the hybrid is shown to out perform reinforcement learning alone in terms of faster adaptation to the changing circumstances of sensor failure. The hybrid learning scheme allows us to make best use of such pre-labeled datasets as might exist and to remember effectively good control actions discovered by reinforcement learning.

The lack of sufficient parameter data is usually dealt with by treating relevant parameters as random fields, which enables one to employ various geostatistical and stochastic tools. The major conceptual difficulty with these techniques is that they rely on the ergodicity hypothesis to interchange spatial and ensemble statistics. Instead of treating deterministic material properties as random, we introduce tools from machine learning to deal with the sparsity of data. To demonstrate the relevance and advantages of this approach, we apply one of these tools, the Support Vector Machine, to delineate geologic facies from hydraulic conductivity data.

J	Down, TA; Hubbard, TJP				Down, TA; Hubbard, TJP			What can we learn from noncoding regions of similarity between genomes?	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							DNA; ANNOTATION; SEQUENCES	Background: In addition to known protein-coding genes, large amounts of apparently non-coding sequence are conserved between the human and mouse genomes. It seems reasonable to assume that these conserved regions are more likely to contain functional elements than less-conserved portions of the genome. Methods: Here we used a motif-oriented machine learning method based on the Relevance Vector Machine algorithm to extract the strongest signal from a set of non-coding conserved sequences. Results: We successfully fitted models to reflect the non-coding sequences, and showed that the results were quite consistent for repeated training runs. Using the learned models to scan genomic sequence, we found that they often made predictions close to the start of annotated genes. We compared this method with other published promoter-prediction systems, and showed that the set of promoters which are detected by this method is substantially similar to that detected by existing methods. Conclusions: The results presented here indicate that the promoter signal is the strongest single motif-based signal in the non-coding functional fraction of the genome. They also lend support to the belief that there exists a substantial subset of promoter regions which share several common features including, but not restricted to, a relative abundance of CpG dinucleotides. This subset is detectable by a variety of distinct computational methods.

Criterion has two complementary applications: (1) Critique Writing Analysis Tools, a suite of pro-rams that detect errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics, that identify discourse elements in the essay, and that recognize potentially undesirable elements of style, and (2) e-rater version 2.0, an automated essay scoring system. Critique and e-rater provide students with feedback that is specific to their writing in order to help them improve their writing skills and is intended to be used under the instruction of a classroom teacher. Both applications employ natural language processing and machine learning techniques. All of these capabilities outperform baseline algorithms, and some of the tools agree with human judges in their evaluations as often as two judges agree with each other.

We conducted the study on three different neural network architectures, multilayered Back Propagation, Radial Basis Function, and Fuzzy ARTMAP using three different training methods, duplicating minority class examples, Snowball technique and multidimensional Gaussian modeling of data noise. Three major issues are addressed: neural learning from unbalanced data examples, neural learning from noisy data, and making intentional biased decisions. We argue that by properly generated extra training data examples around the noise densities, we can train a neural network that has a stronger capability of generalization and better control of the classification error of the trained neural network. In particular, we focus on problems that require a neural network to make favorable classification to a particular class such as classifying normal( pass)/abnormal( fail) vehicles in an assembly plant. In addition, we present three methods that quantitatively measure the noise level of a given data set. All experiments were conducted using data examples downloaded directly from test sites of an automobile assembly plant. The experimental results showed that the proposed multidimensional Gaussian noise modeling algorithm was very effective in generating extra data examples that can be used to train a neural network to make favorable decisions for the minority class and to have increased generalization capability.

However, despite this enormous potential, few IE systems have successfully made the transition from laboratory to commercial application. The reason may be a purely practical one - to build useable, scaleable IE systems requires bringing together a range of different technologies as well as providing clear and reproducible guidelines as to how to collectively configure and deploy those technologies. This paper is an attempt to address these issues. The paper focuses on two primary goals. Firstly, we show that an information extraction system which is used for real world applications and different domains can be built using some autonomous, corporate components ( agents). Such a system has some advanced properties: clear separation to different extraction tasks and steps, portability to multiple application domain, trainability, extensibility, etc. Secondly, we show that machine learning and, in particular, learning in different ways and at different levels, can be used to build practical IE systems. We show that carefully selecting the right machine learning technique for the right task and selective sampling can be used to reduce the human effort required to annotate examples for building such systems.

J	Chiu, KC; Xu, L				Chiu, KC; Xu, L			Arbitrage pricing theory-based Gaussian temporal factor analysis for adaptive portfolio management	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						temporal factor analysis; arbitrage pricing theory; portfolio optimization; sharpe ratio; downside risk; upside volatility	STATE-SPACE; PERFORMANCE; RETURNS; MODELS	Ever since the inception of Markowitz's modem portfolio theory, static portfolio optimization techniques were gradually phased out by dynamic portfolio management due to the growth of popularity in automated trading. In view of the intensive computational needs, it is common to use machine learning approaches on Sharpe ratio maximization for implementing dynamic portfolio optimization. In the literature, return-based approaches which directly used security prices or returns to control portfolio weights were often used. Inspired by the arbitrage pricing theory (APT), some other efforts concentrate on indirect modelling using hidden factors. On the other hand, with regard to the proper risk measure in the Sharpe ratio, downside risk was considered a better substitute for variance. In this paper, we investigate how the Gaussian temporal factor analysis (TFA) technique can be used for portfolio optimization. Since TFA is based on the classical APT model and has the benefit of removing rotation indeterminacy via temporal modelling, using TFA for portfolio management allows portfolio weights to be indirectly controlled by several hidden factors. Moreover, we extend the approach to some other variants tailored for investors according to their investment objectives and degree of risk tolerance. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recent studies have shown that Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods achieved better performance than, traditional statistical methods. This article introduces a relatively new machine learning technique, support vector machines (SVM), to the problem in attempt to provide a model with better explanatory power. We used backpropagation neural network (BNN) as a benchmark and obtained prediction accuracy around 80% for both BNN and SVM methods for the United States and Taiwan markets. However, only slight improvement of SVM was observed. Another direction of the research is to improve the interpretability of the AI-based models. We applied recent research results in neural network model interpretation and obtained relative importance of the input fmancial variables from the neural network models. Based on these results, we conducted a market comparative analysis on the differences of determining factors in the United States and Taiwan markets. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

J	Lee, ISK; Lau, HYK				Lee, ISK; Lau, HYK			Adaptive state space partitioning for reinforcement learning	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						reinforcement learning; nearest neighbor quantizer; state space partitioning; peg-in-hole; navigation	TD(LAMBDA); CONVERGENCE	The convergence property of reinforcement learning has been extensively investigated in the field of machine learning, however, its applications to real-world problems are still constrained due to its computational complexity. A novel algorithm to improve the applicability and efficacy of reinforcement learning algorithms via adaptive state space partitioning is presented. The proposed temporal difference learning with adaptive vector quantization (TD-AVQ) is an online algorithm and does not assume any a priori knowledge with respect to the learning task and environment. It utilizes the information generated from the reinforcement learning algorithms. Therefore, no additional computations on the decisions of how to partition a particular state space are required. A series of simulations are provided to demonstrate the practical values and performance of the proposed algorithms in solving robot motion planning problems. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The concept of multidimensional category model is introduced for representing classes. In contrast with traditional flat and hierarchical category models, the multidimensional category model classifies each document using multiple predefined sets of categories, where each set corresponds to a dimension. Since a multidimensional model can be converted to flat and hierarchical models, three classification approaches are possible, i.e., classifying directly based on the multidimensional model and classifying with the equivalent flat or hierarchical models. The efficiency of these three approaches is investigated using drug information collection with two different dimensions: 1) drug topics and 2) primary therapeutic classes. In the experiments, k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, and two centroid-based methods are selected as classifiers. The comparisons among three approaches of classification are done using two-way analysis of variance, followed by the Scheffe's test for post hoc comparison. The experimental results show that multidimensional-based classification performs better than the others, especially in the presence of a relatively small training set. As one application, a category-based search engine using the multidimensional category concept was developed to help users retrieve drug information.

Active learning method facilitates identifying an optimal decision boundary for pattern classification in machine learning. The result of this method is compared with the standard active learning method that uses random sampling on the decision boundary hyperplane. The comparison is done through simulation and application to the real-world data from the UCI benchmark data set. The boundary is modeled as a nonseparable linear decision hyperplane in multidimensional space with a stochastic oracle.

J	Denoyer, L; Gallinari, P				Denoyer, L; Gallinari, P			Bayesian network model for semi-structured document classification	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						statistical learning; Bayesian networks; categorization; structured documents; XML; machine learning	CATEGORIZATION	Recently, a new community has started to emerge around the development of new information research methods for searching and analyzing semi-structured and XML like documents. The goal is to handle both content and structural information, and to deal with different types of information content (text, image, etc.). We consider here the task of structured document classification. We propose a generative model able to handle both structure and content which is based on Bayesian networks. We then show how to transform this generative model into a discriminant classifier using the method of Fisher kernel. The model is then extended for dealing with different types of content information (here text and images). The model was tested on three databases: the classical webKB corpus composed of HTML pages, the new INEX corpus which has become a reference in the field of ad-hoc retrieval for XML documents, and a multimedia corpus of Web pages.

Systems which can provide personalized product recommendations to their users (often called recommender systems) have gained a lot of interest in recent years. Collaborative filtering is one of the commonly used approaches which normally requires a definition of user similarity measure. In the literature, researchers have proposed different choices for the similarity measure using different approaches, and yet there is no guarantee for optimality. In this paper, we propose the use of machine learning techniques to learn the optimal user similarity measure as well as user rating styles for enhancing recommendation accuracy. Based on a criterion function measuring the overall prediction error, several ratings transformation functions for modeling rating styles together with their learning algorithms are derived. With the help of the formulation and the optimization framework, subjective components in user ratings are removed so that the transformed ratings can then be compared. We have evaluated our proposed methods using the EachMovie dataset and succeeded in obtaining significant improvement in recommendation accuracy when compared with the standard correlation-based algorithm.

To determine whether topographical measurements of the parapapillary region analyzed by machine learning classifiers can detect early to moderate glaucoma better than similarly processed measurements obtained within the disc margin and to improve methods for optimization of machine learning classifier feature selection. METHODS. One eye of each of 95 patients with early to moderate glaucomatous visual field damage and of each of 135 normal subjects older than 40 years participating in the longitudinal Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study ( DIGS) were included. Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT; Heidelberg Engineering, Dossenheim, Germany) mean height contour was measured in 36 equal sectors, both along the disc margin and in the parapapillary region ( at a mean contour line radius of 1.7 mm). Each sector was evaluated individually and in combination with other sectors. Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) learning classifiers were used to interpret HRT sector measurements along the disc margin and in the parapapillary region, to differentiate between eyes with normal and glaucomatous visual fields and to compare the results with global and regional HRT parameter measurements. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to measure diagnostic performance of the HRT parameters and to evaluate the cross-validation strategies and forward selection and backward elimination optimization techniques that were used to generate the reduced feature sets. RESULTS. The area under the ROC curve for mean height contour of the 36 sectors along the disc margin was larger than that for the mean height contour in the parapapillary region (0.97 and 0.85, respectively). Of the 36 individual sectors along the disc margin, those in the inferior region between 240degrees and 300degrees, had the largest area under the ROC curve ( 0.85 - 0.91). With SVM Gaussian techniques, the regional parameters showed the best ability to discriminate between normal eyes and eyes with glaucomatous visual field damage, followed by the global parameters, mean height contour measures along the disc margin, and mean height contour measures in the parapapillary region. The area under the ROC curve was 0.98, 0.94, 0.93, and 0.85, respectively. Cross-validation and optimization techniques demonstrated that good discrimination (99% of peak area under the ROC curve) can be obtained with a reduced number of HRT parameters. CONCLUSIONS. Mean height contour measurements along the disc margin discriminated between normal and glaucomatous eyes better than measurements obtained in the parapapillary region.

In this paper we show that a relatively simple molecular representation (using 14 variables) can be combined with leading edge machine learning algorithms to predict logP on new compounds more accurately than existing benchmark algorithms which use complex molecular representations.

J	Liu, Y				Liu, Y			A comparative study on feature selection methods for drug discovery	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article								Feature selection is frequently used as a preprocessing step to machine learning. The removal of irrelevant and redundant information often improves the performance of learning algorithms. This paper is a comparative study of feature selection in drug discovery. The focus is on aggressive dimensionality reduction. Five methods were evaluated, including information gain, mutual information, a chi(2)-test, odds ratio, and GSS coefficient. Two well-known classification algorithms, Naive Bayesian and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were used to classify the chemical compounds. The results showed that Maive Bayesian benefited significantly from the feature selection, while SVM performed better when all features were used. In this experiment, information gain and chi(2)-test were most effective feature selection methods. Using information gain with a Naive Bayesian classifier, removal of up to 96% of the features yielded an improved classification accuracy measured by sensitivity. When information gain was used to select the features, SVM was much less sensitive to the reduction of feature space. The feature set size was reduced by 99%, while losing only a few percent in terms of sensitivity (from 58.7% to 52.5%) and specificity (from 98.4% to 97.2%). In contrast to information gain and chi(2)-test, mutual information had relatively poor performance due to its bias toward favoring rare features and its sensitivity to probability estimation errors.
