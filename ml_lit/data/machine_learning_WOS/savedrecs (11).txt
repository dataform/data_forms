Philip			Extreme Learning Machine With Composite Kernels for Hyperspectral Image Classification	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Composite kernel (CK); extreme learning machine (ELM); hyperspectral image (HSI) classification	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; REMOTE-SENSING IMAGES; MARKOV RANDOM-FIELDS; MORPHOLOGICAL PROFILES; SPATIAL CLASSIFICATION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; APPROXIMATION; SELECTION; SVM	Due to its simple, fast, and good generalization ability, extreme learning machine (ELM) has recently drawn increasing attention in the pattern recognition and machine learning fields. To investigate the performance of ELM on the hyperspectral images (HSIs), this paper proposes two spatial-spectral composite kernel (CK) ELM classification methods. In the proposed CK framework, the single spatial or spectral kernel consists of activation-function-based kernel and general Gaussian kernel, respectively. The proposed methods inherit the advantages of ELM and have an analytic solution to directly implement the multiclass classification. Experimental results on three benchmark hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed ELM with CK methods outperform the general ELM, SVM, and SVM with CK methods.	[Zhou, Yicong; Chen, C. L.

Explaining Nonhabitual Transport Overcrowding With Internet Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Information extraction; machine learning; smartcards; special events; travel demand modeling; web mining	HUMAN MOBILITY	Public transport smartcard data can be used for detection of large crowds. By comparing statistics on habitual behavior (e.g., average by time of day), one can specifically identify nonhabitual crowds, which are often very problematic for transport systems. While habitual overcrowding (e.g., peak hour) is well understood both by traffic managers and travelers, nonhabitual overcrowding hotspots can become even more disruptive and unpleasant because they are generally unexpected. By quickly understanding such cases, a transport manager can react and mitigate transport system disruptions. We propose a probabilistic data analysis model that breaks each nonhabitual overcrowding hotspot into a set of explanatory components. The potential explanatory components are initially retrieved from social networks and special events websites and then processed through text-analysis techniques. Finally, for each such component, the probabilistic model estimates a specific share in the total overcrowding counts. We first validate with synthetic data and then test our model with real data from the public transport system (EZLink) of Singapore, focused on three case study areas. We demonstrate that it is able to generate explanations that are intuitively plausible and consistent both locally (correlation coefficient, i.e., CC, from 85% to 99% for the three areas) and globally (CC from 41.2% to 83.9%). This model is directly applicable to any other domain sensitive to crowd formation due to large social events (e.g., communications, water, energy, waste).

J	Dai, HL				Dai, Hong-Liang			Imbalanced Protein Data Classification Using Ensemble FTM-SVM	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NANOBIOSCIENCE			English	Article						Class imbalance; classification; ensemble; protein; support vector machine (SVM)	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; SEQUENCE; RECOGNITION; PERFORMANCE; NETWORKS; KERNELS	Classification of protein sequences into functional and structural families based on machine learning methods is a hot research topic in machine learning and Bioinformatics. In fact, the underlying protein classification problem is a huge multiclass problem. Generally, the multiclass problem can be reduced to a set of binary classification problems. The protein in one class are seen as positive examples while those outside the class are seen as negative examples. However, the class imbalance problem will arise in this case because the number of protein in one class is usually much smaller than that of the protein outside the class. To handle the challenge, we propose a novel framework to classify the protein. We firstly use free scores (FS) to perform feature extraction for protein; then, the inverse random under sampling (IRUS) is used to create a large number of distinct training sets; next, we use a new ensemble approach to combine these distinct training sets with a new fuzzy total margin support vector machine (FTM-SVM) that we have constructed. we call the novel ensemble classifier as ensemble fuzzy total margin support vector machine (EnFTM-SVM). We then give a full description of our method, including the details of its derivation. Finally, experimental results on fourteen benchmark protein data sets indicate that the proposed method outperforms many state-of-the-art protein classifying methods.

We apply machine learning to data describing the traits and zoonotic pathogen diversity of the most speciose group of mammals, the rodents, which also comprise a disproportionate number of zoonotic disease reservoirs. Our models predict reservoir status in this group with over 90% accuracy, identifying species with high probabilities of harboring undiscovered zoonotic pathogens based on trait profiles that may serve as rules of thumb to distinguish reservoirs from nonreservoir species. Key predictors of zoonotic reservoirs include biogeographical properties, such as range size, as well as intrinsic host traits associated with lifetime reproductive output. Predicted hotspots of novel rodent reservoir diversity occur in the Middle East and Central Asia and the Midwestern United States.

Despite the efforts, little is known on how we encode, maintain and retrieve information. One of the hypothesis assumes that transient states are generated in our intricate network of neurons when the brain is stimulated by a sensory input. Based on this idea, powerful computational schemes have been developed. These schemes, known as machine-learning techniques, include artificial neural networks, support vector machine and reservoir computing, among others. In this paper, we concentrate on the reservoir computing (RC) technique using delay-coupled systems. Unlike traditional RC, where the information is processed in large recurrent networks of interconnected artificial neurons, we choose a minimal design, implemented via a simple nonlinear dynamical system subject to a self-feedback loop with delay. This design is not intended to represent an actual brain circuit, but aims at finding the minimum ingredients that allow developing an efficient information processor. This simple scheme not only allows us to address fundamental questions but also permits simple hardware implementations. By reducing the neuro-inspired reservoir computing approach to its bare essentials, we find that nonlinear transient responses of the simple dynamical system enable the processing of information with excellent performance and at unprecedented speed. We specifically explore different hardware implementations and, by that, we learn about the role of nonlinearity, noise, system responses, connectivity structure, and the quality of projection onto the required high-dimensional state space. Besides the relevance for the understanding of basic mechanisms, this scheme opens direct technological opportunities that could not be addressed with previous approaches.

However, the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) was not widely used, and the classification performance did not reach the standard of practical use. We proposed a novel CAD system for MR brain images based on eigenbrains and machine learning with two goals: accurate detection of both AD subjects and AD-related brain regions. Method: First, we used maximum inter-class variance (ICV) to select key slices from 3D volumetric data. Second, we generated an eigenbrain set for each subject. Third, the most important eigenbrain (MIE) was obtained by Welch's t-test (WTT). Finally, kernel support-vector-machines with different kernels that were trained by particle swarm optimization, were used to make an accurate prediction of AD subjects. Coefficients of MIE with values higher than 0.98 quantile were highlighted to obtain the discriminant regions that distinguish AD from NC. Results: The experiments showed that the proposed method can predict AD subjects with a competitive performance with existing methods, especially the accuracy of the polynomial kernel (92.36 +/- 0.94) was better than the linear kernel of 91.47 +/- 1.02 and the radial basis function (RBF) kernel of 86.71 +/- 1.93. The proposed eigenbrain-based CAD system detected 30 AD-related brain regions (Anterior Cingulate, Caudate Nucleus, Cerebellum, Cingulate Gyrus, Claustrum, Inferior Frontal Gyrus, Inferior Parietal Lobule, lnsula, Lateral Ventricle, Lentiform Nucleus, Lingual Gyrus, Medial Frontal Gyrus, Middle Frontal Gyrus, Middle Occipital Gyrus, Middle Temporal Gyrus, Paracentral Lobule, Parahippocampal Gyrus, Postcentral Gyrus, Posterial Cingulate, Precentral Gyrus, Precuneus, Subcallosal Gyrus, Sub-Gyral, Superior Frontal Gyrus, Superior Parietal Lobule, Superior Temporal Gyrus, Supramarginal Gyrus, Thalamus, Transverse Temporal Gyrus, and Uncus). The results were coherent with existing literatures. Conclusion: The eigenbrain method was effective in AD subject prediction and discriminant brain-region detection in MRI scanning.

The main challenge is to determine the splice sites in the coding region. Due to the intrinsic complexity and the uncertainty in gene sequence, the adoption of data mining methods is increasingly becoming popular. There are various methods developed on different strategies in this direction. This article focuses on the construction of new hybrid machine learning ensembles that solve the splice junction task more effectively. A novel supervised feature reduction technique is developed using entropy-based fuzzy rough set theory optimized by greedy hill-climbing algorithm. The average prediction accuracy achieved is above 98% with 95% confidence interval. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated using various metrics to establish the statistical significance of the results. The experiments are conducted using various schemes with human DNA sequence data. The obtained results are highly promising as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches in literature.

With modern high-density EMG sensor technology, it is possible to capture the rich spectrospatial structure of the myoelectric activity. We hypothesize that multi-way machine learning methods can efficiently utilize this structure in classification as well as reveal interesting patterns in it. To this end, we investigate the suitability of existing three-way classification methods to EMG-based hand movement classification in spectrospatial domain, as well as extend these methods by sparsification and regularization. We propose to use Fourier-domain independent component analysis as preprocessing to improve classification and interpretability of the results. In high-density EMG experiments on hand movements across 10 subjects, three-way classification yielded higher average performance compared with state-of-the art classification based on temporal features, suggesting that the three-way analysis approach can efficiently utilize detailed spectrospatial information of high-density EMG. Phase and amplitude patterns of features selected by the classifier in finger-movement data were found to be consistent with known physiology. Thus, our approach can accurately resolve hand and finger movements on the basis of detailed spectrospatial information, and at the same time allows for physiological interpretation of the results.

J	Omrani, H; Abdallah, F; Charif, O; Longford, NT				Omrani, Hichem; Abdallah, Fahed; Charif, Omar; Longford, Nicholas T.			Multi-label class assignment in land-use modelling	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						land-use modelling; multi-label; machine learning; geographic information systems	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; NEURAL-NETWORKS; GIS; CLASSIFICATION; VALIDATION; DYNAMICS; AREAS; SCALE	During the last two decades, a variety of models have been applied to understand and predict changes in land use. These models assign a single-attribute label to each spatial unit at any particular time of the simulation. This is not realistic because mixed use of land is quite common. A more detailed classification allowing the modelling of mixed land use would be desirable for better understanding and interpreting the evolution of the use of land. A possible solution is the multi-label (ML) concept where each spatial unit can belong to multiple classes simultaneously. For example, a cluster of summer houses at a lake in a forested area should be classified as water, forest and residential (built-up). The ML concept was introduced recently, and it belongs to the machine learning field. In this article, the ML concept is introduced and applied in land-use modelling. As a novelty, we present a land-use change model that allows ML class assignment using the k nearest neighbour (kNN) method that derives a functional relationship between land use and a set of explanatory variables. A case study with a rich data-set from Luxembourg using biophysical data from aerial photography is described. The model achieves promising results based on the well-known ML evaluation criteria. The application described in this article highlights the value of the multi-label k nearest neighbour method (MLkNN) for land-use modelling.

Corresponding model is difficult to establish and effectively predicted using the traditional methods based on statistical and machine learning. Characteristics of internet public opinion are chaotic, so the chaos theory can be introduced to research first, then the information of internet public opinion having chaotic characteristic is proved by the Lyapunov index. The model to predict the development trend of internet public opinion is next established by the phase space reconstruction theory. Finally, the hybrid algorithm EMPSO-RBF which is based on EM algorithm and the RBF neural network optimized by the improved PSO algorithm is proposed to solve the model. The hybrid algorithm fully takes the advantage of the EM clustering algorithm and the improved PSO, so the RBF neural network is improved by initializing the network structure in the early stage and optimizing the network parameters later. First, the EM clustering algorithm is used to obtain the center value and variance, and the radial basis function is improved with the combination of traditional Gauss model. Then the relevant network parameters are obtained by the improved PSO algorithm which is based on error optimizing the network parameters constantly. The model algorithm can be accurately simulated in the time series of chaotic information by experiments which are validated by different chaotic time series information; and it can better describe the development trend of different information of internet public opinion. The predicted results are made for government to monitor and guide the information of internet public opinion and benefit the social harmony and stability.

Compared with the labor-intensive and time-consuming experimental approaches, computational predictions of succinylation sites are much desirable due to their convenient and fast speed. Currently, numerous computational models have been developed to identify PTMs sites through various types of two-class machine learning algorithms. These methods require both positive and negative samples for training. However, designation of the negative samples of PTMs was difficult and if it is not properly done can affect the performance of computational models dramatically. So that in this work, we implemented the first application of positive samples only learning (PSoL) algorithm to succinylation sites prediction problem, which was a special class of semi-supervised machine learning that used positive samples and unlabeled samples to train the model. Meanwhile, we proposed a novel succinylation sites computational predictor called SucPred (succinylation site predictor) by using multiple feature encoding schemes. Promising results were obtained by the SucPred predictor with an accuracy of 88.65% using 5-fold cross validation on the training dataset and an accuracy of 84.40% on the independent testing dataset, which demonstrated that the positive samples only learning algorithm presented here was particularly useful for identification of protein succinylation sites. Besides, the positive samples only learning algorithm can be applied to build predictors for other types of PTMs sites with ease. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper presents machine-learning based methods for identifying brain states induced by realistic VEs with improved accuracy as well as the capability for mapping their spatial topography on the neocortex. VEs provide the ability to study the brain under conditions closer to the environment in which humans evolved, and thus to probe deeper into the complexities of human cognition. As a test case, we designed a stimulus to reflect a military combat situation in the Middle East, motivated by the potential of using real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. Each subject experienced moving through the virtual town where they encountered 1-6 animated combatants at different locations, while fMRI data was collected. To analyze the data from what is, compared to most studies, more complex and less controlled stimuli, we employed statistical machine learning in the form of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA) with special attention given to artificial Neural Networks (NN). Extensions to NN that exploit the block structure of the stimulus were developed to improve the accuracy of the classification, achieving performances from 58 to 93% (chance was 16.7%) with six subjects. This demonstrates that MVPA can decode a complex cognitive state, viewing a number of characters, in a dynamic virtual environment. To better understand the source of this information in the brain, a novel form of sensitivity analysis was developed to use NN to quantify the degree to which each voxel contributed to classification. Compared with maps produced by general linear models and the searchlight approach, these sensitivity maps revealed a more diverse pattern of information relevant to the classification of cognitive state.

Vetting candidate signals manually by inspecting light curves and other diagnostic information is a labor intensive effort. Additionally, this classification methodology does not yield any information about the quality of PCs; all candidates are as credible as any other. The torrent of exoplanet discoveries will continue after Kepler, because a number of exoplanet surveys will have an even broader search area. This paper presents the application of machine-learning techniques to the classification of the exoplanet transit-like signals present in the Kepler light curve data. Transit-like detections are transformed into a uniform set of real-numbered attributes, the most important of which are described in this paper. Each of the known transit-like detections is assigned a class of PC; astrophysical false positive; or systematic, instrumental noise. We use a random forest algorithm to learn the mapping from attributes to classes on this training set. The random forest algorithm has been used previously to classify variable stars; this is the first time it has been used for exoplanet classification. We are able to achieve an overall error rate of 5.85% and an error rate for classifying exoplanets candidates of 2.81%.

Data augmentation makes a training sample more closely resemble a test sample, if the two base samples differ, in order to improve measured statistics of the test sample. We perform two sets of analyses by selecting 800 000 (1.7 million) Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8 (Data Release 10) galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. We construct a base training set by imposing an artificial r-band apparent magnitude cut to select only bright galaxies and then augment this base training set by using simulations and by applying the K-CORRECT package to artificially place training set galaxies at a higher redshift. We obtain redshift estimates for the remaining faint galaxy sample, which are not used during training. We find that data augmentation reduces the error on the recovered redshifts by 40 per cent in both sets of analyses, when compared to the difference in error between the ideal case and the non-augmented case. The outlier fraction is also reduced by at least 10 per cent and up to 80 per cent using data augmentation. We finally quantify how the recovered redshifts degrade as one probes to deeper magnitudes past the artificial magnitude limit of the bright training sample. We find that at all apparent magnitudes explored, the use of data augmentation with tree-based methods provide an estimate of the galaxy redshift with a low value of bias, although the error on the recovered redshifts increases as we probe to deeper magnitudes. These results have applications for surveys which have a spectroscopic training set which forms a biased sample of all photometric galaxies, for example if the spectroscopic detection magnitude limit is shallower than the photometric limit.

Many computational approaches have been developed to predict the regulatory regions using various genomic features such as sequence motifs and evolutionary conservation. However, these DNA sequence-based approaches do not reflect the tissue-specific nature of the regulatory regions. In this work, we propose to predict regulatory regions using multiple features derived from DNA methylation profile. Results: We discovered several interesting features of the methylated CpG (mCpG) sites within regulatory regions. First, a hypomethylation status of CpGs within regulatory regions, compared to the genomic background methylation level, extended out > 1000 bp from the center of the regulatory regions, demonstrating a high degree of correlation between the methylation statuses of neighboring mCpG sites. Second, when a regulatory region was inactive, as determined by histone mark differences between cell lines, methylation level of the mCpG site increased from a hypomethylated state to a hypermethylated state, the level of which was even higher than the genomic background. Third, a distinct set of sequence motifs was overrepresented surrounding mCpG sites within regulatory regions. Using 5 types of features derived from DNA methylation profiles, we were able to predict promoters and enhancers using machine-learning approach (support vector machine). The performances for prediction of promoters and enhancers are quite well, showing an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.992 and 0.817, respectively, which is better than that simply based on methylation level, especially for prediction of enhancers. Conclusions: Our study suggests that DNA methylation features of mCpG sites can be used to predict regulatory regions.

J	Mohammed, A; Guda, C				Mohammed, Akram; Guda, Chittibabu			Application of a hierarchical enzyme classification method reveals the role of gut microbiome in human metabolism	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article							INFLAMMATORY-BOWEL-DISEASE; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; DATABASE; PROTEIN; OBESITY; SUBCLASSES; PREDICTION; BACTERIA	Background: Enzymes are known as the molecular machines that drive the metabolism of an organism; hence identification of the full enzyme complement of an organism is essential to build the metabolic blueprint of that species as well as to understand the interplay of multiple species in an ecosystem. Experimental characterization of the enzymatic reactions of all enzymes in a genome is a tedious and expensive task. The problem is more pronounced in the metagenomic samples where even the species are not adequately cultured or characterized. Enzymes encoded by the gut microbiota play an essential role in the host metabolism; thus, warranting the need to accurately identify and annotate the full enzyme complements of species in the genomic and metagenomic projects. To fulfill this need, we develop and apply a method called ECemble, an ensemble approach to identify enzymes and enzyme classes and study the human gut metabolic pathways. Results: ECemble method uses an ensemble of machine-learning methods to accurately model and predict enzymes from protein sequences and also identifies the enzyme classes and subclasses at the finest resolution. A tenfold cross-validation result shows accuracy between 97 and 99% at different levels in the hierarchy of enzyme classification, which is superior to comparable methods. We applied ECemble to predict the entire complements of enzymes from ten sequenced proteomes including the human proteome. We also applied this method to predict enzymes encoded by the human gut microbiome from gut metagenomic samples, and to study the role played by the microbe-derived enzymes in the human metabolism. After mapping the known and predicted enzymes to canonical human pathways, we identified 48 pathways that have at least one bacteria-encoded enzyme, which demonstrates the complementary role of gut microbiome in human gut metabolism. These pathways are primarily involved in metabolizing dietary nutrients such as carbohydrates, amino acids, lipids, cofactors and vitamins. Conclusions: The ECemble method is able to hierarchically assign high quality enzyme annotations to genomic and metagenomic data. This study demonstrated the real application of ECemble to understand the indispensable role played by microbe-encoded enzymes in the healthy functioning of human metabolic systems.

Until now, existing studies formulated GS as the problem of modeling an individual's breeding value for a particular trait of interest, i.e., as a regression problem. To assess predictive accuracy of the model, the Pearson correlation between observed and predicted trait values was used. Contributions In this paper, we propose to formulate GS as the problem of ranking individuals according to their breeding value. Our proposed framework allows us to employ machine learning methods for ranking which had previously not been considered in the GS literature. To assess ranking accuracy of a model, we introduce a new measure originating from the information retrieval literature called normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG). NDCG rewards more strongly models which assign a high rank to individuals with high breeding value. Therefore, NDCG reflects a prerequisite objective in selective breeding: accurate selection of individuals with high breeding value. Results We conducted a comparison of 10 existing regression methods and 3 new ranking methods on 6 datasets, consisting of 4 plant species and 25 traits. Our experimental results suggest that tree-based ensemble methods including McRank, Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Regression Trees achieve excellent ranking accuracy. RKHS regression and RankSVM also achieve good accuracy when used with an RBF kernel. Traditional regression methods such as Bayesian lasso, wBSR and BayesC were found less suitable for ranking. Pearson correlation was found to correlate poorly with NDCG. Our study suggests two important messages. First, ranking methods are a promising research direction in GS. Second, NDCG can be a useful evaluation measure for GS.

Owing to the complexity of the disease, its root cause still remains unclear. The existing anti-Alzheimer's drugs are unable to cure the disease while the current therapeutic options have provided only limited help in restoring moderate memory and remain ineffective at restricting the disease's progression. The striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) has been shown to be involved in the internalization of the receptor, N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDR) and thus is associated with the disease. The present study was performed using machine learning algorithms, docking protocol and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to develop STEP inhibitors, which could be novel anti-Alzheimer's molecules. Methods The present study deals with the generation of computational predictive models based on chemical descriptors of compounds using machine learning approaches followed by substructure fragment analysis. To perform this analysis, the 2D molecular descriptors were generated and machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Sequential Minimization Optimization) were utilized. The binding mechanisms and the molecular interactions between the predicted active compounds and the target protein were modelled using docking methods. Further, the stability of the protein-ligand complex was evaluated using MD simulation studies. The substructure fragment analysis was performed using Substructure fingerprint (SubFp), which was further explored using a predefined dictionary. Results The present study demonstrates that the computational methodology used can be employed to examine the biological activities of small molecules and prioritize them for experimental screening. Large unscreened chemical libraries can be screened to identify potential novel hits and accelerate the drug discovery process. Additionally, the chemical libraries can be searched for significant substructure patterns as reported in the present study, thus possibly contributing to the activity of these molecules.

Early detection and effective treatment is the only rescue to reduce breast cancer mortality. Accurate classification of a breast cancer tumor is an important task in medical diagnosis. Machine learning techniques are gaining importance in medical diagnosis because of their classification capability. In this paper, we propose a new, Genetically Optimized Neural Network (GONN) algorithm, for solving classification problems. We evolve a neural network genetically to optimize its architecture (structure and weight) for classification. We introduce new crossover and mutation operators which differ from standard crossover and mutation operators to reduce the destructive nature of these operators. We use the GONN algorithm to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant. To demonstrate our results, we had taken the WBCD database from UCI Machine Learning repository and compared the classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrix, ROC curves and AUC under ROC curves of GONN with classical model and classical back propagation model. Our algorithm gives classification accuracy of 98.24%, 99.63% and 100% for 50-50, 60-40, 70-30 training-testing partition respectively and 100% for 10 fold cross validation. The results show that our approach works well with the breast cancer database and can be a good alternative to the well-known machine learning methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Social lending has gained significant momentum recently, with some platforms reaching multi-billion dollar loan circulation in a short amount of time. On the other hand, sustainability and possible widespread adoption of such platforms depend heavily on reliable risk attribution to individual borrowers. For this purpose, we propose a random forest (RF) based classification method for predicting borrower status. Our results on data from the popular social lending platform Lending Club (LC) indicate the RF-based method outperforms the FICO credit scores as well as LC grades in identification of good borrowers.

Therefore, feature selection has become a necessary step to make the analysis more manageable and to extract useful knowledge about a given domain. A large variety of feature selection techniques are available in literature, and their comparative analysis is a very difficult task. So far, few studies have investigated, from a theoretical and/or experimental point of view, the degree of similarity/dissimilarity among the available techniques, namely the extent to which they tend to produce similar results within specific application contexts. This kind of similarity analysis is of crucial importance when two or more methods are combined in an ensemble fashion: indeed the ensemble paradigm is beneficial only if the involved methods are capable of giving different and complementary representations of the considered domain. This paper gives a contribution in this direction by proposing an empirical approach to evaluate the degree of consistency among the outputs of different selection algorithms in the context of high dimensional classification tasks. Leveraging on a proper similarity index, we systematically compared the feature subsets selected by eight popular selection methods, representatives of different selection approaches, and derived a similarity trend for feature subsets of increasing size. Through an extensive experimentation involving sixteen datasets from three challenging domains (Internet advertisements, text categorization and micro-array data classification), we obtained useful insight into the pattern of agreement of the considered methods. In particular, our results revealed how multivariate selection approaches systematically produce feature subsets that overlap to a small extent with those selected by the other methods.

Modeling of steelmaking process with effective machine learning techniques	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Steelmaking process; Modeling; Prediction; Random forests; Support vector regression; Artificial neural networks; Dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system; 5-Fold cross validation	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; RANDOM FORESTS; LEVENBERG-MARQUARDT; DATA CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; PREDICTION; REGRESSION; PARAMETERS	Monitoring and control of the output yield of steel in a steelmaking shop plays a critical role in steel industry. The yield of steel determines how much percentage of hot metal, scrap, and iron ore are being converted into steel ingots. It represents the operational efficiency of the steelmaking shop and is considered as an important performance measure for producing a specific quantity of steel. Due to complexity of the steelmaking process and nonlinear relationship between the process parameters, modeling the input-output process parameters and accurately predicting the output yield in the steelmaking shop is very difficult and has been a major research issue. Statistical models and artificial neural networks (ANN) have been extensively studied by researchers and practitioners to model a variety of complex processes. In the present study, we consider random forests (RF), ANN, dynamic evolving neuro-fuzzy inference system (DENFIS) and support vector regression (SVR) as competitive learning tools to verify the suitability of applications of these approaches and investigate their comparative predictive ability. In the present investigation, 0.00001 of MSE is set as a goal of learning during modeling. Based on real-life data, the computational results depict that the training and testing MSE values of SVR and DENFIS are close to 0.00001 indicating that they have higher prediction ability than ANN and RF. Also, mean absolute percentage prediction errors of the proposed models confirm that the predicted yield based on each method is in good agreement with the testing datasets. Overall, SVR performs best and DENFIS the next best followed by ANN and RF methods respectively. The results suggest that the prediction precision given by SVR can meet the requirement for the actual production of steel. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Braida, F; Mello, CE; Pasinato, MB; Zimbrao, G				Braida, Filipe; Mello, Carlos E.; Pasinato, Marden B.; Zimbrao, Geraldo			Transforming collaborative filtering into supervised learning	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Recommender system; Collaborative filtering; Dimensionality reduction; Supervised learning	RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS	Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a well-known approach for Recommender Systems (RS). This approach extrapolates rating predictions from ratings given by user on items, which are represented by a user-item matrix filled with a rating r(fJ) given by an user i on an item j. Therefore, CF has been confined to this data structure relying mostly on adaptations of supervised learning methods to deal with rating predictions and matrix decomposition schemes to complete unfilled positions of the rating matrix. Although there have been proposals to apply Machine Learning (ML) to RS, these works had to transform the rating matrix into the typical Supervised Learning (SL) data set, i.e., a set of pairwise tuples (x,y), where y is the correspondent class (the rating) of the instance x is an element of R-k. So far, the proposed transformations were thoroughly crafted using the domain information. However, in many applications this kind of information can be incomplete, uncertain or stated in ways that are not machine-readable. Even when it is available, its usage can be very complex requiring specialists to craft the transformation. In this context, this work proposes a domain-independent transformation from the rating matrix representation to a supervised learning dataset that enables SL methods to be fully explored in RS. In addition, our transformation is said to be straightforward, in the sense that, it is an automatic process that any lay person can perform requiring no domain specialist. Our experiments have proven that our transformation, combined with SL methods, have greatly outperformed classical CF methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Structure classification and melting temperature prediction in octet AB solids via machine learning	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							SEMICONDUCTOR EFFECTIVE CHARGES; FUNCTIONAL PERTURBATION-THEORY; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; BINARY COMPOUNDS; POLARIZATION; POINTS; MODEL; CONSTANTS; ALLOYS; SCALE	Machine learning methods are being increasingly used in condensed matter physics and materials science to classify crystals structures and predict material properties. However, the reliability of these methods for a given problem, especially when large data sets are unavailable, has not been well studied. By addressing the tasks of classifying crystal structure and predicting melting temperatures of the octet subset of AB solids, we performed such a study and found potential problems with using machine learning methods on relatively small data sets. At the same time, however, we can reaffirm the potential power of such methods for these tasks. In particular, we uncovered an important new material feature, the excess Born effective charge, that significantly increased the accuracy of the predictions for the classification problem we defined. This discovery leads us to propose a new scale for the degree of ionicity and covalency in these solids. More specifically, we partitioned the crystal structures of a set of 75 octet solids into those that are ionic and covalent bonded and thus performed a binary classification task. We found that using the standard indices (r(sigma), r(pi)), suggested by St. John and Bloch several decades ago, enabled an average success in classification of 92%. Using just r(sigma) and the excess Born effective charge Delta Z(A) of the A atom enabled an average success of 97%, but we also found relatively large variations about these averages that were dependent on how certain machine learning methods were used and for which a standard deviation was not a proper measure of the degree of confidence we can place in either average. Instead, we calculated and report with 95% confidence that the traditional classification pair predicts an accuracy in the interval [89%, 95%] and the accuracy of the new pair lies in the interval [96%, 99%]. For melting temperature predictions, the size of our data set was 46. We estimate the root-mean-squared error of our resulting model to be 11% of the mean melting temperature of the data, but we note that if the accuracy of this predicted error is itself measured, our estimated fitting error itself has a root-mean-square error of 50%. In short, what we illustrate is that classification and regression predictions can vary significantly, depending on the details of how machine learning methods are applied to small data sets. This variation makes it important, if not essential, to average the predictions and compute confidence intervals about these averages to report results meaningfully. However, when properly used, these statistical methods can advance our understanding and improve predictions of material properties even for small data sets.

A.; Fu, Yan			Predicting Positive and Negative Relationships in Large Social Networks	PLOS ONE			English	Article							STRUCTURAL BALANCE; LINK-PREDICTION; EMBEDDEDNESS	In a social network, users hold and express positive and negative attitudes (e.g. support/opposition) towards other users. Those attitudes exhibit some kind of binary relationships among the users, which play an important role in social network analysis. However, some of those binary relationships are likely to be latent as the scale of social network increases. The essence of predicting latent binary relationships have recently began to draw researchers' attention. In this paper, we propose a machine learning algorithm for predicting positive and negative relationships in social networks inspired by structural balance theory and social status theory. More specifically, we show that when two users in the network have fewer common neighbors, the prediction accuracy of the relationship between them deteriorates. Accordingly, in the training phase, we propose a segment-based training framework to divide the training data into two subsets according to the number of common neighbors between users, and build a prediction model for each subset based on support vector machine (SVM). Moreover, to deal with large-scale social network data, we employ a sampling strategy that selects small amount of training data while maintaining high accuracy of prediction. We compare our algorithm with traditional algorithms and adaptive boosting of them. Experimental results of typical data sets show that our algorithm can deal with large social networks and consistently outperforms other methods.

In particular, we are often interested in the fraction of each parent's genome that comes from specific ancestries (e.g. European, African, Native American, etc). This has many applications ranging from understanding the inheritance of ancestry-related risks and traits to quantifying human assortative mating patterns. Results: We model the problem of parental genomic ancestry inference as a pooled semi-Markov process. We develop a general mathematical framework for pooled semi-Markov processes and construct efficient inference algorithms for these models. Applying our inference algorithm to genotype data from 231 Mexican trios and 258 Puerto Rican trios where we have the true genomic ancestry of each parent, we demonstrate that our method accurately infers parameters of the semi-Markov processes and parents' genomic ancestries. We additionally validated the method on simulations. Our model of pooled semi-Markov process and inference algorithms may be of independent interest in other settings in genomics and machine learning.

The main challenge lies in intelligently integrating the actions of all users connected to the grid. In this context, electricity load forecasting methodologies is a key component for demand-side management. This research compares the accuracy of different Machine Learning methodologies for the hourly energy forecasting in buildings. The main goal of this work is to demonstrate the performance of these models and their scalability for different consumption profiles. We propose a hybrid methodology that combines feature selection based on entropies with soft computing and machine learning approaches, he. Fuzzy Inductive Reasoning, Random Forest and Neural Networks. They are also compared with a traditional statistical technique ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average). In addition, in contrast to the general approaches where offline modelling takes considerable time, the approaches discussed in this work generate fast and reliable models, with low computational costs. These approaches could be embedded, for instance, in a second generation of smart meters, where they could generate on-site electricity forecasting of the next hours, or even trade the excess of energy.

UPP produces highly accurate alignments for both nucleotide and amino acid sequences, even on ultra-large datasets or datasets containing fragmentary sequences.

Aiming toward this goal, we develop and apply a systematic hierarchy of efficient empirical methods to estimate atomization and total energies of molecules. These methods range from a simple sum over atoms, to addition of bond energies, to pairwise interatomic force fields, reaching to the more sophisticated machine learning approaches that are capable of describing collective interactions between many atoms or bonds. In the case of equilibrium molecular geometries, even simple pairwise force fields demonstrate prediction accuracy comparable to benchmark energies calculated using density functional theory with hybrid exchange-correlation functionals; however, accounting for the collective many-body interactions proves to be essential for approaching the "holy grail" of chemical accuracy of 1 kcal/mol for both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium geometries. This remarkable accuracy is achieved by a vectorized representation of molecules (so-called Bag of Bonds model) that exhibits strong nonlocality in chemical space. In addition, the same representation allows us to predict accurate electronic properties of molecules, such as their polarizability and molecular frontier orbital energies.

R. palustris was grown in flow cell chambers with identical medium conditions either in the presence or absence of light and oxygen. In the absence of oxygen and the presence of light, R. palustris grew and formed biofilms photoheterotrophically, and in the presence of oxygen and the absence of light, R. palustris grew and formed biofilms heterotrophically. We used confocal laser scanning microscopy and image analysis software to quantitatively analyze and compare R. palustris biofilm formation over time in these two metabolic modes. We describe quantifiable differences in structure between the biofilms formed by the bacterium grown heterotrophically and those grown photoheterotrophically. We developed a computational model to explore ways in which biotic and abiotic parameters could drive the observed biofilm architectures, as well as a random-forest machine-learning algorithm based on structural differences that was able to identify growth conditions from the confocal imaging of the biofilms with 87% accuracy. Insight into the structure of phototrophic biofilms and conditions that influence biofilm formation is relevant for understanding the generation of biofilm structures with different properties, and for optimizing applications with phototrophic bacteria growing in the biofilm state.

In addition to that, it was conducted to propose approaches for emotion recognition based on physiological signals. Methods: Three emotions, boredom, pain, and surprise, are induced through the presentation of emotional stimuli and electrocardiography (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature (SKT), and photoplethysmography (PPG) as physiological signals are measured to collect a dataset from 217 participants when experiencing the emotions. Twenty-seven physiological features are extracted from the signals to classify the three emotions. The discriminant function analysis (DFA) as a statistical method, and five machine learning algorithms (linear discriminant analysis (LDA), classification and regression trees (CART), self-organizing map (SOM), Naive Bayes algorithm, and support vector machine (SVM)) are used for classifying the emotions. Results: The result shows that the difference of physiological responses among emotions is significant in heart rate (HR), skin conductance level (SCL), skin conductance response (SCR), mean skin temperature (meanSKT), blood volume pulse (BVP), and pulse transit time (PTT), and the highest recognition accuracy of 84.7 % is obtained by using DFA. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the differences of boredom, pain, and surprise and the best emotion recognizer for the classification of the three emotions by using physiological signals.

A cognitive radio node senses the environment, analyzes the outdoor parameters, and then makes decisions for dynamic time-frequency-space resource allocation and management to improve the utilization of the radio spectrum. For efficient real-time process, the cognitive radio is usually combined with artificial intelligence and machine-learning techniques so that an adaptive and intelligent allocation is achieved. This paper firstly presents the cognitive radio networks, resources, objectives, constraints, and challenges. Then, it introduces artificial intelligence and machine-learning techniques and emphasizes the role of learning in cognitive radios. Then, a survey on the state-of-the-art of machine-learning techniques in cognitive radios is presented. The literature survey is organized based on different artificial intelligence techniques such as fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, neural networks, game theory, reinforcement learning, support vector machine, case-based reasoning, entropy, Bayesian, Markov model, multi-agent systems, and artificial bee colony algorithm. This paper also discusses the cognitive radio implementation and the learning challenges foreseen in cognitive radio applications.

Recent genome-wide chromatin states mapping efforts revealed that DNA elements are associated with characteristic chromatin modification signatures, based on which several approaches have been developed to predict transcriptional enhancers. However, their practical application is limited by incomplete extraction of chromatin features and model inconsistency for predicting enhancers across different cell types. To address these issues, we define a set of non-redundant shape features of histone modifications, which shows high consistency across cell types and can greatly reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors. Integrating shape features with a machine-learning algorithm AdaBoost, we developed an enhancer predicting method, DELTA (Distal Enhancer Locating Tool based on AdaBoost). We show that DELTA significantly outperforms current enhancer prediction methods in prediction accuracy on different datasets and can predict enhancers in one cell type using models trained in other cell types without loss of accuracy. Overall, our study presents a novel framework for accurately identifying enhancers from epigenetic data across multiple cell types.

How to represent and measure similarity appropriately is a pursuit of many researchers. Many tasks, such as classification and clustering, can be accomplished perfectly when a similarity metric is well-defined. Cosine similarity is a widely used metric that is both simple and effective. This paper proposes a cosine similarity ensemble (CSE) method for learning similarity. In CSE, diversity is guaranteed by using multiple cosine similarity learners, each of which makes use of a different initial point to define the pattern vectors used in its similarity measures. The CSE method is not limited to measuring similarity using only pattern vectors that start at the origin. In addition, the thresholds of these separate cosine similarity learners are adaptively determined. The idea of using a selective ensemble is also implemented in CSE, and the proposed CSE method outperforms other compared methods on various data sets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In theory, this problem can be solved by the natural convex joint/mixed relaxations (i.e., l(1)-norm and trace norm) under certain conditions. However, all current provable algorithms suffer from superlinear per-iteration cost, which severely limits their applicability to large-scale problems. In this paper, we propose a scalable, provable and structured robust bilinear factorization (RBF) method to recover low-rank and sparse matrices from missing and grossly corrupted data, i.e., robust matrix completion (RMC), or incomplete and grossly corrupted measurements, i.e., compressive principal component pursuit (CPCP). Specifically, we first present two small-scale matrix trace norm regularized bilinear factorization models for RMC and CPCP problems, in which repetitively calculating SVD of a large-scale matrix is replaced by updating two much smaller factor matrices. Then, we apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to efficiently solve the RMC problems. Finally, we provide the convergence analysis of our algorithm, and extend it to address general CPCP problems. Experimental results verified both the efficiency and effectiveness of our method compared with the state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This paradigm shift necessitates a change in the acceptance criteria and action tolerance for QA. Here we present a knowledge based technique to objectively quantify degradations in DVH for prostate radiotherapy. Using machine learning, organ-at-risk (OAR) DVHs from a population of 198 prior patients' plans were adapted to a test patient's anatomy to establish patient-specific DVH ranges. This technique was applied to single arc prostate VMAT plans to evaluate various simulated delivery errors: systematic single leaf offsets, systematic leaf bank offsets, random normally distributed leaf fluctuations, systematic lag in gantry angle of the mutli-leaf collimators (MLCs), fluctuations in dose rate, and delivery of each VMAT arc with a constant rather than variable dose rate. Quantitative Analyses of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic suggests V-75Gy dose limits of 15% for the rectum and 25% for the bladder, however the knowledge based constraints were more stringent: 8.48 +/- 2.65% for the rectum and 4.90 +/- 1.98% for the bladder. 19 +/- 10 mm single leaf and 1.9 +/- 0.7 mm single bank offsets resulted in rectum DVHs worse than 97.7% (2 sigma) of clinically accepted plans. PTV degradations fell outside of the acceptable range for 0.6 +/- 0.3 mm leaf offsets, 0.11 +/- 0.06 mm bank offsets, 0.6 +/- 1.3 mm of random noise, and 1.0 +/- 0.7 degrees of gantry-MLC lag. Utilizing a training set comprised of prior treatment plans, machine learning is used to predict a range of achievable DVHs for the test patient's anatomy. Consequently, degradations leading to statistical outliers may be identified. A knowledge based QA evaluation enables customized QA criteria per treatment site, institution and/or physician and can often be more sensitive to errors than criteria based on organ complication rates.

However most works are focused on the classification techniques and less are devoted to regression models. In this paper to adapt indefinite kernels to ridge regression model, an indefinite kernel ridge regression model is proposed. Instead of performing spectral transformation on the kernel matrix, a less restrictive semi-definite proxy kernel can be constructed to approximate the kernel which normally is positive semi-definite. The sensitivity of the distance between this indefinite kernel and the proxy kernel is controlled by a parameter rho. This approach allows one to construct regression models of response values based on the similarities of corresponding objects, where the requirement on similarity measures to satisfy Mercers condition can be relaxed. To illustrate the use of this algorithm, it was applied to the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modelling over 16 drug targets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Concept-drift is the change in the underlying concept and occurs in almost every data stream. Concept-evolution, in fact, is the arrival of novel classes and is an undeniable phenomenon in most real world data streams. There are lots of researches about data stream classification, but most of them focus on the first two challenges and ignore the last one. In this paper, we propose new method based on ensembles whose classifiers use local patterns to enhance the accuracy. Local pattern is a group of Boolean features which have local influence on ordinal and categorical features. Also, in order to enhance the accuracy of novel class detection we construct a neighborhood graph among novel class candidates and analyze connected components of the constructed graph. Experiments on both real and synthetic benchmark data sets show the superiority of the proposed method over the related state-of-the-art techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Unfortunately, there has been little effort to unite those methods and software into one package. We here describe the Open Drug Discovery Toolkit (ODDT), which aims to fulfill the need for comprehensive and open source drug discovery software. Results: The Open Drug Discovery Toolkit was developed as a free and open source tool for both computer aided drug discovery (CADD) developers and researchers. ODDT reimplements many state-of-the-art methods, such as machine learning scoring functions (RF-Score and NNScore) and wraps other external software to ease the process of developing CADD pipelines. ODDT is an out-of-the-box solution designed to be easily customizable and extensible. Therefore, users are strongly encouraged to extend it and develop new methods. We here present three use cases for ODDT in common tasks in computer-aided drug discovery. Conclusion: Open Drug Discovery Toolkit is released on a permissive 3-clause BSD license for both academic and industrial use. ODDT's source code, additional examples and documentation are available on GitHub (https://github.com/oddt/oddt).

We present a problem involving design of magnetoelastic Fe-Ga alloy microstructure for enhanced elastic, plastic and magnetostrictive properties. While theoretical models for computing properties given the microstructure are known for this alloy, inversion of these relationships to obtain microstructures that lead to desired properties is challenging, primarily due to the high dimensionality of microstructure space, multi-objective design requirement and non-uniqueness of solutions. These challenges render traditional search-based optimization methods incompetent in terms of both searching efficiency and result optimality. In this paper, a route to address these challenges using a machine learning methodology is proposed. A systematic framework consisting of random data generation, feature selection and classification algorithms is developed. Experiments with five design problems that involve identification of microstructures that satisfy both linear and nonlinear property constraints show that our framework outperforms traditional optimization methods with the average running time reduced by as much as 80% and with optimality that would not be achieved otherwise.

Because of the complexity of this problem, trial-and-error is heavily involved in the laboratory today. A cost-effective route to aid experimental materials discovery is to construct structure models of nanoporous materials in silico and use molecular simulations to rapidly test them and elucidate data-driven guidelines for rational design. For example, highly tunable nanoporous materials have shown promise as adsorbents for separating an industrially relevant gaseous mixture of xenon and krypton. In this work, we characterize, screen, and analyze the Nanoporous Materials Genorne, a database of about 670 000 porous material structures, for candidate adsorbents for xenon/krypton separations. For over half a million structures, the computational resources required for a brute-force screening using grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations of Xe/Kr adsorption are prohibitive. To overcome the computational cost, we used a hybrid approach combining machine learning algorithms (random forests) with molecular simulations. We compared the results from our large-scale screening with simple pore models to rationalize the strong link between pore size and selectivity. With this insight, we then analyzed the anatomy of the binding sites of the most selective materials. These binding sites can be constructed from tubes, pockets, rings, or cages and are often composed of nondiscrete chemical fragments. The complexity of these binding sites emphasizes the importance of high-throughput computational screenings to identify optimal materials for a given application. Interestingly, our screening study predicts that the two most selective materials in the database are an aluminophosphate zeolite analogue and a calcium based coordination network, both of which have already been synthesized but not yet tested for Xe/Kr separations.

Here, we summarize various approaches for drug-likeness evaluations, including simple rules/filters based on molecular properties/structures and quantitative prediction models based on sophisticated machine learning methods, and provide a comprehensive review of recent advances in this field. Moreover, the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches are briefly outlined. Finally, the drug-likeness analyses of natural products and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) are discussed.

Prediction of drug-ABC-transporter interaction - Recent advances and future challenges	ADVANCED DRUG DELIVERY REVIEWS			English	Review						ABC transporters; Computational models; Bioassays; Machine learning; Pharmacophore modeling; Transport inhibition	BINDING CASSETTE TRANSPORTERS; RESISTANCE PROTEIN BCRP/ABCG2; MEDIATED MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE; P-GLYCOPROTEIN INHIBITORS; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; SALT EXPORT PUMP; COMPUTATIONAL MODELS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; EFFLUX; IDENTIFICATION	With the discovery of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), it became evident that ABC-transporters play a vital role in bioavailability and toxicity of drugs. They prevent intracellular accumulation of toxic compounds, which renders them a major defense mechanism against xenotoxic compounds. Their expression in cells of all major barriers (intestine, blood-brain barrier, blood-placenta barrier) as well as in metabolic organs (liver, kidney) also explains their influence on the ADMET properties of drugs and drug candidates. Thus, in silico models for the prediction of the probability of a compound to interact with P-gp or analogous transporters are of high value in the early phase of the drug discovery process. Within this review, we highlight recent developments in the area, with a special focus on the molecular basis of drug-transporter interaction. In addition, with the recent availability of X-ray structures of several ABC-transporters, also structure-based design methods have been applied and will be addressed. (C) 2015 The Authors.

To prevent the occurrence of DDI in the clinic, experimental systems to evaluate drug interaction have been integrated into the various stages of the drug discovery and development process. A large body of knowledge about DDI has also accumulated through these studies and pharmacovigillence systems. Much of this work to date has focused on the drug metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P-450s as well as drug transporters, ion channels and occasionally other proteins. This combined knowledge provides a foundation for a hypothesis-driven in silico approach, using either cheminformatics or physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PK) modeling methods to assess DDI potential. Here we review recent advances in these approaches with emphasis on hypothesis-driven mechanistic models for important protein targets involved in PK-based DDI. Recent efforts with other informatics approaches to detect DDI are highlighted. Besides DDI, we also briefly introduce drug interactions with other substances, such as Traditional Chinese Medicines to illustrate how in silico modeling can be useful in this domain. We also summarize valuable data sources and web-based tools that are available for DDI prediction. We finally explore the challenges we see faced by in silico approaches for predicting DDI and propose future directions to make these computational models more reliable, accurate, and publically accessible.

CYPs comprise many isoforms, which catalyze a wide variety of reactions, and potentially, a large number of different metabolites can be formed. However, it is often hard to rationalize what metabolites these enzymes generate. In recent years, many different in silico approaches have been developed to predict binding or regioselective product formation for the different CYP isoforms. These comprise ligand-based methods that are trained on experimental CYP data and structure-based methods that consider how the substrate is oriented in the active site or/and how reactive the part of the substrate that is accessible to the heme group is. We will review key aspects for various approaches that are available to predict binding and site of metabolism (SOM), what outcome can be expected from the predictions, and how they could potentially be improved.

Machine learning methods, with their ability in classifying diverse structures and complex mechanisms, are well suited for predicting ADME and ADME regulatory properties. Recent efforts have been directed at the broadening of application scopes and the improvement of predictive performance with particular focuses on the coverage of ADME properties, and exploration of more diversified training data, appropriate molecular features, and consensus modeling. Moreover, several online machine learning ADME prediction servers have emerged.

These measurements include multi-species data that are typically analysed by constructing community models as collections of models built for each species separately (local models) without considering the possible (taxonomic) relationships among species. In this work, we propose to construct a single community structure model for all the species (global model) that is able to exploit the aforementioned relationships. Namely, we investigate whether inclusion of additional information in the form of taxonomic rank or multiple species helps to build better community structure models. More specifically, we use predictive clustering trees (a generalized form of decision trees) to build models for three practically relevant datasets from the task of community structure modelling: microarthopod community living in the agricultural soils of Denmark, organisms living in Slovenian rivers and vegetation found in the State of Victoria, Australia. On each dataset, we compare the performance of four types of community structure models, which correspond to four machine learning tasks: Single species models without taxonomic rank correspond to single-label classification; single species models with taxonomic rank correspond to hierarchical single-label classification; multi-species models without taxonomic rank correspond to multi-label classification; and multi-species models with taxonomic rank correspond to hierarchical multi-label classification. The results of the experimental evaluation reveal that by using the taxonomic rank and the multi-species aspect of the data, we are able to learn better community structure models.

The models within an ensemble can have different structure and parameters and make diverse predictions. Ensembles achieve high predictive performance, benefiting from the diversity of the individual models and outperforming them. In this paper, we develop a novel method for learning ensembles of process-based models. We build upon existing approaches to learning process-based models of dynamic systems from observational data, which integrates the theoretical and empirical paradigms for modelling dynamic systems. In addition to observed data, process-based modelling takes into account domain-specific modelling knowledge. We apply the newly developed method and evaluate its utility on a set of problems of modelling population dynamics in aquatic ecosystems. Data on three lake ecosystems are used, together with a library of process-based knowledge on modelling population dynamics. Based on the evaluation results, we identify the optimal settings of the method for learning ensembles of process-based models, i.e., the optimal number of ensemble constituents (25) as well as the optimal way to select (using a separate validation set) and combine them (using simple average). Furthermore, the evaluation results show that ensemble models have significantly better predictive performance than single models. Finally, the ensembles of process-based models accurately simulate the current and predict the future behaviour of the three aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By taking a cross-sectional assessment of previously published cryopreservation data (sample means and standard errors) as preliminary meta-data, a decision tree learning analysis (DTLA) was performed to develop an understanding of target survival using optimized pruning methods based on different approaches. Briefly, a clear direction on the decision process for selection of methods was developed with key choices being the cooling rate, plunge temperature on the one hand and biomaterial choice, use of composites (sugars and proteins as additional constituents), loading procedure and cell location in 3D scaffolding on the other. Secondly, using machine learning and generalized approaches via the Naive Bayes Classification (NBC) method, these metadata were used to develop posterior probabilities for combinatorial approaches that were implicitly recorded in the metadata. These latter results showed that newer protocol choices developed using probability elicitation techniques can unearth improved protocols consistent with multiple unidimensionally-optimized physical protocols. In conclusion, this article proposes the use of DTLA models and subsequently NBC for the improvement of modern cryopreservation techniques through an integrative approach.

Accordingly, we developed Gene Set Omic Analysis (GSOA), a bioinformatics tool that can evaluate multiple types and combinations of omic data at the pathway level. GSOA uses machine learning to identify dysregulated pathways and improves upon other methods because of its ability to decipher complex, multigene patterns. We compare GSOA to alternative methods and demonstrate its ability to identify pathways known to play a role in various cancer phenotypes.

A Generalizable Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Using Machine Learning for Feature Discovery	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MOTOR IMAGERY; CLASSIFICATION; PLASTICITY; TASKS	This work describes a generalized method for classifying motor-related neural signals for a brain-computer interface (BCI), based on a stochastic machine learning method. The method differs from the various feature extraction and selection techniques employed in many other BCI systems. The classifier does not use extensive a-priori information, resulting in reduced reliance on highly specific domain knowledge. Instead of pre-defining features, the time-domain signal is input to a population of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) in order to perform a stochastic search for the best structure. The results showed that the average performance of the new algorithm outperformed other published methods using the Berlin BCI IV (2008) competition dataset and was comparable to the best results in the Berlin BCI II (2002-3) competition dataset. The new method was also applied to electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded from five subjects undertaking a hand squeeze task and demonstrated high levels of accuracy with a mean classification accuracy of 78.9% after five-fold cross-validation. Our new approach has been shown to give accurate results across different motor tasks and signal types as well as between subjects.

However, current estimates of Chinese forest biomass are mostly based on inventorybased timber volumes and empirical conversion factors at the provincial scale, which could introduce large uncertainties in forest biomass estimation. Here we provide a data-driven estimate of Chinese forest aboveground biomass from 2001 to 2013 at a spatial resolution of 1 km by integrating a recently reviewed plot-level ground-measured forest aboveground biomass database with geospatial information from 1-km Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset in a machine learning algorithm (the model tree ensemble, MTE). We show that Chinese forest aboveground biomass is 8.56 Pg C, which is mainly contributed by evergreen needle-leaf forests and deciduous broadleaf forests. The mean forest aboveground biomass density is 56.1 Mg C ha(-1), with high values observed in temperate humid regions. The responses of forest aboveground biomass density to mean annual temperature are closely tied to water conditions; that is, negative responses dominate regions with mean annual precipitation less than 1300 mm y(-1) and positive responses prevail in regions with mean annual precipitation higher than 2800 mm y(-1). During the 2000s, the forests in China sequestered C by 61.9 Tg C y(-1), and this C sink is mainly distributed in north China and may be attributed to warming climate, rising CO2 concentration, N deposition, and growth of young forests.

In this paper we explore the variability and ambiguity of database and software name mentions and compare dictionary and machine learning approaches to their identification. Results: Through the development and analysis of a corpus of 60 full-text documents manually annotated at the mention level, we report high variability and ambiguity in database and software mentions. On a test set of 25 full-text documents, a baseline dictionary look-up achieved an F-score of 46 %, highlighting not only variability and ambiguity but also the extensive number of new resources introduced. A machine learning approach achieved an F-score of 63 % (with precision of 74 %) and 70 % (with precision of 83 %) for strict and lenient matching respectively. We characterise the issues with various mention types and propose potential ways of capturing additional database and software mentions in the literature. Conclusions: Our analyses show that identification of mentions of databases and tools is a challenging task that cannot be achieved by relying on current manually-curated resource repositories. Although machine learning shows improvement and promise (primarily in precision), more contextual information needs to be taken into account to achieve a good degree of accuracy.

Integrating Multiple Distribution Models to Guide Conservation Efforts of an Endangered Toad	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ANAXYRUS-CALIFORNICUS; OCCURRENCE RECORDS; RANDOM FORESTS; NATIONAL-PARK; LAND-COVER; HABITAT; DESERT	Species distribution models are used for numerous purposes such as predicting changes in species' ranges and identifying biodiversity hotspots. Although implications of distribution models for conservation are often implicit, few studies use these tools explicitly to inform conservation efforts. Herein, we illustrate how multiple distribution models developed using distinct sets of environmental variables can be integrated to aid in identification sites for use in conservation. We focus on the endangered arroyo toad (Anaxyrus californicus), which relies on open, sandy streams and surrounding floodplains in southern California, USA, and northern Baja California, Mexico. Declines of the species are largely attributed to habitat degradation associated with vegetation encroachment, invasive predators, and altered hydrologic regimes. We had three main goals: 1) develop a model of potential habitat for arroyo toads, based on long-term environmental variables and all available locality data; 2) develop a model of the species' current habitat by incorporating recent remotely-sensed variables and only using recent locality data; and 3) integrate results of both models to identify sites that may be employed in conservation efforts. We used a machine learning technique, Random Forests, to develop the models, focused on riparian zones in southern California. We identified 14.37% and 10.50% of our study area as potential and current habitat for the arroyo toad, respectively. Generally, inclusion of remotely-sensed variables reduced modeled suitability of sites, thus many areas modeled as potential habitat were not modeled as current habitat. We propose such sites could be made suitable for arroyo toads through active management, increasing current habitat by up to 67.02%. Our general approach can be employed to guide conservation efforts of virtually any species with sufficient data necessary to develop appropriate distribution models.
