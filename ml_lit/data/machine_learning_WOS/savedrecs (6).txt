J	Lin, HJ; Hsu, YL; Hsu, MS; Cheng, CM				Lin, Hanjun; Hsu, Yeh-Liang; Hsu, Ming-Shinn; Cheng, Chih-Ming			Development of a Telehealthcare Decision Support System for Patients Discharged from the Hospital	TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH			English	Article						telehealthcare; decision support system; machine learning; symptom data; commercial telemedicine; home health monitoring; telehealth		Objective: This article presents the development of a telehealthcare decision support system (TDSS) for patients discharged from the hospital, where symptom data are important indications of the recovery progress for patients. Symptom data are difficult to quantify in a telehealthcare application scenario because the observations and perceptions on symptoms by the patient themselves are subjective. In the TDSS, both symptom data from patients and clinical histories from the hospital information system are collected. Machine learning algorithms are used to build a predictive model for classifying patients according to their symptom data and clinical histories, to provide a degree of urgency for the patient to return to the hospital. Materials and Methods: During a 1-year period, 1,467 patient cases were collected. Symptom data and clinical histories were preprocessed into 49 parameters for machine learning. The training data of patients were validated manually with their actual clinical histories of returning to the hospital. The performances of predictive models trained by five different machine learning algorithms were evaluated and compared. Results: The Bayesian network algorithm had the best performance among the machine learning algorithms tested in this application scenario and was selected to be implemented in the TDSS. On the 1,467 patient cases collected, its precision in 10-fold cross-validation was 79.3%. The most important six parameters were also selected from the 49 parameters by feature selection. The performance of correct prediction by the TDSS is comparable to that by the nursing team at the call center. Conclusions: The TDSS provides a degree of urgency for patients to return to the hospital and thereby assists the telehealthcare nursing team in making such decisions. The performance of the TDSS is expected to improve as more cases of patient data are collected and input into the TDSS. The TDSS has been implemented in one of the largest commercialized telehealthcare practices in Taiwan administered by Min-Sheng General Hospital.

The collection surveys the core commitments of the PDP framework, the key issues the framework has addressed, and the debates the framework has spawned, and presents viewpoints on the current status of these issues. The articles focus on both historical roots and contemporary developments in learning, optimality theory, perception, memory, language, conceptual knowledge, cognitive control, and consciousness. Here we consider the approach more generally, reviewing the original motivations, the resulting framework, and the central tenets of the underlying theory. We then evaluate the impact of PDP both on the field at large and within specific subdomains of cognitive science and consider the current role of PDP models within the broader landscape of contemporary theoretical frameworks in cognitive science. Looking to the future, we consider the implications for cognitive science of the recent success of machine learning systems called "deep networks"-systems that build on key ideas presented in the PDP volumes.

However, the model of light induced damage to animals using physiological indicators as features in machine learning method is never founded. This study was designed to evaluate the changes in micro vascular diameter, the serum absorption spectrum and the blood flow influenced by light irradiation of different wavelengths, powers and exposure time with support vector machine (SVM). The micro images of the mice auricle were recorded and the vessel diameters were calculated by computer program. The serum absorption spectrums were analyzed. The result shows that training sample rate 20% and 50% have almost the same correct recognition rate. Better performance and accuracy was achieved by third-order polynomial kernel SVM quadratic optimization method and it worked suitably for predicting the light induced damage to organisms.

Therefore, they are of utmost importance for the global carbon cycle. Large-area forest inventories in these mostly remote regions are associated with logistical problems and high financial efforts. Remotely-sensed data from satellite platforms may have the capability to provide such huge amounts of information. This study presents an application-oriented approach to derive aboveground growing stock volume (GSV) maps using the annual large-area L-band backscatter mosaics provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Furthermore, a multi-temporal map has been created to improve GSV estimation accuracy. Based on information from Russian forest inventory data, the maps were generated using the machine learning algorithm, RandomForest. The results showed the high potential of this method for an operational, large-scale and high-resolution biomass estimation over boreal forests. An RMSE from 55.2 to 63.3 m(3)/ha could be obtained for the annual maps. Using the multi-temporal approach, the error could be slightly reduced to 54.4 m(3)/ha.

Steering in a Random Forest: Ensemble Learning for Detecting Drowsiness-Related Lane Departures	HUMAN FACTORS			English	Article						drowsiness detection; lane departure; random forest; machine learning; steering wheel angle	DRIVER FATIGUE; SLEEPINESS	Objective: The aim of this study was to design and evaluate an algorithm for detecting drowsiness-related lane departures by applying a random forest classifier to steering wheel angle data. Background: Although algorithms exist to detect and mitigate driver drowsiness, the high rate of false alarms and missed detection of drowsiness represent persistent challenges. Current algorithms use a variety of data sources, definitions of drowsiness, and machine learning approaches to detect drowsiness. Method: We develop a new approach for detecting drowsiness-related lane departures using steering wheel angle data that employ an ensemble definition of drowsiness and a random forest algorithm. Data collected from 72 participants driving the National Advanced Driving Simulator are used to train and evaluate the model. The model's performance was assessed relative to a commonly used algorithm, percentage eye closure (PERCLOS). Results: The random forest steering algorithm had a higher classification accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve than PERCLOS and had comparable positive predictive value. The algorithm succeeds at identifying two key scenarios associated with the drowsiness detection task. These two scenarios consist of instances when drivers depart their lane because they fail to modulate their steering behavior according to the demands of the simulated road and instances when drivers correctly modulate their steering behavior according to the demands of the road. Conclusion: The random forest steering algorithm is a promising approach to detect driver drowsiness. The algorithm's ties to consequences of drowsy driving suggest that it can be easily paired with mitigation systems.

These data can serve in the acquisition of knowledge for real-world situations that are of interest to information services and, ultimately, to people. Such systems face a common challenge, namely the considerable gap between the data produced by measurement and the abstract terminology used to describe real-world situations. We present and discuss the architecture of a software system that utilizes sensor data, digital signal processing, machine learning, and knowledge representation and reasoning to acquire, represent, and infer knowledge about real-world situations observable by a sensor network. We demonstrate the application of the system to vehicle detection and classification by measurement of road pavement vibration. Thus, real-world situations involve vehicles and information for their type, speed, and driving direction.

By releasing the annotated gold standard corpus with Data Use Agreement we would like to encourage other Computational Linguists to experiment with our data and develop new machine learning models for de-identification. This paper describes: (1) the modifications required by the Institutional Review Board before sharing the de-identification gold standard corpus; (2) our efforts to keep the PHI as realistic as possible; (3) and the tests to show the effectiveness of these efforts in preserving the value of the modified data set for machine learning model development. Materials and methods: In a previous study we built an original de-identification gold standard corpus annotated with true Protected Health Information (PHI) from 3503 randomly selected clinical notes for the 22 most frequent clinical note types of our institution. In the current study we modified the original gold standard corpus to make it suitable for external sharing by replacing HIPAA-specified PHI with newly generated realistic PHI. Finally, we evaluated the research value of this new dataset by comparing the performance of an existing published in-house de-identification system, when trained on the new de-identification gold standard corpus, with the performance of the same system, when trained on the original corpus. We assessed the potential benefits of using the new de-identification gold standard corpus to identify PHI in the i2b2 and PhysioNet datasets that were released by other groups for de-identification research. We also measured the effectiveness of the i2b2 and PhysioNet de-identification gold standard corpora in identifying PHI in our original clinical notes. Results: Performance of the de-identification system using the new gold standard corpus as a training set was very close to training on the original corpus (92.56 vs. 93.48 overall F-measures). Best i2b2/PhysioNet/CCHMC cross-training performances were obtained when training on the new shared CCHMC gold standard corpus, although performances were still lower than corpus-specific trainings. Discussion and conclusion: We successfully modified a de-identification dataset for external sharing while preserving the de-identification research value of the modified gold standard corpus with limited drop in machine learning de-identification performance.

Most common approaches are whole-genome regression models where phenotypes are regressed on thousands of markers concurrently, applying different prior distributions to marker effects. While use of shrinkage or regularization in SNP regression models has delivered improvements in predictive ability in genome-based evaluations, serious over-fitting problems may be encountered as the ratio between markers and available phenotypes continues increasing. Machine learning is an alternative approach for prediction and classification, capable of dealing with the dimensionality problem in a computationally flexible manner. In this article we provide an overview of non-parametric and machine learning methods used in genome wide prediction, discuss their similarities as well as their relationship to some well-known parametric approaches. Although the most suitable method is usually case dependent, we suggest the use of support vector machines and random forests for classification problems, whereas Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces regression and boosting may suit better regression problems, with the former having the more consistently higher predictive ability. Neural Networks may suffer from over-fitting and may be too computationally demanded when the number of neurons is large. We further discuss on the metrics used to evaluate predictive ability in model comparison under cross-validation from a genomic selection point of view. We suggest use of predictive mean squared error as a main but not only metric for model comparison. Visual tools may greatly assist on the choice of the most accurate model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Interpretation of coronary CT angiography (cCTA) to search for NCP is a challenging task for radiologists due to the low CT number of NCP, the large number of coronary arteries, and multiple phase CT acquisition. The authors conducted a preliminary study to develop machine learning method for automated detection of NCPs in cCTA. Methods: With IRB approval, a data set of 83 ECG-gated contrast enhanced cCTA scans with 120 NCPs was collected retrospectively from patient files. A multiscale coronary artery response and rolling balloon region growing (MSCAR-RBG) method was applied to each cCTA volume to extract the coronary arterial trees. Each extracted vessel was reformatted to a straightened volume composed of cCTA slices perpendicular to the vessel centerline. A topological soft-gradient (TSG) detection method was developed to prescreen for NCP candidates by analyzing the 2D topological features of the radial gradient field surface along the vessel wall. The NCP candidates were then characterized by a luminal analysis that used 3D geometric features to quantify the shape information and gray-level features to evaluate the density of the NCP candidates. With machine learning techniques, useful features were identified and combined into an NCP score to differentiate true NCPs from false positives (FPs). To evaluate the effectiveness of the image analysis methods, the authors performed tenfold cross-validation with the available data set. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the classification performance of individual features and the NCP score. The overall detection performance was estimated by free response ROC (FROC) analysis. Results: With our TSG prescreening method, a prescreening sensitivity of 92.5% (111/120) was achieved with a total of 1181 FPs (14.2 FPs/scan). On average, six features were selected during the tenfold cross-validation training. The average area under the ROC curve (AUC) value for training was 0.87 +/- 0.01 and the AUC value for validation was 0.85 +/- 0.01. Using the NCP score, FROC analysis of the validation set showed that the FP rates were reduced to 3.16, 1.90, and 1.39 FPs/scan at sensitivities of 90%, 80%, and 70%, respectively. Conclusions: The topological soft-gradient prescreening method in combination with the luminal analysis for FP reduction was effective for detection of NCPs in cCTA, including NCPs causing positive or negative vessel remodeling. The accuracy of vessel segmentation, tracking, and centerline identification has a strong impact on NCP detection. Studies are underway to further improve these techniques and reduce the FPs of the CADe system. (C) 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

There are many applications such as the detection of pathologies and segmentation which would benefit from automatic initialization by the detection of vertebrae. One possible application is the initialization of local vertebral segmentation methods, eliminating the need for manual initialization by a human operator. Automating the initialization process would optimize the clinical workflow. However, automatic vertebra recognition in magnetic resonance (MR) images is a challenging task due to noise in images, pathological deformations of the spine, and image contrast variations. Methods: This work presents a fully automatic algorithm for 3D cervical vertebra detection in MR images. We propose a machine learning method for cervical vertebra detection based on new features combined with a linear support vector machine for classification. An algorithm for bivariate gradient orientation histogram generation from three-dimensional raster image data is introduced which allows us to describe three-dimensional objects using the authors' proposed bivariate histograms. Results: A detailed performance evaluation on 21 T2-weighted MR images of the cervical vertebral region is given. A single model for cervical vertebrae C3 C7 is generated and evaluated. The results show that the generic model performs equally well for each of the cervical vertebrae C3 C7. The algorithm's performance is also evaluated on images containing various levels of artificial noise. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves good results despite the presence of severe image noise. Conclusions: The proposed detection method delivers accurate locations of cervical vertebrae in MR images which can be used in diagnosis and therapy. In order to achieve absolute comparability with the results of future work, the authors are following an open data approach by making the image dataset used in their performance evaluation available to the public.

Pattern-recognition ecological niche models fit to presence-only and presence-absence data	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						machine learning; potential distribution; realized distribution; species distribution model; Swiss flora	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS; HABITAT-SUITABILITY; PREDICTION; ACCURACY; DOMAIN; PLANTS; SPACE; ALPS	1. Identifying the boundary of a species' niche from observational and environmental data is a common problem in ecology and conservation biology and a variety of techniques have been developed or applied to model niches and predict distributions. Here, we examine the performance of some pattern-recognition methods as ecological niche models (ENMs). Particularly, one-class pattern recognition is a flexible and seldom used methodology for modelling ecological niches and distributions from presence-only data. The development of one-class methods that perform comparably to two-class methods (for presence/absence data) would remove modelling decisions about sampling pseudo-absences or background data points when absence points are unavailable. 2. We studied nine methods for one-class classification and seven methods for two-class classification (five common to both), all primarily used in pattern recognition and therefore not common in species distribution and ecological niche modelling, across a set of 106 mountain plant species for which presence-absence data was available. We assessed accuracy using standard metrics and compared trade-offs in omission and commission errors between classification groups as well as effects of prevalence and spatial autocorrelation on accuracy. 3. One-class models fit to presence-only data were comparable to two-class models fit to presence-absence data when performance was evaluated with a measure weighting omission and commission errors equally. One-class models were superior for reducing omission errors (i.e. yielding higher sensitivity), and two-classes models were superior for reducing commission errors (i.e. yielding higher specificity). For these methods, spatial autocorrelation was only influential when prevalence was low. 4. These results differ from previous efforts to evaluate alternative modelling approaches to build ENM and are particularly noteworthy because data are from exhaustively sampled populations minimizing false absence records. Accurate, transferable models of species' ecological niches and distributions are needed to advance ecological research and are crucial for effective environmental planning and conservation; the pattern-recognition approaches studied here show good potential for future modelling studies. This study also provides an introduction to promising methods for ecological modelling inherited from the pattern-recognition discipline.

Multiple research groups have described a variety of approaches for establishing high-quality proteome-wide datasets. However, data analysis is as critical as data production for reliable and insightful biological interpretation, and no consistent and robust solutions have been offered to the community so far. Here, we introduce the requirements for rigorous spatial proteomics data analysis, as well as the statistical machine learning methodologies needed to address them, including supervised and semi-supervised machine learning, clustering, and novelty detection. We present freely available software solutions that implement innovative state-of-the-art analysis pipelines and illustrate the use of these tools through several case studies involving multiple organisms, experimental designs, mass spectrometry platforms, and quantitation techniques. We also propose sound analysis strategies for identifying dynamic changes in subcellular localization by comparing and contrasting data describing different biological conditions. We conclude by discussing future needs and developments in spatial proteomics data analysis.	[Gatto, Laurent; Breckels, Lisa M.; Nightingale, Daniel J.

J	Yang, Z; Li, N; Becerik-Gerber, B; Orosz, M				Yang, Zheng; Li, Nan; Becerik-Gerber, Burcin; Orosz, Michael			A systematic approach to occupancy modeling in ambient sensor-rich buildings	SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Building energy conservation; occupancy modeling; ambient sensing; intelligent buildings; building energy simulation	SUSTAINABILITY; NETWORK	With ever-rising energy demand and diminishing sources of inexpensive energy resources, energy conservation has become an increasingly important topic. Building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are considered to be a prime target for energy conservation due to their significant contribution to commercial buildings' energy consumption in the US. Knowing a building's occupancy plays a crucial role in implementing demand-response HVAC controls, with a corresponding potential for reduction of HVAC energy consumption, especially in office buildings. This paper evaluates occupancy modeling (both binary detection and multi-class estimation) using twelve ambient sensor variables. Performance of six machine-learning techniques is evaluated in both single-occupancy and multi-occupancy offices. Of the six, the decision-tree technique yielded the best overall accuracy (i.e. 96.0% to 98.2%) and root mean square error (RMSE) (i.e. 0.109 to 0.156). The contribution of each individual ambient sensor variable is evaluated via information gain. It is found that CO2, door status, and light variables have important contributions to the final modeling results. It is observed that the overall accuracy generally increases as the number of sensors increases. This paper also examines the possibility of building a global occupancy model, and explores the reasons for low performance of global occupancy estimation. Lastly, the occupancy model is used to estimate and visualize the accumulative room and thermal zone usage in an office test-bed building for three months. The results reveal that the effective vacancy accounts for a substantial portion of the operational hours, varying from 19.8% to 29.8% with an average of 23.3%, which bears significant potential for energy savings. Furthermore, the authors simulated HVAC energy consumption of the test-bed building for three months in DesignBuilder and EnergyPlus, and compared energy consumption of occupancy-based demand-response HVAC controls using the authors' occupancy-modeling results to the conventional HVAC controls currently implemented in the test-bed building. The results demonstrate that 20% of gas and 18% of electricity could be effectively saved if occupancy-based demand-response HVAC control is implemented.

J	Agarwal, S; Mitra, M				Agarwal, Sushant; Mitra, Mira			Lamb wave based automatic damage detection using matching pursuit and machine learning	SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES			English	Article						Lamb wave; matching pursuit; SVM; ANN; damage detection	COMPOSITE STRUCTURES; IDENTIFICATION	In this study, matching pursuit (MP) has been tested with machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs) to automate the process of damage detection in metallic plates. Here, damage detection is done using the Lamb wave response in a thin aluminium plate simulated using a finite element (FE) method. To reduce the complexity of the Lamb wave response, only the A(0) mode is excited and sensed. The procedure adopted for damage detection consists of three major steps, involving signal processing and machine learning (ML). In the first step, MP is used for de-noising and enhancing the sparsity of the database. In the existing literature, MP is used to decompose any signal into a linear combination of waveforms that are selected from a redundant dictionary. In this work, MP is deployed in two stages to make the database sparse as well as to de-noise it. After using MP on the database, it is then passed as input data for ML classifiers. ANN and SVM are used to detect the location of the potential damage from the reduced data. The study demonstrates that the SVM is a robust classifier in the presence of noise and is more efficient than the ANN. Out-of-sample data are used for the validation of the trained and tested classifier. Trained classifiers are found to be successful in the detection of damage with a detection rate of more than 95%.

For instance, whereas medicinal chemists can take advantage of regions in chemical space rich in activity cliffs, QSAR practitioners need to escape from such regions. The influence of activity cliffs in medicinal chemistry applications is extensively documented. However, the 'dark side' of activity cliffs (i.e. their detrimental effect on the development of predictive machine learning algorithms) has been understudied. Similarly, limited amounts of work have been devoted to propose potential solutions to the drawbacks of activity cliffs in similarity-based approaches. In this review, the duality of activity cliffs in medicinal chemistry and computational approaches is addressed, with emphasis on the rationale and potential solutions for handling the 'ugly face' of activity cliffs.

This is due to non-optimal splitting decisions boosted by a possibly unlimited number of examples obtained from a data source. To keep the processing speed high and the tree complexity low, appropriate incremental pruning techniques are needed. In this paper, we introduce a pruning technique for the class of incremental linear model trees with approximate lookahead on stationary data sources. Experimental results show that the advantage of approximate lookahead in terms of processing speed can be further improved by producing much smaller and consequently more explanatory, less memory consuming trees on high-dimensional data. This is done at the expense of only a small increase in prediction error. Additionally, the pruning algorithm can be tuned to either produce less accurate model trees at a much higher processing speed or, alternatively, more accurate trees at the expense of higher processing times.

A Parameter Free BBN Discriminant Function for Optimum Model Complexity versus Goodness of Data Fitting	JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						machine learning; Bayesian network; decision stump; K2; data characterization	LEARNING BAYESIAN NETWORKS; ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; SELECTION	Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) is an appealing classification model for learning causal and noncausal dependencies among a set of query variables. It is a challenging task to learning BBN structure from observational data because of pool of large number of candidate network structures. In this study, we have addressed the issue of goodness of data fitting versus model complexity. While doing so, we have proposed discriminant function which is non-parametric, free of implicit assumptions but delivering better classification accuracy in structure learning. The contribution in this study is twofold, first contribution (discriminant function) is in BBN structure learning and second contribution is for Decision Stump classifier. While designing the novel discriminant function, we analyzed the underlying relationship between the characteristics of data and accuracy of decision stump classifier.

The new panchromatic, synoptic sky surveys require advanced tools for discovering patterns and trends hidden behind data which are both complex and of high dimensionality. We present DAMEWARE (DAta Mining & Exploration Web Application REsource): a general purpose, web-based, distributed data mining environment developed for the exploration of large data sets, and finely tuned for astronomical applications. By means of graphical user interfaces, it allows the user to perform classification, regression, or clustering tasks with machine learning methods. Salient features of DAMEWARE include its ability to work on large datasets with minimal human intervention, and to deal with a wide variety of real problems such as the classification of globular clusters in the galaxy NGC1399; the evaluation of photometric redshifts; and, finally, the identification of candidate Active Galactic Nuclei in multiband photometric surveys. In all these applications, DAMEWARE allowed us to achieve better results than those attained with more traditional methods. With the aim of providing potential users with all needed information, in this paper we briefly describe the technological background of DAMEWARE, give a short introduction to some relevant aspects of data mining, followed by a summary of some science cases and, finally, provide a detailed description of a template use case.

Current EWS leverage only a small fraction of Electronic Health Record (EHR) content. The planned widespread implementation of EHRs brings the promise of abundant data resources for prediction purposes. The three specific aims of our research are: (1) to develop an EHR-based automated algorithm to predict the need for Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) transfer in the first 24 h of admission; (2) to evaluate the performance of the new algorithm on a held-out test data set; and (3) to compare the effectiveness of the new algorithm's with those of two published Pediatric Early Warning Scores (PEWS). Methods: The cases were comprised of 526 encounters with 24-h Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) transfer. In addition to the cases, we randomly selected 6772 control encounters from 62516 inpatient admissions that were never transferred to the PICU. We used 29 variables in a logistic regression and compared our algorithm against two published PEWS on a held-out test data set. Results: The logistic regression algorithm achieved 0.849 (95% CI 0.753-0.945) sensitivity, 0.859 (95% CI 0.850-0.868) specificity and 0.912 (95% CI 0.905-0.919) area under the curve (AUC) in the test set. Our algorithm's AUC was significantly higher, by 11.8 and 22.6% in the test set, than two published PEWS. Conclusion: The novel algorithm achieved higher sensitivity, specificity, and AUC than the two PEWS reported in the literature. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	de Morais, WO; Lundstrom, J; Wickstrom, N				de Morais, Wagner O.; Lundstrom, Jens; Wickstrom, Nicholas			Active In-Database Processing to Support Ambient Assisted Living Systems	SENSORS			English	Article						healthcare technology; smart homes; ambient assisted living; database management systems; active databases; in-database processing; data mining	OLDER-ADULTS; CHALLENGES; FRAMEWORK; HEALTH	As an alternative to the existing software architectures that underpin the development of smart homes and ambient assisted living (AAL) systems, this work presents a database-centric architecture that takes advantage of active databases and in-database processing. Current platforms supporting AAL systems use database management systems (DBMSs) exclusively for data storage. Active databases employ database triggers to detect and react to events taking place inside or outside of the database. DBMSs can be extended with stored procedures and functions that enable in-database processing. This means that the data processing is integrated and performed within the DBMS. The feasibility and flexibility of the proposed approach were demonstrated with the implementation of three distinct AAL services. The active database was used to detect bed-exits and to discover common room transitions and deviations during the night. In-database machine learning methods were used to model early night behaviors. Consequently, active in-database processing avoids transferring sensitive data outside the database, and this improves performance, security and privacy. Furthermore, centralizing the computation into the DBMS facilitates code reuse, adaptation and maintenance. These are important system properties that take into account the evolving heterogeneity of users, their needs and the devices that are characteristic of smart homes and AAL systems. Therefore, DBMSs can provide capabilities to address requirements for scalability, security, privacy, dependability and personalization in applications of smart environments in healthcare.

Although remote sensing techniques have been proven useful in assessing forest biomass in general, more is required to investigate their capabilities in predicting intra-and-inter species biomass which are mainly characterised by non-linear relationships. In this study, we tested two machine learning algorithms, Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) and Random Forest (RF) regression trees to predict intra-and-inter species biomass using high resolution RapidEye reflectance bands as well as the derived vegetation indices in a commercial plantation. The results showed that the SGB algorithm yielded the best performance for intra-and-inter species biomass prediction; using all the predictor variables as well as based on the most important selected variables. For example using the most important variables the algorithm produced an R-2 of 0.80 and RMSE of 16.93 t.ha(-1) for E. grandis; R-2 of 0.79, RMSE of 17.27 t.ha(-1) for P. taeda and R-2 of 0.61, RMSE of 43.39 t.ha(-1) for the combined species data sets. Comparatively, RF yielded plausible results only for E. dunii (R-2 of 0.79; RMSE of 7.18 t.ha(-1)). We demonstrated that although the two statistical methods were able to predict biomass accurately, RF produced weaker results as compared to SGB when applied to combined species dataset. The result underscores the relevance of stochastic models in predicting biomass drawn from different species and genera using the new generation high resolution RapidEye sensor with strategically positioned bands.

Greedy recommendation, however, is suboptimal over the long term: it does not actively gather information on user preferences and fails to recommend novel songs that are potentially interesting. A successful recommender system must balance the needs to explore user preferences and to exploit this information for recommendation. This article presents a new approach to music recommendation by formulating this exploration-exploitation trade-off as a reinforcement learning task. To learn user preferences, it uses a Bayesian model that accounts for both audio content and the novelty of recommendations. A piecewise-linear approximation to the model and a variational inference algorithm help to speed up Bayesian inference. One additional benefit of our approach is a single unified model for both music recommendation and playlist generation. We demonstrate the strong potential of the proposed approach with simulation results and a user study.

In this paper, we discuss feature extraction and interpretation of the modality data from a finger-shaped biomimetic tactile sensor (BioTac (R)) which provides simultaneous information about contact forces, microvibrations and thermal fluxes, mimicking the full cutaneous sensory capabilities of the human finger. The data produced by these sensory modalities are synergistic and non-linear during sensor-object interaction. Algorithms and machine learning techniques were developed and validated for extracting the cutaneous information during sliding motion against the surface of object.

Accurate photometric redshifts for large samples of galaxies are among the main products of modern multiband digital surveys. Over the last decade, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has become a sort of benchmark against which to test the various methods. Aims. We present an application of a new method to the estimation of photometric redshifts for the galaxies in the SDSS Data Release 9 (SDSS-DR9). Photometric redshifts for more than 143 million galaxies were produced. Methods. The Multi Layer Perceptron with Quasi Newton Algorithm (MLPQNA) model, provided within the framework of the DAta Mining and Exploration Web Application REsource (DAMEWARE), is an interpolative method derived from machine learning models. Results. The obtained redshifts have an overall uncertainty of sigma= 0.023 with a very small average bias of similar to 3 x 10 5, and a fraction of catastrophic outliers (vertical bar Delta z vertical bar > 2 sigma) of similar to 5%. This result is slightly better than what was already available in the literature in terms of the smaller fraction of catastrophic outliers as well.

Review of machine learning and signal processing techniques for automated electrode selection in high-density microelectrode arrays	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-BIOMEDIZINISCHE TECHNIK			English	Review						cell-type identification; electronic depth control; Gaussian process classifier; signal quality; spike detection	NONLINEAR ENERGY OPERATOR; SPIKE-SORTING ALGORITHMS; TO-NOISE RATIO; DEPTH CONTROL; ACTION-POTENTIALS; EXTRACELLULAR RECORDINGS; MULTIUNIT RECORDINGS; MOTORIZED MICRODRIVE; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; WAVELET TRANSFORM	Recently developed CMOS-based microprobes contain hundreds of electrodes on a single shaft with interelectrode distances as small as 30 m. So far, neuroscientists manually select a subset of those electrodes depending on their appraisal of the "usefulness" of the recorded signals, which makes the process subjective but more importantly too time consuming to be useable in practice. The ever-increasing number of recording electrodes on microelectrode probes calls for an automated selection of electrodes containing "good quality signals" or "signals of interest." This article reviews the different criteria for electrode selection as well as the basic signal processing steps to prepare the data to compute those criteria. We discuss three of them. The first two select the electrodes based on "signal quality." The first criterion computes the penalized signal-to-noise ratio (SNR); the second criterion models the neuroscientist's appraisal of signal quality. Last, our most recent work allows the selection of electrodes that capture particular anatomical cell types. The discussed algorithms perform what is called in the literature "electronic depth control" in contrast to the mechanical repositioning of the electrode shafts in search of "good quality signals" or "signals of interest."

These algorithms are implemented in a large-scale distributed environment to scale to massive data sets. To accelerate these large-scale graph-based iterative computations, we propose delta-based accumulative iterative computation (DAIC). Different from traditional iterative computations, which iteratively update the result based on the result from the previous iteration, DAIC updates the result by accumulating the "changes'' between iterations. By DAIC, we can process only the "changes'' to avoid the negligible updates. Furthermore, we can perform DAIC asynchronously to bypass the high-cost synchronous barriers in heterogeneous distributed environments. Based on the DAIC model, we design and implement an asynchronous graph processing framework, Maiter. We evaluate Maiter on local cluster as well as on Amazon EC2 Cloud. The results show that Maiter achieves as much as 60x speedup over Hadoop and outperforms other state-of-the-art frameworks.

Machine Learning Approach for Sudden Cardiac Arrest Prediction Based on Optimal Heart Rate Variability Features	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Sudden Cardiac Arrest; Heart Rate Variability; Sequential Feature Selection; Support Vector Machine; Probabilistic Neural Network; Analysis of Variance	TIME-SERIES; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; POINCARE PLOT; DEATH; HRV; INTERVALS; SIGNALS; BEAT	Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) is a devastating heart abnormality which leads to millions of casualty per year. Thus, early detection or prediction of SCA could save the human lives in greater scale. This present work is aimed to predict SCA two minutes before its occurrence and significant results has been obtained using the proposed signal processing methodology. Two international standard databases namely, MIT/BIH Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) Holter Database for SCA and Physiobank Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR) for normal control data were used in this work. Initially, five minutes R-R interval of a subject which is two minutes before the onset of SCA was extracted from MIT/BIH database's annotation files for predicting the SCA. Then, Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signal was pre-processed for ectopic beats removal and detrending using mean and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) respectively. Pre-processed HRV was analysed in time, frequency and nonlinear domains to extract various features to efficiently predict SCA. Totally, 34 features (15 time domain, 13 frequency domains, and 6 nonlinear domains) were extracted from each HRV signal samples of normal and SCA subjects. Sequential Feature Selection (SFS) algorithm is used to select optimal features and seven features (2 time, 3 frequency and 2 nonlinear) among 34 features was chosen as a result. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) were used to predict the SCA and normal control cases. SVM and PNN give maximum mean SCA prediction rate of 96.36% and 93.64% respectively. Thus the present experimental results clearly indicates that, SVM classifier is more efficient in predicting SCA than PNN and mean classification rate reported in this work is higher compared to the earlier works on predicting SCA.

The use of multiple classifiers generally allows better predictive performance than that achievable with a single model. Several approaches exist in the literature that provide means to construct and aggregate such ensembles. However, these ensemble systems contain redundant members that, if removed, may further increase group diversity and produce better results. Smaller ensembles also relax the memory and storage requirements, reducing system's run-time overhead while improving overall efficiency. This paper extends the ideas developed for feature selection problems to support classifier ensemble reduction, by transforming ensemble predictions into training samples, and treating classifiers as features. Also, the global heuristic harmony search is used to select a reduced subset of such artificial features, while attempting to maximize the feature subset evaluation. The resulting technique is systematically evaluated using high dimensional and large sized benchmark datasets, showing a superior classification performance against both original, unreduced ensembles, and randomly formed subsets.

J	Jin, ZM; Li, C; Lin, Y; Cai, D				Jin, Zhongming; Li, Cheng; Lin, Yue; Cai, Deng			Density Sensitive Hashing	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Clustering; locality sensitive hashing; random projection	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR; SEARCH; QUANTIZATION	Nearest neighbor search is a fundamental problem in various research fields like machine learning, data mining and pattern recognition. Recently, hashing-based approaches, for example, locality sensitive hashing (LSH), are proved to be effective for scalable high dimensional nearest neighbor search. Many hashing algorithms found their theoretic root in random projection. Since these algorithms generate the hash tables (projections) randomly, a large number of hash tables (i. e., long codewords) are required in order to achieve both high precision and recall. To address this limitation, we propose a novel hashing algorithm called density sensitive hashing (DSH) in this paper. DSH can be regarded as an extension of LSH. By exploring the geometric structure of the data, DSH avoids the purely random projections selection and uses those projective functions which best agree with the distribution of the data. Extensive experimental results on real-world data sets have shown that the proposed method achieves better performance compared to the state-of-the-art hashing approaches.

A Decision Support Approach for Online Stock Forum Sentiment Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS			English	Article						Decision support; generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH); sentiment analysis; stock price; support vector machine (SVM); volatility	FORECASTING VOLATILITY; INVESTOR SENTIMENT; MODELS; RETURNS; MARKETS; NOISE; PRICE; TALK; NEWS	The Internet provides the opportunity for investors to post online opinions that they share with fellow investors. Sentiment analysis of online opinion posts can facilitate both investors' investment decision making and stock companies' risk perception. This paper develops a novel sentiment ontology to conduct context-sensitive sentiment analysis of online opinion posts in stock markets. The methodology integrates popular sentiment analysis into machine learning approaches based on support vector machine and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity modeling. A typical financial website called Sina Finance has been selected as an experimental platform where a corpus of financial review data was collected. Empirical results suggest solid correlations between stock price volatility trends and stock forum sentiment. Computational results show that the statistical machine learning approach has a higher classification accuracy than that of the semantic approach. Results also imply that investor sentiment has a particularly strong effect for value stocks relative to growth stocks.

Extrapolating active layer thickness measurements across Arctic polygonal terrain using LiDAR and NDVI data sets	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						active layer thickness; thaw depth; frozen ground; ice wedge polygons; barrow; Alaska; eco-hydro-geo-thermal regimes	NORTH-CENTRAL ALASKA; KUPARUK RIVER-BASIN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GROUND TEMPERATURES; MODEL PERFORMANCE; MACKENZIE DELTA; PERMAFROST; USA; TERRITORIES; VARIABILITY	Landscape attributes that vary with microtopography, such as active layer thickness (ALT), are labor intensive and difficult to document effectively through in situ methods at kilometer spatial extents, thus rendering remotely sensed methods desirable. Spatially explicit estimates of ALT can provide critically needed data for parameterization, initialization, and evaluation of Arctic terrestrial models. In this work, we demonstrate a new approach using high-resolution remotely sensed data for estimating centimeter-scale ALT in a 5 km(2) area of ice-wedge polygon terrain in Barrow, Alaska. We use a simple regression-based, machine learning data-fusion algorithm that uses topographic and spectral metrics derived from multisensor data (LiDAR and WorldView-2) to estimate ALT (2 m spatial resolution) across the study area. Comparison of the ALT estimates with ground-based measurements, indicates the accuracy (r(2)=0.76, RMSE 4.4 cm) of the approach. While it is generally accepted that broad climatic variability associated with increasing air temperature will govern the regional averages of ALT, consistent with prior studies, our findings using high-resolution LiDAR and WorldView-2 data, show that smaller-scale variability in ALT is controlled by local eco-hydro-geomorphic factors. This work demonstrates a path forward for mapping ALT at high spatial resolution and across sufficiently large regions for improved understanding and predictions of coupled dynamics among permafrost, hydrology, and land-surface processes from readily available remote sensing data.

Identifying sampling locations for field-scale soil moisture estimation using K-means clustering	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						clustering; K-means; machine learning; temporal stability	WATER; VARIABILITY; TOPOGRAPHY	Identifying and understanding the impact of field-scale soil moisture patterns is currently limited by the time and resources required to do sufficient monitoring. This study uses K-means clustering to find critical sampling points to estimate field-scale near-surface soil moisture. Points within the field are clustered based upon topographic and soils data and the points representing the center of those clusters are identified as the critical sampling points. Soil moisture observations at 42 sites across the growing seasons of 4 years were collected several times per week. Using soil moisture observations at the critical sampling points and the number of points within each cluster, a weighted average is found and used as the estimated mean field-scale soil moisture. Field-scale soil moisture estimations from this method are compared to the rank stability approach (RSA) to find optimal sampling locations based upon temporal soil moisture data. The clustering approach on soil and topography data resulted in field-scale average moisture estimates that were as good or better than RSA, but without the need for exhaustive presampling of soil moisture. Using an electromagnetic inductance map as a proxy for soils data significantly improved the estimates over those obtained based on topography alone.

Ahmet			Adaptive Statistical Signatures of Network Soft-Failures in User Devices	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						fault signatures; network anomalies; terminal device diagnosis; automated inference; signature estimation; feature predictability; feature stability; regression analysis	INTRUSION DETECTION; DIAGNOSIS; CLASSIFICATION; ETHERNET	Efficient fault detection and characterization are crucial requirements for automated network diagnosis systems. In this paper, we present normalized statistical signatures (NSSs), a network 'softfailure' characterization technique for user devices (UDs) based upon exhaustive sets of aggregated statistical features extracted from transmission control protocol (TCP) packet streams. TCP streams are collected on-demand (e. g. upon user complaint) with fixed data transfer limits to capture the artifacts resulting from UD faults. NSSs created using live network and testbed data are able to uniquely characterize many faults and offer insight into how various types of features are affected by the faults and networks. We then introduce the link adaptive signature estimation (LASE) technique to reduce the quantities of collected NSSs required for generalized diagnostic systems with variable link parameters. We create feature estimator functions using multivariate regression techniques to generate artificial NSSs, which are subsequently used to train machine learning systems that have robust generalization capabilities. Performance of a prototype fault classifier system based on NSSs shows that an overall detection accuracy of 98% can be achieved for eight types of faults in a live network environment. In this paper, we specifically focus on formulating the basic framework of NSS and LASE, and limit the analysis to wired networks. This work can later be extended to encompass more complex fixed and mobile wireless networking environments. We expect that the combination of NSSs and LASE can serve as the foundation of next-generation automated network diagnosis systems.

An effective technique that could quickly and accurately detect a wide range of anomalies would be able to prevent serious consequences for system security or reliability. In this article, we characterize detection techniques on the basis of learning models and propose an unsupervised learning model for real-time anomaly detection in computer networks. We also conducted a series of experiments to examine capabilities of the proposed model by employing three well-known machine learning algorithms, namely multivariate normal distribution, k-nearest neighbor, and one-class support vector machine. The results of these experiments on real network traffic suggest that the proposed model is a promising solution and has a number of flexible capabilities to detect several types of anomalies in real time.

Species distribution models of an endangered rodent offer conflicting measures of habitat quality at multiple scales	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Dipodomys ingens; giant kangaroo rat; habitat suitability; mark-recapture; Maxent; survival	RESERVE SELECTION; DIPODOMYS-INGENS; POPULATIONS; ABUNDANCE	1. The high cost of directly measuring habitat quality has led ecologists to test alternate methods for estimating and predicting this critically important ecological variable. In particular, it is frequently assumed but rarely tested that models of habitat suitability ('species distribution models', SDMs) may provide useful indices of habitat quality, either from an individual animal or manager's perspective. Critically, SDMs are increasingly used to estimate species' ranges, with an implicit assumption that areas of high suitability will result in higher probability of persistence. This assumption underlies efforts to use SDMs to design protected areas, assess the status of cryptic species or manage responses to climate change. Recent tests of this relationship have provided mixed results, suggesting SDMs may predict abundance but not other measures of high-quality habitat (e. g. survival, persistence). 2. In this study, we created a suite of SDMs for the endangered giant kangaroo rat Dipodomys ingens at three distinct scales using the machine-learning method Maxent. We compared these models with three measures of habitat quality: survival, abundance and body condition. 3. Species distribution models were not correlated with survival, while models at all scales were positively correlated with abundance. Finer-scale models were more closely correlated with abundance than the largest scale. Body condition was not correlated with habitat suitability at any scale. The inability of models to predict survival may be due to a lack of information in environmental covariates; unmeasured community processes or stochastic events; or the inadequacy of using models that predict species presence to also predict demography. 4. Synthesis and applications. Species distribution models (SDMs), especially fine scale ones, may be useful for longer-term management goals, such as identifying high-quality habitat for protection. However, short-term management decisions should be based only on models that use covariates appropriate for the necessary temporal and spatial scales. Assumptions about the relationship between habitat suitability and habitat quality must be made explicit. Even then, care should be taken in inferring multiple types of habitat quality from SDMs.	[Bean, William T.] Humboldt State Univ, Arcata, CA 95501 USA; [Prugh, Laura R.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Biol & Wildlife, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Stafford, Robert] CDFW, Los Osos, CA 93412 USA; [Butterfield, H.

In this study, we developed and tested an automated approach for mapping LULCCs at annual time intervals using data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Our approach characterizes changes between land cover types based on annual time series of per-pixel land cover probabilities. We used the temporal segmentation algorithm MODTrendr to identify trends and changes in the probability time series that were associated with land cover/use conversions. Accuracy assessment revealed good performance of our approach (overall accuracy of 92.0%). The method detected conversions from forest to grassland with a user's accuracy of 94.0 +/- 2.0% and a producer's accuracy of 95.6 +/- 1.6%. Conversions between cropland and grassland were detected with a user's and a producer's accuracy of 65.8 +/- 4.8% and 72.2 +/- 9.2%, respectively. We here present for the first time an approach that combines probabilities derived from machine learning (random forest classification) with time-series-based analysis (MODTrendr) for land cover/use change analysis at MODIS scale.

Pan-European Grassland Mapping Using Seasonal Statistics From Multisensor Image Time Series	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Decision tree; grassland classification; large area classification; multitemporal analysis; object-based analysis; remote sensing	LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS; ACCURACY ASSESSMENT; CROP CLASSIFICATION; SATELLITE IMAGERY; DECISION TREES; LARGE AREAS; GLC2000; OBJECTS; FOREST	Grasslands cover approximately 40% of the Earth's surface. Low-cost tools for inventory, management, and monitoring are needed because of their great expanse, diversity, and the importance for environmental processes. Remote sensing is a useful technique for providing accurate and reliable information for land use planning and large-scale grassland management. In the context of "GIO land" (Copernicus Initial Operations land program), which is currently contracted by the European Environment Agency, a high-resolution grassland layer of 39 European countries is being created with an overall classification accuracy of better than 80%. Since grassland canopy density, chlorophyll status, and ground cover (GC) are highly dynamic throughout the growing season, no unique spectral signature can be used to map grasslands. Therefore, it is necessary to use image time series to characterize the phenological dynamics of grasslands throughout the year in order to discriminate between grasslands and other vegetation with similar spectral responses. This paper describes an operational approach based on a multisensor concept that employs optical multitemporal and multiscale satellite imagery to generate the high-resolution pan-European grassland layer. The approach is based on the supervised decision tree classifier C5.0 in combination with previous image segmentation and seasonal statistics for various vegetation indices (VIs). Results from the grassland classification for Hungary are presented. The accuracy assessment for this classification was carried out using 328 independent sample points derived from a ground-based European field survey program (LUCAS) and current CORINE Land Cover data. The grassland classification approach is explained in detail on the example of Hungary where an overall accuracy of 92.2% has been reached.

J	Wang, XY; Dang, YN; Zhang, L; Zhang, DM; Lan, E; Mei, H				Wang, Xiaoyin; Dang, Yingnong; Zhang, Lu; Zhang, Dongmei; Lan, Erica; Mei, Hong			Predicting Consistency-Maintenance Requirement of Code Clones at Copy-and-Paste Time	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Code cloning; consistency maintenance; programming aid	EVOLVING SOFTWARE; DETECTION TOOLS; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM	Code clones have always been a double edged sword in software development. On one hand, it is a very convenient way to reuse existing code, and to save coding effort. On the other hand, since developers may need to ensure consistency among cloned code segments, code clones can lead to extra maintenance effort and even bugs. Recently studies on the evolution of code clones show that only some of the code clones experience consistent changes during their evolution history. Therefore, if we can accurately predict whether a code clone will experience consistent changes, we will be able to provide useful recommendations to developers on leveraging the convenience of some code cloning operations, while avoiding other code cloning operations to reduce future consistency maintenance effort. In this paper, we define a code cloning operation as consistency-maintenance-required if its generated code clones experience consistent changes in the software evolution history, and we propose a novel approach that automatically predicts whether a code cloning operation requires consistency maintenance at the time point of performing copy-and-paste operations. Our insight is that whether a code cloning operation requires consistency maintenance may relate to the characteristics of the code to be cloned and the characteristics of its context. Based on a number of attributes extracted from the cloned code and the context of the code cloning operation, we use Bayesian Networks, a machine-learning technique, to predict whether an intended code cloning operation requires consistency maintenance. We evaluated our approach on four subjects-two large-scale Microsoft software projects, and two popular open-source software projects-under two usage scenarios: 1) recommend developers to perform only the cloning operations predicted to be very likely to be consistency-maintenance-free, and 2) recommend developers to perform all cloning operations unless they are predicted very likely to be consistency-maintenance-required. In the first scenario, our approach is able to recommend developers to perform more than 50 percent cloning operations with a precision of at least 94 percent in the four subjects. In the second scenario, our approach is able to avoid 37 to 72 percent consistency-maintenance-required code clones by warning developers on only 13 to 40 percent code clones, in the four subjects.

Fetal QRS extraction from abdominal recordings via model-based signal processing and intelligent signal merging	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						fetal electrocardiography; QRS annotation; ECG dynamical model	COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ELECTROCARDIOGRAM; DECOMPOSITION; SEPARATION	Noninvasive fetal ECG (fECG) monitoring has potential applications in diagnosing congenital heart diseases in a timely manner and assisting clinicians to make more appropriate decisions during labor. However, despite advances in signal processing and machine learning techniques, the analysis of fECG signals has still remained in its preliminary stages. In this work, we describe an algorithm to automatically locate QRS complexes in noninvasive fECG signals obtained from a set of four electrodes placed on the mother's abdomen. The algorithm is based on an iterative decomposition of the maternal and fetal subspaces and filtering of the maternal ECG (mECG) components from the fECG recordings. Once the maternal components are removed, a novel merging technique is applied to merge the signals and detect the fetal QRS (fQRS) complexes. The algorithm was trained and tested on the fECG datasets provided by the PhysioNet/CinC challenge 2013. The final results indicate that the algorithm is able to detect fetal peaks for a variety of signals with different morphologies and strength levels encountered in clinical practice.

Our goal is to have a powerful, yet conceptually clean, solution. There are two novel key components at the heart of our approach: an echo state recurrent neural network that is trained to indicate fetal QRS complexes, and several increasingly sophisticated versions of statistics-based dynamic programming algorithms, which are derived from and rooted in probability theory. We also employ a standard technique for preprocessing and removing maternal ECG complexes from the signals, but do not take this as the main focus of this work. The proposed approach is quite generic and can be extended to other types of signals and annotations. Open-source code is provided.

Currently, there are a few standards and programs available that address the testing for such counterfeit parts. However, not enough research has yet addressed the detection and avoidance of all counterfeit parts-recycled, remarked, overproduced, cloned, out-of-spec/defective, and forged documentation-currently infiltrating the electronic component supply chain. Even if they work initially, all these parts may have reduced lifetime and pose reliability risks. In this tutorial, we will provide a review of some of the existing counterfeit detection and avoidance methods. We will also discuss the challenges ahead for implementing these methods, as well as the development of new detection and avoidance mechanisms.

Testing the accuracy of an observation-based classifier for rapid detection of autism risk	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							DIAGNOSTIC-OBSERVATION-SCHEDULE; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; REVISED ALGORITHMS; ADOS SCORES; SEVERITY; CHILDREN	Current approaches for diagnosing autism have high diagnostic validity but are time consuming and can contribute to delays in arriving at an official diagnosis. In a pilot study, we used machine learning to derive a classifier that represented a 72% reduction in length from the gold-standard Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G), while retaining >97% statistical accuracy. The pilot study focused on a relatively small sample of children with and without autism. The present study sought to further test the accuracy of the classifier (termed the observation-based classifier (OBC)) on an independent sample of 2616 children scored using ADOS from five data repositories and including both spectrum (n = 2333) and non-spectrum (n = 283) individuals. We tested OBC outcomes against the outcomes provided by the original and current ADOS algorithms, the best estimate clinical diagnosis, and the comparison score severity metric associated with ADOS-2. The OBC was significantly correlated with the ADOS-G (r = -0.814) and ADOS-2 (r = -0.779) and exhibited >97% sensitivity and >77% specificity in comparison to both ADOS algorithm scores. The correspondence to the best estimate clinical diagnosis was also high (accuracy = 96.8%), with sensitivity of 97.1% and specificity of 83.3%. The correlation between the OBC score and the comparison score was significant (r = -0.628), suggesting that the OBC provides both a classification as well as a measure of severity of the phenotype. These results further demonstrate the accuracy of the OBC and suggest that reductions in the process of detecting and monitoring autism are possible.	[Duda, M.; Wall, D.

For each interface residue or target residue to be predicted, the authors extract hybrid features which incorporate a wide range of information of the target residue and its spatial neighbor residues, that is, the nearest contact residue in the other face (mirror-contact residue) and the nearest contact residue in the same face (intra-contact residue). Here, feature selection is performed using random forests to avoid over-fitting. Thereafter, the extreme learning machine is employed to effectively integrate these hybrid features for predicting hot spots in protein interfaces. By the 5-fold cross validation in the training set, their method can achieve accuracy (ACC) of 82.1% and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.459, and outperforms some alternative machine learning methods in the comparison study. Furthermore, their method achieves ACC of 76.8% and MCC of 0.401 in the independent test set, and is more effective than the major existing hot spot predictors. Their prediction method offers a powerful tool for uncovering candidate residues in the studies of alanine scanning mutagenesis for functional protein interaction sites.

Models based on fragility curves are widely used for assessing wind damage risk at the county and census tract levels. Large-scale evaluation of the predictive accuracy of these models has been hampered by the lack of detailed damage data. This paper has three aims: (1) to evaluate the predictive accuracy of fragility-curve-based models at the census tract level using a comprehensive damage data set for Harris County residences collected after Hurricane Ike in 2008, (2) to demonstrate the need for geographically refined models of wind damage risk at spatial scales of 1-km(2) blocks and to analyze the performance of fragility-curve models at that level, and (3) to explore the sources of errors made by fragility-curve-based models at the census tract and 1-km(2)-block level using a statistical machine learning model constructed from 21 potential explanatory variables. The results provide new insights for building the next generation of fragility-curve models for accurately predicting hurricane wind damage risk to residential structures at the spatial scale of 1-km(2) blocks.

Through a qualitative analysis of reported incidents in WikiMapia and OpenStreetMap, a typology of this kind of vandalism is outlined, including play, ideological, fantasy, artistic and industrial carto-vandalism, as well as carto-spam. Two families of counter-strategies deployed in amateur mapping communities are discussed. First, the contributors organize forms of policing, based on volunteered community involvement, patrolling the maps and reporting incidents. Second, the detection of carto-vandalism can be supported by automated tools, based either on explicit rules or on machine learning.

J	Olukotun, K				Olukotun, Kunle			Beyond Parallel Programming with Domain Specific Languages	ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES			English	Article						domain specific languages; compilers; heterogeneous architectures; performance		Today, almost all computer architectures are parallel and heterogeneous; a combination of multiple CPUs, GPUs and specialized processors. This creates a challenging problem for application developers who want to develop high performance programs without the effort required to use low-level, architecture specific parallel programming models (e.g. OpenMP for CMPs, CUDA for GPUs, MPI for clusters). Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are a promising solution to this problem because they can provide an avenue for high-level application-specific abstractions with implicit parallelism to be mapped directly to low level architecture-specific programming models; providing both high programmer productivity and high execution performance. In this talk I will describe an approach to building high performance DSLs, which is based on DSL embedding in a general purpose programming language, metaprogramming and a DSL infrastructure called De lite. I will describe how we transform DSL programs into efficient first-order low-level code using domain specific optimization, parallelism and locality optimization with parallel patterns, and architecture-specific code generation. All optimizations and transformations are implemented in De lite: an extensible DSL compiler infrastucture that significantly reduces the effort required to develop new DSLs. De lite DSLs for machine learning, data querying, graph analysis, and scientific computing all achieve performance competitive with manually parallelized C++ code.

J	Hultquist, C; Chen, G; Zhao, KG				Hultquist, Carolynne; Chen, Gang; Zhao, Kaiguang			A comparison of Gaussian process regression, random forests and support vector regression for burn severity assessment in diseased forests	REMOTE SENSING LETTERS			English	Article							FIRE SEVERITY; VEGETATION; CLASSIFICATION; CALIFORNIA; IMAGERY; MASTER	Remote sensing has been widely adopted to map post-fire burn severity over large forested areas. Statistical regression based on linear or simple non-linear assumptions is typically used to link post-fire forest reflectance with the degree of burn severity. However, this linkage becomes complicated if forests experienced severe mortality caused by pre-fire disease or insect outbreaks, which is likely to occur more frequently as a result of rapid climate change. In an effort to improve the understanding of the relationship between forest reflectance and fire-disease disturbances, this study explored the efficacy of three machine learning techniques, that is, Gaussian process regression (GPR), random forests (RF) and support vector regression (SVR), within a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) framework to assess burn severity in a forest subject to pre-fire disease epidemics. MASTER [MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)/ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer)] airborne sensor was applied to collect relatively high spatial (4m) and high spectral (50 bands) resolution reflectance data. Results show that RF, SVR and GPR models outperformed conventional multiple regression by 48%, 29% and 27%, respectively. Compared to SVR and GPR, RF not only achieved better performance in burn severity assessment, but also demonstrated lower sensitivity to the application of different combinations of remote sensing variables. In addition to Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), this study further revealed the importance of image-texture (representing spectral variability within and between neighbourhood forest patches) in burn severity mapping over diseased forests.

Comparative genomics of 274 Vibrio cholerae genomes reveals mobile functions structuring three niche dimensions	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Functional genomics; Mobile elements; Phages; Niche adaptation; Vibrio; Genome evolution; Genotype-phenotype association; Random forest	SEQUENCES; ALGORITHM; BACTERIA; STRAINS; PROJECT; SERVER	Background: Vibrio cholerae is a globally dispersed pathogen that has evolved with humans for centuries, but also includes non-pathogenic environmental strains. Here, we identify the genomic variability underlying this remarkable persistence across the three major niche dimensions space, time, and habitat. Results: Taking an innovative approach of genome-wide association applicable to microbial genomes (GWAS-M), we classify 274 complete V. cholerae genomes by niche, including 39 newly sequenced for this study with the Ion Torrent DNA-sequencing platform. Niche metadata were collected for each strain and analyzed together with comprehensive annotations of genetic and genomic attributes, including point mutations (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs), protein families, functions and prophages. Conclusions: Our analysis revealed that genomic variations, in particular mobile functions including phages, prophages, transposable elements, and plasmids underlie the metadata structuring in each of the three niche dimensions. This underscores the role of phages and mobile elements as the most rapidly evolving elements in bacterial genomes, creating local endemicity (space), leading to temporal divergence (time), and allowing the invasion of new habitats. Together, we take a data-driven approach for comparative functional genomics that exploits high-volume genome sequencing and annotation, in conjunction with novel statistical and machine learning analyses to identify connections between genotype and phenotype on a genome-wide scale.

A computational method to differentiate normal individuals, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients using serum biomarkers	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE			English	Article						osteoarthritis; cytokines; serum; diagnostic; artificial neural network; machine learning	SYNOVIAL-FLUID; DISEASE PROGRESSION; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; MARKERS; VALIDATION; CRITERIA; BIOLOGY; KNEE	The objective of this study was to develop a method for categorizing normal individuals (normal, n = 100) as well as patients with osteoarthritis (OA, n = 100), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n = 100) based on a panel of inflammatory cytokines expressed in serum samples. Two panels of inflammatory proteins were used as training sets in the construction of two separate artificial neural networks (ANNs). The first training set consisted of all proteins (38 in total) and the second consisted of only the significantly different proteins expressed (12 in total) between at least two patient groups. Both ANNs obtained high levels of sensitivity and specificity, with the first and second ANN each diagnosing 100% of test set patients correctly. These results were then verified by re-investigating the entire dataset using a decision tree algorithm. We show that ANNs can be used for the accurate differentiation between serum samples of patients with OA, a diagnosed RA patient comparator cohort and normal/control cohort. Using neural network and systems biology approaches to manage large datasets derived from high-throughput proteomics should be further explored and considered for diagnosing diseases with complex pathologies.

J	Hammer, EM; Kaufmann, T; Kleih, SC; Blankertz, B; Kubler, A				Hammer, Eva M.; Kaufmann, Tobias; Kleih, Sonja C.; Blankertz, Benjamin; Kuebler, Andrea			Visuo-motor coordination ability predicts performance with brain-computer interfaces controlled by modulation of sensorimotor rhythms (SMR)	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-computer interfaces; sensorimotor rhythms; predictors; visuo-motor coordination abilities; attentional impulsivity	BARRATT IMPULSIVENESS SCALE; BCI; EEG; COMMUNICATION; POTENTIALS; MOVEMENT; IMAGERY; OPERATE	Modulation of sensor motor rhythms (SMR) was suggested as a control signal for brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Yet, there is a population of users estimated between 10 to 50% not able to achieve reliable control and only about 20% of users achieve high (80-100%) performance. Predicting performance prior to BCI use would facilitate selection of the most feasible system for an individual, thus constitute a practical benefit for the user, and increase our knowledge about the correlates of BCI control. In a recent study, we predicted SMR-BCI performance from psychological variables that were assessed prior to the BCI sessions and BCI control was supported with machine-learning techniques. We described two significant psychological predictors, namely the visuo-motor coordination ability and the ability to concentrate on the task. The purpose of the current study was to replicate these results thereby validating these predictors within a neurofeedback based SMR-BCI that involved no machine learning. Thirty-three healthy BCI novices participated in a calibration session and three further neurofeedback training sessions. Two variables were related with mean SMR-BCI performance: (1) a measure for the accuracy of fine motor skills, i.e., a trade for a person's visuo-motor control ability; and (2) subject's ''attentional impulsivity" In a linear regression they accounted for almost 20% in variance of SMR-BCI performance, but predictor (1) failed significance. Nevertheless, on the basis of our prior regression model for sensorimotor control ability we could predict current SMR-BCI performance with an average prediction error of M = 12.07%. In more than 50% of the participants, the prediction error was smaller than 10%. Hence, psychological variables played a moderate role in predicting SMR-BCI performance in a neurofeedback approach that involved no machine learning. Future studies are needed to further consolidate (or reject) the present predictors.

This behavior has been shown to imply that these systems reside near a unique critical point where the extensive parts of the entropy and energy are exactly equal. Here, we show analytically, and via numerical simulations, that Zipf-like probability distributions arise naturally if there is a fluctuating unobserved variable (or variables) that affects the system, such as a common input stimulus that causes individual neurons to fire at time-varying rates. In statistics and machine learning, these are called latent-variable or mixture models. We show that Zipf's law arises generically for large systems, without fine-tuning parameters to a point. Our work gives insight into the ubiquity of Zipf's law in a wide range of systems.

We evaluate the combination of NLP and machine learning to detect thromboembolic disease diagnosis and incidental clinically relevant findings from angiography and venography reports written in French. We model thromboembolic diagnosis and incidental findings as a set of concepts, modalities and relations between concepts that can be used as features by a supervised machine learning algorithm. A corpus of 573 radiology reports was de-identified and manually annotated with the support of NLP tools by a physician for relevant concepts, modalities and relations. A machine learning classifier was trained on the dataset interpreted by a physician for diagnosis of deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and clinically relevant incidental findings. Decision models accounted for the imbalanced nature of the data and exploited the structure of the reports. Results: The best model achieved an F measure of 0.98 for pulmonary embolism identification, 1.00 for deep vein thrombosis, and 0.80 for incidental clinically relevant findings. The use of concepts, modalities and relations improved performances in all cases. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the benefits of developing an automated method to identify medical concepts, modality and relations from radiology reports in French. An end-to-end automatic system for annotation and classification which could be applied to other radiology reports databases would be valuable for epidemiological surveillance, performance monitoring, and accreditation in French hospitals.

In most structural problems, such as natural language processing and image processing, developing labeled data for a specific domain requires considerable amount of human resources. In this paper, we present a cluster-based method to fuse labeled training and unlabeled raw data. We design a top-down divisive clustering algorithm that ensures maximal information gain in the use of unlabeled data via clustering similar words. To implement this idea, we design a top-down iterative K-means clustering algorithm to merge word clusters. Differently, the derived term groups are then encoded as new features for the supervised learners in order to improve the coverage of lexical information. Without additional training data or external materials, this approach yields state-of-the-art performance on the shallow parsing and base-chunking benchmark datasets (94.50 and 93.12 in F-(beta) rates).

The previous multi-frame super-resolution processing system can improve resolution but has limited cell flow rate and hence low throughput when capturing multiple subpixel-shifted cell images. This paper introduces a single-frame super-resolution processing with on-line machine-learning for contact images of cells.

Alternative splicing allows creation of many distinct mature mRNA transcripts from a single gene by utilizing different splice sites. In plants like Arabidopsis thaliana, the most common type of alternative splicing is intron retention. Many studies in the past focus on positional distribution of retained introns (RIs) among different genic regions and their expression regulations, while little systematic classification of RIs from constitutively spliced introns (CSIs) has been conducted using machine learning approaches. We used random forest and support vector machine (SVM) with radial basis kernel function (RBF) to differentiate these two types of introns in Arabidopsis. By comparing coordinates of introns of all annotated mRNAs from TAIR10, we obtained our high-quality experimental data. To distinguish RIs from CSIs, We investigated the unique characteristics of RIs in comparison with CSIs and finally extracted 37 quantitative features: local and global nucleotide sequence features of introns, frequent motifs, the signal strength of splice sites, and the similarity between sequences of introns and their flanking regions. We demonstrated that our proposed feature extraction approach was more accurate in effectively classifying RIs from CSIs in comparison with other four approaches. The optimal penalty parameter C and the RBF kernel parameter gamma in SVM were set based on particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSOSVM). Our classification performance showed F-Measure of 80.8% (random forest) and 77.4% (PSOSVM). Not only the basic sequence features and positional distribution characteristics of RIs were obtained, but also putative regulatory motifs in intron splicing were predicted based on our feature extraction approach. Clearly, our study will facilitate a better understanding of underlying mechanisms involved in intron retention.

The number of candidate measures is legion. This calls for proper, objective criteria when ranking their relevance. Methods: Following a shotgun approach we determined a plenitude of kinematic and physiological gait measures and ranked their relevance using conventional analysis of variance (ANOVA) supplemented by logistic and partial least squares (PLS) regressions. We illustrated this approach using data from two studies involving stroke patients, amputees, and healthy controls. Results: Only a handful of measures turned out significant in the ANOVAs. The logistic regressions, by contrast, revealed various measures that clearly discriminated between experimental groups and conditions. The PLS regression also identified several discriminating measures, but they did not always agree with those of the logistic regression. Discussion & conclusion: Extracting a measure's classification capacity cannot solely rely on its statistical validity but typically requires proper post-hoc analysis. However, choosing the latter inevitably introduces some arbitrariness, which may affect outcome in general. We hence advocate the use of generic expert systems, possibly based on machine-learning.

A document classifier for medicinal chemistry publications trained on the ChEMBL corpus	JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS			English	Article						Machine learning; Triage; Curation; Document classification	DATABASE	Background: The large increase in the number of scientific publications has fuelled a need for semi-and fully automated text mining approaches in order to assist in the triage process, both for individual scientists and also for larger-scale data extraction and curation into public databases. Here, we introduce a document classifier, which is able to successfully distinguish between publications that are 'ChEMBL-like' (i.e. related to small molecule drug discovery and likely to contain quantitative bioactivity data) and those that are not. The unprecedented size of the medicinal chemistry literature collection, coupled with the advantage of manual curation and mapping to chemistry and biology make the ChEMBL corpus a unique resource for text mining. Results: The method has been implemented as a data protocol/workflow for both Pipeline Pilot (version 8.5) and KNIME (version 2.9) respectively. Both workflows and models are freely available at: ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/text-mining. These can be readily modified to include additional keyword constraints to further focus searches. Conclusions: Large-scale machine learning document classification was shown to be very robust and flexible for this particular application, as illustrated in four distinct text-mining-based use cases. The models are readily available on two data workflow platforms, which we believe will allow the majority of the scientific community to apply them to their own data.

Animal models(1) can demonstrate the effects of neurotoxic substances; however, they provide limited insight into the psycho-social and higher cognitive factors involved in the initiation of substance use and progression to misuse. One can search for pre-existing risk factors by testing for endophenotypic biomarkers(2) in non-using relatives; however, these relatives may have personality or neural resilience factors that protect them from developing dependence(3). A longitudinal study has potential to identify predictors of adolescent substance misuse, particularly if it can incorporate a wide range of potential causal factors, both proximal and distal, and their influence on numerous social, psychological and biological mechanisms(4). Here we apply machine learning to a wide range of data from a large sample of adolescents (n = 692) to generate models of current and future adolescent alcohol misuse that incorporate brain structure and function, individual personality and cognitive differences, environmental factors (including gestational cigarette and alcohol exposure), life experiences, and candidate genes. These models were accurate and generalized to novel data, and point to life experiences, neurobiological differences and personality as important antecedents of binge drinking. By identifying the vulnerability factors underlying individual differences in alcohol misuse, these models shed light on the aetiology of alcohol misuse and suggest targets for prevention.

J	Leo, M; Cazzato, D; De Marco, T; Distante, C				Leo, Marco; Cazzato, Dario; De Marco, Tommaso; Distante, Cosimo			Unsupervised Eye Pupil Localization through Differential Geometry and Local Self-Similarity Matching	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FACE-RECOGNITION; DISTANCE; FEATURES	The automatic detection and tracking of human eyes and, in particular, the precise localization of their centers (pupils), is a widely debated topic in the international scientific community. In fact, the extracted information can be effectively used in a large number of applications ranging from advanced interfaces to biometrics and including also the estimation of the gaze direction, the control of human attention and the early screening of neurological pathologies. Independently of the application domain, the detection and tracking of the eye centers are, currently, performed mainly using invasive devices. Cheaper and more versatile systems have been only recently introduced: they make use of image processing techniques working on periocular patches which can be specifically acquired or preliminarily cropped from facial images. In the latter cases the involved algorithms must work even in cases of non-ideal acquiring conditions (e.g in presence of noise, low spatial resolution, non-uniform lighting conditions, etc.) and without user's awareness (thus with possible variations of the eye in scale, rotation and/or translation). Getting satisfying results in pupils' localization in such a challenging operating conditions is still an open scientific topic in Computer Vision. Actually, the most performing solutions in the literature are, unfortunately, based on supervised machine learning algorithms which require initial sessions to set the working parameters and to train the embedded learning models of the eye: this way, experienced operators have to work on the system each time it is moved from an operational context to another. It follows that the use of unsupervised approaches is more and more desirable but, unfortunately, their performances are not still satisfactory and more investigations are required. To this end, this paper proposes a new unsupervised approach to automatically detect the center of the eye: its algorithmic core is a representation of the eye's shape that is obtained through a differential analysis of image intensities and the subsequent combination with the local variability of the appearance represented by self-similarity coefficients. The experimental evidence of the effectiveness of the method was demonstrated on challenging databases containing facial images. Moreover, its capabilities to accurately detect the centers of the eyes were also favourably compared with those of the leading state-of-the-art methods.

J	Clark, AM; Bunin, BA; Litterman, NK; Schurer, SC; Visser, U				Clark, Alex M.; Bunin, Barry A.; Litterman, Nadia K.; Schuerer, Stephan C.; Visser, Ubbo			Fast and accurate semantic annotation of bioassays exploiting a hybrid of machine learning and user confirmation	PEERJ			English	Article						Bioassay; Ontology; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Bayesian; Semantic curation	DRUG DISCOVERY	Bioinformatics and computer aided drug design rely on the curation of a large number of protocols for biological assays that measure the ability of potential drugs to achieve a therapeutic effect. These assay protocols are generally published by scientists in the form of plain text, which needs to be more precisely annotated in order to be useful to software methods. We have developed a pragmatic approach to describing assays according to the semantic definitions of the BioAssay Ontology (BAO) project, using a hybrid of machine learning based on natural language processing, and a simplified user interface designed to help scientists curate their data with minimum effort. We have carried out this work based on the premise that pure machine learning is insufficiently accurate, and that expecting scientists to find the time to annotate their protocols manually is unrealistic. By combining these approaches, we have created an effective prototype for which annotation of bioassay text within the domain of the training set can be accomplished very quickly. Well-trained annotations require single-click user approval, while annotations from outside the training set domain can be identified using the search feature of a well-designed user interface, and subsequently used to improve the underlying models. By drastically reducing the time required for scientists to annotate their assays, we can realistically advocate for semantic annotation to become a standard part of the publication process. Once even a small proportion of the public body of bioassay data is marked up, bioinformatics researchers can begin to construct sophisticated and useful searching and analysis algorithms that will provide a diverse and powerful set of tools for drug discovery researchers.

The method is mainly divided into two steps. The first step is to generate a spare hyperplane and estimate the score of each instance in positive bags. For the second step, MI-NSVM seeks the "most positive" instance of each positive bag by the information obtained in the first step, and then generates the second hyperplane.

First, we used ANOVA and PCA for a preliminary analysis. Then, machine-learning tools for identification and classification were applied to verify the feasibility of using data mining tools to find the region where M. tenacissima samples originated. The study clearly indicated that the support vector machine, the radial basis function neural network, and the random forest chemometric tools had the potential to identify the origins of M. tenacissima. The results revealed that the SVM-grid model was superior to all the other mathematical methods with an average discrimination rate of 98.875% for the training set and 100% for the test set. The order of successful identification rates is as follows: SVM-grid > SVM-ga > RF > RBF-NN > SVM-pso. Moreover, there have been few relevant studies about the application of these machine-learning tools combined with multi-element analysis for tracing the geographical source, so this paper can serve as a reference to identify the origin and perform quality assurance in the field of medicinal plants.

Identification and quantification of uncertainties are integral parts of ARD assessment and risk mitigation, however previous studies on predicting ARD drainage chemistry have not fully addressed issues of uncertainties. In this study, artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) are used for the prediction of ARD drainage chemistry and their predictive uncertainties are quantified using probability bounds analysis. Furthermore, the predictions of ANN and SVM are integrated using four aggregation methods to improve their individual predictions. The results of this study showed that ANN performed better than SVM in enveloping the observed concentrations. In addition, integrating the prediction of ANN and SVM using the aggregation methods improved the predictions of individual techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The classical MDP model is suitable for an agent/decision-maker interested in maximizing expected revenues, but does not account for minimizing variability in the revenues. An MDP model in which the agent can maximize the revenues while simultaneously controlling the variance in the revenues is proposed. This work is rooted in machine learning/neural network concepts, where updating is based on system feedback and step sizes. First, a Bellman equation for the problem is proposed. Thereafter, convergent dynamic programming and reinforcement learning techniques for solving the MDP are provided along with encouraging numerical results on a small MDP and a preventive maintenance problem.

Phase discontinuity predictions using a machine-learning trained kernel	APPLIED OPTICS			English	Article							DEFORMATION MEASUREMENTS; UNWRAPPING ALGORITHM; INTERFEROMETRY; REDUCTION; NETWORKS	Phase unwrapping is one of the key steps of interferogram analysis, and its accuracy relies primarily on the correct identification of phase discontinuities. This can be especially challenging for inherently noisy phase fields, such as those produced through shearography and other speckle-based interferometry techniques. We showed in a recent work how a relatively small 10 x 10 pixel kernel was trained, through machine learning methods, for predicting the locations of phase discontinuities within noisy wrapped phase maps. We describe here how this kernel can be applied in a sliding-window fashion, such that each pixel undergoes 100 phase-discontinuity examinations-one test for each of its possible positions relative to its neighbors within the kernel's extent. We explore how the resulting predictions can be accumulated, and aggregated through a voting system, and demonstrate that the reliability of this method outperforms processing the image by segmenting it into more conventional 10 x 10 nonoverlapping tiles. When used in this way, we demonstrate that our 10 x 10 pixel kernel is large enough for effective processing of full-field interferograms. Avoiding, thus, the need for substantially more formidable computational resources which otherwise would have been necessary for training a kernel of a significantly larger size.

Specifically, neural development is also of great clinical relevance because several human neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, autism disorders or drug addiction and also brain malformations are thought to have neurodevelopmental origins, i.e. pathogenesis initiates during childhood and adolescence. Impacts during early neurodevelopment might also predispose to late-onset neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. The neural tube develops from its precursor tissue, the neural plate, in a patterning process that is determined by compartmentalization into morphogenetic units, the action of local signaling centers and a well-defined and locally restricted expression of genes and their interactions. While public databases provide gene expression data with spatio-temporal resolution, they usually neglect the genetic interactions that govern neural development. Here, we introduce Mouse IDGenes, a reference database for genetic interactions in the developing mouse brain. The database is highly curated and offers detailed information about gene expressions and the genetic interactions at the developing mid-/hindbrain boundary. To showcase the predictive power of interaction data, we infer new Wnt/beta-catenin target genes by machine learning and validate one of them experimentally. The database is updated regularly. Moreover, it can easily be extended by the research community. Mouse IDGenes will contribute as an important resource to the research on mouse brain development, not exclusively by offering data retrieval, but also by allowing data input.

However, whether the spontaneous fluctuations are directly related to these two different resting states are still largely unclear. In the present study, we acquired resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 24 healthy subjects (11 males, 20.17 +/- 2.74 years) under the EO and EC states. The amplitude of the spontaneous brain activity in low-frequency band was subsequently investigated by using the metric of fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (fALFF) for each subject under each state. A support vector machine (SVM) analysis was then applied to evaluate whether the category of resting states could be determined from the brain spontaneous fluctuations. We demonstrated that these two resting states could be decoded from the identified pattern of brain spontaneous fluctuations, predominantly based on fALFF in the sensorimotor module. Specifically, we observed prominent relationships between increased fALFF for EC and decreased fALFF for EO in sensorimotor regions. Overall, the present results indicate that a SVM performs well in the discrimination between the brain spontaneous fluctuations of distinct resting states and provide new insight into the neural substrate of the resting states during EC and EO.

Several forms of anatomical features, such as cortical volume, shape, and thickness, have demonstrated discriminative capability. These approaches rely on accurate non-linear image transformation, which could invite several nuisance factors, such as dependency on transformation parameters and the degree of anatomical abnormality, and an unpredictable influence of residual registration errors. In this study, we tested a simple method to extract disease-related anatomical features, which is suitable for initial stratification of the heterogeneous patient populations often encountered in clinical data. The method employed gray-level invariant features, which were extracted from linearly transformed images, to characterize AD-specific anatomical features. The intensity information from a disease-specific spatial masking, which was linearly registered to each patient, was used to capture the anatomical features. We implemented a two-step feature selection for anatomic recognition. First, a statistic-based feature selection was implemented to extract AD-related anatomical features while excluding non-significant features. Then, seven knowledge-based ROIs were used to capture the local discriminative powers of selected voxels within areas that were sensitive to AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The discriminative capability of the proposed feature was measured by its performance in differentiating AD or MCI from normal elderly controls (NC) using a support vector machine. The statistic-based feature selection, together with the knowledge-based masks, provided a promising solution for capturing anatomical features of the brain efficiently. For the analysis of clinical populations, which are inherently heterogeneous, this approach could stratify the large amount of data rapidly and could be combined with more detailed subsequent analyses based on non-linear transformation.

Exhausting the information: novel Bayesian combination of photometric redshift PDFs	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: data analysis; methods: statistical; surveys; galaxies: distances and redshifts; galaxies: statistics	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; OSCILLATION SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY; BARYON ACOUSTIC-OSCILLATIONS; SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS; DATA RELEASE; SDSS-III; LEGACY SURVEY; SURVEY DESIGN; GALAXIES; CLASSIFICATION	The estimation and utilization of photometric redshift probability density functions (photo-z PDFs) have become increasingly important over the last few years and currently there exist a wide variety of algorithms to compute photo-z's, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we present a novel and efficient Bayesian framework that combines the results from different photo-z techniques into a more powerful and robust estimate by maximizing the information from the photometric data. To demonstrate this, we use a supervised machine learning technique based on random forest, an unsupervised method based on self-organizing maps, and a standard template-fitting method but can be easily extended to other existing techniques. We use data from the DEEP2 survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to explore different methods for combining the predictions from these techniques. By using different performance metrics, we demonstrate that we can improve the accuracy of our final photo-z estimate over the best input technique, that the fraction of outliers is reduced, and that the identification of outliers is significantly improved when we apply a na < ve Bayes classifier to this combined information. Our more robust and accurate photo-z PDFs will allow even more precise cosmological constraints to be made by using current and future photometric surveys. These improvements are crucial as we move to analyse photometric data that push to or even past the limits of the available training data, which will be the case with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.

Alzheimer's Dis Neuroimaging	Computational genetics analysis of grey matter density in Alzheimer's disease	BIODATA MINING			English	Article							STATISTICAL EPISTASIS NETWORKS; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GENOME-WIDE; ASSOCIATION; VISUALIZATION; AD	Background: Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of progressive dementia and there is currently no known cure. The cause of onset is not fully understood but genetic factors are expected to play a significant role. We present here a bioinformatics approach to the genetic analysis of grey matter density as an endophenotype for late onset Alzheimer's disease. Our approach combines machine learning analysis of gene-gene interactions with large-scale functional genomics data for assessing biological relationships. Results: We found a statistically significant synergistic interaction among two SNPs located in the intergenic region of an olfactory gene cluster. This model did not replicate in an independent dataset. However, genes in this region have high-confidence biological relationships and are consistent with previous findings implicating sensory processes in Alzheimer's disease. Conclusions: Previous genetic studies of Alzheimer's disease have revealed only a small portion of the overall variability due to DNA sequence differences. Some of this missing heritability is likely due to complex gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. We have introduced here a novel bioinformatics analysis pipeline that embraces the complexity of the genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease while at the same time harnessing the power of functional genomics. These findings represent novel hypotheses about the genetic basis of this complex disease and provide open-access methods that others can use in their own studies.

In this study, we aim to discover the most relevant variables for risk prediction of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) using clinical signs and heart rate variability. Methods: A total of 702 chest pain patients at the Emergency Department (ED) of a tertiary hospital in Singapore were included in this study. The recruited patients were at least 30 years of age and who presented to the ED with a primary complaint of non-traumatic chest pain. The primary outcome was a composite of MACE such as death and cardiac arrest within 72 h of arrival at the ED. For each patient, eight clinical signs such as blood pressure and temperature were measured, and a 5-min ECG was recorded to derive heart rate variability parameters. A random forest-based novel method was developed to select the most relevant variables. A geometric distance-based machine learning scoring system was then implemented to derive a risk score from 0 to 100. Results: Out of 702 patients, 29 (4.1%) met the primary outcome. We selected the 3 most relevant variables for predicting MACE, which were systolic blood pressure, the mean RR interval and the mean instantaneous heart rate. The scoring system with these 3 variables produced an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.812, and a cutoff score of 43 gave a sensitivity of 82.8% and specificity of 63.4%, while the scoring system with all the 23 variables had an AUC of 0.736, and a cutoff score of 49 gave a sensitivity of 72.4% and specificity of 63.0%. Conventional thrombolysis in myocardial infarction score and the modified early warning score achieved AUC values of 0.637 and 0.622, respectively. Conclusions: It is observed that a few predictors outperformed the whole set of variables in predicting MACE within 72 h. We conclude that more predictors do not necessarily guarantee better prediction results. Furthermore, machine learning-based variable selection seems promising in discovering a few relevant and significant measures as predictors.

To date, there are no efficient morphologic features or genomic biomarkers that can characterize the phenotypes of the cancer, especially with regard to metastasis the most adverse outcome. Searching for effective surrogate genes out of large quantities of gene expression data is a key to cancer phenotyping and/or understanding molecular mechanisms underlying prostate cancer development. Results: Using the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) method on microarray data from normal tissues, primary tumors and metastatic tumors, we identifed four genes that can optimally classify samples of different prostate cancer phases. Moreover, we constructed a molecular interaction network with existing bioinformatic resources and co-identifed eight genes on the shortest paths among the mRMR--identified genes, which are potential co acting factors of prostate cancer. Functional analyses show that molecular functions involved in cell communication, hormone receptor mediated signaling, and transcription regulation play important roles in the development of prostate cancer. Conclusion: We conclude that the surrogate genes we have selected compose an effective classifier of prostate cancer phases, which corresponds to a minimum characterization of cancer phenotypes on the molecular level. Along with their molecular interaction partners, it is fairly to assume that these genes may have mportant roles in prostate cancer development; particularly, the un-reported genes may bring new insights for the understanding of the molecular mechanisms. Thus our results may serve as a candidate gene set for further functional studies.

Substituting random forest for multiple linear regression improves binding affinity prediction of scoring functions: Cyscore as a case study	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Molecular docking; Binding affinity; Drug discovery; Machine learning	PROTEIN-LIGAND COMPLEXES; OUT CROSS-VALIDATION; PDBBIND DATABASE; DRUG DISCOVERY; DATA-BANK; DATA SETS; OPTIMIZATION; APPROPRIATE; DOCKING; LEAD	Background: State-of-the-art protein-ligand docking methods are generally limited by the traditionally low accuracy of their scoring functions, which are used to predict binding affinity and thus vital for discriminating between active and inactive compounds. Despite intensive research over the years, classical scoring functions have reached a plateau in their predictive performance. These assume a predetermined additive functional form for some sophisticated numerical features, and use standard multivariate linear regression (MLR) on experimental data to derive the coefficients. Results: In this study we show that such a simple functional form is detrimental for the prediction performance of a scoring function, and replacing linear regression by machine learning techniques like random forest (RF) can improve prediction performance. We investigate the conditions of applying RF under various contexts and find that given sufficient training samples RF manages to comprehensively capture the non-linearity between structural features and measured binding affinities. Incorporating more structural features and training with more samples can both boost RF performance. In addition, we analyze the importance of structural features to binding affinity prediction using the RF variable importance tool. Lastly, we use Cyscore, a top performing empirical scoring function, as a baseline for comparison study. Conclusions: Machine-learning scoring functions are fundamentally different from classical scoring functions because the former circumvents the fixed functional form relating structural features with binding affinities. RF, but not MLR, can effectively exploit more structural features and more training samples, leading to higher prediction performance. The future availability of more X-ray crystal structures will further widen the performance gap between RF-based and MLR-based scoring functions. This further stresses the importance of substituting RF for MLR in scoring function development.

These potential users of noninvasive BCIs display a large range of physical and mental conditions. Prior studies have shown the general applicability of BCI with patients, with the conflict of either using many training sessions or studying only moderately restricted patients. We present a BCI system designed to establish external control for severely motor-impaired patients within a very short time. Within only six experimental sessions, three out of four patients were able to gain significant control over the BCI, which was based on motor imagery or attempted execution. For the most affected patient, we found evidence that the BCI could outperform the best assistive technology (AT) of the patient in terms of control accuracy, reaction time and information transfer rate. We credit this success to the applied user-centered design approach and to a highly flexible technical setup. State-of-the art machine learning methods allowed the exploitation and combination of multiple relevant features contained in the EEG, which rapidly enabled the patients to gain substantial BCI control. Thus, we could show the feasibility of a flexible and tailorable BCI application in severely disabled users. This can be considered a significant success for two reasons: Firstly, the results were obtained within a short period of time, matching the tight clinical requirements. Secondly, the participating patients showed, compared to most other studies, very severe communication deficits. They were dependent on everyday use of AT and two patients were in a locked-in state. For the most affected patient a reliable communication was rarely possible with existing AT.

It is known that thousands of isoforms bind themselves through specific homophilic interactions, a process which provides the basis for cellular self-recognition. Detailed biochemical studies of specific isoforms strongly suggest that homophilic binding, i.e. the formation of homodimers by identical Dscam1 isomers, is of great importance for the self-avoidance of neurons. Due to experimental limitations, it is currently impossible to measure the homophilic binding affinities for all 19,000 potential isoforms. Results: Here we reconstructed the DNA sequences of an ancestral Dscam form (which likely existed approximately 40 similar to 50 million years ago) using a comparative genomic approach. On the basis of this sequence, we established a working model to predict the self-binding affinities of all isoforms in both the current and the ancestral genome, using machine-learning methods. Detailed computational analysis was performed to compare the self-binding affinities of all isoforms present in these two genomes. Our results revealed that 1) isoforms containing newly derived variable domains exhibit higher self-binding affinities than those with conserved domains, and 2) current isoforms display higher self-binding affinities than their counterparts in the ancient genome. As thousands of Dscam isoforms are needed for the self-avoidance of the neuron, we propose that an increase in self-binding affinity provides the basis for the successful evolution of the arthropod brain. Conclusions: Our data presented here provide an excellent model for future experimental studies of the binding behavior of Dscam isoforms. The results of our analysis indicate that evolution favored the rise of novel variable domains thanks to their higher self-binding affinities, rather than selection merely on the basis of simple expansion of isoform diversity, as that this particular selection process would have established the powerful mechanisms required for neuronal self-avoidance. Thus, we reveal here a new molecular mechanism for the successful evolution of arthropod brains.

Improved prediction of peptide detectability for targeted proteomics using a rank-based algorithm and organism-specific data	JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS			English	Article						Targeted proteomics; Peptide detectability; Machine learning; Rank prediction algorithms; Proteotypic peptides; SRM	PROTEIN INFERENCE PROBLEM; TANDEM MASS-SPECTROMETRY; ACID INDEX DATABASE; QUANTITATIVE PROTEOMICS; SHOTGUN PROTEOMICS; GLOBAL ANALYSIS; RNA-SEQ; QUANTIFICATION; REPRODUCIBILITY; IDENTIFICATION	The in silico prediction of the best-observable "proteotypic" peptides in mass spectrometry-based workflows is a challenging problem. Being able to accurately predict such peptides would enable the informed selection of proteotypic peptides for targeted quantification of previously observed and non-observed proteins for any organism, with a significant impact for clinical proteomics and systems biology studies. Current prediction algorithms rely on physicochemical parameters in combination with positive and negative Mining sets to identify those peptide properties that most profoundly affect their general detectabllity. Here we present PeptideRank, an approach that uses learning to rank algorithm for peptide detectability prediction from shotgun proteomics data, and that eliminates the need to select a negative dataset for the training step. A large number of different peptide properties are used to train ranking models in order to predict a ranking of the best-observable peptides within a protein. Empirical evaluation with rank accuracy metrics showed that PeptideRank complements existing prediction algorithms. Our results indicate that the best performance is achieved when it is trained on organism-specific shotgun proteomics data, and that PeptideRank is most accurate for short to medium-sized and abundant proteins, without any loss in prediction accuracy for the important class of membrane proteins. Biological significance Targeted proteomics approaches have been gaining a lot of momentum and hold immense potential for systems biology studies and clinical proteomics. However, since only very few complete proteomes have been reported to date, for a considerable fraction of a proteome there is no experimental proteomics evidence that would allow to guide the selection of the best-suited proteotypic peptides (PTPs), i.e. peptides that are specific to a given proteoform and that are repeatedly observed in a mass spectrometer. We describe a novel, rank-based approach for the prediction of the best-suited PTPs for targeted proteomics applications. By building on methods developed in the field of information retrieval (e.g. web search engines like Google's PageRank), we circumvent the delicate step of selecting positive and negative training sets and at the same time also more closely reflect the experimentalist's need for selecting e.g. the 5 most promising peptides for targeting a protein of interest.

J	Serra, I; Girardi, R; Novais, P				Serra, Ivo; Girardi, Rosario; Novais, Paulo			Evaluating techniques for learning non-taxonomic relationships of ontologies from text	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Learning non-taxonomic relationships; Ontology; Ontology learning; Natural language processing; Machine learning	WEB	Learning non-taxonomic relationships is a sub-field of Ontology Learning that aims at automating the extraction of these relationships from text. Several techniques have been proposed based on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. However just like for other techniques for Ontology Learning, evaluating techniques for learning non-taxonomic relationships is an open problem. Three general proposals suggest that the learned ontologies can be evaluated in an executable application or by domain experts or even by a comparison with a predefined reference ontology. This article proposes two procedures to evaluate techniques for learning non-taxonomic relationships based on the comparison of the relationships obtained with those of a reference ontology. Also, these procedures are used in the evaluation of two state of the art techniques performing the extraction of relationships from two corpora in the domains of biology and Family Law.

Comparisons were performed on the KOSPI 200 Index options from January 2001 to December 2010. To verify the statistical differences between the compared methods, we tested the following null hypothesis: two series of forecasting errors have the same mean-squared value. The experimental study reveals that non-parametric methods significantly outperform parametric methods on both in-sample pricing and out-of-sample pricing. The outperforming non-parametric method is statistically different from the other models, and significantly different from the parametric models. The Gaussian process model delivers the most outstanding performance in forecasting, and also provides the predictive distribution of option prices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Garcia-Rudolph, A; Gibert, K				Garcia-Rudolph, Alejandro; Gibert, Karina			A data mining approach to identify cognitive NeuroRehabilitation Range in Traumatic Brain Injury patients	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Machine learning; Algorithms; Statistics	DECISION-TREE ANALYSIS; REHABILITATION; EXPERIENCE; PLASTICITY; PREDICTION; REGRESSION; VARIABLES	Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) treatment consists of hierarchically organized tasks that require repetitive use of impaired cognitive functions in a progressively more demanding sequence. Active monitoring of the progress of the subjects is therefore required, and the difficulty of the tasks must be progressively increased, always pushing the subjects to reach a goal just beyond what they can attain. There is an important lack of well-established criteria by which to identify the right tasks to propose to the patient. In this paper, the NeuroRehabilitation Range (NRR) is introduced as a means of identifying formal operational models. These are to provide the therapist with dynamic decision support information for assigning the most appropriate CR plan to each patient. Data mining techniques are used to build data-driven models for NRR. The Sectorized and Annotated Plane (SAP) is proposed as a visual tool by which to identify NRR, and two data-driven methods to build the SAP are introduced and compared. Application to a specific representative cognitive task is presented. The results obtained suggest that the current clinical hypothesis about NRR might be reconsidered. Prior knowledge in the area is taken into account to introduce the number of task executions and task performance into NRR models and a new model is proposed which outperforms the current clinical hypothesis. The NRR is introduced as a key concept to provide an operational model identifying when a patient is experiencing activities in his or her Zone of Proximal Development and, consequently, experiencing maximum improvement. For the first time, data collected through a CR platform has been used to find a model for the NRR. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Meteorological data from the Karso watershed in India (consisting of 3801 daily records from the year 2000 to 2010) were used to develop and test the models for daily pan evaporation estimation. The measured meteorological variables include daily observations of rainfall, minimum and maximum air temperatures, minimum and maximum humidity, and sunshine hours. Prior to model development, the Gamma Test (GT) was used to derive estimates of the noise variance for each input-output set in order to identify the most useful predictors for use in the machine learning approaches used in this study. The ANN models consisted of feed forward backpropagation (FFBP) models with Bayesian Regularization (BR), along with the LevenbergMarquardt (LM) algorithm. A comparison was made between the estimates provided by the ANN, LSSVR, Fuzzy Logic, and ANFIS models. The empirical Hargreaves and Samani method (HGS), as well as the Stephens-Stewart (SS) method, were also considered for comparison with the newer machine learning methods. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Correlation Coefficient (CORR) were the statistical performance indices that were used to evaluate the accuracy of the various models. Based on the comparison, it was found that the Fuzzy Logic and LS-SVR approaches can be employed successfully in modeling the daily evaporation process from the available climatic data. In addition, results showed that the machine learning models outperform the traditional HGS and SS empirical methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The objective of this paper is to review the recent published segmentation and classification techniques and their state-of-the-art for the human brain magnetic resonance images (MRI). The review reveals the CAD systems of human brain MRI images are still an open problem. In the light of this review we proposed a hybrid intelligent machine learning technique for computer-aided detection system for automatic detection of brain tumor through magnetic resonance images. The proposed technique is based on the following computational methods; the feedback pulse-coupled neural network for image segmentation, the discrete wavelet transform for features extraction, the principal component analysis for reducing the dimensionality of the wavelet coefficients, and the feed forward back-propagation neural network to classify inputs into normal or abnormal. The experiments were carried out on 101 images consisting of 14 normal and 87 abnormal (malignant and benign tumors) from a real human brain MRI dataset. The classification accuracy on both training and test images is 99% which was significantly good. Moreover, the proposed technique demonstrates its effectiveness compared with the other machine learning recently published techniques. The results revealed that the proposed hybrid approach is accurate and fast and robust. Finally, possible future directions are suggested. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper examines and compares some machine learning regression methods to develop a predictive model, which can predict hourly full load electrical power output of a combined cycle power plant. The base load operation of a power plant is influenced by four main parameters, which are used as input variables in the dataset, such as ambient temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, and exhaust steam pressure. These parameters affect electrical power output, which is considered as the target variable. The dataset, which consists of these input and target variables, was collected over a six-year period. First, based on these variables the best subset of the dataset is explored among all feature subsets in the experiments. Then, the most successful machine learning regression method is sought for predicting full load electrical power output. Thus, the best performance of the best subset, which contains A complete set of input variables, has been observed using the most successful method, which is Bagging algorithm with REPTree, with a mean absolute error of 2.818 and a Root Mean-Squared Error of 3.787.

First, a new SR approach, called Extended Spectral Regression (ESR), is proposed to perform manifold learning on a huge number of data samples. Then, an efficient Bag-of-Words (BOW) based method is developed which employs ESR to encapsulate local visual features with their semantic, spatial, scale, and orientation information for scene recognition. In many applications, such as image classification and multimedia analysis, there are a huge number of low-level feature samples in a training set. It prohibits direct application of SR to perform manifold learning on such dataset In ESR, we first group the samples into tiny clusters, and then devise an approach to reduce the size of the similarity matrix for graph learning. In this way, the subspace learning on graph Laplacian for a vast dataset is computationally feasible on a personal computer. In the ESR-based scene recognition, we first propose an enhanced low-level feature representation which combines the scale, orientation, spatial position, and local appearance of a local feature. Then, ESR is applied to embed enhanced low-level image features. The ESR-based feature embedding not only generates a low dimension feature representation but also integrates various aspects of low-level features into the compact representation. The bag-of-words is then generated from the embedded features for image classification. The comparative experiments on open benchmark datasets for scene recognition demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline approaches. It is suitable for real-time applications on mobile platforms, e.g. tablets and smart phones. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Study on the effectiveness of anomaly detection for spam filtering	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Spam filtering; Anomaly detection; Secure e-commerce; Computer security	IDENTIFICATION; MODELS	Spam has become an important problem for computer security because it is a channel for spreading threats, including computer viruses, worms and phishing. Currently, more than 85% of received emails are spam. Historical approaches to combating these messages, including simple techniques such as sender blacklisting or using email signatures, are no longer completely reliable on their own. Many solutions utilise machine-learning approaches trained with statistical representations of the terms that usually appear in the emails. Nevertheless, these methods require a time-consuming training step with labelled data. Dealing with the limited availability of labelled training instances slows down the progress of filtering systems and offers advantages to spammers. In this paper, we present a study of the effectiveness of anomaly detection applied to spam filtering, which reduces the necessity of labelling spam messages and only employs the representation of one class of emails (i.e., legitimate or spam). This study includes a presentation of the first anomaly based spam filtering system, an enhancement of this system that applies a data reduction algorithm to the labelled dataset to reduce processing time while maintaining detection rates and an analysis of the suitability of choosing legitimate emails or spam as a representation of normality.

Implementation of different spam detection methods based on machine learning techniques was proposed to solve the problem of numerous email spam ravaging the system. Previous algorithm used in email spam detection compares each email message with spam and non-spam data before generating detectors while our proposed system inspired by the artificial immune system model with the adaptive nature of negative selection algorithm uses special features to generate detectors to cover the spam space. To cope with the trend of email spam, a novel model that improves the random generation of a detector in negative selection algorithm (NSA) with the use of stochastic distribution to model the data point using particle swarm optimization (PSO) was implemented. Local outlier factor is introduced as the fitness function to determine the local best (Pbest) of the candidate detector that gives the optimum solution. Distance measure is employed to enhance the distinctiveness between the non-spam and spam candidate detector. The detector generation process was terminated when the expected spam coverage is reached. The theoretical analysis and the experimental result show that the detection rate of NSA-PSO is higher than the standard negative selection algorithm.

Efficient crowdsourcing of unknown experts using bounded multi-armed bandits	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Crowdsourcing; Machine learning; Multi-armed bandits; Budget limitation		Increasingly, organisations flexibly outsource work on a temporary basis to a global audience of workers. This so-called crowdsourcing has been applied successfully to a range of tasks, from translating text and annotating images, to collecting information during crisis situations and hiring skilled workers to build complex software. While traditionally these tasks have been small and could be completed by non-professionals, organisations are now starting to crowdsource larger, more complex tasks to experts in their respective fields. These tasks include, for example, software development and testing, web design and product marketing. While this emerging expert crowdsourcing offers flexibility and potentially lower costs, it also raises new challenges, as workers can be highly heterogeneous, both in their costs and in the quality of the work they produce. Specifically, the utility of each outsourced task is uncertain and can vary significantly between distinct workers and even between subsequent tasks assigned to the same worker. Furthermore, in realistic settings, workers have limits on the amount of work they can perform and the employer will have a fixed budget for paying workers. Given this uncertainty and the relevant constraints, the objective of the employer is to assign tasks to workers in order to maximise the overall utility achieved. To formalise this expert crowdsourcing problem, we introduce a novel multi-armed bandit (MAB) model, the bounded MAB. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm to solve it efficiently, called bounded epsilon-first, which proceeds in two stages: exploration and exploitation. During exploration, it first uses epsilon B of its total budget B to learn estimates of the workers' quality characteristics. Then, during exploitation, it uses the remaining (1 - epsilon)B to maximise the total utility based on those estimates. Using this technique allows us to derive an O (B-2/3) upper bound on its performance regret (i.e., the expected difference in utility between our algorithm and the optimum), which means that as the budget B increases, the regret tends to 0. In addition to this theoretical advance, we apply our algorithm to real-world data from oDesk, a prominent expert crowdsourcing site. Using data from real projects, including historic project budgets, expert costs and quality ratings, we show that our algorithm outperforms existing crowdsourcing methods by up to 300%, while achieving up to 95% of a hypothetical optimum with full information.

This model exploits the inherent voxel contextual information of the structures of interest in order to improve its segmentation performance results. Without any feature set or learning algorithm prior assumption, the proposed scheme directly seeks to learn the contextual properties of a region from the predicted classifications of previous classifiers within an iterative scheme. Performance results regarding segmentation accuracy in three two-class and multi-class medical volume datasets show a significant improvement with respect to state of the art alternatives. Due to its easiness of implementation and its independence of feature space and learning algorithm, the presented machine learning framework could be taken into consideration as a first choice in complex volume segmentation scenarios.

J	Castro, M; Goes, LFW; Mehaut, JF				Castro, Marcio; Goes, Luis Fabricio W.; Mehaut, Jean-Francois			Adaptive thread mapping strategies for transactional memory applications	JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING			English	Article						Transactional memory; Thread mapping; Adaptivity; Multicore	PARALLELISM	Transactional Memory (TM) is a programmer friendly alternative to traditional lock-based concurrency. Although it intends to simplify concurrent programming, the performance of the applications still relies on how frequent they synchronize and the way they access shared data. These aspects must be taken into consideration if one intends to exploit the full potential of modern multicore platforms. Since these platforms feature complex memory hierarchies composed of different levels of cache, applications may suffer from memory latencies and bandwidth problems if threads are not properly placed on cores. An interesting approach to efficiently exploit the memory hierarchy is called thread mapping. However, a single fixed thread mapping cannot deliver the best performance when dealing with a large range of transactional workloads, TM systems and platforms. In this article, we propose and implement in a TM system a set of adaptive thread mapping strategies for TM applications to tackle this problem. They range from simple strategies that do not require any prior knowledge to strategies based on Machine Learning techniques. Taking the Linux default strategy as baseline, we achieved performance improvements of up to 64.4% on a set of synthetic applications and an overall performance improvement of up to 16.5% on the standard STAMP benchmark suite.

Stable Atlas-based Mapped Prior (STAMP) machine-learning segmentation for multicenter large-scale MRI data	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Article						Segmentation; Machine learning; Random forest; Multicenter study	BRAIN-TISSUE SEGMENTATION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CLINICAL-TRIALS; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; INTRACRANIAL VOLUME; CLASSIFICATION; FUSION; REGISTRATION	Machine learning (ML)-based segmentation methods are a common technique in the medical image processing field. In spite of numerous research groups that have investigated ML-based segmentation frameworks, there remains unanswered aspects of performance variability for the choice of two key components: ML algorithm and intensity normalization. This investigation reveals that the choice of those elements plays a major part in determining segmentation accuracy and generalizability. The approach we have used in this study aims to evaluate relative benefits of the two elements within a subcortical MRI segmentation framework. Experiments were conducted to contrast eight machine-learning algorithm configurations and 11 normalization strategies for our brain MR segmentation framework. For the intensity normalization, a Stable Atlas-based Mapped Prior (STAMP) was utilized to take better account of contrast along boundaries of structures. Comparing eight machine learning algorithms on down-sampled segmentation MR data, it was obvious that a significant improvement was obtained using ensemble-based ML algorithms (i.e., random forest) or ANN algorithms. Further investigation between these two algorithms also revealed that the random forest results provided exceptionally good agreement with manual delineations by experts. Additional experiments showed that the effect of STAMP-based intensity normalization also improved the robustness of segmentation for multicenter data sets. The constructed framework obtained good multicenter reliability and was successfully applied on a large multicenter MR data set (n > 3000). Less than 10% of automated segmentations were recommended for minimal expert intervention. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using the ML-based segmentation tools for processing large amount of multicenter MR images. We demonstrated dramatically different result profiles in segmentation accuracy according to the choice of ML algorithm and intensity normalization chosen. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Most existing techniques tend not to perform well on minority class instances when the dataset is highly skewed because they focus on minimising the forecasting error without considering the relative distribution of each class. This investigation proposes an emerging multi-agent architecture, grounded on cooperative learning, to solve the class-imbalanced classification problem. Additionally, this study deals further with the obscure nature of the multi-agent architecture and expresses comprehensive rules for auditors. The results from this study indicate that the presented model performs satisfactorily in risk management and is able to tackle a highly class-imbalanced dataset comparatively well. Furthermore, the knowledge visualised process, supported by real examples, can assist both internal and external auditors who must allocate limited detecting resources; they can take the rules as roadmaps to modify the auditing programme.

These questions were used to determine the current state of the art in this particular strand of TM and suggest future directions in TM development to support cancer research. Methods: A review of the research on TM of cancer-related information was carried out. A literature search was conducted on the Medline database as well as IEEE Xplore and ACM digital libraries to address the interdisciplinary nature of such research. The search results were supplemented with the literature identified through Google Scholar. Results: A range of studies have proven the feasibility of TM for extracting structured information from clinical narratives such as those found in pathology or radiology reports. In this article, we provide a critical overview of the current state of the art for TM related to cancer. The review highlighted a strong bias towards symbolic methods, e.g. named entity recognition (NER) based on dictionary lookup and information extraction (IE) relying on pattern matching. The F-measure of NER ranges between 80% and 90%, while that of IE for simple tasks is in the high 90s. To further improve the performance, TM approaches need to deal effectively with idiosyncrasies of the clinical sublanguage such as non-standard abbreviations as well as a high degree of spelling and grammatical errors. This requires a shift from rule-based methods to machine learning following the success of similar trends in biological applications of TM. Machine learning approaches require large training datasets, but clinical narratives are not readily available for TM research due to privacy and confidentiality concerns. This issue remains the main bottleneck for progress in this area. In addition, there is a need for a comprehensive cancer ontology that would enable semantic representation of textual information found in narrative reports. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Associative classification has aroused significant research interest in recent years due to its superior accuracy. Traditional association rule mining algorithms often yield many redundant and sometimes conflicting class association rules. This paper presents a new, efficient associative classification approach. This new approach produces a compact classifier with a small number of association rules, yet with good classification performance. This approach is based on a novel rule quality metric, named as Principality, which measures an association rule's classification accuracy and coverage for a specific class. Heuristic methods utilizing the Principality metric are applied to rule pruning and associative classifier construction to produce a compact classifier. This Principal Association Mining (PAM) approach is confirmed to be effective at improving classification accuracy as well as decreasing classifier size by experiments conducted on 17 datasets.

However, very little research has considered a multi-granulation perspective. In this paper, we present a new feature selection method that selects distinguishing features by fusing neighborhood multi-granulation. We first use neighborhood rough sets as an effective granular computing tool, and analyze the influence of the granularity of neighborhood information. Then, we obtain all feature rank lists based on the significance of features in different granularities. Finally, we obtain a new feature selection algorithm by fusing all individual feature rank lists. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively select a discriminative feature subset, and performs as well as or better than other popular feature selection algorithms in terms of classification performance.

Due to the increasing size of the problems, removing useless, erroneous or noisy instances is frequently an initial step that is performed before other data mining algorithms are applied. Instance selection as part of this data reduction task is one of the most relevant problems in current data mining research. Over the past decades, many different instance selection algorithms have been proposed, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. However, as in the case of classification, it is unlikely that a single instance selection algorithm would be able to achieve good results across many different datasets and application fields. In classification, one of the most successful ways of consistently improving the performance of a single learner is the construction of ensembles using boosting methods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for instance selection based on boosting instance selection algorithms in the same way boosting is applied to classification. The proposed approach opens a new field of research in which to apply the many techniques developed for boosting classifiers, for instance selection and other data reduction techniques such as feature selection and simultaneous instance and feature selection. Using 60 datasets for balanced problems and 45 datasets for class-imbalanced problems, the experiments reported show a clear improvement in several state-of-the-art instance selection algorithms using the proposed methodology.

Measuring the quality of hybrid opinion mining model for e-commerce application	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Opinion; Classification; Unigram; Bigram; Feature; Mining; Reviews	SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION; REVIEWS; LEXICON; IRONY	With the rapid expansion of e-commerce over the decades, the growth of the user generated content in the form of reviews is enormous on the Web. A need to organize the e-commerce reviews arises to help users and organizations in making an informed decision about the products. Opinion mining systems based on machine learning approaches are used online to categorize the customer opinion into positive or negative reviews. Different from previous approaches that employed single rule based or statistical techniques, we propose a hybrid machine learning approach built under the framework of combination (ensemble) of classifiers with principal component analysis (PCA) as a feature reduction technique. This paper introduces two hybrid models, i.e. PCA with bagging and PCA with Bayesian boosting models for feature based opinion classification of product reviews. The results are compared with two individual classifier models based on statistical learning i.e. logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM). We found that hybrid methods do better in terms of four quality measures like misclassification rate, correctness, completeness and effectiveness in classifying the opinion into positive and negative.

Hence, providing advance failure warning and precise fault detection in such components are pivotal and cost-effective. The vast majority of past research has focused on signal processing and spectral analysis for fault diagnostics in rotating components. In this study, a data mining approach using a machine learning technique called anomaly detection (AD) is presented. This method employs classification techniques to discriminate between defect examples. Two features, kurtosis and Non-Gaussianity Score (NGS), are extracted to develop anomaly detection algorithms. The performance of the developed algorithms was examined through real data from a test to failure bearing. Finally, the application of anomaly detection is compared with one of the popular methods called Support Vector Machine (SVM) to investigate the sensitivity and accuracy of this approach and its ability to detect the anomalies in early stages.

The model embraces various machine learning models such as support vector machine-based and minimax probability machine-based classification and regression models. The unified framework makes it possible to compare and contrast existing learning models and to explain their differences and similarities. In this paper, after relating existing learning models to UMLM, we show some theoretical properties for UMLM. Concretely, we show an interpretation of UMLM as minimizing a well-known financial risk measure (worst-case value-at risk (VaR) or conditional VaR), derive generalization bounds for UMLM using such a risk measure, and prove that solving problems of UMLM leads to estimators with the minimized generalization bounds. Those theoretical properties are applicable to related existing learning models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Speech as an Index of Psychoactive Drug Effects	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; 3,4-METHYLENEDIOXYMETHAMPHETAMINE ECSTASY; PROSOCIAL FEELINGS; THOUGHT-DISORDER; D-AMPHETAMINE; HUMANS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; OXYTOCIN; KETAMINE	Abused drugs can profoundly alter mental states in ways that may motivate drug use. These effects are usually assessed with self-report, an approach that is vulnerable to biases. Analyzing speech during intoxication may present a more direct, objective measure, offering a unique 'window' into the mind. Here, we employed computational analyses of speech semantic and topological structure after +/- 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 'ecstasy') and methamphetamine in 13 ecstasy users. In 4 sessions, participants completed a 10-min speech task after MDMA (0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg), methamphetamine (20 mg), or placebo. Latent Semantic Analyses identified the semantic proximity between speech content and concepts relevant to drug effects. Graph-based analyses identified topological speech characteristics. Group-level drug effects on semantic distances and topology were assessed. Machine-learning analyses (with leave-one-out cross-validation) assessed whether speech characteristics could predict drug condition in the individual subject. Speech after MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) had greater semantic proximity than placebo to the concepts friend, support, intimacy, and rapport. Speech on MDMA (0.75 mg/kg) had greater proximity to empathy than placebo. Conversely, speech on methamphetamine was further from compassion than placebo. Classifiers discriminated between MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) and placebo with 88% accuracy, and MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) and methamphetamine with 84% accuracy. For the two MDMA doses, the classifier performed at chance. These data suggest that automated semantic speech analyses can capture subtle alterations in mental state, accurately discriminating between drugs. The findings also illustrate the potential for automated speech-based approaches to characterize clinically relevant alterations to mental state, including those occurring in psychiatric illness.

The derived models are robust, generalize very well in unseen data, and generated results superior to those of some of the widely used bed load formulae, without the need to set a threshold for the initiation of motion, and consequently avoid predicting erroneous zero transport rates.

This discussion is methods-based and focused on some algorithms that chemoinformatics researchers frequently use. It makes no claim to be exhaustive. We concentrate on methods for supervised learning, predicting the unknown property values of a test set of instances, usually molecules, based on the known values for a training set. Particularly relevant approaches include Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbors and naive Bayes classifiers. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Methods VRQoL was surveyed in 164 glaucomatous patients using the Sumi questionnaire. Their VRQoL score was predicted using machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, gradient boosting, support vector machine) based on total deviation (TD) values from integrated VF (IVF), VA, age and gender. For comparison, VRQoL score was predicted using standard linear regression with mean of IVF, TD values, and VA, and also the stepwise model selection by Akaike Information Criterion. Prediction error was calculated as root mean of the squared prediction error (RMSE) associated with the leave one out cross validation. Results RMSEs associated with general VRQoL score were smaller for the machine learning algorithms (1.99 to 2.21) compared with the standard linear model and the stepwise model selection (2.35 to 3.20). A similar tendency was found in each individual VRQoL task score. Conclusions We found that it was advantageous to use machine learning methods to predict VRQoL accurately. These statistical methods could be used to help clinicians better understand patients' VRQoL without the need for extra tests other than standard VA and VF.

Many existing activity recognition studies employ a supervised machine learning approach and thus require an end user's labeled training data, this approach places a large burden on the user. In this study, we assume that a user wears sensors (accelerometers) on several parts of the body such as the hands, waist, and thigh, and we attempt to share sensor data obtained from only selected accelerometers (e.g., only waist and thigh sensors) among two different activity classes based on a sensor data similarity measure. This approach permits us to correctly learn parameters of an activity classification model by using sufficient quantities of shared sensor data without adding new training data. We confirmed the effectiveness of our method by using 48 h of sensor data obtained from 20 participants, and achieved a good recognition accuracy.

Host Genetic Factors Predisposing to HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder	CURRENT HIV/AIDS REPORTS			English	Article						Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART); Central nervous system; CNS; HIV; HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders; HAND	HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; APOLIPOPROTEIN E4 GENOTYPE; AIDS DEMENTIA COMPLEX; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; DISEASE PROGRESSION; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY; APOE EPSILON-4	The success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in transforming the lives of HIV-infected individuals with access to these drugs is tempered by the increasing threat of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) to their overall health and quality of life. Intensive investigations over the past two decades have underscored the role of host immune responses, inflammation, and monocyte-derived macrophages in HAND, but the precise pathogenic mechanisms underlying HAND remain only partially delineated. Complicating research efforts and therapeutic drug development are the sheer complexity of HAND phenotypes, diagnostic imprecision, and the growing intersection of chronic immune activation with aging-related comorbidities. Yet, genetic studies still offer a powerful means of advancing individualized care for HIV-infected individuals at risk. There is an urgent need for 1) longitudinal studies using consistent phenotypic definitions of HAND in HIV-infected subpopulations at very high risk of being adversely impacted, such as children, 2) tissue studies that correlate neuropathological changes in multiple brain regions with genomic markers in affected individuals and with changes at the RNA, epigenomic, and/or protein levels, and 3) genetic association studies using more sensitive subphenotypes of HAND. The NIH Brain Initiative and Human Connectome Project, coupled with rapidly evolving systems biology and machine learning approaches for analyzing high-throughput genetic, transcriptomic and epigenetic data, hold promise for identifying actionable biological processes and gene networks that underlie HAND. This review summarizes the current state of understanding of host genetic factors predisposing to HAND in light of past challenges and suggests some priorities for future research to advance the understanding and clinical management of HAND in the cART era.

The in silico prediction is an appropriate alternative for the laborious and costly experimental process of drug-target interaction prediction. Developing a variety of computational methods opens a new direction in analyzing and detecting new drug-target pairs. Areas covered: In this review, we will focus on chemogenomic methods which have established a learning framework for predicting drug-target interactions. Learning-based methods are classified into supervised and semi-supervised, and the supervised learning methods are studied as two separate parts including similarity-based methods and feature-based methods. Expert opinion: In spite of many improvements for pharmacology applications by learning-based methods, there are many over simplification settings in construction of predictive models that may lead to over-optimistic results on drug-target interaction prediction.

Whereas in English, Chinese, or Spanish this field has a long history and evaluation datasets for various domains are widely available, in the case of the Czech language no systematic research has yet been conducted. We tackle this issue and establish a common ground for further research by providing a large human-annotated Czech social media corpus. Furthermore, we evaluate state-of-the-art supervised machine learning methods for sentiment analysis. We explore different pre-processing techniques and employ various features and classifiers. We also experiment with five different feature selection algorithms and investigate the influence of named entity recognition and preprocessing on sentiment classification performance. Moreover, in addition to our newly created social media dataset, we also report results for other popular domains, such as movie and product reviews. We believe that this article will not only extend the current sentiment analysis research to another family of languages, but will also encourage competition, potentially leading to the production of high-end commercial solutions.

Previous work in this area has traditionally focused on image-based documents; however, given the prevalence and popularity of the PDF format for dissemination, alternatives to image-based approaches are increasingly being explored. In this paper, we investigate the use of both machine learning techniques and heuristic rules to locate the boundaries of both isolated and embedded formulae within documents, based upon data extracted directly from PDF files. We propose four new features along with preprocessing and post-processing techniques for isolated formula identification. Furthermore, we compare, analyse and extensively tune nine state-of-the-art learning algorithms for a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed methods. The evaluation is carried out over a ground-truth dataset, which we have made publicly available, together with an application adaptable fine-grained evaluation metric. Our experimental results demonstrate that the overall accuracies of isolated and embedded formula identification are increased by 11.52 and 10.65 %, compared with our previously proposed formula identification approach.

Nowadays, there is no standard clinical procedure for assessing bone age and the most widely used approaches are the Greulich and Pyle and the Tanner and Whitehouse methods. Computer methods have been proposed to automatize the process; however, there is a lack of exploration about how to combine the features of the different parts of the hand, and how to take advantage of ensemble techniques for this purpose. This paper presents a study where the use of ensemble techniques for improving bone age assessment is evaluated. Anew computer method was developed that extracts descriptors for each joint of each finger, which are then combined using different ensemble schemes for obtaining a final bone age value. Three popular ensemble schemes are explored in this study: bagging, stacking and voting. Best results were achieved by bagging with a rule-based regression (M5P), scoring a mean absolute error of 10.16 months. Results show that ensemble techniques improve the prediction performance of most of the evaluated regression algorithms, always achieving best or comparable to best results. Therefore, the success of the ensemble methods allow us to conclude that their use may improve computer-based bone age assessment, offering a scalable option for utilizing multiple regions of interest and combining their output.

According to the scores of class separability and variable separability, this criterion measures the significance of feature subset, independent of any specific classification. In addition, a mutual information matrix between variables is used as features for classification, and no prior knowledge about the cardinality of feature subset is required. Experiments are performed by using a standard lung cancer dataset. The obtained solutions are verified with three different classifiers, including the support vector machine (SVM), the back-propagation neural network (BPNN), and the K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and compared with those obtained by the whole feature set, the F-score and the correlation-based feature selection methods. The comparison results show that the proposed intelligent system has a good diagnosis performance and can be used as a promising tool for lung cancer diagnosis.

Learning to expand queries using entities	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						query expansion; information retrieval; machine learning	SET; WEB	A substantial fraction of web search queries contain references to entities, such as persons, organizations, and locations. Recently, methods that exploit named entities have been shown to be more effective for query expansion than traditional pseudorelevance feedback methods. In this article, we introduce a supervised learning approach that exploits named entities for query expansion using Wikipedia as a repository of high-quality feedback documents. In contrast with existing entity-oriented pseudorelevance feedback approaches, we tackle query expansion as a learning-to-rank problem. As a result, not only do we select effective expansion terms but we also weigh these terms according to their predicted effectiveness. To this end, we exploit the rich structure of Wikipedia articles to devise discriminative term features, including each candidate term's proximity to the original query terms, as well as its frequency across multiple article fields and in category and infobox descriptors. Experiments on three Text REtrieval Conference web test collections attest the effectiveness of our approach, with gains of up to 23.32% in terms of mean average precision, 19.49% in terms of precision at 10, and 7.86% in terms of normalized discounted cumulative gain compared with a state-of-the-art approach for entity-oriented query expansion.

Here, we sketch the development of this discipline and compare it to that of the adjacent field of neuroeconomics. We describe three new frontiers for ongoing progress at both theoretical and applied levels. First, the field will broaden its boundaries to include genetics and molecular neuroscience, each of which will provide important new insights into individual differences in decision making. Second, recent advances in computational methods will improve the accuracy and out-of-sample generalizability of predicting decisions from brain activity. Third, sophisticated meta-analyses will help consumer neuroscientists to synthesize the growing body of knowledge, providing evidence for consistency and specificity of brain activations and their reliability as measurements of consumer behavior.

Linking an evolutionary based optimization algorithm with a hydraulic simulation model has gained attention for obtaining the optimal schedule. However, this technique requires significant computation time and thus has difficulty in real-time implementation. This paper presents several tactics to generate warm solutions that can be used in the initial population of the evolutionary algorithms to reduce the computation times. Strategies to generate warm solutions include the use of linear programming, surrogate model known as machine learning or meta-model, and historical pump schedule for similar demand pattern. Providing warm solutions from approximate methods or previous day's results to stochastic search methods can improve solution convergence and offers significant computation time benefits. Results obtained from different strategies are compared.	[Pasha, M. Fayzul.

Firstly, a small amount of training dataset is generated by the structural analysis to train the GP. Then, the implicit performance and its derivatives are approximated by the trained GP using explicit formulations. Secondly, an iterative algorithm called as the GP-based first-order reliability method is implemented to obtain the design point. During iterations, the precision of the GP approximation in the important region, which contributes significantly to the failure probability, is improved continuously by adding the new iterative design point into the training set. Finally, an importance sampling around the design point is applied to obtain the failure probability. To assess the validity of the proposed method, five numerical examples were presented and discussed, which validated that accurate and computationally efficient results for structural reliability analysis can be obtained using the proposed method.

J	Mehdi, M; Bouguila, N; Bentahar, J				Mehdi, Mohamad; Bouguila, Nizar; Bentahar, Jamal			Probabilistic approach for QoS-aware recommender system for trustworthy web service selection	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Web service; Trust; Bayesian network; Online learning; Dirichlet; Beta-Liouville	DIRICHLET DISTRIBUTION; TRUST; MANAGEMENT; DISTRIBUTIONS; PROPORTIONS	We present a QoS-aware recommender approach based on probabilistic models to assist the selection of web services in open, distributed, and service-oriented environments. This approach allows consumers to maintain a trust model for each service provider they interact with, leading to the prediction of the most trustworthy service a consumer can interact with among a plethora of similar services. In this paper, we associate the trust in a service to its performance denoted by QoS ratings instigated by the amalgamation of various QoS metrics. Since the quality of a service is contingent, which renders its trustworthiness uncertain, we adopt a probabilistic approach for the prediction of the quality of a service based on the evaluation of past experiences (ratings) of each of its consumers. We represent the QoS ratings of services using different statistical distributions, namely multinomial Dirichlet, multinomial generalized Dirichlet, and multinomial Beta-Liouville. We leverage various machine learning techniques to compute the probabilities of each web service to belong to different quality classes. For instance, we use the Bayesian inference method to estimate the parameters of the aforementioned distributions, which presents a multidimensional probabilistic embodiment of the quality of the corresponding web services. We also employ a Bayesian network classifier with a Beta-Liouville prior to enable the classification of the QoS of composite services given the QoS of its constituents. We extend our approach to function in an online setting using the Voting EM algorithm that enables the estimation of the probabilities of the QoS after each interaction with a web service. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in modeling, classifying and incrementally learning the QoS ratings.

It corresponds to a player Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network whose weights are updated through an evaluation function that is automatically adjusted by means of the Temporal Difference methods. A Genetic Algorithm automatically chooses a concise and efficient set of functions, which describe various scenarios associated with Checkers - called features - to represent the board states in the input layer of the Neural Network. It means that each individual of the Genetic Algorithm is a candidate set of features that is associated to a distinct Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network. The output layer of the Neural Network is a real number (prediction) that indicates to which extent the input state is favorable to provide a better agent performance. In LS-VisionDraughts, a particular version of the search algorithm Alpha-Beta, called fail-soft Alpha-Beta, combined with Table Transposition, Iterative Deepening and ordered tree, uses this prediction value to choose the best move corresponding to the current board state. The best individual is chosen by means of numerous tournaments involving these selfsame Neural Networks. The architecture of LS-VisionDraught is inspired on the agent NeuroDraughts. However, the former system enhances the performance of the latter by automating the selection of the features through Evolutionary Computation and by replacing its Minimax search algorithm with the improved search strategy resumed above. This procedure allows for a 95 % reduction in the search runtime. Further, it remarkably increases the search tree depth. The results obtained from evaluative tournaments confirm the advances of LS-VisionDraughts compared to its opponents. It is however important to point out that LS-VisionDraughts learns practically without human supervision, contrary to the current automatic world champion Chinook, which has been built in a strongly supervised manner.

Unfortunately, generic search engines do not allow them to identify learning objects among semi-structured candidate educational resources, much less retrieve them by teaching goals. This article describes a multi-strategy approach for semantically guided extraction, indexing and search of educational metadata; it combines machine learning, concept analysis, and corpus-based natural language processing techniques. The overall model was validated by comparing extracted metadata against standard search methods and heuristic-based techniques for Classification Accuracy and Metadata Quality (as evaluated by actual teachers), yielding promising results and showing that this semantically guided metadata extraction can effectively enhance access and use of educational digital material.

Soft biometric traits are unique representation of a person, which can be in a form of physical, behavioural or biological human characteristics that differentiate between him/her into a group people (e.g. gender, age, height, colour, race etc.). Keystroke dynamics is a behavioural biometric modality to recognise how a person types on a keyboard. In this paper, we consider the following soft traits: the hand category (i.e. if the user types with one or two hands), the gender category, the age category and the handedness category. For this purpose, we collected a new database. Two cases are studied: static passwords and free text. By combining machine learning and fusion process, the results are promising.

The study of meetings is important, but also challenging, as it requires an understanding of social signals and complex interpersonal dynamics. Our aim in this work is to use a data-driven approach to the science of meetings. We provide tentative evidence that: (i) it is possible to automatically detect when during the meeting a key decision is taking place, from analyzing only the local dialogue acts, (ii) there are common patterns in the way social dialogue acts are interspersed throughout a meeting, (iii) at the time key decisions are made, the amount of time left in the meeting can be predicted from the amount of time that has passed, (iv) it is often possible to predict whether a proposal during a meeting will be accepted or rejected based entirely on the language (the set of persuasive words) used by the speaker.

This paper proposes a new representation of time series, which in contrast to existing approaches, decomposes a time-series dataset into latent patterns and membership weights of local segments to those patterns. The process is formalized as a constrained objective function and a tailored stochastic coordinate descent optimization is applied. The time-series are projected to a new feature representation consisting of the sums of the membership weights, which captures frequencies of local patterns. Features from various sliding window sizes are concatenated in order to encapsulate the interaction of patterns from different sizes. The derived representation offers a set of features that boosts classification accuracy. Finally, a large-scale experimental comparison against 11 baselines over 43 real life datasets, indicates that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy results.

Further, we attempted to determine a plausible interpretation of SAR model coefficients for the best performing SAR models. This is the most extensive quantitatively based investigation of the species-area relationship so far undertaken in the literature. We gathered 28 different models from the literature and fitted them to sampling data from EcoSim using non-linear regression and Delta AICc as the goodness-of-fit criterion. Afterwards, we proposed a machine-learning approach to find plausible relationships between the models' coefficients and the spatial information that likely affect SARs, as a basis for extracting rules that provide an interpretation of SAR coefficients. We found the power function family to be a reasonable choice and in particular the Plotkin function based on Delta AICc ranking. The Plotkin function was consistently in the top three in terms of the best ranked SAR functions. Furthermore, the simple power function was the best-ranked model in nested sampling amongst models with two coefficients. We found that the Plotkin, quadratic power, Morgan-Mercer-Floid and the generalized cumulative Weibull functions are the best ranked models for small, intermediate, large, and very large scales, respectively, in nested sampling, while Plotkin (in small to intermediate scales) and Chapman-Richards (in large to very large scales) are the best ranked functions in random sampling. Finally, based on rule extractions using machine-learning techniques we were able to find interpretations of the coefficients for the simple and extended power functions. For instance, function coefficients corresponded to sampling scale size, patch number, fractal dimension, average patch size, and spatial complexity. Our main conclusions are that SAR models are highly dependent on sampling scale and sampling approach and that the shape of the best ranked SAR model is convex without an asymptote for smaller scales (small, intermediate) and it is sigmoid for larger scales (large and very large). For some of the SAR model coefficients, there are clear correlations with spatial information, thereby providing an interpretation of these coefficients. In addition, the slope z measuring the rate of species increase for SAR models in the power function family was found to be directly proportional to beta diversity, which confirms the view that beta diversity and SAR models are to some extent both measures of species richness.

Image-based plant phenotyping with incremental learning and active contours	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Agriculture; Phenotyping; Plant segmentation; Machine learning; Gaussian mixture model; Active contour model	ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; ANALYSIS TOOL; SEGMENTATION; GROWTH; GENOTYPE; QUANTIFICATION; SHAPE; HISTOGRAMS; PHENOMICS; KNOWLEDGE	Plant phenotyping investigates how a plant's genome, interacting with the environment, affects the observable traits of a plant (phenome). It is becoming increasingly important in our quest towards efficient and sustainable agriculture. While sequencing the genome is becoming increasingly efficient, acquiring phenotype information has remained largely of low throughput. Current solutions for automated image-based plant phenotyping, rely either on semi-automated or manual analysis of the imaging data, or on expensive and proprietary software which accompanies costly hardware infrastructure. While some attempts,have been made to create software applications that enable the analysis of such images in an automated fashion, most solutions are tailored to particular acquisition scenarios and restrictions on experimental design. In this paper we propose and test, a method for the segmentation and the automated analysis of time-lapse plant images from phenotyping experiments in a general laboratory setting, that can adapt to scene variability. The method involves minimal user interaction, necessary to establish the statistical experiments that may follow. At every time instance (i.e., a digital photograph), it segments the plants in images that contain many specimens of the same species. For accurate plant segmentation we propose a vector valued level set formulation that incorporates features of color intensity, local texture, and prior knowledge. Prior knowledge is incorporated using a plant appearance model implemented with Gaussian mixture models, which utilizes incrementally information from previously segmented instances. The proposed approach is tested on Arabidopsis plant images acquired with a static camera capturing many subjects at the same time. Our validation with ground truth segmentations and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods in the literature shows that the proposed method is able to handle images with complicated and changing background in an automated fashion. An accuracy of 96.7% (dice similarity coefficient) was observed, which was higher than other methods used for comparison. While here it was tested on a single plant species, the fact that we do not employ shape driven models and we do not rely on fully supervised classification (trained on a large dataset) increases the ease of deployment of the proposed solution for the study of different plant species in a variety of laboratory settings. Our solution will be accompanied by an easy to use graphical user interface and, to facilitate adoption, we will make the software available to the scientific community. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Applying machine learning based on multiscale classifiers to detect remote phenology patterns in Cerrado savanna trees	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Remote phenology; Digital cameras; Machine learning; Image analysis; Tropical forests	CLIMATE-CHANGE; CLASSIFICATION; IMAGES; FEATURES; IMPACTS; FORESTS; GROWTH	Plant phenology is one of the most reliable indicators of species responses to global climate change, motivating the development of new technologies for phenological monitoring. Digital cameras or near remote systems have been efficiently applied as multi-channel imaging sensors, where leaf color information is extracted from the RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) color channels, and the changes in green levels are used to infer leafing patterns of plant species. In this scenario, texture information is a great ally for image analysis that has been little used in phenology studies. We monitored leaf-changing patterns of Cerrado savanna vegetation by taking daily digital images. We extract RGB channels from the digital images and correlate them with phenological changes. Additionally, we benefit from the inclusion of textural metrics for quantifying spatial heterogeneity. Our first goals are: (1) to test if color change information is able to characterize the phenological pattern of a group of species; (2) to test if the temporal variation in image texture is useful to distinguish plant species; and (3) to test if individuals from the same species may be automatically identified using digital images. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach based on multiscale classifiers to detect phenological patterns in the digital images. Our results indicate that: (1) extreme hours (morning and afternoon) are the best for identifying plant species; (2) different plant species present a different behavior with respect to the color change information; and (3) texture variation along temporal images is promising information for capturing phenological patterns. Based on those results, we suggest that individuals from the same species and functional group might be identified using digital images, and introduce a new tool to help phenology experts in the identification of new individuals from the same species in the image and their location on the ground.

Applications of Machine Learning and Data Mining Methods to Detect Associations of Rare and Common Variants with Complex Traits	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						machine learning methods; penalized regression; support vector machine; sparse principal components; permanental classification; sparse graphical model; rare variants	VARIABLE SELECTION; REGULARIZATION; LIKELIHOOD; REGRESSION; LASSO	Machine learning methods (MLMs), designed to develop models using high-dimensional predictors, have been used to analyze genome-wide genetic and genomic data to predict risks for complex traits. We summarize the results from six contributions to our Genetic Analysis Workshop 18 working group; these investigators applied MLMs and data mining to analyses of rare and common genetic variants measured in pedigrees. To develop risk profiles, group members analyzed blood pressure traits along with single-nucleotide polymorphisms and rare variant genotypes derived from sequence and imputation analyses in large Mexican American pedigrees. Supervised MLMs included penalized regression with varying penalties, support vector machines, and permanental classification. Unsupervised MLMs included sparse principal components analysis and sparse graphical models. Entropy-based components analyses were also used to mine these data. None of the investigators fully capitalized on the genetic information provided by the complete pedigrees. Their approaches either corrected for the nonindependence of the individuals within the pedigrees or analyzed only those who were independent. Some methods allowed for covariate adjustment, whereas others did not. We evaluated these methods using a variety of metrics. Four contributors conducted primary analyses on the real data, and the other two research groups used the simulated data with and without knowledge of the underlying simulation model. One group used the answers to the simulated data to assess power and type I errors.

Ray			Evolutionary Dynamics of Information Diffusion Over Social Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Evolutionary game; game theory; information diffusion; information spreading; social networks	GAME-THEORETIC APPROACH; VIEW	Current social networks are of extremely large-scale generating tremendous information flows at every moment. How information diffuses over social networks has attracted much attention from both industry and academics. Most of the existing works on information diffusion analysis are based on machine learning methods focusing on social network structure analysis and empirical data mining. However, the network users' decisions, actions, and socio-economic interactions are generally ignored by most of existing works. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic framework to model the dynamic information diffusion process in social networks. Specifically, we derive the information diffusion dynamics in complete networks, uniform degree, and nonuniform degree networks, with the highlight of two special networks, the Erdos-Renyi random network and the Barabasi-Albert scale-free network. We find that the dynamics of information diffusion over these three kinds of networks are scale-free and all the three dynamics are same with each other when the network scale is sufficiently large. To verify our theoretical analysis, we perform simulations for the information diffusion over synthetic networks and real-world Facebook networks. Moreover, we also conduct an experiment on a Twitter hashtags dataset, which shows that the proposed game theoretic model can well fit and predict the information diffusion over real social networks.

As a result, human factors have gained attention in the software industry. Software Project Managers are decisive to achieve project success. A competent project manager is capable of solving any problem that an organization may encounter, regardless of its complexity. This paper presents I-Competere which is a tool developed to forecast competence gaps in key management personnel by predicting planning and scheduling competence levels. Based on applied intelligence techniques, I-Competere allows the forecast and anticipation of competence needs thus articulating personnel development tools and techniques. The results of the test, using several artificial neural networks, are more than promising and show prediction accuracy.

Prediction of fracture characteristics of high strength and ultra high strength concrete beams based on relevance vector machine	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DAMAGE MECHANICS			English	Article						Relevance vector machine; ultra high strength concrete; high strength concrete; fracture characteristics; variance		This paper examines the applicability of relevance vector machine-based regression to predict fracture characteristics and failure load (P-max) of high strength and ultra high strength concrete beams. Fracture characteristics include fracture energy (G(F)), critical stress intensity factor (K-IC) and critical crack tip opening displacement. Characterization of mix and testing of beams of high strength and ultra high strength concrete have been described briefly. The procedure to compute G(F), K-IC and CTODC has been outlined. Relevance vector machine is a machine learning technique that uses Bayesian inference to obtain parsimonious solutions for regression and classification. The relevance vector machine has an identical functional form to the support vector machine, but provides probabilistic classification and regression. Relevance vector machine is based on a Bayesian formulation of a linear model with an appropriate prior that results in a sparse representation. Four relevance vector machine models have been developed using MATLAB software for training and prediction of P-max, K-IC, G(F) and CTODC. Relevance vector machine models have been trained with about 70% of the total 87 datasets and tested with about 30% of the total datasets. It is observed that the predicted values from the relevance vector machine models are in good agreement with those of the experimental values.

However, this tool may be very slow in some practical applications. Many techniques have been discussed to speed up the performance of this algorithm and allow its use in an even broader range of applications. Although the backpropagation algorithm has been used for decades, we present here a set of computational results that suggest that by replacing bihyperbolic functions the backpropagation algorithm performs better than the traditional sigmoid functions. To the best of our knowledge, this finding was never previously published in the open literature. The efficiency and discrimination capacity of the proposed methodology are shown through a set of computational experiments, and compared with the traditional problems of the literature.

Software Fault Prediction at Design Phase	JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Software metrics; Machine learning; Design metric; Fault prediction		Prediction of fault-prone modules continues to attract researcher's interest due to its significant impact on software development cost. The most important goal of such techniques is to correctly identify the modules where faults are most likely to present in early phases of software development lifecycle. Various software metrics related to modules level fault data have been successfully used for prediction of fault-prone modules. Goal of this research is to predict the faulty modules at design phase using design metrics of modules and faults related to modules. We have analyzed the effect of pre-processing and different machine learning schemes on eleven projects from NASA Metrics Data Program which offers design metrics and its related faults. Using seven machine learning and four preprocessing techniques we confirmed that models built from design metrics are surprisingly good at fault proneness prediction. The result shows that we should choose Naive Bayes or Voting feature intervals with discretization for different data sets as they outperformed out of 28 schemes. Naive Bayes and Voting feature intervals has performed AUC > 0.7 on average of eleven projects. Our proposed framework is effective and can predict an acceptable level of fault at design phases.

In the medical domain, there have been a number of studies on NER in English clinical notes; however, very limited NER research has been carried out on clinical notes written in Chinese. The goal of this study was to systematically investigate features and machine learning algorithms for NER in Chinese clinical text. Materials and methods We randomly selected 400 admission notes and 400 discharge summaries from Peking Union Medical College Hospital in China. For each note, four types of entity clinical problems, procedures, laboratory test, and medications were annotated according to a predefined guideline. Two-thirds of the 400 notes were used to train the NER systems and one-third for testing. We investigated the effects of different types of feature including bag-of-characters, word segmentation, part-of-speech, and section information, and different machine learning algorithms including conditional random fields (CRF), support vector machines (SVM), maximum entropy (ME), and structural SVM (SSVM) on the Chinese clinical NER task. All classifiers were trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the test set, and micro-averaged precision, recall, and F-measure were reported. Results Our evaluation on the independent test set showed that most types of feature were beneficial to Chinese NER systems, although the improvements were limited. The system achieved the highest performance by combining word segmentation and section information, indicating that these two types of feature complement each other. When the same types of optimized feature were used, CRF and SSVM outperformed SVM and ME. More specifically, SSVM achieved the highest performance of the four algorithms, with F-measures of 93.51% and 90.01% for admission notes and discharge summaries, respectively.

Assisted annotation of medical free text using RapTAT	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							CLINICAL TEXT; QUALITY	Objective To determine whether assisted annotation using interactive training can reduce the time required to annotate a clinical document corpus without introducing bias. Materials and methods A tool, RapTAT, was designed to assist annotation by iteratively pre-annotating probable phrases of interest within a document, presenting the annotations to a reviewer for correction, and then using the corrected annotations for further machine learning-based training before pre-annotating subsequent documents. Annotators reviewed 404 clinical notes either manually or using RapTAT assistance for concepts related to quality of care during heart failure treatment. Notes were divided into 20 batches of 19-21 documents for iterative annotation and training. Results The number of correct RapTAT pre-annotations increased significantly and annotation time per batch decreased by similar to 50% over the course of annotation. Annotation rate increased from batch to batch for assisted but not manual reviewers. Pre-annotation F-measure increased from 0.5 to 0.6 to >0.80 (relative to both assisted reviewer and reference annotations) over the first three batches and more slowly thereafter. Overall inter-annotator agreement was significantly higher between RapTAT-assisted reviewers (0.89) than between manual reviewers (0.85). Discussion The tool reduced workload by decreasing the number of annotations needing to be added and helping reviewers to annotate at an increased rate. Agreement between the pre-annotations and reference standard, and agreement between the pre-annotations and assisted annotations, were similar throughout the annotation process, which suggests that pre-annotation did not introduce bias. Conclusions Pre-annotations generated by a tool capable of interactive training can reduce the time required to create an annotated document corpus by up to 50%.

The patient-level perspective differs from the prevailing natural language processing (NLP) practice of evaluating at the term, event, sentence, document, or visit level. Methods We utilized an existing pediatric asthma cohort with manual annotations. After generating a basic feature set via standard clinical NLP methods, we introduce six methods of aggregating time-distributed features from the document level to the patient level. These aggregation methods are used to classify patients according to their asthma status in two hypothetical settings: retrospective epidemiology and clinical decision support. Results In both settings, solid patient classification performance was obtained with machine learning algorithms on a number of evidence aggregation methods, with Sum aggregation obtaining the highest F-1 score of 85.71% on the retrospective epidemiological setting, and a probability density function-based method obtaining the highest F-1 score of 74.63% on the clinical decision support setting. Multiple techniques also estimated the diagnosis date (index date) of asthma with promising accuracy, Discussion The clinical decision support setting is a more difficult problem. We rule out some aggregation methods rather than determining the best overall aggregation method, since our preliminary data set represented a practical setting in which manually annotated data were limited. Conclusion Results contrasted the strengths of several aggregation algorithms in different settings. Multiple approaches exhibited good patient classification performance, and also predicted the timing of estimates with reasonable accuracy.

Supervised machine learning and active learning in classification of radiology reports	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							TEXT CLASSIFICATION	Objective This paper presents an automated system for classifying the results of imaging examinations (CT, MRI, positron emission tomography) into reportable and non-reportable cancer cases. This system is part of an industrial-strength processing pipeline built to extract content from radiology reports for use in the Victorian Cancer Registry. Materials and methods In addition to traditional supervised learning methods such as conditional random fields and support vector machines, active learning (AL) approaches were investigated to optimize training production and further improve classification performance. The project involved two pilot sites in Victoria, Australia (Lake Imaging (Ballarat) and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (Melbourne)) and, in collaboration with the NSW Central Registry, one pilot site at Westmead Hospital (Sydney). Results The reportability classifier performance achieved 98.25% sensitivity and 96.14% specificity on the cancer registry's held-out test set. Up to 92% of training data needed for supervised machine learning can be saved by AL. Discussion AL is a promising method for optimizing the supervised training production used in classification of radiology reports. When an AL strategy is applied during the data selection process, the cost of manual classification can be reduced significantly. Conclusions The most important practical application of the reportability classifier is that it can dramatically reduce human effort in identifying relevant reports from the large imaging pool for further investigation of cancer. The classifier is built on a large real-world dataset and can achieve high performance in filtering relevant reports to support cancer registries.	[Nguyen, Dung H.

Traditional classification problem assumes that the misclassification for each category has the same cost, and the target of learning algorithm is to minimize the expected error rate. In cost-sensitive learning, costs of misclassification for samples of different categories are not the same; the target of algorithm is to minimize the sum of misclassification cost. Cost-sensitive learning can meet the actual demand of real-life classification problems, such as medical diagnosis, financial projections, and so on. Due to fast learning speed and perfect performance, extreme learning machine (ELM) has become one of the best classification algorithms, while voting based on extreme learning machine (V-ELM) makes classification results more accurate and stable. However, V-ELM and some other versions of ELM are all based on the assumption that all misclassifications have same cost. Therefore, they cannot solve cost-sensitive problems well. To overcome the drawback of ELMs mentioned above, an algorithm called cost-sensitive ELM (CS-ELM) is proposed by introducing misclassification cost of each sample into V-ELM. Experimental results on gene expression data show that CS-ELM is effective in reducing misclassification cost.

Predicting the binding affinity of protien- protien complexes is one of the challenging problems in computational and molecular biology. In this work, we related sequence features of protein protein complexes with their binding affinities using machine learning approaches.we set up a database of 185 protein Protein complexes for which the interacting pairs are lieteroditners and their experimental biinding affinities are available. On the other hand, we have developed a set of 610 features from the sequences of protein complexes and utilized Ranker search method, which is the combination of Attribute evaluator and Ranker method for selecting specific features. We have analyzed several machine learning algorithms to discriminate protein protein complexes into high combination of nine features using support vector machines. Further, we observed accuracy of 83.3% on an independent test set of 30 complexes. We suggest that our method would serve as an effective tool for indentifying the interacting partners in protein protein Interaction networks and human pathogen interactions based on the strength of interactions.

Currently, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a popular and common modeling approach. In this paper, we investigate methods, including LDA and its extensions, for separating a set of scientific publications into several clusters. To evaluate the results, we generate a collection of documents that contain academic papers from several different fields and see whether papers in the same field will be clustered together.

Although they make our lives easier, increasing P2P traffic leads to many problems in management and security. Classifying P2P traffic accurately is becoming more critical for network management and P2P malware detection. Many methods have been proposed for P2P traffic classification, such as port-based, signature-based, pattern-based, and statistics-based methods. However, with the development of anti-identification techniques from port disguise to payload encryption or even packet size controlling, a single method is not enough to classify P2P traffic accurately. In this paper, an improved two-step hybrid P2P traffic classifier is proposed. The first step is a signature-based classifier at the packet-level combined with connection heuristics. The second step consists of a statistics-based classifier and pattern heuristics, and classifies the remaining unknown traffic at the flow level. Based on the analysis of various machine learning algorithms, the statistics-based classifier is implemented with REPTree, a decision tree algorithm. Through verification with real datasets, it is shown that our hybrid scheme provides high accuracy and low overhead compared to other hybrid schemes.

Here, we present a new prediction method that can identify novel AMPs that are highly similar in sequence to known peptides but offer improved antimicrobial activity along with lower host cytotoxicity. Using previously generated AMP amino acid substitution data, we developed an amino acid activity contribution matrix that contained an activity contribution value for each amino acid in each position of the model peptide. A series of AMPs were designed with this method. After evaluating the antimicrobial activities of these novel AMPs against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains, DP7 was chosen for further analysis. Compared to the parent peptide HH2, this novel AMP showed broad-spectrum, improved antimicrobial activity, and in a cytotoxicity assay it showed lower toxicity against human cells. The in vivo antimicrobial activity of DP7 was tested in a Staphylococcus aureus infection murine model. When inoculated and treated via intraperitoneal injection, DP7 reduced the bacterial load in the peritoneal lavage solution. Electron microscope imaging and the results indicated disruption of the S. aureus outer membrane by DP7. Our new prediction method can therefore be employed to identify AMPs possessing minor amino acid differences with improved antimicrobial activities, potentially increasing the therapeutic agents available to combat multidrug-resistant infections.

Color information is indispensable for the clinical diagnosis malignant melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. For this reason, most of the currently accepted dermoscopic scoring systems either directly or indirectly incorporate color as a diagnostic criterion. For example, both the asymmetry, border, colors, and dermoscopic (ABCD) rule of dermoscopy and the more recent color, architecture, symmetry, and homogeneity (CASH) algorithm include the number of clinically significant colors in their calculation of malignancy scores. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to the automated quantification of clinically significant colors in dermoscopy images. Given a true-color dermoscopy image with N colors, we first reduce the number of colors in this image to a small numberK, i.e., K << N, using the K-means clustering algorithm incorporating a spatial term. The optimal K value for the image is estimated separately using five commonly used cluster validity criteria. We then train a symbolic regression algorithm using the estimates given by these criteria, which are calculated on a set of 617 images. Finally, the mathematical equation given by the regression algorithm is used for two-class (benign versus malignant) classification. The proposed approach yields a sensitivity of 62% and a specificity of 76% on an independent test set of 297 images.	[Celebi, M.

In majority of published work by various researchers so far, most of the methods need manually mark the label of land cover types. In the proposed framework, all the information, like land cover types and their features, is defined as prior knowledge achieved from land use maps, topographic data, texture data, vegetation's growth cycle and field data. The land cover classification is treated as an automatically supervised learning procedure, which can be divided into automatic sample selection and fuzzy supervised classification. Once a series of features were extracted from multi-source datasets, spectral matching method is used to determine the degrees of membership of auto-selected pixels, which indicates the probability of the pixel to be distinguished as a specific land cover type. In order to make full use of this probability, a fuzzy support vector machine (SVM) classification method is used to handle samples with membership degrees. This method is applied to Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data of two areas located in Northern China. The automatic classification results are compared with visual interpretation. Experimental results show that the proposed method classifies the remote sensing data with a competitive and stable accuracy, and demonstrate that an objective land cover classification result is achievable by combining several advanced machine learning methods.

Even though many prognostic gene lists and predictors have been proposed, especially for breast cancer, high-throughput "omic" methods have so far not revolutionized clinical practice, and their clinical utility has not been satisfactorily established. Different prognostic gene lists have very few shared genes, the biological meaning of most signatures is unclear, and the published success rates are considered to be overoptimistic. This review examines critically the manner in which prognostic classifiers are derived using machine-learning methods and suggests reasons for the shortcomings and problems listed above. Two approaches that may hold hope for obtaining improved prognosis are presented. Both are based on using existing prior knowledge; one proposes combining molecular "omic" predictors with established clinical ones, and the second infers biologically relevant pathway deregulation scores for each tumor from expression data, and uses this representation to study and stratify individual tumors. Approaches such as the second one are referred to in the physics literature as "phenomenology"; they will, hopefully, play a significant role in future studies of cancer. (C) 2014 AACR.

Runtime Optimizations for Tree-based Machine Learning Models	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Web search; general information storage and retrieval; information technology and systems; scalability and efficiency; learning to rank; regression trees		Tree-based models have proven to be an effective solution for web ranking as well as other machine learning problems in diverse domains. This paper focuses on optimizing the runtime performance of applying such models to make predictions, specifically using gradient-boosted regression trees for learning to rank. Although exceedingly simple conceptually, most implementations of tree-based models do not efficiently utilize modern superscalar processors. By laying out data structures in memory in a more cache-conscious fashion, removing branches from the execution flow using a technique called predication, and micro-batching predictions using a technique called vectorization, we are able to better exploit modern processor architectures. Experiments on synthetic data and on three standard learning-to-rank datasets show that our approach is significantly faster than standard implementations.

A total of 239 Chinese cabbage seed samples including 8 varieties were acquired by hyperspectral image system, 158 for calibration and the rest 81 for validation. A region of 15 pixel x 15 pixel was selected as region of interest (ROI) and the average spectral information of ROI was obtained as sample spectral information. Multiplicative scatter correction was selected as pretreatment method to reduce the noise of spectrum. The performance of four classification algorithms including Ada-boost algorithm, extreme learning machine (ELM), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) were examined in this study. In order to simplify the input variables, 10 effective wavelengths (EMS) including 1 002, 1 005, 1 015, 1 019, 1 022, 1 103, 1 106, 1 167, 1 237 and 1 409 nm were selected by analysis of variable load distribution in PLS model. The reflectance of effective wavelengths was taken as the input variables to build effective wavelengths based models. The results indicated that the classification accuracy of the four models based on full-spectral were over 90%, the optimal models were extreme learning machine and random forest, and the classification accuracy achieved 100%. The classification accuracy of effective wavelengths based models declined slightly but the input variables compressed greatly, the efficiency of data processing was improved, and the classification accuracy of EW-ELM model achieved 100%. ELM performed well both in full-spectral model and in effective wavelength based model in this study, it was proven to be a useful tool for spectral analysis. So rapid and nondestructive recognition of Chinese cabbage seeds by hyperspectral imaging combined with machine learning is feasible, and it provides a new method for on line batch variety recognition of Chinese cabbage seeds.

Brut is based on the Random Forest algorithm, and uses bubbles identified by >35,000 citizen scientists from the Milky Way Project to discover the identifying characteristics of bubbles in images from the Spitzer Space Telescope. We demonstrate that Brut's ability to identify bubbles is comparable to expert astronomers. We use Brut to re-assess the bubbles in the Milky Way Project catalog, and find that 10%-30% of the objects in this catalog are non-bubble interlopers. Relative to these interlopers, high-reliability bubbles are more confined to the mid-plane, and display a stronger excess of young stellar objects along and within bubble rims. Furthermore, Brut is able to discover bubbles missed by previous searches-particularly bubbles near bright sources which have low contrast relative to their surroundings. Brut demonstrates the synergies that exist between citizen scientists, professional scientists, and machine learning techniques. In cases where "untrained" citizens can identify patterns that machines cannot detect without training, machine learning algorithms like Brut can use the output of citizen science projects as input training sets, offering tremendous opportunities to speed the pace of scientific discovery. A hybrid model of machine learning combined with crowdsourced training data from citizen scientists can not only classify large quantities of data, but also address the weakness of each approach if deployed alone.

Abductive Learning Ensembles for Hand Shape Identification	COGNITIVE COMPUTATION			English	Article						Pattern recognition; Hand recognition; Biometric authentication; Geometric features; Polynomial neural networks; Ensemble learning	RECOGNITION; PALMPRINT; AUTHENTICATION; BIOMETRICS	A novel method is presented for hand shape identification based on abductive machine learning. We developed several models and investigated their performance on raw hand shape data for 20 and 40 participants in the form of three different categories of geometric measurements: twelve finger features, two palm features, and three whole hand features. Performance was compared when using each category of features separately and when combining them together. Moreover, we describe two novel and more effective approaches using an ensemble of three abductive networks combined at either the score level or the decision level. The effect of doubling the number of participants from 20 to 40 was studied as well. The ensemble approach achieved overall identification accuracies of 100 and 98.3333 % for the 20-participant and 40-participant datasets, respectively. This compares favorably with other learning approaches tried on the same datasets, including decision trees, support vector machines, and rule-based classifiers.

(2) Does there exist unified framework for feedforward neural networks and feature space methods? ELMs that have built some tangible links between machine learning techniques and biological learning mechanisms have recently attracted increasing attention of researchers in widespread research areas. This paper provides an insight into ELMs in three aspects, viz: random neurons, random features and kernels. This paper also shows that in theory ELMs (with the same kernels) tend to outperform support vector machine and its variants in both regression and classification applications with much easier implementation.

The system is composed of distributed Web services, which implement machine-learning solutions dedicated to constructing the decision models directly from the datasets impaired by the high percentage of missing values of the attributes and imbalanced class distribution. The issue of the imbalanced data is solved by the application of a cost-sensitive support vector machine and the problem of missing values of attributes is handled by proposing the novel ensemble-based approach that splits the incomplete data space into complete subspaces that are further used to construct base learners. We evaluate the quality of the SOSDS components using three ontological datasets.

DREAM: Diabetic Retinopathy Analysis Using Machine Learning	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Bright lesions; classification; diabetic retinopathy (DR); fundus image processing; red lesions; segmentation; severity grade	COLOR FUNDUS PHOTOGRAPHS; AUTOMATIC DETECTION; RETINAL IMAGES; SYSTEM; MICROANEURYSMS; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS	This paper presents a computer-aided screening system (DREAM) that analyzes fundus images with varying illumination and fields of view, and generates a severity grade for diabetic retinopathy (DR) using machine learning. Classifiers such as the Gaussian Mixture model (GMM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), and AdaBoost are analyzed for classifying retinopathy lesions from nonlesions. GMM and kNN classifiers are found to be the best classifiers for bright and red lesion classification, respectively. A main contribution of this paper is the reduction in the number of features used for lesion classification by feature ranking using Adaboost where 30 top features are selected out of 78. A novel two-step hierarchical classification approach is proposed where the nonlesions or false positives are rejected in the first step. In the second step, the bright lesions are classified as hard exudates and cotton wool spots, and the red lesions are classified as hemorrhages and micro-aneurysms. This lesion classification problem deals with unbalanced datasets and SVM or combination classifiers derived from SVM using the Dempster-Shafer theory are found to incur more classification error than the GMM and kNN classifiers due to the data imbalance. The DR severity grading system is tested on 1200 images from the publicly available MESSIDOR dataset. The DREAM system achieves 100% sensitivity, 53.16% specificity, and 0.904 AUC, compared to the best reported 96% sensitivity, 51% specificity, and 0.875 AUC, for classifying images as with or without DR. The feature reduction further reduces the average computation time for DR severity per image from 59.54 to 3.46 s.

Since the number of parameters to be assessed is generally exponential in n, improving the efficiency is an important concern in knowledge engineering. Non-impeding noisy-AND (NIN-AND) tree causal models reduce the number of parameters to being linear in n, while explicitly expressing both reinforcing and undermining interactions among causes. The key challenge in NIN-AND tree modeling is the acquisition of the NIN-AND tree structure. In this paper, we formulate a concise structure representation and an expressive causal interaction function of NIN-AND trees. Building on these representations, we propose two structural acquisition methods, which are applicable to both elicitation-based and machine learning-based acquisitions. Their accuracy is demonstrated through experimental evaluations.

We tested the algorithms on a 44-h signal database built from hybrid sensors worn by eight PD patients and four healthy subjects who carried out unscripted and unconstrained activities of daily living in an apartment-like environment. Comparison of the performance of our machine-learning algorithms against independent clinical annotations of disorder presence and severity demonstrates that, despite their differing approaches to dynamic pattern classification, dynamic neural networks, dynamic support vector machines, and hidden Markov models were equally effective in keeping error rates of the dynamic tracking well below 10%. A common set of experimentally derived signal features were used to train the algorithm without the need for subject-specific learning. We also found that error rates below 10% are achievable even when our algorithms are tested on data from a sensor location that is different from those used in algorithm training.

To identify novel C. burnetii effectors, we applied a machine-learning approach to predict C. burnetii effectors, and examination of 20 such proteins resulted in the identification of 13 novel effectors. To determine whether these effectors, as well as several previously identified effectors, modulate conserved eukaryotic pathways, they were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The effects on yeast growth were examined under regular growth conditions and in the presence of caffeine, a known modulator of the yeast cell wall integrity (CWI) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. In the presence of caffeine, expression of the effectors CBU0885 and CBU1676 caused an enhanced inhibition of yeast growth, and the growth inhibition of CBU0388 was suppressed. Furthermore, analysis of synthetic lethality effects and examination of the activity of the CWI MAP kinase transcription factor Rlm1 indicated that CBU0388 enhances the activation of this MAP kinase pathway in yeast, while CBU0885 and CBU1676 abolish this activation. Additionally, coexpression of CBU1676 and CBU0388 resulted in mutual suppression of their inhibition of yeast growth. These results strongly indicate that these three effectors modulate the CWI MAP kinase pathway in yeast. Moreover, both CBU1676 and CBU0885 were found to contain a conserved haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) domain, which was found to be required for their activity. Collectively, our results demonstrate that MAP kinase pathways are most likely targeted by C. burnetii Icm/Dot effectors.

However, the disproportion in the number of three dimensional (3D) protein structures generated versus their classification into relevant superfamilies/families emphasizes the need for automated classification schemes. Predicting function of novel proteins based on sequence information alone has proven to be a major challenge. The present study focuses on the use of physicochemical parameters in conjunction with machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines) to classify proteins into their respective SCOP superfamily/Pfam family, using sequence derived information. Spectrophores (TM), a 1D descriptor of the 3D molecular field surrounding a structure was used as a benchmark to compare the performance of the physicochemical parameters. The machine learning algorithms were modified to select features based on information gain for each SCOP superfamily/Pfam family. The effect of combining physicochemical parameters and spectrophores on classification accuracy (CA) was studied. Machine learning algorithms trained with the physicochemical parameters consistently classified SCOP superfamilies and Pfam families with a classification accuracy above 90%, while spectrophores performed with a CA of around 85%. Feature selection improved classification accuracy for both physicochemical parameters and spectrophores based machine learning algorithms. Combining both attributes resulted in a marginal loss of performance. Physicochemical parameters were able to classify proteins from both schemes with classification accuracy ranging from 90-96%. These results suggest the usefulness of this method in classifying proteins from amino acid sequences.	[Mohan, Abhilash; Rao, M.

Ranking from binary comparisons is a ubiquitous problem in modern machine learning applications. In this paper, we consider l(1)-norm SVM for ranking. As well known, learning with l(1)-norm restrictions usually leads to sparsity. Moreover, instead of independently draw sample sequence, we are given sample of exponentially strongly mixing sequence. Under some mild conditions, a learning rate is established.

We recorded 179 locations of 54 ringed individuals between 1988 and 2011 to map the species habitat suitability with MaxEnt, a machine-learning technique based on the principle of maximum entropy. The migratory movements of 25 birds equipped with satellite transmitters were used to define the autumnal migratory flyway used by most storks crossing the Peninsula as well as to define the wintering period. The aim was to test if the number of wintering storks was positively correlated to habitat suitability and negatively correlated to the flyway distance. Data provided by an extensive count across Portugal and Spain during the 2012-2013 winter supported the findings that black storks were more abundant in areas of high habitat suitability close to the migratory flyway. This agrees with previous evidence on the role of migratory flyways in determining the distribution of some wintering birds in Iberia. A gap analysis reflected that just 12.3% of the suitable areas and 18.8% of individuals recorded during the 2012-2013 winter were included within the Special Protection Areas network of Portugal and Spain. Most of these birds were crowded in unprotected areas covered by rice fields (68% of individuals), a key habitat for the species.

Bayesian classification methods are among the most popular machine learning approaches for the prediction of activity from chemical structure. Much work has focused on predicting structure-activity relationships (SARs) on the basis of experimental training data. By contrast, only a few efforts have thus far been made to rationalize the performance of Bayesian or other supervised machine learning models and better understand why they might succeed or fail. In this study, we introduce an intuitive approach for the visualization and graphical interpretation of naive Bayesian classification models. Parameters derived during supervised learning are visualized and interactively analyzed to gain insights into model performance and identify features that determine predictions. The methodology is introduced in detail and applied to assess Bayesian modeling efforts and predictions on compound data sets of varying structural complexity. Different classification models and features determining their performance are characterized in detail. A prototypic implementation of the approach is provided.

Prediction of Intramolecular Polarization of Aromatic Amino Acids Using Kriging Machine Learning	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION			English	Article							QUANTUM-CHEMICAL TOPOLOGY; MULTIPOLAR ELECTROSTATICS; FORCE-FIELD; ATOMIC PROPERTIES; MOLECULAR-MECHANICS; STACKING INTERACTIONS; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; ENERGY; BIOMOLECULES; POTENTIALS	Present computing power enables novel ways of modeling polarization. Here we show that the machine learning method kriging accurately captures the way the electron density of a topological atom responds to a change in the positions of the surrounding atoms. The success of this method is demonstrated on the four aromatic amino acids histidine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. A new technique of varying training set sizes to vastly reduce training times while maintaining accuracy is described and applied to each amino acid. Each amino acid has its geometry distorted via normal modes of vibration over all local energy minima in the Ramachandran map. These geometries are then used to train the kriging models. Total electrostatic energies predicted by the kriging models for previously unseen geometries are compared to the true energies, yielding mean absolute errors of 2.9, 5.1, 4.2, and 2.8 kJ mol(1) for histidine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine, respectively.

The potential energy function uses a machine learning method called Kriging to predict the local-frame multipole moments of atoms defined via the Quantum Chemical Topology (QCT) approach. These atomic multipole moments then interact via an interaction tensor based on spherical harmonics. Atom-centered local coordinate frames are used, constructed from the internal geometry of the molecular system. The forces involve derivatives of both this geometric dependence and of the trained kriging models. In the near future, these analytical forces will enable molecular dynamics and geometry optimization calculations as part of the QCT force field.	[Mills, Matthew J.

IPL combines perceptual evaluation with iterative model refinement. Human observers rate the appropriateness of synthesized behaviors in the context of a conversation. These ratings are used to refine the machine learning models that predict the social signal timings. As the ratings correspond to those moments in the conversation where the production of a specific behavior is inappropriate, we regard features extracted at these moments as negative samples for the training of a classifier. This is an advantage over the traditional corpus-based approach to extract negative samples at random non-positive moments. We perform a comparison between IPL and the traditional corpus-based approach on the timing of backchannels for a listener in speaker-listener dialogs. While both models perform similarly in terms of precision and recall scores, there is a tendency that the backchannels generated with IPL are rated as more appropriate. We additionally investigate the effect of the amount of available training data and the variation of training data on the outcome of the models.

Staging information is critical for diagnosing the extent of cancer in a patient and for planning individualised treatment. Extracting such information into more structured form saves time, improves reporting, and underpins the potential for automated decision support. Methods and material: We investigate the portability of a text mining model constructed from records from one health centre, by applying it directly to the extraction task over a set of records from a different health centre, with different reporting narrative characteristics. Other than a simple normalisation step on features associated with target labels, we apply the models from one system directly to the other. Results: The best F-scores for in-hospital experiments are 81%, 85%, and 94% (for staging T, N, and M respectively), while best cross-hospital F-scores reach 84%, 81%, and 91% for the same respective categories. Conclusions: Our performance results compare favourably to the best levels reported in the literature, and most relevant to our aim here the cross-corpus results demonstrate the portability of the models we developed.

J	Kim, S; Park, T; Kon, M				Kim, Shinuk; Park, Taesung; Kon, Mark			Cancer survival classification using integrated data sets and intermediate information	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Machine learning algorithm; Integration of data sets; Intermediate information; Survival time classification	SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA; GENE-EXPRESSION; BREAST-CANCER; OVARIAN-CANCER; PATIENT SURVIVAL; UP-REGULATION; LUNG-CANCER; MICRORNA; APOPTOSIS; PROFILES	Objective: Although numerous studies related to cancer survival have been published, increasing the prediction accuracy of survival classes still remains a challenge. Integration of different data sets, such as microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA, might increase the accuracy of survival class prediction. Therefore, we suggested a machine learning (ML) approach to integrate different data sets, and developed a novel method based on feature selection with Cox proportional hazard regression model (FSCOX) to improve the prediction of cancer survival time. Methods: FSCOX provides us with intermediate survival information, which is usually discarded when separating survival into 2 groups (short- and long-term), and allows us to perform survival analysis. We used an ML-based protocol for feature selection, integrating information from miRNA and mRNA expression profiles at the feature level. To predict survival phenotypes, we used the following classifiers, first, existing ML methods, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), second, a new median-based classifier using FSCOX (FSCOX_median), and third, an SVM classifier using FSCOX (FSCOX_SVM). We compared these methods using 3 types of cancer tissue data sets: (i) miRNA expression, (ii) mRNA expression, and (iii) combined miRNA and mRNA expression. The latter data set included features selected either from the combined miRNA/mRNA profile or independently from miRNAs and mRNAs profiles (IFS). Results: In the ovarian data set, the accuracy of survival classification using the combined miRNA/mRNA profiles with IFS was 75% using RF, 86.36% using SVM, 84.09% using FSCOX_median, and 88.64% using FSCOX_SVM with a balanced 22 short-term and 22 long-term survivor data set. These accuracies are higher than those using miRNA alone (70.45%, RF; 75%, SVM; 75%, FSCOX_median; and 75%, FSCOX_SVM) or mRNA alone (65.91%, RF; 63.64%, SVM; 72.73%, FSCOX_median; and 70.45%, FSCOX_SVM). Similarly in the glioblastoma multiforme data, the accuracy of miRNA/mRNA using IFS was 75.51% (RF), 87.76% (SVM) 85.71% (FSCOX_median), 85.71% (FSCOX_SVM). These results are higher than the results of using miRNA expression and mRNA expression alone. In addition we predict 16 hsa-miR-23b and hsa-miR-27b target genes in ovarian cancer data sets, obtained by SVM-based feature selection through integration of sequence information and gene expression profiles. Conclusion: Among the approaches used, the integrated miRNA and mRNA data set yielded better results than the individual data sets. The best performance was achieved using the FSCOX_SVM method with independent feature selection, which uses intermediate survival information between short-term and long-term survival time and the combination of the 2 different data sets. The results obtained using the combined data set suggest that there are some strong interactions between miRNA and mRNA features that are not detectable in the individual analyses.

Optimal hunting conditions drive circalunar behavior of a diurnal carnivore	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						circalunar behavior; diurnal carnivore; machine-learning; moonlight; optimal hunting; time budgets	AFRICAN WILD DOGS; CHEETAH ACINONYX-JUBATUS; PREDATION RISK; NATIONAL-PARK; PREY PREFERENCES; MOONLIGHT; AVOIDANCE; SERENGETI; TIME; MAMMALS	Foraging requirements and predation risk shape activity patterns and temporal behavior patterns widely across taxa. Although this has been extensively studied in small mammals, the influence of predation and prey acquisition on the activity and behavior of large carnivores has received little attention. The diurnal activity described as typical for cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) has been explained in terms of their avoidance of antagonistic interactions with other larger predators. However, a recent study revealed that cheetahs are frequently active at night, especially during periods of full moon. Being both predator and "prey" in an environment with comparatively high densities of larger and competitively dominant nocturnal predator species, we investigated whether cheetah nocturnal behavior could be explained by favorable conditions for 1) predator avoidance or 2) prey acquisition. We used a data set of continuously recorded behavior created using machine-learning techniques on behavioral data collected in the field to transform recorded 2D activity values from radio-collars into 3 distinct behavioral states (feeding, moving, and resting). We found that 32.5% of cheetah feeding behavior occurred at night and that, in the dry season, nocturnal feeding behavior was positively correlated with moonlight intensity. Our results suggest that nocturnal and circalunar behavior of cheetahs is driven by optimal hunting conditions, outweighing the risks of encountering other predators. Using novel methodology, the results provide new insights into the temporal distribution of behavior, contributing to our understanding of the importance of moonlight and season on the behavior patterns of diurnal species.

J	Caramiaux, B; Francoise, J; Schnell, N; Bevilacqua, F				Caramiaux, Baptiste; Francoise, Jules; Schnell, Norbert; Bevilacqua, Frederic			Mapping Through Listening	COMPUTER MUSIC JOURNAL			English	Article							AUDITORY-MOTOR INTERACTIONS; MUSICAL EXPRESSION; PERCEPTION; GESTURE; AUDIO; WORLD; HEAR	Gesture-to-sound mapping is generally defined as the association between gestural and sound parameters. This article describes an approach that brings forward the perception-action loop as a fundamental design principle for gesture-sound mapping in digital music instrument. Our approach considers the processes of listening as the foundation-and the first step-in the design of action-sound relationships. In this design process, the relationship between action and sound is derived from actions that can be perceived in the sound. Building on previous work on listening modes and gestural descriptions, we propose to distinguish between three mapping strategies: instantaneous, temporal, and metaphorical. Our approach makes use of machine-learning techniques for building prototypes, from digital music instruments to interactive installations. Four different examples of scenarios and prototypes are described and discussed.

A multi-theoretical kernel-based approach to social network-based recommendation	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Social network; Recommender systems; Non-linear multiple kernel learning	LINK-PREDICTION; CRITICAL MASS; TRUST; SYSTEMS; ALGORITHMS; DIFFUSION; FRAMEWORK; MEDIA; MODEL; GRAPH	Recommender systems are a critical component of e-commerce websites. The rapid development of online social networking services provides an opportunity to explore social networks together with information used in traditional recommender systems, such as customer demographics, product characteristics, and transactions. It also provides more applications for recommender systems. To tackle this social network-based recommendation problem, previous studies generally built trust models in light of the social influence theory. This study inspects a spectrum of social network theories to systematically model the multiple facets of a social network and infer user preferences. In order to effectively make use of these heterogonous theories, we take a kernel-based machine learning paradigm, design and select kernels describing individual similarities according to social network theories, and employ a non-linear multiple kernel learning algorithm to combine the kernels into a unified model. This design also enables us to consider multiple theories' interactions in assessing individual behaviors. We evaluate our proposed approach on a real-world movie review data set The experiments show that our approach provides more accurate recommendations than trust-based methods and the collaborative filtering approach. Further analysis shows that kernels derived from contagion theory and homophily theory contribute a larger portion of the model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, L; Peng, T				Liu, Lu; Peng, Tao			Clustering-based Method for Positive and Unlabeled Text Categorization Enhanced by Improved TFIDF	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						text classification; reliable negative examples; clustering; C-CRNE; WVC	IMAGE RETRIEVAL; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION; DOCUMENTS	PU learning occurs frequently in Web pages classification and text retrieval applications because users may be interested in information on the same topic. Collecting reliable negative examples is a key step in PU (Positive and Unlabeled) text classification, which solves a key problem in machine learning when no labeled negative examples are available in the training set or negative examples are difficult to collect. Thus, this paper presents a novel clustering-based method for collecting reliable negative examples (C-CRNE). Different from traditional methods, we remove as many probable positive examples from unlabeled set as possible, which results that more reliable negative examples are found out. During the process of building classifier, a novel TFIDF-improved feature weighting approach, which reflects the importance of the term in the positive and negative training examples respectively, is presented to describe documents in the Vector Space Model. We also build a weighted voting classifier by iteratively applying the SVM algorithm and implement OCS (One-class SVM), PEBL (Positive Example Based Learning) and 1-DNFII (Constrained 1-DNF) methods used for comparison. Experimental results on three real-world datasets (Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1), Reuters-21578 and 20 Newsgroups) show that our proposed C-CRNE extracts more reliable negative examples than the baseline algorithms with very low error rates. And our classifier outperforms other state-of-art classification methods from the perspective of traditional performance metrics.

This study presents two improved algorithms based on machine learning approaches for efficient estimation of saturation pressure of reservoir oil. To achieve the research purpose, a large data set, comprising of more than 750 crude oil samples with different composition and geographical origins, was collected from the literature for development of the models. The efficiency of the proposed models was tested against sixteen well-known empirical correlations. The proposed models show good performance in terms of accuracy with the lowest error percentage and highest R-2 values. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Machine learning approaches to investigate the impact of PCBs on the transcriptome of the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Machine learning; Transcriptome; Bottlenose dolphin; Ecogenomics; Environmental contaminant exposure; Biotoxin exposure	PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; GENE-EXPRESSION; STRIPED DOLPHINS; STENELLA-COERULEOALBA; DNA-REPAIR; BLOOD; ORGANOCHLORINE; MICROARRAY; COAST; SEA	As top-level predators, common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are particularly sensitive to chemical and biological contaminants that accumulate and biomagnify in the marine food chain. This work investigates the potential use of microarray technology and gene expression profile analysis to screen common bottlenose dolphins for exposure to environmental contaminants through the immunological and/or endocrine perturbations associated with these agents. A dolphin microarray representing 24,418 unigene sequences was used to analyze blood samples collected from 47 dolphins during capture-release health assessments from five different US coastal locations (Beaufort, NC, Sarasota Bay, FL, Saint Joseph Bay, FL, Sapelo Island, GA and Brunswick, GA). Organohalogen contaminants including pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners were determined in blubber biopsy samples from the same animals. A subset of samples (n = 10, males; n = 8, females) with the highest and the lowest measured values of PCBs in their blubber was used as strata to determine the differential gene expression of the exposure extremes through machine learning classification algorithms. A set of genes associated primarily with nuclear and DNA stability, cell division and apoptosis regulation, intra- and extra-cellular traffic, and immune response activation was selected by the algorithm for identifying the two exposure extremes. In order to test the hypothesis that these gene expression patterns reflect PCB exposure, we next investigated the blood transcriptomes of the remaining dolphin samples using machine-learning approaches, including K-nn and Support Vector Machines classifiers. Using the derived gene sets, the algorithms worked very well (100% success rate) at classifying dolphins according to the contaminant load accumulated in their blubber. These results suggest that gene expression profile analysis may provide a valuable means to screen for indicators of chemical exposure. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using multi variate data mining techniques for estimating fire susceptibility of Tyrolean forests	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Forest fire; RandomForest; MaxEnt; spatial distribution; Austria; Alps	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; LANDSCAPE; MANAGEMENT; RISK; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; REGRESSION; IGNITIONS	Forest fires in the Alps might become more hazardous in the future due to their linkage to high temperatures and drought periods. To understand the driving forces and the actual distribution patterns of forest fires is crucial to adapt to those future challenges. We used the province Tyrol in Austria as a case study area. We tested two machine learning algorithms (MaxEnt and RandomForests) for their capability in use with historic fire data and environmental datasets. Presence-only data of 399 forest fires between 1993 and 2011 was compared with a range of topography, vegetation, climate and socio-economic datasets, in order to find out the main driving parameters of the spatial forest fire distribution and to delimit areas of particular fire danger. The results of both algorithms were compared for agreement and differences. Both algorithms delivered broadly similar results; climate (number of days above a certain fire weather index) and anthropogenic parameters (distance to buildings, population density) are the most important parameters in the current alpine fire regime. The models slightly disagreed on the role of forest type and of topography. Joined model results show a strong concentration of potential fire danger along the main valleys and in the drier Tyrolean Upland. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CRISPR loci consist of several repetitive DNA sequences called repeats, inter-spaced by stretches of variable length sequences called spacers. This CRISPR array is transcribed and processed into multiple mature RNA species (crRNAs). A single crRNA is integrated into an interference complex, together with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins, to bind and degrade invading nucleic acids. Although existing bioinformatics tools can recognize CRISPR loci by their characteristic repeat-spacer architecture, they generally output CRISPR arrays of ambiguous orientation and thus do not determine the strand from which crRNAs are processed. Knowledge of the correct orientation is crucial for many tasks, including the classification of CRISPR conservation, the detection of leader regions, the identification of target sites (protospacers) on invading genetic elements and the characterization of protospacer-adjacent motifs. Results: We present a fast and accurate tool to determine the crRNA-encoding strand at CRISPR loci by predicting the correct orientation of repeats based on an advanced machine learning approach. Both the repeat sequence and mutation information were encoded and processed by an efficient graph kernel to learn higher-order correlations. The model was trained and tested on curated data comprising >4500 CRISPRs and yielded a remarkable performance of 0.95 AUC ROC (area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic). In addition, we show that accurate orientation information greatly improved detection of conserved repeat sequence families and structure motifs. We integrated CRISPRstrand predictions into our CRISPRmap web server of CRISPR conservation and updated the latter to version 2.0.

The piRNAs are mostly known to be involved in protecting the genome from invasive transposable elements. But recent discoveries suggest their involvement in the pathophysiology of diseases, such as cancer. Their identification is therefore an important task, and computational methods are needed. However, the lack of conserved piRNA sequences and structural elements makes this identification challenging and difficult. Results: In the present study, we propose a new modular and extensible machine learning method based on multiple kernels and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for piRNA identification. Very few piRNA features are known to date. The use of a multiple kernels approach allows editing, adding or removing piRNA features that can be heterogeneous in a modular manner according to their relevance in a given species. Our algorithm is based on a combination of the previously identified features [sequence features (k-mer motifs and a uridine at the first position) and piRNAs cluster feature] and a new telomere/centromere vicinity feature. These features are heterogeneous, and the kernels allow to unify their representation. The proposed algorithm, named piRPred, gives promising results on Drosophila and Human data and outscores previously published piRNA identification algorithms.

These alterations can cause the loss of function (LoF) of the gene product, for instance, in tumor suppressors, or increase or change its activity or function, if it is an oncogene. Distinguishing between these two classes is important to understand tumorigenesis in patients and has implications for therapy decision making. Here, we assess the capacity of multiple gene features related to the pattern of genomic alterations across tumors to distinguish between activating and LoF cancer genes, and we present an automated approach to aid the classification of novel cancer drivers according to their role. Result: OncodriveROLE is a machine learning-based approach that classifies driver genes according to their role, using several properties related to the pattern of alterations across tumors. The method shows an accuracy of 0.93 and Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.84 classifying genes in the Cancer Gene Census.

J	Mah, YH; Husain, M; Rees, G; Nachev, P				Mah, Yee-Haur; Husain, Masud; Rees, Geraint; Nachev, Parashkev			Human brain lesion-deficit inference remapped	BRAIN			English	Article						lesion-deficit inference; focal brain injury; ischaemic brain injury	CHRONIC SPATIAL NEGLECT; VISUAL NEGLECT; PARIETAL LOBE; ANATOMY; NEUROANATOMY; ATTENTION; CORTEX; DAMAGE	Our knowledge of the anatomical organization of the human brain in health and disease draws heavily on the study of patients with focal brain lesions. Historically the first method of mapping brain function, it is still potentially the most powerful, establishing the necessity of any putative neural substrate for a given function or deficit. Great inferential power, however, carries a crucial vulnerability: without stronger alternatives any consistent error cannot be easily detected. A hitherto unexamined source of such error is the structure of the high-dimensional distribution of patterns of focal damage, especially in ischaemic injury-the commonest aetiology in lesion-deficit studies-where the anatomy is naturally shaped by the architecture of the vascular tree. This distribution is so complex that analysis of lesion data sets of conventional size cannot illuminate its structure, leaving us in the dark about the presence or absence of such error. To examine this crucial question we assembled the largest known set of focal brain lesions (n = 581), derived from unselected patients with acute ischaemic injury (mean age = 62.3 years, standard deviation = 17.8, male: female ratio = 0.547), visualized with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and processed with validated automated lesion segmentation routines. High-dimensional analysis of this data revealed a hidden bias within the multivariate patterns of damage that will consistently distort lesion-deficit maps, displacing inferred critical regions from their true locations, in a manner opaque to replication. Quantifying the size of this mislocalization demonstrates that past lesion-deficit relationships estimated with conventional inferential methodology are likely to be significantly displaced, by a magnitude dependent on the unknown underlying lesion-deficit relationship itself. Past studies therefore cannot be retrospectively corrected, except by new knowledge that would render them redundant. Positively, we show that novel machine learning techniques employing high-dimensional inference can nonetheless accurately converge on the true locus. We conclude that current inferences about human brain function and deficits based on lesion mapping must be re-evaluated with methodology that adequately captures the high-dimensional structure of lesion data.

As they occupy various niches in diverse habitats, one may assume the existence of lifestyle-specific genomic features. We include 240 actinobacteria classified into four pathogenicity classes: human pathogens (HPs), broad-spectrum pathogens (BPs), opportunistic pathogens (OPs) and non-pathogenic (NP). We hypothesize: (H1) Pathogens (HPs and BPs) possess specific pathogenicity signature genes. (H2) The same holds for OPs. (H3) Broad-spectrum and exclusively HPs cannot be distinguished from each other because of an observation bias, i.e. many HPs might yet be unclassified BPs. (H4) There is no intrinsic genomic characteristic of OPs compared with pathogens, as small mutations are likely to play a more dominant role to survive the immune system. To study these hypotheses, we implemented a bioinformatics pipeline that combines evolutionary sequence analysis with statistical learning methods (Random Forest with feature selection, model tuning and robustness analysis). Essentially, we present orthologous gene sets that computationally distinguish pathogens from NPs (H1). We further show a clear limit in differentiating OPs from both NPs (H2) and pathogens (H4). HPs may also not be distinguished from bacteria annotated as BPs based only on a small set of orthologous genes (H3), as many HPs might as well target a broad range of mammals but have not been annotated accordingly. In conclusion, we illustrate that even in the post-genome era and despite next-generation sequencing technology, our ability to efficiently deduce real-world conclusions, such as pathogenicity classification, remains quite limited.

J	Chen, HB; Xu, JG; He, B				Chen, Hongbo; Xu, Jungang; He, Ben			Automated Essay Scoring by Capturing Relative Writing Quality	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						automated essay scoring; learning to rank; data mining		Automated essay-scoring (AES) systems utilize computer techniques and algorithms to automatically rate essays written in an educational setting, by which the workload of human raters is greatly reduced. AES is usually addressed as a classification or regression problem, where classical machine learning algorithms such as K-nearest neighbor and support vector machines are applied. In this paper, we argue that essay rating is based on the comparison of writing quality between essays and treat AES rather as a ranking problem by capturing the difference in writing quality between essays. We propose a rank-based approach that trains an essay-rating model by learning to rank algorithms, which have been widely used in many information retrieval and social Web mining tasks. Various linguistic and statistical features are utilized to facilitate the learning algorithms. Extensive experiments on two public English essay datasets, Automated Student Assessment Prize and Chinese Learners English Corpus, show that our proposed approach based on pairwise learning outperforms previous classification or regression-based methods on all 15 topics. Finally, analysis on the importance of the features extracted reveals that content, organization and structure are the main factors that affect the ratings of essays written by native English speakers, while non-native speakers are prone to losing ratings on improper term usage, syntactic complexity and grammar errors.

However, complex behavioral and social problems often exhibit strong couplings and heterogeneity between values, attributes and objects (i.e., non-IIDness). This fundamentally challenges the IIDness-based learning methodologies and techniques. This paper presents a high-level overview of the needs, challenges and opportunities of non-IIDness learning for handling complex behavioral and social problems. By reviewing the nature and issues of classic IIDness-based algorithms in frequent pattern mining, clustering and classification to complex behavioral and social applications, concepts, structures, frameworks and exemplar techniques are discussed for non-IIDness learning. Case studies, related work and prospects of non-IIDness learning are presented. Non-IIDness learning is also a fundamental issue in big data analytics.

Masking each moving object with a background subtraction method is an effective technique to protect its privacy. However, the background subtraction method is heavily affected by sunshine change, and a redundant masking by over-extraction is inevitable. Such superfluous masking disturbs the quality of video surveillance. In this paper, we propose a moving object masking method combining background subtraction and machine learning based on Real AdaBoost. This method can reduce the superfluous masking while maintaining the reliability of privacy protection. In the experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves about 78-94% accuracy for classifying superfluous masking regions and moving objects.

However, social media data violate this assumption due to the linkages. Meanwhile, with the variety of data, there exist many samples, i.e.. Universum, that do not belong to either class of interest. These characteristics pose great challenges to dealing with social media data. In this letter, we fully take advantage of Universum samples to enable the model to be more discriminative. In addition, the linkages are also taken into consideration in the means of social dimensions. To this end, we propose the algorithm Semi-Supervised Linked samples Feature Selection with Universum (U-SSLFS) to integrate the linking information and Universum simultaneously to select robust features. The empirical study shows that U-SSLFS outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on the Flickr and BlogCatalog.

Over the past few years, several Instance Selection-based MIL (ISMIL) algorithms have been presented by using the concept of the embedding space. Although they delivered very promising performance, they often require long computation times for instance selection, leading to a low efficiency of the whole learning process. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient ISMIL algorithm based on the similarity of pairwise instances within a bag. The basic idea is selecting from every training bag a pair of the most similar instances as instance prototypes and then mapping training bags into the embedding space that is constructed from all the instance prototypes. Thus, the MIL problem can be solved with the standard supervised learning techniques, such as support vector machines. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than its competitors and highly comparable with them in terms of classification accuracy. Moreover, the testing of noise sensitivity demonstrates that our MIL algorithm is very robust to labeling noise.

One common learning scenario that is often possible to apply is learning by imitation, in which the behavior of an exemplary driver provides training instances for a supervised learning algorithm. This article follows this approach in the domain of simulated car racing, using the TORCS simulator. In contrast to most prior work on imitation learning, a symbolic decision tree knowledge representation is adopted, which combines potentially high accuracy with human readability, an advantage that can be important in many applications. Decision trees are demonstrated to be capable of representing high quality control models, reaching the performance level of sophisticated pre-designed algorithms. This is achieved by enhancing the basic imitation learning scenario to include active retraining, automatically triggered on control failures. It is also demonstrated how better stability and generalization can be achieved by sacrificing human-readability and using decision tree model ensembles. The methodology for learning control models contributed by this article can be hopefully applied to solve real-world control tasks, as well as to develop video game bots.

One of the fundamental challenges in accomplishing these goals is the tremendous genetic variability of the virus, with some genes differing at as many as 40% of nucleotide positions among circulating strains. Because of this, the genetic bases of many viral phenotypes, most notably the susceptibility to neutralization by a particular antibody, are difficult to identify computationally. Drawing upon open-source general-purpose machine learning algorithms and libraries, we have developed a software package IDEPI (IDentify EPItopes) for learning genotype-to-phenotype predictive models from sequences with known phenotypes. IDEPI can apply learned models to classify sequences of unknown phenotypes, and also identify specific sequence features which contribute to a particular phenotype. We demonstrate that IDEPI achieves performance similar to or better than that of previously published approaches on four well-studied problems: finding the epitopes of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNab), determining coreceptor tropism of the virus, identifying compartment-specific genetic signatures of the virus, and deducing drug-resistance associated mutations. The cross-platform Python source code (released under the GPL 3.0 license), documentation, issue tracking, and a pre-configured virtual machine for IDEPI can be found at https://github.com/veg/idepi.

A plethora of methods has been suggested to infer PPI from data on a large scale, but none of them is able to characterize the effect of this interaction. Here, we present a novel computational development that employs mitotic phenotypes of a genome-wide RNAi knockdown screen and enables identifying the activating and inhibiting effects of PPIs. Exemplarily, we applied our technique to a knockdown screen of HeLa cells cultivated at standard conditions. Using a machine learning approach, we obtained high accuracy (82% AUC of the receiver operating characteristics) by cross-validation using 6,870 known activating and inhibiting PPIs as gold standard. We predicted de novo unknown activating and inhibiting effects for 1,954 PPIs in HeLa cells covering the ten major signaling pathways of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and made these predictions publicly available in a database. We finally demonstrate that the predicted effects can be used to cluster knockdown genes of similar biological processes in coherent subgroups. The characterization of the activating or inhibiting effect of individual PPIs opens up new perspectives for the interpretation of large datasets of PPIs and thus considerably increases the value of PPIs as an integrated resource for studying the detailed function of signaling pathways of the cellular system of interest.

This report describes our predictive method to facilitate the discovery of novel caspase-3 substrates. To develop a more reliable prediction method, we specifically examined improvement of the data quantity and quality of caspase-3 cleavage sites. The ScreenCap3 method is based on machine learning and on information not only of experimentally verified positive examples but also of negative examples, which were not cleaved by caspase-3. Using information of experimentally verified noncleavage sites, we elucidate novel patterns of amino acids around "actual" cleavage sites. Results show that ScreenCap3 provides substantial improvement in terms of precision, compared with existing methods. Therefore, ScreenCap3 is anticipated for use with proteomic screening and identification of novel caspase-3 substrates and their cleavage sites. ScreenCap3 is available at http://scap.cbrc.jp/ScreenCap3/.

We focus on machine learning-based approaches, particularly similarity-based methods that use drug and target similarities, which show relationships among drugs and those among targets, respectively. These two similarities represent two emerging concepts, the chemical space and the genomic space. Typically, the methods combine these two types of similarities to generate models for predicting new drug-target interactions. This process is also closely related to a lot of work in pharmacogenomics or chemical biology that attempt to understand the relationships between the chemical and genomic spaces. This background makes the similarity-based approaches attractive and promising. This article reviews the similarity-based machine learning methods for predicting drug-target interactions, which are state-of-the-art and have aroused great interest in bioinformatics. We describe each of these methods briefly, and empirically compare these methods under a uniform experimental setting to explore their advantages and limitations.

J	Gong, HP; Liu, XQ; Wu, J; He, ZY				Gong, Haipeng; Liu, Xiaoqing; Wu, Jun; He, Zengyou			Data construction for phosphorylation site prediction	BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						phosphorylation site prediction; classification; Friedman test; generalization performance; Wilcoxon signed-ranks test	MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH; PROTEIN-PHOSPHORYLATION; POSTTRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS; NEURAL-NETWORK; SEQUENCE; TOOL; IDENTIFICATION; SPECIFICITY	Protein phosphorylation is one of the most pervasive post-translational modifications, regulating diverse cellular processes in various organisms. As mass spectrometry-based experimental approaches for identifying phosphorylation events are resource-intensive, many computational methods have been proposed, in which phosphorylation site prediction is formulated as a classification problem. They differ in several ways, and one crucial issue is the construction of training data and test data for unbiased performance evaluation. In this article, we categorize the existing data construction methods and try to answer three questions: (i) Is it equivalent to use different data construction methods in the assessment of phosphorylation site prediction algorithms? (ii) What kind of test data set is unbiased for assessing the prediction performance of a trained algorithm in different real world scenarios? (iii) Among the summarized training data construction methods, which one(s) has better generalization performance for most scenarios? To answer these questions, we conduct comprehensive experimental studies for both non-kinase-specific and kinase-specific prediction tasks. The experimental results show that: (i) different data construction methods can lead to significantly different prediction performance; (ii) there can be different test data construction methods that are unbiased with respect to different real world scenarios; and (iii) different data construction methods have different generalization performance in different real world scenarios. Therefore, when developing new algorithms in future research, people should concentrate on what kind of scenario their algorithm will work for, what the corresponding unbiased test data are and which training data construction method can generate best generalization performance.

Methods: MICs of pyrazinamide were determined for Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, cultured from 58 patients in a previous randomized clinical trial in Cape Town, South Africa. The MICs were determined using BACTEC MGIT 960 for isolates that were collected before standard treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol commenced. Weekly sputum collections were subsequently made for 8 weeks in order to culture M. tuberculosis in Middlebrook broth medium. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was utilized to identify the pyrazinamide MIC predictive of sputum culture results at the end of pyrazinamide therapy. The machine learning-derived susceptibility breakpoints were then confirmed using standard association statistics that took into account confounders of 2 month sputum conversion. Results: The pyrazinamide MIC range was 12.5 to >100 mg/L for the isolates prior to therapy. The epidemiological 95% cut-off value was >100 mg/L. The 2 month sputum conversion rate in liquid cultures was 26% by stringent criteria and 48% by less stringent criteria. CART analysis identified an MIC breakpoint of 50 mg/L, above which patients had poor sputum conversion rates. The relative risk of poor sputum conversion was 1.5 (95% CI: 1.2-1.8) for an MIC >50 mg/L compared with an MIC <= 50 mg/L. Conclusions: We propose a pyrazinamide susceptibility breakpoint of 50 mg/L for clinical decision making and for development of rapid susceptibility assays. This breakpoint is identical to that identified using computer-aided simulations of hollow fibre system output.

Airborne laser scanning data is available for large areas with high resolution and supports automatic processing, therefore, it is well suited for habitat mapping. Lowland hay meadows are widespread habitat types in European grasslands, and also have one of the highest species richness. The objective of this study was to test the applicability of airborne laser scanning for vegetation mapping of different grasslands, including the Natura 2000 habitat type lowland hay meadows. Full waveform leaf-on and leaf-off point clouds were collected from a Natura 2000 site in Sopron, Hungary, covering several grasslands. The LIDAR data were processed to a set of rasters representing point attributes including reflectance, echo width, vegetation height, canopy openness, and surface roughness measures, and these were fused to a multi-band pseudo-image. Random forest machine learning was used for classifying this dataset. Habitat type, dominant plant species and other features of interest were noted in a set of 140 field plots. Two sets of categories were used: five classes focusing on meadow identification and the location of lowland hay meadows, and 10 classes, including eight different grassland vegetation categories. For five classes, an overall accuracy of 75% was reached, for 10 classes, this was 68%. The method delivers unprecedented fine resolution vegetation maps for management and ecological research. We conclude that high-resolution full-waveform LIDAR data can be used to detect grassland vegetation classes relevant for Natura 2000.

Data driven soft sensors have been successfully employed as a supplement to the online hardware analyzers that are often expensive and require high maintenance. Support Vector Regression (SVR) is an efficient machine learning technique that can be used for soft sensor design. However, choosing optimal hyper-parameter values for the SVR is a hard optimization problem. In order to determine the parameters as fast and accurate as possible, some Hybrid Meta-Heuristic (HMH) algorithms have been developed in this study. A comprehensive study has been carried out comparing the meta-heuristic algorithms of GA and PSO to the HMH algorithms of GA-SQP and PSO-SQP for prediction of sulfur quality in treated gas oil using the SVR technique. Experimental data from a hydrodesulfurization (HDS) setup were collected to validate the proposed SVR model. The SVR model yields better performances both in accuracy and computation time (CT) for predicting the sulfur quality with hyper parameters optimized by HMH algorithms. Applying the PSO-SQP algorithm gives the best performance with AARE = 0.133 and CT = 15.88 s compared to the other methods. (C) 2014 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The MODIS ice surface temperature product as an indicator of sea ice minimum over the Arctic Ocean	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						MODIS; Ice surface temperature; Sea ice extent; Wind vorticity; Time lag relationship	ANNULAR MODE; CLEAR-SKY; AVHRR; SHEET; OSCILLATION; VARIABILITY; ATMOSPHERE; FOREST; EXTENT; COVER	This study examines the relationship between sea ice extent and ice surface temperature (IST) between 2000 and 2013 using daily IST products from the Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD1S) sensor. The empirical prediction of September sea ice extent using its trend and two climate variables IST and wind vorticity exhibits a statistically significant relationship (R = 0.97) with a time lag, where IST maximum in summer (June-July) corresponds to the sea ice extent minimum in September. This suggests that IST may serve as an indicator of the basin-wide heat energy accumulated in the Arctic by solar radiation and large-scale atmospheric heat transport from lower latitudes. The process of inducing higher IST is related to the change of atmospheric circulation over the Arctic. Averaged IST and 850 hPa relative vorticity of the polar region show a significant negative correlation ( 0.57) in boreal summer (June-August), suggesting a weakening of the polar vortex in the case of warmer-than-normal IST conditions. Weakening of the polar vortex is accompanied by above-normal surface pressure. Minimum sea ice extent in September was successfully predicted by both multiple linear regression and machine learning support vector regression using preceding summer IST and wind vorticity along with the trend of sea ice extent (R-2 similar to 0.95, cross validation RMSE of 3-4 x 10(5) km(2), and relative cross validation RMSE of 5-8%).

For regions with persistent cloud cover the use of multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data provides an attractive solution for generating up-to-date inventories of grasslands. This is even more appealing considering the data that will be available from upcoming missions such as Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2. In this study, the performance of three machine learning algorithms; Random Forests (RE), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the relatively underused Extremely Randomised Trees (ERT) is evaluated for discriminating between grassland types over two large heterogeneous areas of Ireland using multi-temporal, multi-sensor radar and ancillary spatial datasets. A detailed accuracy assessment shows the efficacy of the three algorithms to classify different types of grasslands. Overall accuracies >= 88.7% (with kappa coefficient of 0.87) were achieved for the single frequency classifications and maximum accuracies of 97.9% (kappa coefficient of 0.98) for the combined frequency classifications. For most datasets, the ERT classifier outperforms SVM and RE. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Belelli			The seasonal cycle of satellite chlorophyll fluorescence observations and its relationship to vegetation phenology and ecosystem atmosphere carbon exchange	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Fluorescence; Vegetation; Fluorescence; Chlorophyll; GOME-2; Gross primary productivity; Light-use efficiency; Flux tower; Growing season; Carbon uptake period; Phenology	GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION; LIGHT-USE EFFICIENCY; DECIDUOUS BROADLEAF FOREST; EDDY-COVARIANCE; UNITED-STATES; MODIS DATA; PHOTOSYNTHETIC EFFICIENCY; RESPONSE PARAMETERS; TOWER MEASUREMENTS; FLUX MEASUREMENTS	Mapping of terrestrial chlorophyll fluorescence from space has shown potential for providing global measurements related to gross primary productivity (GPP). In particular, space-based fluorescence may provide information on the length of the carbon uptake period. Here, for the first time we test the ability of satellite fluorescence retrievals to track seasonal cycle of photosynthesis as estimated from a diverse set of tower gas exchange measurements from around the world. The satellite fluorescence retrievals are obtained using new observations near the 740 nm emission feature from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2) instrument offering the highest temporal and spatial resolution of available global measurements. Because GOME-2 has a large ground footprint (similar to 40 x 80 km(2)) as compared with that of the flux towers and the GOME-2 data require averaging to reduce random errors, we additionally compare with seasonal cycles of upscaled GPP estimated from a machine learning approach averaged over the same temporal and spatial domain as the satellite data surrounding the tower locations. We also examine the seasonality of absorbed photosynthetically-active radiation (AFAR) estimated from satellite measurements. Finally, to assess whether global vegetation models may benefit from the satellite fluorescence retrievals through validation or additional constraints, we examine seasonal cycles of GPP as produced from an ensemble of vegetation models. Several of the data-driven models rely on satellite reflectance-based vegetation parameters to derive estimates of APAR that are used to compute GPP. For forested (especially deciduous broadleaf and mixed forests) and cropland sites, the GOME-2 fluorescence data track the spring onset and autumn shutoff of photosynthesis as delineated by the upscaled GPP estimates. In contrast the reflectance-based indicators and many of the models, particularly those driven by data, tend to overestimate the length of the photosynthetically-active period for these biomes. Satellite fluorescence measurements therefore show potential for improving the seasonal dependence of photosynthesis simulated by global models at similar spatial scales.

J	Haworth, J; Shawe-Taylor, J; Cheng, T; Wang, JQ				Haworth, James; Shawe-Taylor, John; Cheng, Tao; Wang, Jiaqiu			Local online kernel ridge regression for forecasting of urban travel times	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Forecasting; Travel time; Prediction; Time series; Kernel method; Machine learning	SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; TRAFFIC FLOW PREDICTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MODEL; ROAD; OPTIMIZATION; VOLUME; SVR; ALGORITHMS; PARAMETERS	Accurate and reliable forecasting of traffic variables is one of the primary functions of Intelligent Transportation Systems. Reliable systems that are able to forecast traffic conditions accurately, multiple time steps into the future, are required for advanced traveller information systems. However, traffic forecasting is a difficult task because of the nonlinear and nonstationary properties of traffic series. Traditional linear models are incapable of modelling such properties, and typically perform poorly, particularly when conditions differ from the norm. Machine learning approaches such as artificial neural networks, nonparametric regression and kernel methods (KMs) have often been shown to outperform linear models in the literature. A bottleneck of the latter approach is that the information pertaining to all previous traffic states must be contained within the kernel, but the computational complexity of KMs usually scales cubically with the number of data points in the kernel. In this paper, a novel kernel-based machine learning (ML) algorithm is developed, namely the local online kernel ridge regression (LOKRR) model. Exploiting the observation that traffic data exhibits strong cyclic patterns characterised by rush hour traffic, LOKRR makes use of local kernels with varying parameters that are defined around each time point. This approach has 3 advantages over the standard single kernel approach: (1) It allows parameters to vary by time of day, capturing the time varying distribution of traffic data; (2) It allows smaller kernels to be defined that contain only the relevant traffic patterns, and; (3) It is online, allowing new traffic data to be incorporated as it arrives. The model is applied to the forecasting of travel times on London's road network, and is found to outperform three benchmark models in forecasting lip to 1 h ahead. (C) 2014 The Authors.

A diversity of approaches have been proposed to evaluate ecosystem services associations, but not all methods are equivalent and methodological choices need to be made depending on the scientific and policy questions at hand, as well as the type of data available. Based on previous classifications of ecosystem service associations, we propose to characterize three broad types of associations considering the ecological (supply side) and socio-economical (demand side) aspects of ecosystem services: supply-supply, supply-demand and demand-demand. We then review quantitative methods available and propose guidelines to assess those three categories of relationships among ecosystem services and identify their explanatory variables following three steps: (i) detecting ecosystem services associations, (ii) defining bundles and (iii) identifying the explanatory variables of ecosystem services associations. For each step, strengths and weaknesses of different statistical analysis and machine learning methods are described. The proposed interdisciplinary methodological approach takes one step toward embracing such complexity of socio-ecological systems as it considers ecosystem services delivery (supply-supply), stakeholders' needs (demand-demand), and on how stakeholders can benefit from the ecosystem services delivery (supply-demand). We illustrate how such a diverse spectrum of methods may apply for land management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This modification is based on the soft margins technique, which leads to the minimization of the distance between a cluster center and the learning samples belonging to this cluster. MLMVN has a derivative-free learning algorithm based on the error-correction learning rule and demonstrate a higher functionality and better generalization capability than a number of other machine learning techniques. The discrete k-valued multivalued neuron activation function divides a complex plane into k equal sectors. For more efficient and reliable solving of classification problems it is possible to modify the MLMVN learning algorithm in such a way that learning samples belonging to different classes (clusters) will be located as close as possible to the bisector of a desired sector (the cluster center) and as far as possible from each other, respectively. Such a modification based on the soft margins learning technique is considered in this paper. This modified learning algorithm improves the generalization capability of MLMVN when solving classification problems.

For particular domains, such as multimedia and learning algorithms, approximation is commonly used today. We consider automation to be essential to provide transparent approximation, and we show that larger benefits can be achieved by constructing the approximation techniques to fit the underlying hardware. Our target platform is the GPU because of its high performance capabilities and difficult programming challenges that can be alleviated with proper automation. Our approach-SAGE-combines a static compiler that automatically generates a set of CUDA kernels with varying levels of approximation with a runtime system that iteratively selects among the available kernels to achieve speedup while adhering to a target output quality set by the user. The SAGE compiler employs three optimization techniques to generate approximate kernels that exploit the GPU microarchitecture: selective discarding of atomic operations, data packing, and thread fusion. Across a set of machine learning and image processing kernels, SAGE's approximation yields an average of 2.5x speedup with less than 10% quality loss compared to the accurate execution on a NVIDIA GTX 560 GPU.

J	Santhiar, A; Pandita, O; Kanade, A				Santhiar, Anirudh; Pandita, Omesh; Kanade, Aditya			Mining Unit Tests for Discovery and Migration of Math APIs	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Algorithms; Design; Experimentation; API discovery; API migration; mathematical computation; mining; unit tests	CODE SEARCH; LIBRARY MIGRATION; REFACTORINGS; EVOLUTION; SUPPORT; SOFTWARE; USAGE	Today's programming languages are supported by powerful third-party APIs. For a given application domain, it is common to have many competing APIs that provide similar functionality. Programmer productivity therefore depends heavily on the programmer's ability to discover suitable APIs both during an initial coding phase, as well as during software maintenance. The aim of this work is to support the discovery and migration of math APIs. Math APIs are at the heart of many application domains ranging from machine learning to scientific computations. Our approach, called MATHFINDER, combines executable specifications of mathematical computations with unit tests (operational specifications) of API methods. Given a math expression, MATHFINDER synthesizes pseudo-code comprised of API methods to compute the expression by mining unit tests of the API methods. We present a sequential version of our unit test mining algorithm and also design a more scalable data-parallel version. We perform extensive evaluation of MATHFINDER (1) for API discovery, where math algorithms are to be implemented from scratch and (2) for API migration, where client programs utilizing a math API are to be migrated to another API. We evaluated the precision and recall of MATHFINDER on a diverse collection of math expressions, culled from algorithms used in a wide range of application areas such as control systems and structural dynamics. In a user study to evaluate the productivity gains obtained by using MATHFINDER for API discovery, the programmers who used MATHFINDER finished their programming tasks twice as fast as their counterparts who used the usual techniques like web and code search, IDE code completion, and manual inspection of library documentation. For the problem of API migration, as a case study, we used MATHFINDER to migrate Weka, a popular machine learning library. Overall, our evaluation shows that MATHFINDER is easy to use, provides highly precise results across several math APIs and application domains even with a small number of unit tests per method, and scales to large collections of unit tests.

J	Xie, SF; Weng, W; Chen, K; Liu, XR				Xie, Sifa; Weng, Wei; Chen, Ke; Liu, Xiangrong			IDENTIFYING RELIABLE POSTS AND USERS IN ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Reliable user; reliable content; machine learning; social network	QUALITY	In the age of Web 2.0, generalizing concepts are mainly based on information sharing and user cooperation. The user-centric Internet mode encourages more users to participate in the Internet. However, this mode causes the flooding of social networks with low-quality information. Thus, identifying trusted information in online social networks (OSNs) so as to enable the Internet to serve humans better has gradually become a research hotspot. However, most studies evaluate the quality of user-created content or discriminate reliable users in isolation. These results are specific to particular social networks and lack generality. Intuitively, reliable content and users are closely related. In this study, the authors attempt to combine these two types of reliable data by separately identifying reliable posts and users in a social network. Posts and users are found to improve each other based on the preliminary identification results. To deal with imbalanced data, an algorithm that combines oversampling and undersampling is used to build balanced data. An ensemble classifier is adopted for data classification. Experiments show that the proposed framework is both effective and efficient for most types of OSNs. The contributions of this study are two-fold: (i) a framework combining user-created content and reliable user recognition is proposed, and (ii) an ensemble classifier is built for use in data classification.

J	Han, S; Lee, S; Pena-Mora, F				Han, SangUk; Lee, SangHyun; Pena-Mora, Feniosky			Comparative Study of Motion Features for Similarity-Based Modeling and Classification of Unsafe Actions in Construction	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Safety; Motion capture; Action recognition; Dimension reduction; Machine learning; Classification	SAFETY; FUSION; PERFORMANCE; WORKERS	Rapid development of motion sensors and video processing has triggered growing attention to action recognition for safety and health analysis, as well as operation analysis, in construction. Specifically for occupational safety and health, worker behavior monitoring allows for the automatic detection of workers' unsafe actions and for feedback on their behavior, both of which enable the proactive prevention of an accident by reducing the number of unsafe actions that occur. Previous studies provide insight into tracking human movements and recognizing actions, but further research efforts are needed to understand the following characteristics of motion data, which can significantly affect classification performances: (1) various motion data types extracted from motion capture data, (2) variations of postures and actions, and (3) temporal and sequential relations of motion data. This paper thus presents a modeling and classification methodology for the recognition of unsafe actions, particularly focusing on (1) the description and comparison of four motion data types (i.e., rotation angles, joint angles, position vectors, and movement direction) that will be used as a feature for classification, (2) the estimation of actions' mean trajectory in order to model various patterns of action, and (3) the classification of actions based on spatial-temporal similarity. With a concentration on motion analysis, experiments were undertaken for the modeling and detection of actions during ladder climbing using an red, green, blue plus depth (RGB-D) sensor. Through the experimental study, we found that the proposed approach performs well (i.e., an accuracy of up to 99.5% in lab experiments), that a rotation angle outperforms a joint angle and a position vector, and that movement direction explicitly improves the accuracy of motion classification as combined with each of the other three.

However, it is unclear to what extend these ERP deficits distinguish between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls on a single-subject level, which is of high importance for potential translation to clinical routine. Here, we investigated 144 schizophrenia patients and 144 matched controls with an auditory click-conditioning/oddball paradigm. P50 and N1 gating ratios as well as target-locked N1 and P3 components were submitted to conventional general linear models and to explorative machine learning algorithms. Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed significant between-group differences for the oddball-locked N1 and P3 components but not for any gating measure. Machine learning-assisted analysis achieved 77.7% balanced classification accuracy using a combination of target-locked N1 and P3 amplitudes as classifiers. The superiority of machine learning over repeated-measures analysis for classifying schizophrenia patients was in the range of about 10% as quantified by receiver operating characteristics. For the first time, our study provides large-scale single-subject classification data on auditory click-conditioning and oddball paradigms in schizophrenia. Although our study exemplifies how automated inference may substantially improve classification accuracy, our data also show that the investigated ERP measures show comparably poor discriminatory properties in single subjects, thus illustrating the need to establish either new analytical approaches for these paradigms or other paradigms to investigate the disorder.

Therefore, we investigated whether patients with SZ (N = 141), major depression (MD; N = 104), borderline personality disorder (BPD; N = 57), and individuals in at-risk mental states for psychosis (ARMS; N = 89) deviated from the trajectory of normal brain maturation. This deviation was measured as difference between chronological and the neuroanatomical age (brain age gap estimation [BrainAGE]). Neuroanatomical age was determined by a machine learning system trained to individually estimate age from the structural magnetic resonance imagings of 800 healthy controls. Group-level analyses showed that BrainAGE was highest in SZ (+5.5 y) group, followed by MD (+4.0), BPD (+3.1), and the ARMS (+1.7) groups. Earlier disease onset in MD and BPD groups correlated with more pronounced BrainAGE, reaching effect sizes of the SZ group. Second, BrainAGE increased across at-risk, recent onset, and recurrent states of SZ. Finally, BrainAGE predicted both patient status as well as negative and disorganized symptoms. These findings suggest that an individually quantifiable "accelerated aging" effect may particularly impact on the neuroanatomical signature of SZ but may extend also to other mental disorders.

A predicted variable is the logarithm of the monthly sum of seismic energy induced in a longwall area. The set of predictors include seven quantitative and qualitative variables describing some mining and geological conditions and earlier seismicity in longwalls. Two machine learning methods have been used to develop the models: boosted regression trees and neural networks. Two types of model validation have been applied: on a random validation sample and on a time-based validation sample. The set of a few selected variables enabled nonlinear regression models to be built which gave relatively small prediction errors, taking the complex and strongly stochastic nature of the phenomenon into account. The article presents both the models of periodic forecasting for the following month as well as long-term forecasting.

Previous work has focused on determining the relative roles of two classes of variables (e.g., spatial and environmental) on community composition. However, this approach may ignore the disproportionate impact of variables within classes, and is often confounded by spatial autocorrelation leading to collinearity among variables of different classes. Here, we combine pattern-based metacommunity and machine learning analyses to characterize metacommunity structure of zooplankton from lakes in the northeast United States and to identify environmental, spatial, and geographic covariates associated with metacommunity structure. Analyses were performed for the entire metacommunity and for three zooplankton subsets (cladocerans, copepods, and rotifers), as the variables associated with community structure in these groups were hypothesized to differ. Species distributions of all subsets adhered to an environmental, spatial, and/or geographic gradient, but differed in metacommunity pattern, as copepod species distributions responded independently of one another, while the entire zooplankton metacommunity, cladocerans, and rotifers replaced one another in discrete groups. While environmental variables were nearly always the most important to metacommunity structure, the relative importance of variables differed among zooplankton subsets, suggesting that zooplankton subsets differ in their environmental tolerances and dispersal-limitation.

Recent years, more and more research works have tried to build effective machine learning models to identify traffics with the few packets at the early stage. However, a basic and important problem is still unresolved, that is how many packets are most effective in early stage traffic identification. In this paper, we try to resolve this problem using experimental methods. We firstly extract the packet size of the first 2-10 packets of 3 traffic data sets. And then execute crossover identification experiments with different numbers of packets using 11 well-known machine learning classifiers. Finally, statistical tests are applied to find out which number is the best performed one. Our experimental results show that 5-7 are the best packet numbers for early stage traffic identification.

In previous work, we found that centromeres contain origins of replication (ORIs) that are determined epigenetically in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. In this study, we used origin recognition complex (ORC) binding and nucleosome occupancy patterns in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces lactis to train a machine learning algorithm to predict the position of active arm (noncentromeric) origins in the C. albicans genome. The model identified bona fide active origins as determined by the presence of replication intermediates on nondenaturing two-dimensional (2D) gels. Importantly, these origins function at their native chromosomal loci and also as autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs) on a linear plasmid. A "mini-ARS screen" identified at least one and often two ARS regions of >= 100 bp within each bona fide origin. Furthermore, a 15-bp AC-rich consensus motif was associated with the predicted origins and conferred autonomous replicating activity to the mini-ARSs. Thus, while centromeres and the origins associated with them are epigenetic, arm origins are dependent upon critical DNA features, such as a binding site for ORC and a propensity for nucleosome exclusion. IMPORTANCE DNA replication machinery is highly conserved, yet the definition of exactly what specifies a replication origin differs in different species. Here, we utilized computational genomics to predict origin locations in Candida albicans by combining locations of binding sites for the conserved origin replication complex, necessary for replication initiation, together with chromatin organization patterns. We identified predicted sequences that exhibited bona fide origin function and developed a linear plasmid assay to delimit the DNA fragments necessary for origin function. Additionally, we found that a short AC-rich motif, which is enriched in predicted origins, is required for origin function. Thus, we demonstrated a new machine learning paradigm for identification of potential origins from a genome with no prior information. Furthermore, this work suggests that C. albicans has two different types of origins: "hard-wired" arm origins that rely upon specific sequence motifs and "epigenetic" centromeric origins that are recruited to kinetochores in a sequence-independent manner.

J	Binder, JM; Jennings, C				Binder, Jeffrey M.; Jennings, Collin			Visibility and meaning in topic models and 18th-century subject indexes	LITERARY AND LINGUISTIC COMPUTING			English	Article							HUMANITIES	This article addresses the 'meaning problem' of unsupervised topic modeling algorithms using a tool called the Networked Corpus, which offers a way to visualize topic models alongside the texts themselves. We argue that the relationship between quantitative methods and qualitative interpretation can be reframed by investigating the long history of machine learning procedures and their historical antecedents. The new method of visualization presented by the Networked Corpus enables users to compare the results of topic models with earlier methods of topical representation such as the 18th-century subject index. Although the article provides a brief description of the tool, the primary focus is to describe an argument for this kind of comparative analysis between topic models and older genres that perform similar tasks. Such comparative analysis provides a new method for developing conceptual histories of the categories of meaning on which the topic model and the index depend.

Social media and customer behavior analytics for personalized customer engagements	IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM	Companies in various industries, including travel, hospitality, and retail, increasingly focus on improving customer relationships and customer loyalty. In this paper, we propose a new systems architecture that combines the textual content in social media messages with product information, such as the descriptions summarized in catalogs, in order to provide marketing campaign recommendations. Companies commonly build user profiles based on purchase histories and other customer-specific information; however, when dealing with social media, we often cannot match the social media users with the customers. In this regard, we address the problem of targeting individual social media messages for which no personalized profile information can be retrieved. Our solution combines two disparate computational toolboxes for text analytics-natural language processing and machine learning-in order to select social media users for whom to target with topic-specific advertisements. Natural language processing is used to analyze the context of social media messages, and machine learning is used to analyze product information, with the goal being to match social media messages to products and ranking potential advertisements. To demonstrate the framework, we detail a real-world application in the travel and tourism industry using Twitter (R) as the social media platform.

Multi-period marketing-mix optimization with response spike forecasting	IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							MARKOV DECISION-PROCESSES; WORD-OF-MOUTH; FIELD-THEORY; CHOICE; ONLINE; MODEL; TIME; CONSTRAINTS; BUSINESS; POLICIES	Optimizing the marketing budget and its distribution across various channels and target segments, along with the timing of each marketing action for maximum profit, are among the essential problems in marketing. A crucial requirement for effective decision making in direct marketing is an efficient optimization algorithm, coupled with reliable predictions on how the various marketing actions will impact consumers' purchase decisions. For maximizing mid-term revenues, while properly incorporating the temporal dynamics of individual consumers' mental states, we introduce a comprehensive optimization framework for obtaining a state-based marketing-mix policy, with a novel combination of machine learning, optimization, and simulation. Each consumer's purchase decision is modeled with a marked point process whose discrete-state approximation enables efficient optimization of high-dimensional decision variables, and whose discrete event simulation supplies accurate forecasts of the revenues and risks of the optimized policy. The key idea for ensuring the practicality of the proposed approach to marketing planning is a linear programming formulation that allows both handling of temporal dynamics and complex budget constraints across many periods, segments, and channels required in real marketing operations. A real-world case study based on an online retailing dataset implies high revenue gains when the simulation model can be relied on.

However, the characterization of these cardiomyocytes (CMs) is evolving at a relatively slower rate. In particular, there is still uncertainty in classifying the phenotype (ventricular-like, atrial-like, nodal-like, etc.) of an hESC-derived cardiomyocyte (hESC-CM). While previous studies identified the phenotype of a CM based on electrophysiological features of its action potential, the criteria for classification were typically subjective and differed across studies. In this paper, we use techniques from signal processing and machine learning to develop an automated approach to discriminate the electrophysiological differences between hESC-CMs. Specifically, we propose a spectral grouping-based algorithm to separate a population of CMs into distinct groups based on the similarity of their action potential shapes. We applied this method to a dataset of optical maps of cardiac cell clusters dissected from human embryoid bodies. While some of the nine cell clusters in the dataset are presented with just one phenotype, the majority of the cell clusters are presented with multiple phenotypes. The proposed algorithm is generally applicable to other action potential datasets and could prove useful in investigating the purification of specific types of CMs from an electrophysiological perspective.

In silico predictions of potential interactions are valuable and can focus effort on in vitro experiments. We propose a prediction framework that represents the problem using a bipartite graph of drug-target interactions augmented with drug-drug and target-target similarity measures and makes predictions using probabilistic soft logic (PSL). Using probabilistic rules in PSL, we predict interactions with models based on triad and tetrad structures. We apply (blocking) techniques that make link prediction in PSL more efficient for drug-target interaction prediction. We then perform extensive experimental studies to highlight different aspects of the model and the domain, first comparing the models with different structures and then measuring the effect of the proposed blocking on the prediction performance and efficiency. We demonstrate the importance of rule weight learning in the proposed PSL model and then show that PSL can effectively make use of a variety of similarity measures. We perform an experiment to validate the importance of collective inference and using multiple similarity measures for accurate predictions in contrast to non-collective and single similarity assumptions. Finally, we illustrate that our PSL model achieves state-of-the-art performance with simple, interpretable rules and evaluate our novel predictions using online data sets.

As the number of sequenced genomes rapidly grows, the vast majority of proteins can only be annotated computationally. Nature often brings several domains together to form multi-domain and multi-functional proteins with a vast number of possibilities, and each domain may fulfill its own function independently or in a concerted manner with its neighbors. Thus, it is evident that the protein function prediction problem is naturally and inherently Multi-Instance Multi-Label (MIML) learning tasks. Based on the state-of-the-art MIML algorithm MIMLNN, we propose a novel ensemble MIML learning framework EnMIMLNN and design three algorithms for this task by combining the advantage of three kinds of Hausdorff distance metrics. Experiments on seven real-world organisms covering the biological three-domain system, i.e., archaea, bacteria, and eukaryote, show that the EnMIMLNN algorithms are superior to most state-of-the-art MIML and Multi-Label learning algorithms.

VARIABLE SELECTION FOR BART: AN APPLICATION TO GENE REGULATION	ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Variable selection; nonparametric regression; Bayesian learning; machine learning; permutation testing; decision trees; gene regulatory network	LINEAR-REGRESSION; STOCHASTIC SEARCH; DYNAMIC TREES; REGULARIZATION; LASSO	We consider the task of discovering gene regulatory networks, which are defined as sets of genes and the corresponding transcription factors which regulate their expression levels. This can be viewed as a variable selection problem, potentially with high dimensionality. Variable selection is especially challenging in high-dimensional settings, where it is difficult to detect subtle individual effects and interactions between predictors. Bayesian Additive Regression Trees [BART, Ann. Appl. Stat. 4 (2010) 266-298] provides a novel nonparametric alternative to parametric regression approaches, such as the lasso or stepwise regression, especially when the number of relevant predictors is sparse relative to the total number of available predictors and the fundamental relationships are nonlinear. We develop a principled permutation-based inferential approach for determining when the effect of a selected predictor is likely to be real. Going further, we adapt the BART procedure to incorporate informed prior information about variable importance. We present simulations demonstrating that our method compares favorably to existing parametric and nonparametric procedures in a variety of data settings. To demonstrate the potential of our approach in a biological context, we apply it to the task of inferring the gene regulatory network in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We find that our BART-based procedure is best able to recover the subset of covariates with the largest signal compared to other variable selection methods. The methods developed in this work are readily available in the R package bartMachine.

The adaptive controller, based upon a multiparameter extremum-seeking control algorithm, is capable of obtaining and maintaining high-energy, single-pulse states in a mode-locked fiber laser while the machine learning characterizes the cavity itself for rapid state identification and improved optimization. The theory developed is demonstrated on a nonlinear-polarization-rotation-based laser using waveplate and polarizer angles to achieve optimal passive mode-locking despite large disturbances to the system. The physically realizable objective function introduced divides the energy output by the fourth moment of the pulse spectrum, thus balancing the total energy with the time duration of the mode-locked solution. Moreover, its peaks are high-energy mode-locked states that have a safety margin near parameter regimes where mode-locking breaks down or the multipulsing instability occurs. The methods demonstrated can be implemented broadly to optical systems, or more generally to any self-tuning complex systems.	[Brunton, Steven L.; Fu, Xing; Kutz, J.

Although this approach is known to be an efficient heuristic, the results of recursive tree methods are only locally optimal, as splits are chosen to maximize homogeneity at the next step only. An alternative way to search over the parameter space of trees is to use global optimization methods like evolutionary algorithms. This paper describes the evtree package, which implements an evolutionary algorithm for learning globally optimal classification and regression trees in R. Computationally intensive tasks are fully computed in C++ while the partykit package is leveraged for representing the resulting trees in R, providing unified infrastructure for summaries, visualizations, and predictions. evtree is compared to the open-source CART implementation rpart, conditional inference trees (ctree), and the open-source C4.5 implementation J48. A benchmark study of predictive accuracy and complexity is carried out in which evtree achieved at least similar and most of the time better results compared to rpart, ctree, and J48. Furthermore, the usefulness of evtree in practice is illustrated in a textbook customer classication task.

Mansoor			Face Recognition under Uncontrolled Conditions: A Compact Dictionary based Approach	JOURNAL OF IMAGING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SPARSE REPRESENTATION	Dictionary based learning has emerged as a powerful approach to a large class of machine learning problems, especially face recognition. The development of face recognition methods for unconstrained environments is still a challenging problem. In this article the authors present a dictionary based approach that considers compact face features to define a cluster centroid using k-means clustering in conjunction with a sparse representation classifier. The varying environmental aspects of human face recognition, namely illumination and facial expression, have been dealt with for images captured under controlled and uncontrolled settings. Face normalization using the gradient face method is employed to handle variations in illumination conditions. Facial expression is handled by the use of compact face features, generated using the popular rotation invariant uniform local binary pattern and the histogram of gradients. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated using three large benchmark databases with vast variations, extended Yale B, CMU-PIE and IMFDB. It is encouraging to note that the proposed method has superior performance to popular face recognition algorithms. (C) 2014 Society for Imaging Science and Technology	[Beham, M.

More than ever, we have increasingly large amounts of data on the body, both spatial and non-spatial, its systems, disease and our social and physical environment. These data have a geospatial component. An exciting new era is dawning where we are simultaneously collecting multiple datasets to describe many aspects of health, wellness, human activity, environment and disease. Valuable insights from these datasets can be extracted using massively multivariate computational techniques, such as machine learning, coupled with geospatial techniques. These computational tools help us to understand the topology of the data and provide insights for scientific discovery, decision support and policy formulation. This paper outlines a holistic paradigm called Holistics 3.0 for analyzing health data with a set of examples. Holistics 3.0 combines multiple big datasets set in their geospatial context describing as many areas of a problem as possible with machine learning and causality, to both learn from the data and to construct tools for data-driven decisions.

While fairly good results have been obtained for inferring the user state under highly controlled conditions, a considerable amount of work remains to be done for learning high-quality estimates of subjective evaluations of the state in more natural conditions. In this work, we discuss how two recent machine learning concepts, multi-view learning and multi-task learning, can be adapted for user state recognition, and demonstrate them on two data collections of varying quality. Multi-view learning enables combining multiple measurement sensors in a justified way while automatically learning the importance of each sensor. Multi-task learning, in turn, tells how multiple learning tasks can be learned together to improve the accuracy. We demonstrate the use of two types of multi-task learning: learning both multiple state indicators and models for multiple users together. We also illustrate how the benefits of multi-task learning and multi-view learning can be effectively combined in a unified model by introducing a novel algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

An efficient self-organizing map (E-SOM) learning algorithm using group of neurons	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Self-organizing map (SOM); kernel function; distant neuron; Efficient SOM (E-SOM)	VISUALIZATION	In the learning process of the conventional SOM, the neuron which is closer to the winner neuron learns more than the neuron which is farther away from the winner neuron. The neurons farther away from input are not able to learn properly and some dead units are left on the map. To decrease dead unit problem and improve the learning efficiency, an efficient Self-organzing map algorithm using group of neurons has been proposed. In this paper, we have divided the neurons on the map into two groups according to distance from input: normal and distant. The neurons which are far away from the input have been named distant neurons. We have done some changes in the kernel function for the distant neurons and then compared the learning efficiency of the algorithms by applying on standard input dataset. The results have been compared using three well known parameters, which are widely accepted for checking the learning efficiency of machine learning algorithms. It has been observed from the experimental results that proposed SOM successfully decrease dead units,while still preserving the topology of input data with lesser errors. The maps achieved by the proposed SOM have a lower error measure than the maps formed by SOM and false neighbor degree SOM (FN-SOM).	[Chaudhary, Vikas; Bhatia, R.

In 2004, the first BioCreative challenge already designed a task of automatic GO concepts assignment from a full text. At this time, results were judged far from reaching the performances required by real curation workflows. In particular, supervised approaches produced the most disappointing results because of lack of training data. Ten years later, the available curation data have massively grown. In 2013, the BioCreative IV GO task revisited the automatic GO assignment task. For this issue, we investigated the power of our supervised classifier, GOCat. GOCat computes similarities between an input text and already curated instances contained in a knowledge base to infer GO concepts. The subtask A consisted in selecting GO evidence sentences for a relevant gene in a full text. For this, we designed a state-of-the-art supervised statistical approach, using a naive Bayes classifier and the official training set, and obtained fair results. The subtask B consisted in predicting GO concepts from the previous output. For this, we applied GOCat and reached leading results, up to 65% for hierarchical recall in the top 20 outputted concepts. Contrary to previous competitions, machine learning has this time outperformed standard dictionary-based approaches. Thanks to BioCreative IV, we were able to design a complete workflow for curation: given a gene name and a full text, this system is able to select evidence sentences for curation and to deliver highly relevant GO concepts. Contrary to previous competitions, machine learning this time outperformed dictionary-based systems. Observed performances are sufficient for being used in a real semiautomatic curation workflow. GOCat is available at http://eagl.unige.ch/GOCat/.

Rapid and Accurate Machine Learning Recognition of High Performing Metal Organic Frameworks for CO2 Capture	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							METHANE STORAGE; ADSORPTION; NETWORKS; SELECTIVITY	In this work, we have developed quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models using advanced machine learning algorithms that can rapidly and accurately recognize high-performing metal organic framework (MOF) materials for CO2 capture. More specifically, QSPR classifiers have been developed that can, in a fraction of a section, identify candidate MOFs with enhanced CO2 adsorption capacity (>1 mmol/g at 0.15 bar and >4 mmol/g at 1 bar). The models were tested on a large set of 292 050 MOFs that were not part of the training set. The QSPR classifier could recover 945 of the top 1000 MOFs in the test set while flagging only 10% of the whole library for compute intensive screening. Thus, using the machine learning classifiers as part of a high-throughput screening protocol would result in an order of magnitude reduction in compute time and allow intractably large structure libraries and search spaces to be screened.

RNA sequencing offers a genome-wide view of expressed transcripts, uncovering biologically functional gene fusions. Although several bioinformatics tools are already available for the detection of putative fusion transcripts, candidate event lists are plagued with non-functional read-through events, reverse transcriptase template switching events, incorrect mapping, and other systematic errors. Such lists lack any indication of oncogenic relevance, and they are too large for exhaustive experimental validation. Results: We have designed and implemented a pipeline, Pegasus, for the annotation and prediction of biologically functional gene fusion candidates. Pegasus provides a common interface for various gene fusion detection tools, reconstruction of novel fusion proteins, reading-frame-aware annotation of preserved/lost functional domains, and data-driven classification of oncogenic potential. Pegasus dramatically streamlines the search for oncogenic gene fusions, bridging the gap between raw RNA-Seq data and a final, tractable list of candidates for experimental validation. Conclusion: We show the effectiveness of Pegasus in predicting new driver fusions in 176 RNA-Seq samples of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and 23 cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL).

J	Menezes, T; Roth, C				Menezes, Telmo; Roth, Camille			Symbolic regression of generative network models	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article								Networks are a powerful abstraction with applicability to a variety of scientific fields. Models explaining their morphology and growth processes permit a wide range of phenomena to be more systematically analysed and understood. At the same time, creating such models is often challenging and requires insights that may be counter-intuitive. Yet there currently exists no general method to arrive at better models. We have developed an approach to automatically detect realistic decentralised network growth models from empirical data, employing a machine learning technique inspired by natural selection and defining a unified formalism to describe such models as computer programs. As the proposed method is completely general and does not assume any pre-existing models, it can be applied "out of the box" to any given network. To validate our approach empirically, we systematically rediscover pre-defined growth laws underlying several canonical network generation models and credible laws for diverse real-world networks. We were able to find programs that are simple enough to lead to an actual understanding of the mechanisms proposed, namely for a simple brain and a social network.

The major challenge is that LBPs are diverse in sequence, structure, and function which results in low accuracy of sequence homology based methods. Therefore, there is a need for developing alternative functional prediction methods irrespective of sequence similarity. To identify LBPs from non-LBPs, the performances of support vector machine (SVM) and neural network were compared in this study. Comprehensive protein features and various techniques were employed to create datasets. Five-fold cross-validation (CV) and independent evaluation (IE) tests were used to assess the validity of the two methods. The results indicated that SVM outperforms neural network. SVM achieved 89.28% (CV) and 89.55% (IE) overall accuracy in identification of LBPs from non-LBPs and 92.06% (CV) and 92.90% (IE) (in average) for classification of different LBPs classes. Increasing the number and the range of extracted protein features as well as optimization of the SVM parameters significantly increased the efficiency of LBPs class prediction in comparison to the only previous report in this field. Altogether, the results showed that the SVM algorithm can be run on broad, computationally calculated protein features and offers a promising tool in detection of LBPs classes. The proposed approach has the potential to integrate and improve the common sequence alignment based methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In order to predict multiple classes of multi-family enzymes, we adopted two multi-label learning algorithms, namely RAkEL-RF and MLKNN, and two types of protein descriptors, namely CTD and PseAAC, to generate four predictors, RAkEL-RF-CTD, RAkEL-RF-PseAAC, MLKNN-CTD and MLKNN-PseAAC. When the four predictors were tested on a training set with 10-fold cross validation, the overall success rates reached 97.99%, 96.07%, 96.01% and 95.31%, respectively. For the independent test set, the corresponding rates reached 97.57%, 95.03%, 95.9% and 93.9%, respectively. In conclusion, it proved the outstanding prediction capability and robustness of our predictors from the extremely small difference between two sets for each predictor and the relatively higher accuracy. In addition, three of seven pairs of homologous enzymes with different functions and eighteen of twenty-three distantly related enzymes with a similar family were correctly classified by the RAkEL-RF-CTD predictor. These results indicated the extensive applicability of our predictors.

Different procedures have been proposed to detect such interactions. Which approach is best for explaining the risk of developing disease is unclear. This study sought to elucidate the genetic interaction landscape in candidate genes for MDD by conducting a SNP-SNP interaction analysis using an exhaustive search through 3,704 SNP-markers in 1,732 cases and 1,783 controls provided from the GAIN MDD study. We used three different methods to detect interactions, two logistic regressions models (multiplicative and additive) and one data mining and machine learning (MDR) approach. Results: Although none of the interaction survived correction for multiple comparisons, the results provide important information for future genetic interaction studies in complex disorders. Among the 0.5% most significant observations, none had been reported previously for risk to MDD. Within this group of interactions, less than 0.03% would have been detectable based on main effect approach or an a priori algorithm. We evaluated correlations among the three different models and conclude that all three algorithms detected the same interactions to a low degree. Although the top interactions had a surprisingly large effect size for MDD (e. g. additive dominant model P-uncorrected = 9.10E-9 with attributable proportion (AP) value = 0.58 and multiplicative recessive model with P-uncorrected = 6.95E-5 with odds ratio (OR estimated from beta 3) value = 4.99) the area under the curve (AUC) estimates were low (< 0.54). Moreover, the population attributable fraction (PAF) estimates were also low (< 0.15). Conclusions: We conclude that the top interactions on their own did not explain much of the genetic variance of MDD. The different statistical interaction methods we used in the present study did not identify the same pairs of interacting markers. Genetic interaction studies may uncover previously unsuspected effects that could provide novel insights into MDD risk, but much larger sample sizes are needed before this strategy can be powerfully applied.

Some of the vertical scaling solutions provide good implementation of signature based detection. Unfortunately these approaches treat network flows across different subnets and cannot apply anomaly-based classification if attacks originate from multiple machines at a lower speed, like the scenario of Peer-to-Peer Botnets. In this paper the authors build up on the progress of open source tools like Hadoop, Hive and Mahout to provide a scalable implementation of quasi-real-time intrusion detection system. The implementation is used to detect Peer-to-Peer Botnet attacks using machine learning approach. The contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) Building a distributed framework using Hive for sniffing and processing network traces enabling extraction of dynamic network features; (2) Using the parallel processing power of Mahout to build Random Forest based Decision Tree model which is applied to the problem of Peer-to-Peer Botnet detection in quasi-real-time. The implementation setup and performance metrics are presented as initial observations and future extensions are proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Sanyal, J; New, J; Edwards, RE; Parker, L				Sanyal, Jibonananda; New, Joshua; Edwards, Richard E.; Parker, Lynne			Calibrating building energy models using supercomputer trained machine learning agents	CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE			English	Article						building energy modeling; supercomputer; parametric ensemble; machine learning; calibration; big data		Building energy modeling (BEM) is an approach to model the energy usage in buildings for design and retrofit purposes. EnergyPlus is the flagship Department of Energy software that performs BEM for different types of buildings. The input to EnergyPlus can often extend in the order of a few thousand parameters that have to be calibrated manually by an expert for realistic energy modeling. This makes it challenging and expensive thereby making BEM unfeasible for smaller projects. In this paper, we describe the Autotune' research that employs machine learning algorithms to generate agents for the different kinds of standard reference buildings in the US building stock. The parametric space and the variety of building locations and types make this a challenging computational problem necessitating the use of supercomputers. Millions of EnergyPlus simulations are run on supercomputers that are subsequently used to train machine learning algorithms to generate agents. These agents, once created, can then run in a fraction of the time thereby allowing cost-effective calibration of building models. Published 2014.

Results: We have developed a methodology to address this issue and applied it to identify lipid-related GO terms, owing to the important and varied roles of lipids in many biological processes. Our methodology finds lipid-related GO terms in a semi-automated manner, requiring only moderate manual curation. We first obtain a list of lipid-related gold-standard GO terms by keyword search and manual curation. Then, based on the hypothesis that co-annotated GO terms share similar properties, we develop a machine learning method that expands the list of lipid-related terms from the gold standard. Those terms predicted most likely to be lipid related are examined by a human curator following specific curation rules to confirm the class labels. The structure of GO is also exploited to help reduce the curation effort. The prediction and curation cycle is repeated until no further lipid-related term is found. Our approach has covered a high proportion, if not all, of lipid-related terms with relatively high efficiency.

J	Johnson, S; Trost, B; Long, JR; Pittet, V; Kusalik, A				Johnson, Stephen; Trost, Brett; Long, Jeffrey R.; Pittet, Vanessa; Kusalik, Anthony			A better sequence-read simulator program for metagenomics	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th Annual RECOMB Satellite Workshop on Massively Parallel Sequencing (RECOMB-Seq)	MAR 31-APR 05, 2014	Pittsburgh, PA				ALIGNMENT	Background: There are many programs available for generating simulated whole-genome shotgun sequence reads. The data generated by many of these programs follow predefined models, which limits their use to the authors' original intentions. For example, many models assume that read lengths follow a uniform or normal distribution. Other programs generate models from actual sequencing data, but are limited to reads from single-genome studies. To our knowledge, there are no programs that allow a user to generate simulated data following non-parametric read-length distributions and quality profiles based on empirically-derived information from metagenomics sequencing data. Results: We present BEAR (Better Emulation for Artificial Reads), a program that uses a machine-learning approach to generate reads with lengths and quality values that closely match empirically-derived distributions. BEAR can emulate reads from various sequencing platforms, including Illumina, 454, and Ion Torrent. BEAR requires minimal user input, as it automatically determines appropriate parameter settings from user-supplied data. BEAR also uses a unique method for deriving run-specific error rates, and extracts useful statistics from the metagenomic data itself, such as quality-error models. Many existing simulators are specific to a particular sequencing technology; however, BEAR is not restricted in this way. Because of its flexibility, BEAR is particularly useful for emulating the behaviour of technologies like Ion Torrent, for which no dedicated sequencing simulators are currently available. BEAR is also the first metagenomic sequencing simulator program that automates the process of generating abundances, which can be an arduous task. Conclusions: BEAR is useful for evaluating data processing tools in genomics. It has many advantages over existing comparable software, such as generating more realistic reads and being independent of sequencing technology, and has features particularly useful for metagenomics work.

SPINN: a straightforward machine learning solution to the pulsar candidate selection problem	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: data analysis; stars: neutron; pulsars: general	DISCOVERY; SEARCHES; SYSTEMS	We describe SPINN (Straightforward Pulsar Identification using Neural Networks), a high-performance machine learning solution developed to process increasingly large data outputs from pulsar surveys. SPINN has been cross-validated on candidates from the southern High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) survey and shown to identify every known pulsar found in the survey data while maintaining a false positive rate of 0.64 per cent. Furthermore, it ranks 99 per cent of pulsars among the top 0.11 per cent of candidates, and 95 per cent among the top 0.01 per cent. In conjunction with the PEASOUP pipeline, it has already discovered four new pulsars in a re-processing of the intermediate Galactic latitude area of HTRU, three of which have spin periods shorter than 5 ms. SPINN's ability to reduce the amount of candidates to visually inspect by up to four orders of magnitude makes it a very promising tool for future large-scale pulsar surveys. In an effort to provide a common testing ground for pulsar candidate selection tools and stimulate interest in their development, we also make publicly available the set of candidates on which SPINN was cross-validated.

A numerically-enhanced machine learning approach to damage diagnosis using a Lamb wave sensing network	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL ALGORITHM; METALLIC STRUCTURES; PART II; PROPAGATION; SIMULATION; IDENTIFICATION	This paper describes a methodology for the design of a model-based diagnostic unit. The objective of the work is to define a suitable procedure for the design and verification of diagnostic performance in a simulated environment, trying to maximise the generalisation capability of pattern recognition algorithms when tested with real experimental signals. The system is designed and experimentally verified to solve the fatigue crack damage localisation and assessment problems in a realistic, though rather idealised, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) framework. The study is applied to a piezoelectric Lamb wave sensor network and is validated experimentally on a simple aluminium skin. The analytically-derived dispersion curves for Lamb wave propagation in aluminium are used in order to determine the wave velocities and thus their arrival time at given sensors. The Local Interaction Simulation Approach (LISA) is used to simulate the entire waveform propagation. Once the agreement between analytical, numerical and experimental data is verified on a baseline undamaged condition, the parametric LISA model has been iteratively run, varying the position and the length of a crack on an aluminium skin panel, generating the virtual experience necessary to train a supervised learning regressor based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). After the algorithm structure has been statistically optimised, the network sensitivity to input variations has been evaluated on simulated signals through a technique inspired by information gap theory. Real Lamb wave signals are then processed into the algorithm, providing feasible real-time indication of damage characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We look at applying some of these techniques to the anthropomorphic Meka gripper. First, dimensionality reduction is attempted. We show that dimensionality reduction does not accurately predict the thumb position. A new algorithm is proposed in which measurements from 2D images are used to classify the thumb opposition angle to one of three positions. The remaining joints employ a reactive torque-control strategy to complete the grasp. The algorithm achieves force closure for 82% of 39 household objects. It is simple, computationally fast, and achieves a success rate that is similar to other contemporary grasp planning algorithms.

Landscape similarity, retrieval, and machine mapping of physiographic units	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						Landscape similarity; Landscape search; Physiographic mapping; Pattern recognition; Supervised classification; Web application	MULTIMEDIA INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; LAND-USE; GEOMETRIC SIGNATURE; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; CLASSIFICATION; LANDFORMS; REGIONALIZATION; TOPOGRAPHY; EXAMPLE; METRICS	We introduce landscape similarity - a numerical measure that assesses affinity between two landscapes on the basis of similarity between the patterns of their constituent landform elements. Such a similarity function provides core technology for a landscape search engine - an algorithm that parses the topography of a study area and finds all places with landscapes broadly similar to a landscape template. A landscape search can yield answers to a query in real time, enabling a highly effective means to explore large topographic datasets. In turn, a landscape search facilitates auto-mapping of physiographic units within a study area. The country of Poland serves as a test bed for these novel concepts. The topography of Poland is given by a 30 m resolution DEM. The geomorphons method is applied to this DEM to classify the topography into ten common types of landform elements. A local landscape is represented by a square tile cut out of a map of landform elements. A histogram of cell-pair features is used to succinctly encode the composition and texture of a pattern within a local landscape. The affinity between two local landscapes is assessed using the Wave-Hedges similarity function applied to the two corresponding histograms. For a landscape search the study area is organized into a lattice of local landscapes. During the search the algorithm calculates the similarity between each local landscape and a given query. Our landscape search for Poland is implemented as a GeoWeb application called TerraEx-Pl and is available at http://sil.uc.edu/. Given a sample, or a number of samples, from a target physiographic unit the landscape search delineates this unit using the principles of supervised machine learning. Repeating this procedure for all units yields a complete physiographic map. The application of this methodology to topographic data of Poland results in the delineation of nine physiographic units. The resultant map bears a close resemblance to a conventional physiographic map of Poland; differences can be attributed to geological and paleogeographical input used in drawing the conventional map but not utilized by the mapping algorithm.

For the importance of making the right decision, the proposed method was performed to be able to get better features of the EEG signals. The proposed method was consisted of two stages: feature extraction by 1D-LBP and classification by classifier algorithms with features extracted. On the classification stage, the several machine learning methods were employed to uniform and non-uniform 1D-LBP features. The proposed method was also compared with other existing techniques in the literature to find out benchmark for an epileptic data set. The implementation results showed that the proposed technique could acquire high accuracy in classification of epileptic EEG signals. Also, the present paper is an attempt to develop a general-purpose feature extraction scheme, which can be utilized to extract features from different categories of EEG signals.

In order to quickly estimate the queuing delay in the multimedia over CRN applications without exchanging traffic information among SUs, we are the first group to propose the use of Dirichlet-prior based fully Bayesian model in each individual SU to automatically update its statistical distribution on other SUs' Non-Contiguous (NC)-OFDM subcarrier selection strategy. Such a statistical distribution is used to estimate the probability of queuing delay being less than a threshold. In addition, we introduce a new concept called the Time Window, to accurately determine how many packets can be transmitted simultaneously over multiple subcarriers. Then, we propose a comprehensive, intelligent cross-layer scheduling scheme that can generate the optimal subcarrier selection, power and modulation allocation for each multimedia packet. Our experiments on real video transmission validate our intelligent cross-layer scheduling schemes. The simulation results match with theoretical analysis very well, and the reconstructed video quality using our proposed scheduling scheme is superior to four other popularly used schemes.

The meteorological droughts are identified using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). In the analysis of large-scale climate forcing represented by climate indices such as El Nino Southern Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole Mode and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation on regional droughts, it is found that regional droughts exhibits interannual as well as interdecadal variability. On the basis of potential teleconnections between regional droughts and climate indices, SPI-based drought forecasting models are developed with up to 3months' lead time. As traditional statistical forecast models are unable to capture nonlinearity and nonstationarity associated with drought forecasts, a machine learning technique, namely, support vector regression (SVR), is adopted to forecast the drought index, and the copula method is used to model the joint distribution of observed and predicted drought index. The copula-based conditional distribution of an observed drought index conditioned on predicted drought index is utilized to simulate ensembles of drought forecasts. Two variants of drought forecast models are developed, namely a single model for all the periods in a year and separate models for each of the four seasons in a year. The performance of developed models is validated for predicting drought time series for 10 years' data. Improvement in ensemble prediction of drought indices is observed for combined seasonal model over the single model without seasonal partitions. The results show that the proposed SVM-copula approach improves the drought prediction capability and provides estimation of uncertainty associated with drought predictions.

Machine learning approaches are effective in reducing the complexity of data and rapidly homing in on the underlying trend in multi-dimensional data. Here, we show that by employing an algorithm called the mean shift theory to a large amount of diffraction data in high-throughput experimentation, one can streamline the process of delineating the structural evolution across compositional variations mapped on combinatorial libraries with minimal computational cost. Data collected at a synchrotron beamline are analyzed on the fly, and by integrating experimental data with the inorganic crystal structure database (ICSD), we can substantially enhance the accuracy in classifying the structural phases across ternary phase spaces. We have used this approach to identify a novel magnetic phase with enhanced magnetic anisotropy which is a candidate for rare-earth free permanent magnet.

Three levels of aggregation of information can be used to aid the bedside clinician in this task: analysis of derived parameters of existing measured physiologic variables using simple bedside calculations (functional hemodynamic monitoring); prior physiologic data of similar subjects during periods of stability and disease to define quantitative metrics of level of severity; and libraries of responses across large and comprehensive collections of records of diverse subjects whose diagnosis; therapies, and course is already known to predict not only disease severity, but also the subsequent behavior of the subject if left untreated or treated with one of the many therapeutic options. The problem is in defining the minimal monitoring data set needed to initially identify those patients across all possible processes, and then specifically monitor their responses to targeted therapies known to improve outcome. To address these issues, multivariable models using machine learning data-driven classification techniques can be used to parsimoniously predict cardiorespiratory insufficiency. We briefly describe how these machine learning approaches are presently applied to address earlier identification of cardiorespiratory insufficiency and direct focused, patient-specific management.

J	Magnan, CN; Baldi, P				Magnan, Christophe N.; Baldi, Pierre			SSpro/ACCpro 5: almost perfect prediction of protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility using profiles, machine learning and structural similarity	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							SETS	Motivation: Accurately predicting protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility is important for the study of protein evolution, structure and function and as a component of protein 3D structure prediction pipelines. Most predictors use a combination of machine learning and profiles, and thus must be retrained and assessed periodically as the number of available protein sequences and structures continues to grow. Results: We present newly trained modular versions of the SSpro and ACCpro predictors of secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility together with their multi-class variants SSpro8 and ACCpro20. We introduce a sharp distinction between the use of sequence similarity alone, typically in the form of sequence profiles at the input level, and the additional use of sequence-based structural similarity, which uses similarity to sequences in the Protein Data Bank to infer annotations at the output level, and study their relative contributions to modern predictors. Using sequence similarity alone, SSpro's accuracy is between 79 and 80% (79% for ACCpro) and no other predictor seems to exceed 82%. However, when sequence-based structural similarity is added, the accuracy of SSpro rises to 92.9% (90% for ACCpro). Thus, by combining both approaches, these problems appear now to be essentially solved, as an accuracy of 100% cannot be expected for several well-known reasons. These results point also to several open technical challenges, including (i) achieving on the order of >= 80% accuracy, without using any similarity with known proteins and (ii) achieving on the order of >= 85% accuracy, using sequence similarity alone.

SparkSeq: fast, scalable and cloud-ready tool for the interactive genomic data analysis with nucleotide precision	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS; SEQUENCING DATA; BIOCONDUCTOR; HADOOP	A Summary: Many time-consuming analyses of next-generation sequencing data can be addressed with modern cloud computing. The Apache Hadoop-based solutions have become popular in genomics because of their scalability in a cloud infrastructure. So far, most of these tools have been used for batch data processing rather than interactive data querying. The SparkSeq software has been created to take advantage of a new MapReduce framework, Apache Spark, for next-generation sequencing data. SparkSeq is a general-purpose, flexible and easily extendable library for genomic cloud computing. It can be used to build genomic analysis pipelines in Scala and run them in an interactive way. SparkSeq opens up the possibility of customized ad hoc secondary analyses and iterative machine learning algorithms. This article demonstrates its scalability and overall fast performance by running the analyses of sequencing datasets. Tests of SparkSeq also prove that the use of cache and HDFS block size can be tuned for the optimal performance on multiple worker nodes.

Accurately identifying interaction residues solely from protein sequences is useful for both protein function annotation and drug design, especially in the post-genomic era, as large volumes of protein data have not been functionally annotated. Protein-nucleotide binding residue prediction is a typical imbalanced learning problem, where binding residues are extremely fewer in number than non-binding residues. Alleviating the severity of class imbalance has been demonstrated to be a promising means of improving the prediction performance of a machine-learning-based predictor for class imbalance problems. However, little attention has been paid to the negative impact of class imbalance on protein-nucleotide binding residue prediction. In this study, we propose a new supervised over-sampling algorithm that synthesizes additional minority class samples to address class imbalance. The experimental results from protein-nucleotide interaction datasets demonstrate that the proposed supervised over-sampling algorithm can relieve the severity of class imbalance and help to improve prediction performance. Based on the proposed over-sampling algorithm, a predictor, called TargetSOS, is implemented for protein-nucleotide binding residue prediction. Cross-validation tests and independent validation tests demonstrate the effectiveness of TargetSOS.

Daily grass or alfalfa reference ET values and crop coefficients are widely used to estimate crop water demand. Inaccurate reference ET estimates can hence have a tremendous impact on irrigation costs and the demands on U.S. freshwater resources, particularly within the Ogallala aquifer region. ET networks calculate reference ET using local meteorological data. With gaps in spatial coverage of existing networks and the agriculture-based Texas High Plains ET (TXHPET) network in jeopardy due to lack of funding, there is an immediate need for alternative sources capable of filling data gaps without high maintenance and field-based support costs. Non-agricultural weather stations located throughout the Texas High Plains are providing publicly accessible meteorological data. However, there are concerns that the data may not be suitable for estimating reference ET due to factors such as weather station siting, fetch requirements, data formats, parameters recorded, and quality control issues. The goal of the research reported in this paper is to assess the use of alternative data sources for reference ET computation. Towards this objective, we trained Gaussian process models, an instance of kernel-based machine learning algorithms, on data collected from weather stations to estimate reference ET values and augment the TXHPET database. Results show that Gaussian process models provide much greater accuracy than baseline least square regression models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Bai, Y; Wang, P; Li, C; Xie, JJ; Wang, Y				Bai, Yun; Wang, Pu; Li, Chuan; Xie, Jingjing; Wang, Yin			A multi-scale relevance vector regression approach for daily urban water demand forecasting	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Water demand forecasting; Stationary wavelet transform; Relevance vector regression; Multi-scale; Adaptive chaos particle swarm optimization	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; TIME-SERIES; PREDICTION; CONSUMPTION; ALGORITHM; MACHINE; FUZZY; MODEL	Water is one of the most important resources for economic and social developments. Daily water demand forecasting is an effective measure for scheduling urban water facilities. This work proposes a multi-scale relevance vector regression (MSRVR) approach to forecast daily urban water demand. The approach uses the stationary wavelet transform to decompose historical time series of daily water supplies into different scales. At each scale, the wavelet coefficients are used to train a machine-learning model using the relevance vector regression (RVR) method. The estimated coefficients of the RVR outputs for all of the scales are employed to reconstruct the forecasting result through the inverse wavelet transform. To better facilitate the MSRVR forecasting, the chaos features of the daily water supply series are analyzed to determine the input variables of the RVR model. In addition, an adaptive chaos particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to find the optimal combination of the RVR model parameters. The MSRVR approach is evaluated using real data collected from two waterworks and is compared with recently reported methods. The results show that the proposed MSRVR method can forecast daily urban water demand much more precisely in terms of the normalized root-mean-square error, correlation coefficient, and mean absolute percentage error criteria.

In order to process this information and to extract all possible knowledge, machine learning techniques become necessary. Here we present a new methodology to automatically discover unknown variable objects in large astronomical catalogs. With the aim of taking full advantage of all information we have about known objects, our method is based on a supervised algorithm. In particular, we train a random forest classifier using known variability classes of objects and obtain votes for each of the objects in the training set. We then model this voting distribution with a Bayesian network and obtain the joint voting distribution among the training objects. Consequently, an unknown object is considered as an outlier insofar it has a low joint probability. By leaving out one of the classes on the training set, we perform a validity test and show that when the random forest classifier attempts to classify unknown light curves (the class left out), it votes with an unusual distribution among the classes. This rare voting is detected by the Bayesian network and expressed as a low joint probability. Our method is suitable for exploring massive data sets given that the training process is performed offline. We tested our algorithm on 20 million light curves from the MACHO catalog and generated a list of anomalous candidates. After analysis, we divided the candidates into two main classes of outliers: artifacts and intrinsic outliers. Artifacts were principally due to air mass variation, seasonal variation, bad calibration, or instrumental errors and were consequently removed from our outlier list and added to the training set. After retraining, we selected about 4000 objects, which we passed to a post-analysis stage by performing a cross-match with all publicly available catalogs. Within these candidates we identified certain known but rare objects such as eclipsing Cepheids, blue variables, cataclysmic variables, and X-ray sources. For some outliers there was no additional information. Among them we identified three unknown variability types and a few individual outliers that will be followed up in order to perform a deeper analysis.

Traditional nonuniform scaling for tackling this problem will lead to distortion. Therefore, content-aware consideration is mostly incorporated in the designing procedure. Such methods generally defines an energy function indicating the importance level of image content. The more important regions would be retained in the resizing procedure and distortion could be avoided consequently. The definition of the related energy function is thus the critical factor that directly influences the resizing results. In this work, we explore the definition of energy function from another aspect, matrix decomposition of Low-rank Representation. In our processing, a feature matrix that reflects the texture prior of object contour is firstly constructed. Then the matrix is decomposed into a low-rank one and sparse one. The energy function for resizing is then inferred from the sparse one. We illustrate the proposed method through seam carving framework and image shrinkage operation. Experiments on a dataset containing 1000 images demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the feature importance score generated by machine learning methods is not statistically interpretable, which hampers its application in practice like medical diagnosis. In this study, a framework of Algorithmic Randomness based Feature Selection (ARFS) is proposed to measure the feature importance score using the p-value which derives from the combination of algorithmic randomness test and machine learning methods. In ARFS, a machine learning algorithm, such as random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayes classifier (NB) is used to compute the nonconformity score of each example belonging to data distribution, and then the p-value from algorithmic randomness test is obtained from nonconformity scores. ARFS evaluates the importance of each feature with the reduction of p-value on the datasets before and after random permutation of that feature, which makes it statistically interpretable. To demonstrate its efficiency, three ARFS models, i.e. ARFS-RF, ARFS-SVM and ARFS-NB were used to compare with some feature selection approaches, i.e. RF-ACC, RF-Gini, KNNpermute, SMFS, ANOVA and SNR. The results showed that ARFS-RF obtained better performances both on the synthetic and benchmark datasets. Further study on chronic gastritis dataset in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) showed that the symptom sets given by ARFS-RF performs substantially better than that of TCM experts with the same size. The symptom ranking list generated by ARFS-RF can offer counselling for the physician to design, select, and interpret the symptoms in chronic gastritis diagnosis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Combining Structural Modeling with Ensemble Machine Learning to Accurately Predict Protein Fold Stability and Binding Affinity Effects upon Mutation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; AMINO-ACID SUBSTITUTIONS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; HOT-SPOTS; SOMATIC MUTATIONS; CANCER GENOME; HUMAN-DISEASE; HUMAN GENES; WEB SERVER; DATABASE	Advances in sequencing have led to a rapid accumulation of mutations, some of which are associated with diseases. However, to draw mechanistic conclusions, a biochemical understanding of these mutations is necessary. For coding mutations, accurate prediction of significant changes in either the stability of proteins or their affinity to their binding partners is required. Traditional methods have used semi-empirical force fields, while newer methods employ machine learning of sequence and structural features. Here, we show how combining both of these approaches leads to a marked boost in accuracy. We introduce ELASPIC, a novel ensemble machine learning approach that is able to predict stability effects upon mutation in both, domain cores and domain-domain interfaces. We combine semi-empirical energy terms, sequence conservation, and a wide variety of molecular details with a Stochastic Gradient Boosting of Decision Trees (SGB-DT) algorithm. The accuracy of our predictions surpasses existing methods by a considerable margin, achieving correlation coefficients of 0.77 for stability, and 0.75 for affinity predictions. Notably, we integrated homology modeling to enable proteome-wide prediction and show that accurate prediction on modeled structures is possible. Lastly, ELASPIC showed significant differences between various types of disease-associated mutations, as well as between disease and common neutral mutations. Unlike pure sequence-based prediction methods that try to predict phenotypic effects of mutations, our predictions unravel the molecular details governing the protein instability, and help us better understand the molecular causes of diseases.

Bassim			Quantification of the Heterogeneity of Prognostic Cellular Biomarkers in Ewing Sarcoma Using Automated Image and Random Survival Forest Analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TISSUE MICROARRAYS; FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY; QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT; PROTEIN EXPRESSION; PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS; COLD ISCHEMIA; CANCER; TUMOR; EVOLUTION; FAMILY	Driven by genomic somatic variation, tumour tissues are typically heterogeneous, yet unbiased quantitative methods are rarely used to analyse heterogeneity at the protein level. Motivated by this problem, we developed automated image segmentation of images of multiple biomarkers in Ewing sarcoma to generate distributions of biomarkers between and within tumour cells. We further integrate high dimensional data with patient clinical outcomes utilising random survival forest (RSF) machine learning. Using material from cohorts of genetically diagnosed Ewing sarcoma with EWSR1 chromosomal translocations, confocal images of tissue microarrays were segmented with level sets and watershed algorithms. Each cell nucleus and cytoplasm were identified in relation to DAPI and CD99, respectively, and protein biomarkers (e.g. Ki67, pS6, Foxo3a, EGR1, MAPK) localised relative to nuclear and cytoplasmic regions of each cell in order to generate image feature distributions. The image distribution features were analysed with RSF in relation to known overall patient survival from three separate cohorts (185 informative cases). Variation in pre-analytical processing resulted in elimination of a high number of non-informative images that had poor DAPI localisation or biomarker preservation (67 cases, 36%). The distribution of image features for biomarkers in the remaining high quality material (118 cases, 10 4 features per case) were analysed by RSF with feature selection, and performance assessed using internal cross-validation, rather than a separate validation cohort. A prognostic classifier for Ewing sarcoma with low cross-validation error rates (0.36) was comprised of multiple features, including the Ki67 proliferative marker and a sub-population of cells with low cytoplasmic/nuclear ratio of CD99. Through elimination of bias, the evaluation of high-dimensionality biomarker distribution within cell populations of a tumour using random forest analysis in quality controlled tumour material could be achieved. Such an automated and integrated methodology has potential application in the identification of prognostic classifiers based on tumour cell heterogeneity.

In recent years, low-rank matrix reconstruction has become a research hotspot in many scientific and engineering domains such as machine learning, image processing, computer vision and bioinformatics, which mainly involves the problem of matrix completion and robust principal component analysis, namely recovering a low-rank matrix from an incomplete but accurate sampling subset of its entries and from an observed data matrix with an unknown fraction of its entries being arbitrarily corrupted, respectively. Inspired by these ideas, we consider the problem of recovering a low-rank matrix from an incomplete sampling subset of its entries with an unknown fraction of the samplings contaminated by arbitrary errors, which is defined as the problem of matrix completion from corrupted samplings and modeled as a convex optimization problem that minimizes a combination of the nuclear norm and the l(1)-norm in this paper. Meanwhile, we put forward a novel and effective algorithm called augmented Lagrange multipliers to exactly solve the problem. For mixed Gaussian-impulse noise removal, we regard it as the problem of matrix completion from corrupted samplings, and restore the noisy image following an impulse-detecting procedure. Compared with some existing methods for mixed noise removal, the recovery quality performance of our method is dominant if images possess low-rank features such as geometrically regular textures and similar structured contents; especially when the density of impulse noise is relatively high and the variance of Gaussian noise is small, our method can outperform the traditional methods significantly not only in the simultaneous removal of Gaussian noise and impulse noise, and the restoration ability for a low-rank image matrix, but also in the preservation of textures and details in the image.

Removing batch effects for prediction problems with frozen surrogate variable analysis	PEERJ			English	Article						Batch effects; Surrogate variable analysis; Prediction; Machine learning; Database; Statistics; Genomics	GENE-EXPRESSION; UNWANTED VARIATION; MICROARRAY DATA; DEPENDENCE; PATTERNS; DESIGN; MODEL; ARRAY	Batch effects are responsible for the failure of promising genomic prognostic signatures, major ambiguities in published genomic results, and retractions of widely-publicized findings. Batch effect corrections have been developed to remove these artifacts, but they are designed to be used in population studies. But genomic technologies are beginning to be used in clinical applications where samples are analyzed one at a time for diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive applications. There are currently no batch correction methods that have been developed specifically for prediction. In this paper, we propose an new method called frozen surrogate variable analysis (fSVA) that borrows strength from a training set for individual sample batch correction. We show that fSVA improves prediction accuracy in simulations and in public genomic studies. fSVA is available as part of the sva Bioconductor package.

The major difficulty in using machine-learning approaches for classification of FC data arises from limited access to a wide variety of anomalous samples for training. In consequence, any learning with an abundance of normal cases and a limited set of specific anomalous cases is biased towards the types of anomalies represented in the training set. Such models do not accurately identify anomalies, whether previously known or unknown, that may exist in future samples tested. Although one-class classifiers trained using only normal cases would avoid such a bias, robust sample characterization is critical for a generalizable model. Owing to sample heterogeneity and instrumental variability, arbitrary characterization of samples usually introduces feature noise that may lead to poor predictive performance. Herein, we present a non-parametric Bayesian algorithm called ASPIRE (anomalous sample phenotype identification with random effects) that identifies phenotypic differences across a batch of samples in the presence of random effects. Our approach involves simultaneous clustering of cellular measurements in individual samples and matching of discovered clusters across all samples in order to recover global clusters using probabilistic sampling techniques in a systematic way. Results: We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in identifying anomalous samples in two different FC data sets, one of which represents a set of samples including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases, and the other a generic 5-parameter peripheral-blood immunophenotyping. Results are evaluated in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). ASPIRE achieved AUCs of 0.99 and 1.0 on the AML and generic blood immunophenotyping data sets, respectively. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that anomalous samples can be identified by ASPIRE with almost perfect accuracy without a priori access to samples of anomalous subtypes in the training set. The ASPIRE approach is unique in its ability to form generalizations regarding normal and anomalous states given only very weak assumptions regarding sample characteristics and origin. Thus, ASPIRE could become highly instrumental in providing unique insights about observed biological phenomena in the absence of full information about the investigated samples.

Facilitating Surveillance of Pulmonary Invasive Mold Diseases in Patients with Haematological Malignancies by Screening Computed Tomography Reports Using Natural Language Processing	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CELL TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS; ELECTRONIC MEDICAL-RECORD; ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA; FUNGAL-INFECTIONS; ASPERGILLOSIS; REGISTRY; PNEUMONIA; DIAGNOSIS; CARE; COMPLICATIONS	Purpose: Prospective surveillance of invasive mold diseases (IMDs) in haematology patients should be standard of care but is hampered by the absence of a reliable laboratory prompt and the difficulty of manual surveillance. We used a high throughput technology, natural language processing (NLP), to develop a classifier based on machine learning techniques to screen computed tomography (CT) reports supportive for IMDs. Patients and Methods: We conducted a retrospective case-control study of CT reports from the clinical encounter and up to 12-weeks after, from a random subset of 79 of 270 case patients with 33 probable/proven IMDs by international definitions, and 68 of 257 uninfected-control patients identified from 3 tertiary haematology centres. The classifier was trained and tested on a reference standard of 449 physician annotated reports including a development subset (n = 366), from a total of 1880 reports, using 10-fold cross validation, comparing binary and probabilistic predictions to the reference standard to generate sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver-operating-curve (ROC). Results: For the development subset, sensitivity/specificity was 91% (95% CI 86% to 94%)/79% (95% CI 71% to 84%) and ROC area was 0.92 (95% CI 89% to 94%). Of 25 (5.6%) missed notifications, only 4 (0.9%) reports were regarded as clinically significant. Conclusion: CT reports are a readily available and timely resource that may be exploited by NLP to facilitate continuous prospective IMD surveillance with translational benefits beyond surveillance alone.

Thus, an important area of biomedical research is to identify biomarkers that can classify sepsis severity and outcomes. The complex and heterogeneous nature of sepsis makes the prospect of the classification of sepsis severity using a single biomarker less likely. Instead, we employ machine learning techniques to validate the use of a multiple biomarkers scoring system to determine the severity of sepsis in critically ill children. The study was based on clinical data and plasma samples provided by a tertiary care center's Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) from a group of 45 patients with varying sepsis severity at the time of admission. Canonical Correlation Analysis with the Forward Selection and Random Forests methods identified a particular set of biomarkers that included Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), and Bicarbonate (HCO3) as having the strongest correlations with sepsis severity. The robustness and effectiveness of these biomarkers for classifying sepsis severity were validated by constructing a linear Support Vector Machine diagnostic classifier. We also show that the concentrations of Ang-1, Ang-2, and HCO3 enable predictions of the time dependence of sepsis severity in children.

In this work, we show that the support vector machine, an optimized binary classifier, can be implemented on a quantum computer, with complexity logarithmic in the size of the vectors and the number of training examples. In cases where classical sampling algorithms require polynomial time, an exponential speedup is obtained. At the core of this quantum big data algorithm is a nonsparse matrix exponentiation technique for efficiently performing a matrix inversion of the training data inner-product (kernel) matrix.

J	Roche-Lima, A; Domaratzki, M; Fristensky, B				Roche-Lima, Abiel; Domaratzki, Michael; Fristensky, Brian			Metabolic network prediction through pairwise rational kernels	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Metabolic network; Pairwise rational kernels; Supervised network inference; Finite-state transducers; Pairwise support vector machine	PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS; FINITE-STATE TRANSDUCERS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; ALGORITHMS; INFERENCE; PATHWAYS; AUTOMATA; LIBRARY; DNA	Background: Metabolic networks are represented by the set of metabolic pathways. Metabolic pathways are a series of biochemical reactions, in which the product (output) from one reaction serves as the substrate (input) to another reaction. Many pathways remain incompletely characterized. One of the major challenges of computational biology is to obtain better models of metabolic pathways. Existing models are dependent on the annotation of the genes. This propagates error accumulation when the pathways are predicted by incorrectly annotated genes. Pairwise classification methods are supervised learning methods used to classify new pair of entities. Some of these classification methods, e. g., Pairwise Support Vector Machines (SVMs), use pairwise kernels. Pairwise kernels describe similarity measures between two pairs of entities. Using pairwise kernels to handle sequence data requires long processing times and large storage. Rational kernels are kernels based on weighted finite-state transducers that represent similarity measures between sequences or automata. They have been effectively used in problems that handle large amount of sequence information such as protein essentiality, natural language processing and machine translations. Results: We create a new family of pairwise kernels using weighted finite-state transducers (called Pairwise Rational Kernel (PRK)) to predict metabolic pathways from a variety of biological data. PRKs take advantage of the simpler representations and faster algorithms of transducers. Because raw sequence data can be used, the predictor model avoids the errors introduced by incorrect gene annotations. We then developed several experiments with PRKs and Pairwise SVM to validate our methods using the metabolic network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As a result, when PRKs are used, our method executes faster in comparison with other pairwise kernels. Also, when we use PRKs combined with other simple kernels that include evolutionary information, the accuracy values have been improved, while maintaining lower construction and execution times. Conclusions: The power of using kernels is that almost any sort of data can be represented using kernels. Therefore, completely disparate types of data can be combined to add power to kernel-based machine learning methods. When we compared our proposal using PRKs with other similar kernel, the execution times were decreased, with no compromise of accuracy. We also proved that by combining PRKs with other kernels that include evolutionary information, the accuracy can also also be improved. As our proposal can use any type of sequence data, genes do not need to be properly annotated, avoiding accumulation errors because of incorrect previous annotations.

Comparison and Validation of Injury Risk Classifiers for Advanced Automated Crash Notification Systems	TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION			English	Article						advanced automated crash notification; machine learning; injury risk; logistic regression	METHODOLOGICAL ALTERNATIVES; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; TRAUMA CENTERS; FIELD TRIAGE; OVERTRIAGE; MORTALITY; SEVERITY; COST; CARE	Objective: The odds of death for a seriously injured crash victim are drastically reduced if he or she received care at a trauma center. Advanced automated crash notification (AACN) algorithms are postcrash safety systems that use data measured by the vehicles during the crash to predict the likelihood of occupants being seriously injured. The accuracy of these models are crucial to the success of an AACN. The objective of this study was to compare the predictive performance of competing injury risk models and algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, AdaBoost, naive Bayes, support vector machine, and classification k-nearest neighbors. Methods: This study compared machine learning algorithms to the widely adopted logistic regression modeling approach. Machine learning algorithms have not been commonly studied in the motor vehicle injury literature. Machine learning algorithms may have higher predictive power than logistic regression, despite the drawback of lacking the ability to perform statistical inference. To evaluate the performance of these algorithms, data on 16,398 vehicles involved in non-rollover collisions were extracted from the NASS-CDS. Vehicles with any occupants having an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 15 or greater were defined as those requiring victims to be treated at a trauma center. The performance of each model was evaluated using cross-validation. Cross-validation assesses how a model will perform in the future given new data not used for model training. The crash Delta V (change in velocity during the crash), damage side (struck side of the vehicle), seat belt use, vehicle body type, number of events, occupant age, and occupant sex were used as predictors in each model. Results and Conclusions: Logistic regression slightly outperformed the machine learning algorithms based on sensitivity and specificity of the models. Previous studies on AACN risk curves used the same data to train and test the power of the models and as a result had higher sensitivity compared to the cross-validated results from this study. Future studies should account for future data; for example, by using cross-validation or risk presenting optimistic predictions of field performance. Past algorithms have been criticized for relying on age and sex, being difficult to measure by vehicle sensors, and inaccuracies in classifying damage side. The models with accurate damage side and including age/sex did outperform models with less accurate damage side and without age/sex, but the differences were small, suggesting that the success of AACN is not reliant on these predictors.

To identify new and unknown malwares for updating their anti-virus signature repository, anti-virus vendors must daily collect new, suspicious files that need to be analyzed manually by information security experts who then label them as malware or benign. Analyzing suspected files is a time-consuming task and it is impossible to manually analyze all of them. Consequently, anti-virus vendors use machine learning algorithms and heuristics in order to reduce the number of suspect files that must be inspected manually. These techniques, however, lack an essential element - they cannot be daily updated. In this work we introduce a solution for this updatability gap. We present an active learning (AL) framework and introduce two new AL methods that will assist anti-virus vendors to focus their analytical efforts by acquiring those files that are most probably malicious. Those new AL methods are designed and oriented towards new malware acquisition. To test the capability of our methods for acquiring new malwares from a stream of unknown files, we conducted a series of experiments over a ten-day period. A comparison of our methods to existing high performance AL methods and to random selection, which is the naive method, indicates that the AL methods outperformed random selection for all performance measures. Our AL methods outperformed existing AL method in two respects, both related to the number of new malwares acquired daily, the core measure in this study. First, our best performing AL method, termed "Exploitation", acquired on the 9th day of the experiment about 2.6 times more malwares than the existing AL method and 7.8 more times than the random selection. Secondly, while the existing AL method showed a decrease in the number of new malwares acquired over 10 days, our AL methods showed an increase and a daily improvement in the number of new malwares acquired. Both results point towards increased efficiency that can possibly assist anti-virus vendors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It partitions a set of objects in such a manner that objects in the same clusters are more similar to each another than objects in the different cluster according to certain predefined criteria. K-means is simple yet an efficient method used in data clustering. However, K-means has a tendency to converge to local optima and depends on initial value of cluster centers. In the past, many heuristic algorithms have been introduced to overcome this local optima problem. Nevertheless, these algorithms too suffer several short-comings. In this paper, we present an efficient hybrid evolutionary data clustering algorithm referred to as K-MCI, whereby, we combine K-means with modified cohort intelligence. Our proposed algorithm is tested on several standard data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository and its performance is compared with other well-known algorithms such as K-means, K-means++, cohort intelligence (CI), modified cohort intelligence (MCI), genetic algorithm (GA), simulated annealing (SA), tabu search (TS), ant colony optimization (ACO), honey bee mating optimization (HBMO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The simulation results are very promising in the terms of quality of solution and convergence speed of algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Brain electrical activity bears the emotional cues needed for emotion detection, but very modest research has been done to extract those cues. This paper presents a novel machine learning approach using Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Packet Transform (DT-CWPT) time-frequency features from electroencephalogram (EEG) to detect emotions together with an analysis of brain activity in different emotional states. Firstly, DT-CWPT is used to extract time-frequency emotional features. Then non-redundant and most discriminating emotional features are selected through singular value decomposition (SVD), QR factorization with column pivoting (QRcp) and F-Ratio based feature selection (FS) method. The reduced emotional feature set is used to classify emotion using support vector machine (SVM) and validated by leave-one-out cross-validation scheme. Results confirm the robustness and consistency in classification of emotions from EEG signals and significant correlation between participants' self assessed ratings with emotional features. It also gives an analysis of activities in brain region during different emotional states. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Unfortunately, not all the clustering solutions in the ensemble contribute to the final result. In this paper, we focus on the clustering solution selection strategy in the cluster ensemble, and propose to view clustering solutions as features such that suitable feature selection techniques can be used to perform clustering solution selection. Furthermore, a hybrid clustering solution selection strategy (HCSS) is designed based on a proposed weighting function, which combines several feature selection techniques for the refinement of clustering solutions in the ensemble. Finally, a new measure is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of clustering solution selection strategies. The experimental results on both UCI machine learning datasets and cancer gene expression profiles demonstrate that HCSS works well on most of the datasets, obtains more desirable final results, and outperforms most of the state-of-the-art clustering solution selection strategies.

Moreover, post-fire OLT provides an indicator of long-term successional trajectories and permafrost susceptibility to thaw. To these ends, we 1) mapped OLT and associated uncertainty at 30 m resolution in the Yukon River Basin (YRB), Alaska, employing decision tree models linking remotely sensed imagery with field and ancillary data, 2) converted OLT to OLC using a nonlinear regression, 3) evaluate landscape controls on OLT and OLC, and 4) quantified the post-fire recovery of OLT and OLC. Areas of shallow (<10 cm), moderate (>= 10 cm and <20 cm), moderately thick (>= 20 cm and <30 cm), and thick (>= 30 cm) OLT, composed 34, 20, 14, and 18% of the YRB, respectively; the average OLT was 19.4 cm. Total OLC was estimated to be 338 Pg. A regional chronosequence analysis over 30 years revealed that OLT and OLC increased with stand age COLT: R-2 = 0.68; OLC: R-2 = 0.66), where an average of 16 cm OLT and 5.3 kg/m(2) OLC were consumed by fires. Strong predictors of OLT included climate, topography, near-surface permafrost distributions, soil wetness, and spectral information. Our modeling approach enabled us to produce regional maps of OLT and OLC, which will be useful in understanding risks and feedbacks associated with fires and climate feedbacks.(C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Francis, RA; Guikema, SD; Henneman, L				Francis, Royce A.; Guikema, Seth D.; Henneman, Lucas			Bayesian Belief Networks for predicting drinking water distribution system pipe breaks	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						Bayesian Belief Networks; Drinking water distribution systems; Expert systems; Graphical models	GASTROINTESTINAL ILLNESS; RELIABILITY; MODELS; REPLACEMENT; HEALTH; RISK	In this paper, we use Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to construct a knowledge model for pipe breaks in a water zone. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to model drinking water distribution system pipe breaks using BBNs. Development of expert systems such as BBNs for analyzing drinking water distribution system data is not only important for pipe break prediction, but is also a first step in preventing water loss and water quality deterioration through the application of machine learning techniques to facilitate data-based distribution system monitoring and asset management. Due to the difficulties in collecting, preparing, and managing drinking water distribution system data, most pipe break models can be classified as "statistical-physical" or "hypothesis-generating." We develop the BBN with the hope of contributing to the "hypothesis-generating" class of models, while demonstrating the possibility that BBNs might also be used as "statistical-physical" models. Our model is learned from pipe breaks and covariate data from a mid-Atlantic United States (U.S.) drinking water distribution system network. BBN models are learned using a constraint-based method, a score-based method, and a hybrid method. Model evaluation is based on log-likelihood scoring. Sensitivity analysis using mutual information criterion is also reported. While our results indicate general agreement with prior results reported in pipe break modeling studies, they also suggest that it may be difficult to select among model alternatives. This model uncertainty may mean that more research is needed for understanding whether additional pipe break risk factors beyond age, break history, pipe material, and pipe diameter might be important for asset management planning.

Automated recommendation systems are essential for users to discover music they love and for artists to reach appropriate audience. When manual annotations and user preference data is lacking (e. g. for new artists) these systems must rely on content based methods. Besides powerful machine learning tools for classification and retrieval, a key component for successful recommendation is the audio content representation. Good representations should capture informative musical patterns in the audio signal of songs. These representations should be concise, to enable efficient (low storage, easy indexing, fast search) management of huge music repositories, and should also be easy and fast to compute, to enable real-time interaction with a user supplying new songs to the system. Before designing new audio features, we explore the usage of traditional local features, while adding a stage of encoding with a pre-computed codebook and a stage of pooling to get compact vectorial representations. We experiment with different encoding methods, namely the LASSO, vector quantization (VQ) and cosine similarity (CS). We evaluate the representations' quality in two music information retrieval applications: query-by-tag and query-by-example. Our results show that concise representations can be used for successful performance in both applications. We recommend using top-VQ encoding, which consistently performs well in both applications, and requires much less computation time than the LASSO.

Compared to surgery and drug treatments, balance training is non-invasive and more desired. However, training exercises are usually tedious and the assessment tool is insufficient to diagnose patient's severity rapidly. Methods: An interactive virtual reality (VR) game-based rehabilitation program that adopted Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises, and a sensor-based measuring system were introduced. To verify the therapeutic effect, a clinical experiment with 48 patients and 36 normal subjects was conducted. Quantified balance indices were measured and analyzed by statistical tools and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Results: In terms of balance indices, patients who completed the training process are progressed and the difference between normal subjects and patients is obvious. Conclusions: Further analysis by SVM classifier show that the accuracy of recognizing the differences between patients and normal subject is feasible, and these results can be used to evaluate patients' severity and make rapid assessment.

Innovative technologies, such as Xbox Kinect, enable the recognition of body gestures, which are a direct and expressive way of human communication. Although current development toolkits provide support to identify the position of several joints of the human body and to process the movements of the body parts, they actually lack a flexible and robust mechanism to perform high-level gesture recognition. In consequence, developers are still left with the time-consuming and tedious task of recognizing gestures by explicitly defining a set of conditions on the joint positions and movements of the body parts. This paper presents EasyGR (Easy Gesture Recognition), a tool based on machine learning algorithms that help to reduce the effort involved in gesture recognition. We evaluated EasyGR in the development of 7 gestures, involving 10 developers. We compared time consumed, code size, and the achieved quality of the developed gesture recognizers, with and without the support of EasyGR. The results have shown that our approach is practical and reduces the effort involved in implementing gesture recognizers with Kinect. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hullermeier, E				Huellermeier, Eyke			Learning from imprecise and fuzzy observations: Data disambiguation through generalized loss minimization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						Imprecise data; Fuzzy sets; Machine learning; Extension principle; Data disambiguation; Loss function	RANDOM-VARIABLES; REGRESSION; EXAMPLES	Methods for analyzing or learning from "fuzzy data" have attracted increasing attention in recent years. In many cases, however, existing methods (for precise, non-fuzzy data) are extended to the fuzzy case in an ad-hoc manner, and without carefully considering the interpretation of a fuzzy set when being used for modeling data. Distinguishing between an ontic and an epistemic interpretation of fuzzy set-valued data, and focusing on the latter, we argue that a "fuzzification" of learning algorithms based on an, application of the generic extension principle is not appropriate. In fact, the extension principle fails to properly exploit the inductive bias underlying statistical and machine learning methods, although this bias, at least in principle, offers a means for "disambiguating" the fuzzy data. Alternatively, we therefore propose a method which is based on the generalization of loss functions in empirical risk minimization, and which performs model identification and data disambiguation simultaneously. Elaborating on the fuzzification of specific types of losses, we establish connections to well-known loss functions in regression and classification. We compare our approach with related methods and illustrate its use in logistic regression for binary classification. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In the process, he links the shape of fuzzy sets with classical loss functions, therefore providing strong theoretical links between fuzzy modeling and more classical machine learning approaches. This short note discusses various aspects of his proposal as well as possible extensions. I will first discuss the opportunity to consider more general uncertainty representations, before considering various alternatives to the proposed learning procedure. Finally, I will briefly discuss the differences I perceive about a loss-based and a likelihood-based approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The analysis was performed on data obtained in an emotion elicitation experiment involving 14 participants. Specific discrete emotions were targeted with stimuli from the International Affective Picture System database. The experiment was necessary to achieve the uniformity in the various aspects of emotion elicitation, data processing, feature calculation, self-reporting procedures and estimation evaluation, in order to avoid inconsistency problems that arise when results from studies that use different emotion-related databases are mutually compared. The results of the performed experiment indicate that the combination of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with sequential floating forward selection (SFFS) exhibited the highest accuracy in discrete emotion classification based on physiological features calculated from ECG, respiration, skin conductance and skin temperature. Using leave-one-session-out crossvalidation method, 60.3% accuracy in classification of 5 discrete emotions (sadness, disgust, fear, happiness and neutral) was obtained. In order to identify which methods may be the most suitable for real-time estimator adaptation, execution and learning times of emotion estimators were also comparatively analyzed. Based on this analysis, preferred feature reduction method for real-time estimator adaptation was minimum redundancy - maximum relevance (mRMR), which was the fastest approach in terms of combined execution and learning time, as well as the second best in accuracy, after SFFS. In combination with mRMR, highest accuracies were achieved by k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and MLP with negligible difference (50.33% versus 50.54%); however, mRMR+ kNN is preferable option for real-time estimator adaptation due to considerably lower combined execution and learning time of kNN versus MLP.

A systematic review of predictive modeling for bronchiolitis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Review						Bronchiolitis; Predictive modeling; Machine learning; Respiratory syncytial virus	RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS; INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; PREMATURE-INFANTS BORN; WEEKS GESTATIONAL-AGE; INVESTIGATORS COLLABORATIVE NETWORK; SERIOUS BACTERIAL-INFECTIONS; PREVIOUSLY HEALTHY INFANTS; SOUTH-AFRICAN CHILDREN; RISK-SCORING TOOL; MECHANICALLY VENTILATED INFANTS	Purpose: Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of illness leading to hospitalization in young children. At present, many bronchiolitis management decisions are made subjectively, leading to significant practice variation among hospitals and physicians caring for children with bronchiolitis. To standardize care for bronchiolitis, researchers have proposed various models to predict the disease course to help determine a proper management plan. This paper reviews the existing state of the art of predictive modeling for bronchiolitis. Predictive modeling for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is covered whenever appropriate, as RSV accounts for about 70% of bronchiolitis cases. Methods: A systematic review was conducted through a PubMed search up to April 25, 2014. The literature on predictive modeling for bronchiolitis was retrieved using a comprehensive search query, which was developed through an iterative process. Search results were limited to human subjects, the English language, and children (birth to 18 years). Results: The literature search returned 2312 references in total. After manual review, 168 of these references were determined to be relevant and are discussed in this paper. We identify several limitations and open problems in predictive modeling for bronchiolitis, and provide some preliminary thoughts on how to address them, with the hope to stimulate future research in this domain. Conclusions: Many problems remain open in predictive modeling for bronchiolitis. Future studies will need to address them to achieve optimal predictive models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

De-identification of clinical narratives through writing complexity measures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Electronic medical records; Privacy; Natural language processing	OF-THE-ART; AUTHORSHIP ATTRIBUTION; MEDICAL-RECORDS; READABILITY; DOCUMENTS; TEXT; VALIDATION; SYSTEM	Purpose: Electronic health records contain a substantial quantity of clinical narrative, which is increasingly reused for research purposes. To share data on a large scale and respect privacy, it is critical to remove patient identifiers. De-identification tools based on machine learning have been proposed; however, model training is usually based on either a random group of documents or a pre-existing document type designation (e.g., discharge summary). This work investigates if inherent features, such as the writing complexity, can identify document subsets to enhance de-identification performance. Methods: We applied an unsupervised clustering method to group two corpora based on writing complexity measures: a collection of over 4500 documents of varying document types (e.g., discharge summaries, history and physical reports, and radiology reports) from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and the publicly available i2b2 corpus of 889 discharge summaries. We compare the performance (via recall, precision, and F-measure) of de-identification models trained on such clusters with models trained on documents grouped randomly or VUMC document type. Results: For the Vanderbilt dataset, it was observed that training and testing de-identification models on the same stylometric cluster (with the average F-measure of 0.917) tended to outperform models based on clusters of random documents (with an average F-measure of 0.881). It was further observed that increasing the size of a training subset sampled from a specific cluster could yield improved results (e.g., for subsets from a certain stylometric cluster, the F-measure raised from 0.743 to 0.841 when training size increased from 10 to 50 documents, and the F-measure reached 0.901 when the size of the training subset reached 200 documents). For the i2b2 dataset, training and testing on the same clusters based on complexity measures (average F-score 0.966) did not significantly surpass randomly selected clusters (average F-score 0.965). Conclusions: Our findings illustrate that, in environments consisting of a variety of clinical documentation, de-identification models trained on writing complexity measures are better than models trained on random groups and, in many instances, document types.

T1-based imaging markers, especially volumetric patterns have demonstrated their discriminative potential, however, rely on the tissue abnormalities of gray matter alone. White matter abnormalities and their contribution to AD discrimination have been studied by measuring voxel-based intensities in diffusion tensor images (DTI); however, no systematic study has been done on the discriminative power of either region-of-interest (ROI)-based features from DTI or the combined features extracted from both T1 images and DTI. ROI-based analysis could potentially reduce the feature dimensionality of DTI indices, usually from more than 10e + 5, to 10-150 which is almost equal to the order of magnitude with respect to volumetric features from T1. Therefore it allows for straight forward combination of intensity based landmarks of DTI indices and volumetric features of T1. In the present study, the feasibility of tract-based features related to Alzheimer's disease was first evaluated by measuring its discriminative capability using support vector machine on fractional anisotropy (FA) maps collected from 21 subjects with Alzheimer's disease and 15 normal controls. Then the performance of the tract-based FA + gray matter volumes-combined feature was evaluated by cross-validation. The combined feature yielded good classification result with 94.3% accuracy, 95.0% sensitivity, 93.3% specificity, and 0.96 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The tract-based FA and the tract-based FA + gray matter volumes-combined features are certified their feasibilities for the recognition of anatomical features and may serve to complement classification methods based on other imaging markers.

The Web facilitates qualitative and quantitative comparisons via online debates, discussion forums, product comparison sites, etc., and comparison analysis is becoming increasingly useful in many application areas. This study develops a method for classifying sentences in Korean text documents into several different comparative types to facilitate their analysis. We divide our study into two tasks: (1) extracting comparative sentences from text documents and (2) classifying comparative sentences into seven types. In the first task, we investigate many actual comparative sentences by referring to previous studies and construct a lexicon of comparisons. Sentences that contain elements from the lexicon are regarded as comparative sentence candidates. Next, we use machine learning techniques to eliminate non-comparative sentences from the candidates. In the second task, we roughly classify the comparative sentences using keywords and use a transformation-based learning method to correct initial classification errors. Experimental results show that our method could be suitable for practical use. We obtained an F1-score of 90.23% in the first task, an accuracy of 81.67% in the second task, and an overall accuracy of 88.59% for the integrated system with both tasks.

The technique uses hourly counts of cosmic-ray neutrons, a network of 25 capacitance probes measuring soil moisture at half hourly intervals and at five depths (0-50 cm), and a multiple adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. We quantified soil moisture in the top portion of the soil during wet and dry periods for training and testing periods. After training, the technique provided reliable estimates of temporal pattern of soil moisture at 10- and 20-cm depths during a wet period using input data only from the cosmic-ray neutron probe. There was over-prediction of soil moisture during a dry period, which suggests a longer training period representative of the full range of likely conditions might be required. Spatial maps of soil water content produced from the single cosmic-ray neutron probe were similar to those of the capacitance probe.

We start with the computation of the L-1 maximum- projection principal component of a data matrix containing N signal samples of dimension D. We show that while the general problem is formally NP- hard in asymptotically large N, D, the case of engineering interest of fixed dimension D and asymptotically large sample size is N not. In particular, for the case where the sample size is less than the fixed dimension (N < D) we present in explicit form an optimal algorithm of computational cost 2(N). For the case N >= D, we present an optimal algorithm of complexity O(N-D). We generalize to multiple L-1-max-projection components and present an explicit L-1 optimal subspace calculation algorithm of complexity O(NDK-K+1)where K is the desired number of L-1 principal components ( subspace rank). We conclude with illustrations of -subspace signal processing in the fields of data dimensionality reduction, direction-of-arrival estimation, and image conditioning/ restoration.

This increasingly large collection of methods causes a problem for novice designers: How does one choose which design methods to use for a given problem? Experienced designers can provide case studies that document which methods they used, but studying these cases to infer appropriate methods for a novel problem is inefficient. This research addresses that issue by applying techniques from content-based and collaborative filtering to automatically recommend design methods, given a particular problem. Specifically, we demonstrate the quality with which different algorithms recommend 39 design methods out of an 800+ case study dataset. We find that knowing which methods occur frequently together allows one to recommend design methods more effectively than just using the text of the problem description itself. Furthermore, we demonstrate that automatically grouping frequently co-occurring methods using spectral clustering replicates human-provided groupings to 92% accuracy. By leveraging existing case studies, recommendation algorithms can help novice designers efficiently navigate the increasing array of design methods, leading to more effective product design.

Consequently, incorrectly assuming skew to be constant in these contradicting cases results in an over or under estimation of an algorithm's performance. The area under a precision-recall curve (AUCPR) is a common summary measurement used to report the performance of machine learning algorithms. It is well known that precision is dependent upon class skew, which often varies between datasets. In addition to this, it is demonstrated herein that under certain circumstances the relative ranking of an algorithm (as measured by AUCPR) is not constant and is instead also dependent upon skew. The skew at which the performance of two algorithms inverts and the relationship between precision measured at different skews are defined. This is extended to account for temporal skew characteristics and situations in which skew cannot be precisely defined. Formal proofs for these findings are presented, desirable properties are proved and their application demonstrated.

The MLOC framework incorporates knowledge about how a predictive model will be used for a subsequent task, thus combining machine learning with the decision that is made afterwards. In this work, we use the MLOC framework to study a problem that has implications for power grid reliability and maintenance, called the Machine Learning and Traveling Repairman Problem (ML&TRP). The goal of the ML&TRP is to determine a route for a "repair crew," which repairs nodes on a graph. The repair crew aims to minimize the cost of failures at the nodes, but as in many real situations, the failure probabilities are not known and must be estimated.

J	Liu, B; Feng, WJ; Xu, T; Ji, W				Liu, Bei; Feng, Wanjuan; Xu, Tao; Ji, Wei			A machine learning-based method to detect fluorescent spots and an accelerated, parallel implementation of this method	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN			English	Article						Spot detection; Machine learning; GPU; Multi-core CPU	RAPID OBJECT DETECTION; MULTISCALE PRODUCTS; CELLS; FEATURES; DYNAMICS; VESICLE	Under most microscopes, the fluorescent signals emitted from biological structures, such as vesicles, as well as the signals from single molecules will appear as small puncta, which contribute to a Gaussian-like distribution. Accurate segmentation of these spots will fundamentally affect our interpretation of a specific biological progress. Because of the complicated backgrounds in images, many algorithms fail to identify all of the interesting signals; the tremendous amount of time required for algorithms to process large datasets can also decrease their utility. Here, we introduce an excellent robust detection method based on the machine learning algorithm AdaBoost, which outperforms threshold-based segmentation, wavelets, and FDA under most situations. We also provide a GPU/multi-core CPU implementation of this algorithm; this implementation accelerates the algorithm approximately 10- and 7-fold acceleration compared with a single CPU implementation. The great reduction of time should make this method a promising candidate in the processing of large datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of our algorithm on true fluorescent micrographs, and the results show that machine learning-based detection methods outperform the four other previously reported methods.

J	Bakhtiari, AS; Bouguila, N				Bakhtiari, Ali Shojaee; Bouguila, Nizar			A variational Bayes model for count data learning and classification	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Latent topic models; Count data; Generalized Dirichlet distribution; Variational Bayes; Text classification; Visual scene categorization	LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS; TEXT CATEGORIZATION; MIXTURE; RETRIEVAL; SELECTION; SCENE	Several machine learning and knowledge discovery approaches have been proposed for count data modeling and classification. In particular, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003a) has received a lot of attention and has been shown to be extremely useful in several applications. Although the LDA is generally accepted to be one of the most powerful generative models, it is based on the Dirichlet assumption which has some drawbacks as we shall see in this paper. Thus, our goal is to enhance the LDA by considering the generalized Dirichlet distribution as a prior. The resulting generative model is named latent generalized Dirichlet allocation (LGDA) to maintain consistency with the original model. The LGDA is learned using variational Bayes which provides computationally tractable posterior distributions over the model's hidden variables and its parameters. To evaluate the practicality and merits of our approach, we consider two challenging applications namely text classification and visual scene categorization. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Most current approaches follow a multiple re-grasp strategy for this purpose, in which clothes are sequentially grasped from different points until one of them yields a desired configuration. In this work we propose a vision-based method, built on the Bag of Visual Words approach, that combines appearance and 3D information to detect parts suitable for grasping in clothes, even when they are highly wrinkled. We also contribute a new, annotated, garment part dataset that can be used for benchmarking classification, part detection, and segmentation algorithms. The dataset is used to evaluate our approach and several state-of-the-art 3D descriptors for the task of garment part detection. Results indicate that appearance is a reliable source of information, but that augmenting it with 3D information can help the method perform better with new clothing items. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed method combines machine learning with a Kalman filter to estimate instantaneous positions of a moving target. The target's accelerations, along with information from the network, are used to obtain an accurate estimation of its position. To this end, radio-fingerprints of received signal strength indicators (RSSIs) are first collected over the surveillance area. The obtained database is then used with machine learning algorithms to compute a model that estimates the position of the target using only RSSI information. This model leads to a first position estimate of the target under investigation. The kernel-based ridge regression and the vector-output regularized least squares are used in the learning process. The Kalman filter is used afterward to combine predictions of the target's positions based on acceleration information with the first estimates, leading to more accurate ones. The performance of the method is studied for different scenarios and a thorough comparison with well-known algorithms is also provided.

Among tensor decomposition methods, N-mode singular value decomposition (SVD) is widely used owing to its simplicity. However, the data dimension often becomes too large to perform N-mode SVD directly due to memory limitation. An incremental method to N-mode SVD can be used to resolve this issue, but existing approaches only provide a result, which is just enough to solve discriminative problems, not the full factorization result. In this paper, we present a complete derivation of the incremental N-mode SVD, which can be applied to generative models, accompanied by a technique that can reduce the computational cost by reordering calculations. The proposed incremental N-mode SVD can also be used effectively to update the current result of N-mode SVD when new training data is received. The proposed method provides a very good approximation of N-mode SVD for the experimental data, and requires much less computation in updating a multilinear model.

J	Kontschieder, P; Bulo, SR; Pelillo, M; Bischof, H				Kontschieder, Peter; Bulo, Samuel Rota; Pelillo, Marcello; Bischof, Horst			Structured Labels in Random Forests for Semantic Labelling and Object Detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Random forests; structured prediction; semantic image labelling; object detection	RECOGNITION; RELAXATION; SEGMENTATION; CONTEXT; TREES; CATEGORIZATION; SHAPE	Ensembles of randomized decision trees, known as Random Forests, have become a valuable machine learning tool for addressing many computer vision problems. Despite their popularity, few works have tried to exploit contextual and structural information in random forests in order to improve their performance. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective way to integrate contextual information in random forests, which is typically reflected in the structured output space of complex problems like semantic image labelling. Our paper has several contributions: We show how random forests can be augmented with structured label information and be used to deliver structured low-level predictions. The learning task is carried out by employing a novel split function evaluation criterion that exploits the joint distribution observed in the structured label space. This allows the forest to learn typical label transitions between object classes and avoid locally implausible label configurations. We provide two approaches for integrating the structured output predictions obtained at a local level from the forest into a concise, global, semantic labelling. We integrate our new ideas also in the Hough-forest framework with the view of exploiting contextual information at the classification level to improve the performance on the task of object detection. Finally, we provide experimental evidence for the effectiveness of our approach on different tasks: Semantic image labelling on the challenging MSRCv2 and CamVid databases, reconstruction of occluded handwritten Chinese characters on the Kaist database and pedestrian detection on the TU Darmstadt databases.

In the area of high-tech manufacturing products, even slight variations of the product state during production can lead to costly and time-consuming rework or even scrapage. Describing an individual product's state along the entire manufacturing programme, including all relevant information involved for utilization, e.g., in-process adjustments of process parameters, can be one way to meet the quality requirements and stay competitive. Ideally, the gathered information can be directly analyzed and in case of an identified critical trend or event, adequate action, such as an alarm, can be triggered. Traditional methods based on modelling of cause-effect relations reaches its limits due to the fast increasing complexity and high-dimensionality of modern manufacturing programmes. There is a need for new approaches that are able to cope with this complexity and high-dimensionality which, at the same time, are able to generate applicable results with reasonable effort. Within this paper, the possibility to generate such a system by applying a combination of Cluster Analysis and Supervised Machine Learning on product state data along the manufacturing programme will be presented. After elaborating on the different key aspects of the approach, the applicability on the identified problem in industrial environment will be discussed briefly.

This problem as a special case includes the -regularized convex minimization problem in signal processing, compressive sensing, machine learning, data mining, and so on. However, the non-differentiability of the -norm causes more challenges especially in large problems encountered in many practical applications. This study proposes, analyzes, and tests a Barzilai-Borwein gradient algorithm. At each iteration, the generated search direction demonstrates descent property and can be easily derived by minimizing a local approximal quadratic model and simultaneously taking the favorable structure of the -norm. A nonmonotone line search technique is incorporated to find a suitable stepsize along this direction. The algorithm is easily performed, where each iteration requiring the values of the objective function and the gradient of the smooth term. Under some conditions, the proposed algorithm appears globally convergent. The limited experiments using some nonconvex unconstrained problems from the CUTEr library with additive -regularization illustrate that the proposed algorithm performs quite satisfactorily. Extensive experiments for -regularized least squares problems in compressive sensing verify that our algorithm compares favorably with several state-of-the-art algorithms that have been specifically designed in recent years.

The proposed extension relaxes the strong assumption of the empirical probability distribution over elements of a training set and deals with a set of probability distributions produced by prior knowledge about training data. The classification problem is solved by considering extreme points of the probability distribution set or by means of the conjugate duality technique. Special cases of prior knowledge are considered in detail, including the imprecise linear-vacuous mixture model and interval-valued moments of feature values. Numerical experiments show that the proposed models outperform Campbell and Bennett's model for many real and synthetic data.

We investigate a hierarchy of linguistic decision trees (LDTs) for classification, and present linguistic interpretation of the hierarchy of LDTs. Due to the uncertain and non-linear relationship between input attributes and a goal, different hierarchies could have different performance for classification. We develop a GA with the linguistic ID3 in wrapper to optimize linguistic attribute hierarchy. The experimental results show that optimised linguistic attribute hierarchies perform better on the benchmark databases than a single LDT does, and they can greatly reduce the number of rules when the relationship between a goal variable and input attributes is highly uncertain and nonlinear. Comparing with well-known machine learning approaches, C4.5, Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks, the optimised linguistic attribute hierarchy achieves the highest accuracies for most tested databases. The trained hierarchy can be a real-time classifier if the optimization of hierarchies is performed offline.

Readability is the ease in which text can be read and understood. We hypothesize that the readability is determined by whether a reader can easily grasp text structures. The impression and complexity of text are significant factors. We extract features of impression and complexity from plain text and additional data, such as HTML tags. In order to compare the effect of extracting features, we assess readability rank by machine learning. We conduct fivefold cross validation for each domain and calculate the root mean squared error between the actual rank and the estimated rank. Cross validation experiments confirm that the performance of our method is high, showing the effectiveness of extracting features about the impression and complexity for readability assessment.

It has been widely used in image processing and pattern recognition tasks due to its psychological and physiological interpretation of natural data whose representation may be parts-based in human brain. However, the nonnegative constraint for matrix factorization is generally not sufficient to produce representations that are robust to local transformations. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we proposed a topographic NMF (TNMF), which imposes a topographic constraint on the encoding factor as a regularizer during matrix factorization. In essence, the topographic constraint is a two-layered network, which contains the square nonlinearity in the first layer and the square-root nonlinearity in the second layer. By pooling together the structure-correlated features belonging to the same hidden topic, the TNMF will force the encodings to be organized in a topographical map. Thus, the feature invariance can be promoted. Some experiments carried out on three standard datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches.

In this sense, a face image is just an observation and it should not be considered as the absolutely accurate representation of the face. As more face images from the same person provide more observations of the face, more face images may be useful for reducing the uncertainty of the representation of the face and improving the accuracy of face recognition. However, in a real world face recognition system, a subject usually has only a limited number of available face images and thus there is high uncertainty. In this paper, we attempt to improve the face recognition accuracy by reducing the uncertainty. First, we reduce the uncertainty of the face representation by synthesizing the virtual training samples. Then, we select useful training samples that are similar to the test sample from the set of all the original and synthesized virtual training samples. Moreover, we state a theorem that determines the upper bound of the number of useful training samples. Finally, we devise a representation approach based on the selected useful training samples to perform face recognition. Experimental results on five widely used face databases demonstrate that our proposed approach can not only obtain a high face recognition accuracy, but also has a lower computational complexity than the other state-of-the-art approaches.

Cost-Sensitive Online Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Cost-sensitive classification; online learning; online gradient descent; online anomaly detection	ALGORITHMS; PERCEPTRON	Both cost-sensitive classification and online learning have been extensively studied in data mining and machine learning communities, respectively. However, very limited study addresses an important intersecting problem, that is, "Cost-Sensitive Online Classification". In this paper, we formally study this problem, and propose a new framework for Cost-Sensitive Online Classification by directly optimizing cost-sensitive measures using online gradient descent techniques. Specifically, we propose two novel cost-sensitive online classification algorithms, which are designed to directly optimize two well-known cost-sensitive measures: (i) maximization of weighted sum of sensitivity and specificity, and (ii) minimization of weighted misclassification cost. We analyze the theoretical bounds of the cost-sensitive measures made by the proposed algorithms, and extensively examine their empirical performance on a variety of cost-sensitive online classification tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the proposed technique for solving several online anomaly detection tasks, showing that the proposed technique could be a highly efficient and effective tool to tackle cost-sensitive online classification tasks in various application domains.

In addition, we developed a patient-independent seizure detection algorithm using Freiburg EEG database. Each patient contains datasets called "ictal" and "interictal". Window length of 16 s was applied to extract EEG segments from datasets of each patient. Furthermore, Power Spectral Density (PSD) of each EEG segment was estimated using different spectral analysis methods. Afterwards, these values were fed as input to different machine learning methods that were responsible for seizure detection. We also applied MSPCA de-noising method to EEG segments prior to PSD estimation to determine if MSPCA can further enhance the classifiers' performance. The MSPCA drastically improved both the sensitivity and the specificity, increasing the overall accuracy of all three classifiers up to 20 %. The best overall detection accuracy (99.59 %) was achieved when Eigenvector analysis was used for frequency estimation, and C4.5 as a classifier. The experiment results show that MSPCA is an effective de-noising method for improving the classification performance in epileptic seizure detection.

Unfortunately, many of the upgrades either fail or misbehave. We argue that many of these failures can be avoided for users of the new version of the software by exploiting the characteristics of the upgrade and feedback from the users that have already installed it. To demonstrate that this can be achieved, we build Mojave, the first recommendation system for software upgrades. Mojave leverages data from the existing and new users, machine learning, and static and dynamic source analyses. For each new user, Mojave computes the likelihood that the upgrade will fail for him/her. Based on this value, Mojave recommends for or against the upgrade. We evaluate Mojave for three real upgrade problems with the OpenSSH suite, and one synthetic upgrade problem each in the SQLite database and the uServer Web server. Our results show that it provides accurate recommendations to the new users. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Cheng, FX; Zhao, ZM				Cheng, Feixiong; Zhao, Zhongming			Machine learning-based prediction of drug-drug interactions by integrating drug phenotypic, therapeutic, chemical, and genomic properties	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							DATABASE; CLASSIFICATION; DISCOVERY; NETWORKS; UPDATE; CONSTRUCTION; PROFILES; RESOURCE; INSIGHTS; SYSTEMS	Objective Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are an important consideration in both drug development and clinical application, especially for co-administered medications. While it is necessary to identify all possible DDIs during clinical trials, DDIs are frequently reported after the drugs are approved for clinical use, and they are a common cause of adverse drug reactions (ADR) and increasing healthcare costs. Computational prediction may assist in identifying potential DDIs during clinical trials. Methods Here we propose a heterogeneous network-assisted inference (HNAI) framework to assist with the prediction of DDIs. First, we constructed a comprehensive DDI network that contained 6946 unique DDI pairs connecting 721 approved drugs based on DrugBank data. Next, we calculated drug-drug pair similarities using four features: phenotypic similarity based on a comprehensive drug-ADR network, therapeutic similarity based on the drug Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system, chemical structural similarity from SMILES data, and genomic similarity based on a large drug-target interaction network built using the DrugBank and Therapeutic Target Database. Finally, we applied five predictive models in the HNAI framework: naive Bayes, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and support vector machine, respectively. Results The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the HNAI models is 0.67 as evaluated using fivefold cross-validation. Using antipsychotic drugs as an example, several HNAI-predicted DDIs that involve weight gain and cytochrome P450 inhibition were supported by literature resources. Conclusions Through machine learning-based integration of drug phenotypic, therapeutic, structural, and genomic similarities, we demonstrated that HNAI is promising for uncovering DDIs in drug development and postmarketing surveillance.

The task involved a simulation of a crane that was used by a human operator to move boxes from arbitrary locations throughout a wide area to a designated drop off location in the environment. Initial attempts to teach an agent how to perform the task through observation in a context-free manner yielded poor performance. However, when the task to be learned was decomposed into separate contexts and the agents learned each context independently, the performance improved significantly. The paper describes the process that enabled the improvements achieved and discusses the tests and results that demonstrated the improvement.

This paper proposes a low computation seizure prediction algorithm that combines a fractal dimension with a machine learning algorithm. The presented seizure prediction algorithm extracts the Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD) of EEG signals as features to classify the patient's preictal or interictal state with Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) as a classifier. The outputs of BLDA are smoothed by a Kalman fitter for reducing possible sporadic and isolated false alarms and then the final prediction results are produced using a thresholding procedure. The algorithm was evaluated on the intracranial EEG recordings of 21 patients in the Freiburg EEG database. For seizure occurrence period of 30 min and 50 min, our algorithm obtained an average sensitivity of 86.95% and 89.33%, an average false prediction rate of 0.20/h, and an average prediction time of 24.47 min and 39.39 min, respectively. The results confirm that the changes of HFD can serve as a precursor of ictal activities and be used for distinguishing between interictal and preictal epochs. Both HFD and BLDA classifier have a low computational complexity. All of these make the proposed algorithm suitable for real-time seizure prediction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A comprehensive benchmark is needed to inform best practices in this broad application field. Previous benchmarks have evaluated performance for a few supervised classification and feature selection methods and limited ways to optimize them. The present work updates prior benchmarks by increasing the number of classifiers and feature selection methods order of magnitude, including adding recently developed, state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, this study used 229 text categorization data sets/tasks, and evaluated 28 classification methods (both well-established and proprietary/commercial) and 19 feature selection methods according to 4 classification performance metrics.

J	Yu, N				Yu, Ning			Exploring Co-Training Strategies for Opinion Detection	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						text mining; machine learning; automatic classification	SEMANTIC ORIENTATION; CLASSIFICATION; TEXT; EM	For the last decade or so, sentiment analysis, which aims to automatically identify opinions, polarities, or emotions from user-generated content (e.g., blogs, tweets), has attracted interest from both academic and industrial communities. Most sentiment analysis strategies fall into 2 categories: lexicon-based and corpus-based approaches. While the latter often requires sentiment-labeled data to build a machine learning model, both approaches need sentiment-labeled data for evaluation. Unfortunately, most data domains lack sufficient quantities of labeled data, especially at the subdocument level. Semisupervised learning (SSL), a machine learning technique that requires only a few labeled examples and can automatically label unlabeled data, is a promising strategy to deal with the issue of insufficient labeled data. Although previous studies have shown promising results of applying various SSL algorithms to solve a sentiment-analysis problem, co-training, an SSL algorithm, has not attracted much attention for sentiment analysis largely due to its restricted assumptions. Therefore, this study focuses on revisiting co-training in depth and discusses several co-training strategies for sentiment analysis following a loose assumption. Results suggest that co-training can be more effective than can other currently adopted SSL methods for sentiment analysis.

In this study, an investigation was performed to classify buildings delineated from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing data into three types: single-family houses, multiple-family houses, and non-residential buildings. Four kinds of spatial attributes describing the shape, location, and surrounding environment of buildings were calculated and subsequently employed in the classification. Experiments were performed in suburban and downtown sites in Denver, CO, USA, considering different building components and neighborhood environments. Building type classification results yielded overall accuracy > 70% and Kappa >0.5 for both sites, demonstrating the feasibility of obtaining building type information from LiDAR data. The shape attributes, such as width, footprint area, and perimeter, were most useful for identifying building types. Environmental landscape attributes surrounding buildings, such as the number of road and parking lot pixels, also contributed to obtaining building type information. Combining shape and environmental landscape attributes was necessary to obtain accurate and consistent classification results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ding, SF; Hua, XP; Yu, JZ				Ding, Shifei; Hua, Xiaopeng; Yu, Junzhao			An overview on nonparallel hyperplane support vector machine algorithms	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Review						Support vector machine; Generalized eigenvalue proximal support vector machine; Twin support vector machine; Projection twin support vector machine	PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; TWIN SVM; REGRESSION; SELECTION	Support vector machine (SVM) has attracted substantial interest in the community of machine learning. As the extension of SVM, nonparallel hyperplane SVM (NHSVM) classification algorithms have become current researching hot spots in machine learning during the last few years. For binary classification tasks, the idea of NHSVM algorithms is to find a hyperplane for each class, such that each hyperplane is proximal to the data points of one class and far from the data points of the other class. Compared with the classical SVM, NHSVM algorithms have lower computational complexity, work better on XOR problems and can get better generalization performance. This paper reviews three representative NHSVM algorithms, including generalized eigenvalue proximal SVM (GEPSVM), twin SVM (TWSVM) and projection twin SVM (PTSVM), and gives the research progress of them. The aim of this overview is to provide an insightful organization of current developments of NHSVM algorithms, identify their limitations and give suggestions for further research.

However, most of state-of-the-art methods focus on individual sentences and ignore the impact of context on the meaning of a sentence. In this paper, we propose a method based on conditional random fields to incorporate sentence structure and context information in addition to syntactic information for improving sentiment identification. We also investigate how human interaction affects the accuracy of sentiment labeling using limited training data. We propose and evaluate two different active learning strategies for labeling sentiment data. Our experiments with the proposed approach demonstrate a 5%-15% improvement in accuracy on Amazon customer reviews compared to existing supervised learning and rule-based methods.

This massive growth of user-generated content has also affected traditional shopping behaviour. Customers have embraced new communication channels such as microblogs and social networks that enable them not only just to talk with friends and acquaintances about their shopping experience, but also to search for opinions expressed by complete strangers as part of their decision making processes. Uncovering how customers feel about specific products or brands and detecting purchase habits and preferences has traditionally been a costly and highly time-consuming task which involved the use of methods such as focus groups and surveys. However, the new scenario calls for a deep assessment of current market research techniques in order to better interpret and profit from this ever-growing stream of attitudinal data. With this purpose, we present a novel analysis and classification of user-generated content in terms of it belonging to one of the four stages of the Consumer Decision Journey Court et al. (2009) (i.e. the purchase process from the moment when a customer is aware of the existence of the product to the moment when he or she buys, experiences and talks about it). Using a corpus of short texts written in English and Spanish and extracted from different social media, we identify a set of linguistic patterns for each purchase stage that will be then used in a rule-based classifier. Additionally, we use machine learning algorithms to automatically identify business indicators such as the Marketing Mix elements McCarthy and Brogowicz (1981). The classification of the purchase stages achieves an average precision of 74%. The proposed classification of texts depending on the Marketing Mix elements expressed achieved an average precision of 75% for all the elements analysed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lima, ACES; de Castro, LN				Lima, Ana Carolina E. S.; de Castro, Leandro Nunes			A multi-label, semi-supervised classification approach applied to personality prediction in social media	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Personality; Big Five; Social media; Twitter; Multi-label classification; Semi-supervised learning	TEXT; NETWORKS; RATINGS; MODELS; WORDS	Social media allow web users to create and share content pertaining to different subjects, exposing their activities, opinions, feelings and thoughts. In this context, online social media has attracted the interest of data scientists seeking to understand behaviours and trends, whilst collecting statistics for social sites. One potential application for these data is personality prediction, which aims to understand a user's behaviour within social media. Traditional personality prediction relies on users' profiles, their status updates, the messages they post, etc. Here, a personality prediction system for social media data is introduced that differs from most approaches in the literature, in that it works with groups of texts, instead of single texts, and does not take users' profiles into account. Also, the proposed approach extracts meta-attributes from texts and does not work directly with the content of the messages. The set of possible personality traits is taken from the Big Five model and allows the problem to be characterised as a multi-label classification task. The problem is then transformed into a set of five binary classification problems and solved by means of a semi-supervised learning approach, due to the difficulty in annotating the massive amounts of data generated in social media. In our implementation, the proposed system was trained with three well-known machine-learning algorithms, namely a Naive Bayes classifier, a Support Vector Machine, and a Multilayer Perceptron neural network. The system was applied to predict the personality of Tweets taken from three datasets available in the literature, and resulted in an approximately 83% accurate prediction, with some of the personality traits presenting better individual classification rates than others.

J	Duan, R; Hong, O; Ma, GQ				Duan, Rong; Hong, Olivia; Ma, Guangqin			Semi-Supervised Learning in Inferring Mobile Device Locations	QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						mobile device location; semi-supervised learning; AGPS; cell tower triangulation		With the development of mobility technology, location information has become collectible by various positioning technologies. Different positioning technologies have their advantages and limitations. In particular, location accuracy varies among different technologies. In this paper, we propose semi-supervised learning in inferring low-accuracy location data density from high-accuracy location data density. We focus on the enormous amount of low-accuracy cell tower triangulation (CTT) calculated mobile device location data and the small amount of high-accuracy assisted global positioning system (AGPS) pinpointed location data. The CTT and AGPS mobile device location data are collected for each cell tower that serves the devices, and then, the actual distribution is learned from both CTT and AGPS data by semi-supervised learning, and the likelihood for low-accuracy CTT location can be used as an accuracy indicator. The proposed method takes the advantage of the existing extensively collected location data and augments it by a machine-learning algorithm. The method does not only complement the downside of one technology with the other technology but also considers the computing efficiency by extracting features that can segment the large data naturally, which is the essential in divide-and-conquer distributed big data processing. This big data approach improves the location accuracy statistically without the added complexity and cost of upgrading or replacing mobile networks or devices. Moreover, also, the proposed method focuses on the location density alignment, which avoids tracking individual user devices and preserves user privacy. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Among many learning models, the support vector machine is a popular model with high classification ability which can be trained by mathematical programming methods. Since the model was originally formulated for binary classification, various kinds of extensions have been investigated for multi-class classification. In this paper, we review some existing models, and introduce new models which we recently proposed. The models are derived from the viewpoint of multi-objective maximization of geometric margins for a discriminant function, and each model can be trained by solving a second-order cone programming problem. We show that discriminant functions with high generalization ability can be obtained by these models through some numerical experiments.

In this paper we propose an intelligent resource allocation scheme that dynamically adjusts medium-access-control (MAC) parameters to tune channel-access opportunities and maximize the total utility. "Intelligent" refers to the capability of our approach to regulate each 802.11 node's parameters automatically according to the changes of surrounding situations, e.g. channel conditions and number of nodes. Our intelligent allocation scheme uses neural networks to on-line learn the nonlinear function between the adopted MAC parameters and allocated throughput. Based on the learned knowledge, MAC parameters can therefore be dynamically adjusted toward the desired throughput allocation and consequently the maximal WLAN utility. Simulations results demonstrate the effectiveness of our allocation scheme in maximizing the system utility in a varying 802.11 WLAN environment.

Development of psychiatric biomarkers is consequently important. A promising approach involves the use of machine learning with neuroimaging, to make predictions of diagnosis and treatment response for individual patients. Herein, we describe predictions of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis using structural T-1 weighted brain scans obtained from 34 young males with ADHD and 34 controls and a support vector machine. We report 93% accuracy of individual subject diagnostic prediction. Importantly, automated selection of brain regions supporting prediction was used. High accuracy prediction was supported by a region of reduced white matter in the brainstem, associated with a pons volumetric reduction in ADHD, adjacent to the noradrenergic locus coeruleus and dopaminergic ventral tegmental area nuclei. Medications used to treat ADHD modify dopaminergic and noradrenergic function. The white matter brainstem finding raises the possibility of catecholamine disconnection or dysregulation contributing to the ADHD syndrome, ameliorated by medication.

While suspension culture processes benefit from decades of development of instrumented bioreactors, adherent cultures are typically performed in static, noninstrumented flasks and well-plates. We previously described a microfabricated bioreactor that enables a high degree of control on the microenvironment of the cells while remaining compatible with standard cell culture protocols. In this report, we describe its integration with automated image-processing capabilities, allowing the continuous monitoring of key cell culture characteristics. A machine learning-based algorithm enabled the specific detection of one cell type within a co-culture setting, such as human embryonic stem cells against the background of fibroblast cells. In addition, the algorithm did not confuse image artifacts resulting from microfabrication, such as scratches on surfaces, or dust particles, with cellular features. We demonstrate how the automation of flow control, environmental control, and image acquisition can be employed to image the whole culture area and obtain time-course data of mouse embryonic stem cell cultures, for example, for confluency.

Automatic identification of fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae)	JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION			English	Article						Anastrepha; Multimodal fusion; Machine learning; Fraterculus group; Automatic identification; Classifier selection; Fruit flies; Wing and aculeus images	FRATERCULUS COMPLEX DIPTERA; IMAGE RETRIEVAL; NEURAL-NETWORKS; TEXTURE FEATURES; RECOGNITION; COLOR; DESCRIPTORS; ANASTREPHA; CLASSIFICATION; FRAMEWORK	Fruit flies are pests of major economic importance in agriculture. Among these pests it is possible to highlight some species of genus Anastrepha, which attack a wide range of fruits, and are widely distributed in the American tropics and subtropics. Researchers seek to identify fruit flies in order to implement management and control programs as well as quarantine restrictions. However, fruit fly identification is manually performed by scarce specialists through analysis of morphological features of the mesonotum, wing, and aculeus. Our objective is to find solid knowledge that can serve as a basis for the development of a sounding automatic identification system of the Anastrepha fraterculus group, which is of high economic importance in Brazil. Wing and aculeus images datasets from three specimens have been used in this work. The experiments using a classifier multimodal fusion approach shows promising effectiveness results for identification of these fruit flies, with more than 98% classification accuracy, a remarkable result for this difficult problem.

Through analysing ripeness-related features extracted by thumping watermelons, collecting acoustic signals by microphones on mobile devices, our method can automatically identify the ripeness of watermelons. This is possible in real time, making use of machine learning techniques to provide good accuracy. We firstly collect a training dataset comprising acoustic signals generated by thumping both ripe and unripe watermelons. Audio signal analysis on this helps identify features related to watermelon ripeness. These features are then used to construct a classification model for future signals. Based on this, we developed a crowdsourcing application for Android which allows users to identify watermelon ripeness in real time while submitting their results to us allowing continuous improvement of the classification model. Experimental results show that our method is currently able to correctly classify ripe and unripe watermelons with an overall accuracy exceeding 89 %.

Our experiment results show that both user-based and item-based methods can reach a certain degree of accuracy, but the recommendation coverage of these two methods is significantly different. This paper qualitatively analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of such two methods, and found that user-based methods advantage in recommending popular items while item-based methods perform better at suggesting long tail items. Based on this analysis, we proposes a novel machine learning framework to systematically combine both. We train a model for each user-item pair for discovering the local preference of the user or item over both methods, and effectively combine user-based and item-based predictions using the preference information. Experiment results show that our approach can significantly improve the recommendation quality, and to a certain extend, alleviate the data sparsity problem.

However, constructed-response tasks are also costly to administer and challenging to score because they rely on human raters. One alternative to the manual scoring process is to integrate computer technology with writing assessment. The process of scoring written responses using computer programs is known as 'automated essay scoring' (AES). METHODS An AES system uses a computer program that builds a scoring model by extracting linguistic features from a constructed-response prompt that has been prescored by human raters and then, using machine learning algorithms, maps the linguistic features to the human scores so that the computer can be used to classify (i.e. score or grade) the responses of a new group of students. The accuracy of the score classification can be evaluated using different measures of agreement. RESULTS Automated essay scoring provides a method for scoring constructed-response tests that complements the current use of selected-response testing in medical education. The method can serve medical educators by providing the summative scores required for high-stakes testing. It can also serve medical students by providing them with detailed feedback as part of a formative assessment process. CONCLUSIONS Automated essay scoring systems yield scores that consistently agree with those of human raters at a level as high, if not higher, as the level of agreement among human raters themselves. The system offers medical educators many benefits for scoring constructed-response tasks, such as improving the consistency of scoring, reducing the time required for scoring and reporting, minimising the costs of scoring, and providing students with immediate feedback on constructed-response tasks.

We first detected in Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7 similar to 400 000 galaxy images with i magnitude < 18 that had more than one point spread function, and then applied a machine learning algorithm that detected similar to 26 000 galaxy images that had morphology similar to the morphology of galaxy mergers. That data set was mined using a novelty detection algorithm, producing a short list of 500 most peculiar galaxies as quantitatively determined by the algorithm. Manual examination of these galaxies showed that while most of the galaxy pairs in the list were not necessarily peculiar, numerous unusual galaxy pairs were detected. In this paper, we describe the protocol and computational tools used for the detection of peculiar mergers, and provide examples of peculiar galaxy pairs that were detected.

The uptake of minimal access surgery (MAS) has by virtue of its clinical benefits become widespread across the surgical specialties. However, despite its advantages in reducing traumatic insult to the patient, it imposes significant ergonomic restriction on the operating surgeons who require training for the safe execution. Recent progress in manipulator technologies (robotic or mechanical) have certainly reduced the level of difficulty, however it requires information for a complete gesture analysis of surgical performance. This article reports on the development and evaluation of such a system capable of full biomechanical and machine learning. Methods. The system for gesture analysis comprises 5 principal modules, which permit synchronous acquisition of multimodal surgical gesture signals from different sources and settings. The acquired signals are used to perform a biomechanical analysis for investigation of kinematics, dynamics, and muscle parameters of surgical gestures and a machine learning model for segmentation and recognition of principal phases of surgical gesture. Results. The biomechanical system is able to estimate the level of expertise of subjects and the ergonomics in using different instruments. The machine learning approach is able to ascertain the level of expertise of subjects and has the potential for automatic recognition of surgical gesture for surgeon-robot interactions. Conclusions. Preliminary tests have confirmed the efficacy of the system for surgical gesture analysis, providing an objective evaluation of progress during training of surgeons in their acquisition of proficiency in MAS approach and highlighting useful information for the design and evaluation of master-slave manipulator systems.

An exploratory study in the WHO World Mental Health Surveys	WORLD PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Post-traumatic stress disorder; predictive modeling; machine learning; penalized regression; random forests; ridge regression	PTSD; METAANALYSIS; PREVENTION; INTERVENTIONS; SYMPTOMS; EXPOSURE; VERSION; ADULTS; CIDI	Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) should be one of the most preventable mental disorders, since many people exposed to traumatic experiences (TEs) could be targeted in first response settings in the immediate aftermath of exposure for preventive intervention. However, these interventions are costly and the proportion of TE-exposed people who develop PTSD is small. To be cost-effective, risk prediction rules are needed to target high-risk people in the immediate aftermath of a TE. Although a number of studies have been carried out to examine prospective predictors of PTSD among people recently exposed to TEs, most were either small or focused on a narrow sample, making it unclear how well PTSD can be predicted in the total population of people exposed to TEs. The current report investigates this issue in a large sample based on the World Health Organization (WHO)'s World Mental Health Surveys. Retrospective reports were obtained on the predictors of PTSD associated with 47,466 TE exposures in representative community surveys carried out in 24 countries. Machine learning methods (random forests, penalized regression, super learner) were used to develop a model predicting PTSD from information about TE type, socio-demographics, and prior histories of cumulative TE exposure and DSM-IV disorders. DSM-IV PTSD prevalence was 4.0% across the 47,466 TE exposures. 95.6% of these PTSD cases were associated with the 10.0% of exposures (i.e., 4,747) classified by machine learning algorithm as having highest predicted PTSD risk. The 47,466 exposures were divided into 20 ventiles (20 groups of equal size) ranked by predicted PTSD risk. PTSD occurred after 56.3% of the TEs in the highest-risk ventile, 20.0% of the TEs in the second highest ventile, and 0.0-1.3% of the TEs in the 18 remaining ventiles. These patterns of differential risk were quite stable across demographic-geographic sub-samples. These results demonstrate that a sensitive risk algorithm can be created using data collected in the immediate aftermath of TE exposure to target people at highest risk of PTSD. However, validation of the algorithm is needed in prospective samples, and additional work is warranted to refine the algorithm both in terms of determining a minimum required predictor set and developing a practical administration and scoring protocol that can be used in routine clinical practice.

A comprehensive characterization of antibody responses to blood stage malaria is essential to support the development of future vaccines, sero-diagnostic tests, and sero-surveillance methods. We constructed a proteome array containing 4441 recombinant proteins expressed by the blood stages of the two most common human malaria parasites, P. falciparum (Pf) and P. vivax (Pv), and used this array to screen sera of Papua New Guinea children infected with Pf, Pv, or both (Pf/Pv) that were either symptomatic (febrile), or asymptomatic but had parasitemia detectable via microscopy or PCR. We hypothesized that asymptomatic children would develop antigen-specific antibody profiles associated with antidisease immunity, as compared with symptomatic children. The sera from these children recognized hundreds of the arrayed recombinant Pf and Pv proteins. In general, responses in asymptomatic children were highest in those with high parasitemia, suggesting that antibody levels are associated with parasite burden. In contrast, symptomatic children carried fewer antibodies than asymptomatic children with infections detectable by microscopy, particularly in Pv and Pf/Pv groups, suggesting that antibody production may be impaired during symptomatic infections. We used machine-learning algorithms to investigate the relationship between antibody responses and symptoms, and we identified antibody responses to sets of Plasmodium proteins that could predict clinical status of the donors. Several of these antibody responses were identified by multiple comparisons, including those against members of the serine enriched repeat antigen family and merozoite protein 4. Interestingly, both P. falciparum serine enriched repeat antigen-5 and merozoite protein 4 have been previously investigated for use in vaccines. This machine learning approach, never previously applied to proteome arrays, can be used to generate a list of potential seroprotective and/or diagnostic antigens candidates that can be further evaluated in longitudinal studies.

Due to a major disadvantage of the characteristic overlap and complexity, the wide bandwidth and the weak absorption of the Spectroscopy signals, it seems difficult to give a satisfactory solutions for the modeling problem. To address those problems, in the present paper, a summation wavelet extreme learning machine algorithm (SWELM (CS)) combined with Cuckoo research was adopted for drug discrimination by NIRS. Specifically, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) was selected as the classifier model because of its properties of fast learning and insensitivity, to improve the accuracy and generalization performances of the classifier model; An inverse hyperbolic sine and a Morlet-wavelet are used as dual activation functions to improve convergence speed, and a combination of activation functions makes the network more adequate to deal with dynamic systems; Due to ELM's weights and hidden layer threshold generated randomly, it leads to network instability, so Cuckoo Search was adapted to optimize model parameters; SWELM(CS) improves stability of the classifier model. Besides, SWELM(CS) is based on the ELM algorithm for fast learning and insensitivity; the dual activation functions and proper choice of activation functions enhances the capability of the network to face low and high frequency signals simultaneously; it has high stability of classification by Cuckoo Research. This compact structure of the dual activation functions constitutes a kernel framework by extracting signal features and signal simultaneously, which can be generalized to other machine learning fields to obtain a good accuracy and generalization performances. Drug samples of near infrared spectroscopy produced by Xian-Janssen Pharmaceutical Ltd were adopted as the main objects in this paper. Experiments for binary classification and multi-label classification were conducted, and the conclusion proved that the proposed method has more stable performance, higher classification accuracy and lower sensitivity to training samples than the existing ones, such as the BP neural network, ELM and ELM by particle swarm optimization.

Various databases have been developed containing information about experimentally and computationally detected human PPIs as well as their corresponding annotation data. However, these databases contain many false positive interactions, are partial and only a few of them incorporate data from various sources. To overcome these limitations, we have developed HINT-KB (http://biotools.ceid.upatras.gr/hint-kb), a knowledge base that integrates data from various sources, provides a user-friendly interface for their retrieval, calculates a set of features of interest and computes a confidence score for every candidate protein interaction. This confidence score is essential for filtering the false positive interactions which are present in existing databases, predicting new protein interactions and measuring the frequency of each true protein interaction. For this reason, a novel machine learning hybrid methodology, called (Evolutionary Kalman Mathematical Modelling-EvoKalMaModel), was used to achieve an accurate and interpretable scoring methodology. The experimental results indicated that the proposed scoring scheme outperforms existing computational methods for the prediction of PPIs.

J	Ghosh, S; Chaudhary, V				Ghosh, Subarna; Chaudhary, Vipin			Supervised methods for detection and segmentation of tissues in clinical lumbar MRI	COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS			English	Article						Clinical lumbar MRI; Computer-aided diagnosis; Intervertebral disc segmentation; Dural sac segmentation	SPINAL-CORD; DIAGNOSIS; MODEL; HERNIATION; FEATURES	Lower back pain (LBP) is widely prevalent all over the world and more than 80% of the people suffer from LBP at some point of their lives. Moreover, a shortage of radiologists is the most pressing cause for the need of CAD (computer-aided diagnosis) systems. Automatic localization and labeling of intervertebral discs from lumbar MRI is the first step towards computer-aided diagnosis of lower back ailments. Subsequently, for diagnosis and characterization (quantification and localization) of abnormalities like disc herniation and stenosis, a completely automatic segmentation of intervertebral discs and the dural sac is extremely important. Contribution of this paper towards clinical CAD systems is two-fold. First, we propose a method to automatically detect all visible intervertebral discs in clinical sagittal MRI using heuristics and machine learning techniques. We provide a novel end-to-end framework that outputs a tight bounding box for each disc, instead of simply marking the centroid of discs, as has been the trend in the recent past. Second, we propose a method to simultaneously segment all the tissues (vertebrae, intervertebral disc, dural sac and background) in a lumbar sagittal MRI, using an auto-context approach instead of any explicit shape features or models. Past work tackles the lumbar segmentation problem on a tissue/organ basis, and which tend to perform poorly in clinical scans due to high variability in appearance. We, on the other hand, train a series of robust classifiers (random forests) using image features and sparsely sampled context features, which implicitly represent the shape and configuration of the image. Both these methods have been tested on a huge clinical dataset comprising of 212 cases and show very promising results for both disc detection (98% disc localization accuracy and 2.08 mm mean deviation) and sagittal MRI segmentation (dice similarity indices of 0.87 and 0.84 for the dural sac and the inter-vertebral disc, respectively).

This test can be used for diagnostics, for screening, and for remission monitoring as well. We analyze clinical data, test various machine learning methods and select the best approach to these oblems. Three families of methods, decision trees, kNN (including advanced and adaptive kNN) and probability density evaluation with radial basis functions, are used for classification and risk estimation. Several pre-processing approaches were implemented and compared. The best of them are used to create the diagnostic system. For the differential diagnosis the best solution gives the sensitivity and specificity of 83.5% and 77%, respectively (using three input features, CRP, Haptoglobin and standard clinical symptom). For the screening task, the decision tree method provides the best result, with sensitivity and specificity of 81.4% and >99%, respectively (using the same input features). If the clinical symptoms (Lymphadenopathy) are considered as unknown then a decision tree with CRP and Hapt only provides sensitivity 69% and specificity 83.5%. The lymphoma risk evaluation problem is formulated and solved. The best models are selected as the system for computational lymphoma diagnosis and evaluation of the risk of lymphoma as well. These methods are implemented into a special web-accessed software and are applied to the problem of monitoring dogs with lymphoma after treatment. It detects recurrence of lymphoma up to two months prior to the appearance of clinical signs. The risk map visualization provides a friendly tool for exploratory data analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Luckner, M; Gad, M; Sobkowiak, P				Luckner, Marcin; Gad, Michal; Sobkowiak, Pawel			Stable web spam detection using features based on lexical items	COMPUTERS & SECURITY			English	Article						Web spam detection; Spam detection features; Regular expressions; Context analysis; Lexical items analysis		Web spam is a method of manipulating search engines results by improving ranks of spam pages. It takes various forms and lacks a consistent definition. Web spam detectors use machine learning techniques to detect spam. However, the detectors are mostly verified on data sets coming from the same year as the learning sets. In this paper we compared Support Vector Machine classifiers trained and tested on WEBSPAM-UK data sets from different years. To obtain stable results we proposed new lexical-based features. The HTML document transformed into a text without HTML tags, a set of visible symbols, and a list of links including the ones from tags gave information about weird combinations of letters; consonant clusters; statistics on syllables, words, and sentences; and the Gunning Fog Index. Using data collected in 2006 as a learning set, we obtained very stable accuracy among years. This choice of the training set reduced the sensitivity in 2007, but that can be improved by managing the acceptance threshold. Finally, we proved that the balance between the sensitivity and the specificity measured by the Area Under the Curve (AUC) is improved by our selection of features. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Our research indicates that, in comparison to traditional model-based or data-driven methods, the combination of time series modeling and machine learning techniques produces higher accuracy and lower false alarm rates in FDD for chillers. In this paper, we study a hybrid method incorporating auto-regressive model with exogenous variables (ARX) and support vector machines (SVM). A high dimensional parameter space is constructed by the ARX model and SVM sub-divides the parameter space with hyper-planes, enabling fault classification. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over conventional approaches with higher prediction accuracy and lower false alarm rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We propose a new formulation and show that energy-aware scheduling is a generalization of the minimum makespan scheduling problem. Taking the system graph and program graph as inputs, we propose three different algorithms for energy-aware scheduling, each of them having its own strengths and limitations. The first is a genetic algorithm (Plain GA) that searches for an energy reducing schedule. The second (CA + GA) uses cellular automata (CA) to generate low energy schedules, while using a genetic algorithm (GA) to find good rules for the CA. The third (EAH) is a heuristic which gives preference to high-efficiency machines in allocation. We have tested our algorithms on well-known program graphs and compared our results with other state-of-the-art scheduling algorithms, which confirms the efficacy of our approach. Our work also gives insight into the time-energy trade-offs in scheduling.

Since a depth sensor usually has poorer spatial resolution compared with a color image sensor, many depth image super-resolution methods have been investigated in the literature. With an assumption that no one super-resolution method can universally outperform the other methods, in this paper we introduce a learning-based selection scheme for different super-resolution methods. In our case study, three distinctive mean-type, max-type, and median-type filtering methods are selected as candidate methods. In addition, a new frequency-domain feature vector is designed to enhance the discriminability of the methods. Given the candidate methods and feature vectors, a classifier is trained such that the best method can be selected for each depth pixel. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is first demonstrated using the synthetic data set. The noise-free and noisy low-resolution depth images are constructed, and the quantitative performance evaluation is performed by measuring the difference between the ground-truth high-resolution depth images and the resultant depth images. The proposed algorithm is then applied to real color and time-of-flight depth cameras. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional algorithms both quantitatively and qualitatively.

In this paper, we propose a multilocal search and adaptive niching-based genetic algorithm with a consensus criterion for automatic data clustering. The proposed algorithm employs three local searches of different features in a sophisticated manner to efficiently exploit the decision space. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive niching method, which can dynamically adjust its parameter value depending on the problem instance as well as the search progress, and incorporate it into the proposed algorithm. The adaptation strategy is based on a newly devised population diversity index, which can be used to promote both genetic diversity and fitness. Consequently, diverged niches of high fitness can be formed and maintained in the population, making the approach well-suited to effective exploration of the complex decision space of clustering problems. The resulting algorithm has been used to optimize a consensus clustering criterion, which is suggested with the purpose of achieving reliable solutions. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we have conducted a series of experiments on both synthetic and real data and compared it with other reported methods. The results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve superior performance, outperforming related methods.

Many efficient algorithms have been developed based on solving the induced optimization problems. However, there exists a gap between the theoretically unbeatable convergence rate and the practically efficient learning speed. In this paper, we use the variational inequality (VI) convergence to describe the learning speed. To this end, we avoid the hard concept of regret in online learning and directly discuss the stochastic learning algorithms. We first cast the regularized learning problem as a VI. Then, we present a stochastic version of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) to solve the induced VI. We define a new VI-criterion to measure the convergence of stochastic algorithms. While the rate of convergence for any iterative algorithms to solve nonsmooth convex optimization problems cannot be better than O(1/root t), the proposed stochastic ADMM (SADMM) is proved to have an O(1/t) VI-convergence rate for the l1-regularized hinge loss problems without strong convexity and smoothness. The derived VI-convergence results also support the viewpoint that the standard online analysis is too loose to analyze the stochastic setting properly. The experiments demonstrate that SADMM has almost the same performance as the state-of-the-art stochastic learning algorithms but its O(1/t) VI-convergence rate is capable of tightly characterizing the real learning speed.

Multiobjective Optimization for Model Selection in Kernel Methods in Regression	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Kernel methods; kernel optimization; optimization; Pareto optimality; regression	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; APPROXIMATION; ALGORITHM; NETWORKS	Regression plays a major role in many scientific and engineering problems. The goal of regression is to learn the unknown underlying function from a set of sample vectors with known outcomes. In recent years, kernel methods in regression have facilitated the estimation of nonlinear functions. However, two major (interconnected) problems remain open. The first problem is given by the bias-versus-variance tradeoff. If the model used to estimate the underlying function is too flexible (i.e., high model complexity), the variance will be very large. If the model is fixed (i.e., low complexity), the bias will be large. The second problem is to define an approach for selecting the appropriate parameters of the kernel function. To address these two problems, this paper derives a new smoothing kernel criterion, which measures the roughness of the estimated function as a measure of model complexity. Then, we use multiobjective optimization to derive a criterion for selecting the parameters of that kernel. The goal of this criterion is to find a tradeoff between the bias and the variance of the learned function. That is, the goal is to increase the model fit while keeping the model complexity in check. We provide extensive experimental evaluations using a variety of problems in machine learning, pattern recognition, and computer vision. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields smaller estimation errors as compared with methods in the state of the art.

This requires the solution of three complex problems: accurate prediction of the trajectory of fast-moving objects, predicting the feasible catching configuration, and planning the arm motion, and all within milliseconds. We follow a programming-by-demonstration approach in order to learn, from throwing examples, models of the object dynamics and arm movement. We propose a new methodology to find a feasible catching configuration in a probabilistic manner. We use the dynamical systems approach to encode motion from several demonstrations. This enables a rapid and reactive adaptation of the arm motion in the presence of sensor uncertainty. We validate the approach in simulation with the iCub humanoid robot and in real-world experiments with the KUKA LWR 4+ (7-degree-of-freedom arm robot) to catch a hammer, a tennis racket, an empty bottle, a partially filled bottle, and a cardboard box.

RISE: An Incremental Trust-Region Method for Robust Online Sparse Least-Squares Estimation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS			English	Article						Computer vision; machine learning; online estimation; simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM); sparse least-squares minimization	SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION; GLOBAL CONVERGENCE; UNCONSTRAINED MINIMIZATION; BUNDLE ADJUSTMENT; ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; INFORMATION; ALIGNMENT; GRAPHS	Many point estimation problems in robotics, computer vision, and machine learning can be formulated as instances of the general problem of minimizing a sparse nonlinear sum-of-squares objective function. For inference problems of this type, each input datum gives rise to a summand in the objective function, and therefore performing online inference corresponds to solving a sequence of sparse nonlinear least-squares minimization problems in which additional summands are added to the objective function over time. In this paper, we present Robust Incremental least-Squares Estimation (RISE), an incrementalized version of the Powell's Dog-Leg numerical optimization method suitable for use in online sequential sparse least-squares minimization. As a trust-region method, RISE is naturally robust to objective function non-linearity and numerical ill-conditioning and is provably globally convergent for a broad class of inferential cost functions (twice-continuously differentiable functions with bounded sublevel sets). Consequently, RISE maintains the speed of current state-of-the-art online sparse least-squares methods while providing superior reliability.

Thus, an offline learning phase is not sufficient for recognizing and manipulating such objects. Rather, an autonomous robot needs to acquire knowledge through its own interaction with its environment, without using heuristics encoding human insights about the domain. Interaction also allows information that is not present in static images of a scene to be elicited. Out of a potentially large set of possible interactions, a robot must select actions that are expected to have the most informative outcomes to learn efficiently. In the proposed bottom-up probabilistic approach, the robot achieves this goal by quantifying the expected informativeness of its own actions in information-theoretic terms. We use this approach to segment a scene into its constituent objects. We retain a probability distribution over segmentations. We show that this approach is robust in the presence of noise and uncertainty in real-world experiments. Evaluations show that the proposed information-theoretic approach allows a robot to efficiently determine the composite structure of its environment. We also show that our probabilistic model allows straightforward integration of multiple modalities, such as movement data and static scene features. Learned static scene features allow for experience from similar environments to speed up learning for new scenes.

In this study, several machine learning approaches are used to analyze CRS data. The analyzed data come from a human blood in vitro assay which was used to assess the potential of mAb-based therapeutics to produce cytokine release similar to that induced by Anti-CD28 superagonistic (Anti-CD28 SA) mAbs. The data contain 7 mAbs and two negative controls, a total of 423 samples coming from 44 donors. Three (3) machine learning approaches were applied in combination to observations obtained from that assay, namely (i) Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA); (ii) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by K-means clustering; and (iii) Decision Tree Classification (DTC). All three approaches were able to identify the treatment that caused the most severe cytokine response. HCA was able to provide information about the expected number of clusters in the data. PCA coupled with K-means clustering allowed classification of treatments sample by sample, and visualizing clusters of treatments. DTC models showed the relative importance of various cytokines such as IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha. and IL-10 to CRS. The use of these approaches in tandem provides better selection of parameters for one method based on outcomes from another, and an overall improved analysis of the data through complementary approaches. Moreover, the DTC analysis showed in addition that IL-17 may be correlated with CRS reactions, although this correlation has not yet been corroborated in the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Such estimations and predictions for the care process can be produced from the vast amounts of healthcare data using information technology and computational intelligence techniques. Tactical decision-making and resource allocation may also be supported with different mathematical optimization models. Methods: This study was conducted with a data set comprising electronic nursing narratives and the associated Oulu Patient Classification (OPCq) acuity. A mathematical model for the automated assignment of patient acuity scores was utilized and evaluated with the pre-processed data from 23,528 electronic patient records. The methods to predict patient's acuity were based on linguistic pre-processing, vector-space text modeling, and regularized least-squares regression. Results: The experimental results show that it is possible to obtain accurate predictions about patient acuity scores for the coming day based on the assigned scores and nursing notes from the previous day. Making same-day predictions leads to even better results, as access to the nursing notes for the same day boosts the predictive performance. Furthermore, textual nursing notes allow for more accurate predictions than previous acuity scores. The best results are achieved by combining both of these information sources. The developed model achieves a concordance index of 0.821 when predicting the patient acuity scores for the following day, given the scores and text recorded on the previous day. Conclusions: By applying language technology to electronic patient documents it is possible to accurately predict the value of the acuity scores of the coming day based on the previous days assigned scores and nursing notes.

J	Xu, R; Wang, QQ				Xu, Rong; Wang, QuanQiu			Automatic construction of a large-scale and accurate drug-side-effect association knowledge base from biomedical literature	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Text mining; Drug side effect; Drug discovery; Drug repositioning; Drug toxicity prediction	PHARMACOGENOMICS; PROFILES; NETWORKS; DISEASE; TEXT	Systems approaches to studying drug-side-effect (drug-SE) associations are emerging as an active research area for drug target discovery, drug repositioning, and drug toxicity prediction. However, currently available drug-SE association databases are far from being complete. Herein, in an effort to increase the data completeness of current drug-SE relationship resources, we present an automatic learning approach to accurately extract drug-SE pairs from the vast amount of published biomedical literature, a rich knowledge source of side effect information for commercial, experimental, and even failed drugs. For the text corpus, we used 119,085,682 MEDLINE sentences and their parse trees. We used known drug-SE associations derived from US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug labels as prior knowledge to find relevant sentences and parse trees. We extracted syntactic patterns associated with drug-SE pairs from the resulting set of parse trees. We developed pattern-ranking algorithms to prioritize drug-SE-specific patterns. We then selected a set of patterns with both high precisions and recalls in order to extract drug-SE pairs from the entire MEDLINE. In total, we extracted 38,871 drug-SE pairs from MEDLINE using the learned patterns, the majority of which have not been captured in FDA drug labels to date. On average, our knowledge-driven pattern-learning approach in extracting drug-SE pairs from MEDLINE has achieved a precision of 0.833, a recall of 0.407, and an F1 of 0.545. We compared our approach to a support vector machine (SVM)-based machine learning and a co-occurrence statistics-based approach. We show that the pattern-learning approach is largely complementary to the SVM- and co-occurrence-based approaches with significantly higher precision and F1 but lower recall. We demonstrated by correlation analysis that the extracted drug side effects correlate positively with both drug targets, metabolism, and indications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Walking speed was computed by dividing estimated stride length by stride time using data from a foot mounted inertial measurement unit. In SDI methods stride-by-stride walking speed estimation was driven by detecting gait events using a hidden Markov model (HMM) based method (HMM-based SDI); alternatively, a threshold-based gait event detector was investigated (threshold-based SDI). In the ML method a linear regression model was developed for stride length estimation. Whereas the gait event detectors were a priori fixed without training, the regression model was validated with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. A subject-specific regression model calibration was also implemented to personalize the ML method. Healthy adults performed over-ground walking trials at natural, slower-than-natural and faster-than-natural speeds. The ML method achieved a root mean square estimation error of 2.0% and 4.2%, with and without personalization, against 2.0% and 3.1% by HMM-based SDI and threshold-based SDI. In spite that the results achieved by the two approaches were similar, the ML method, as compared with SDI methods, presented lower intra-subject variability and higher inter-subject variability, which was reduced by personalization.

Since the discovery of the first miRNA, computational tools have been essential to predict targets of given miRNAs that can be biologically verified. The precise mechanism underlying miRNA-mRNA interaction has not yet been elucidated completely, and it is still difficult to predict miRNA targets computationally in a robust fashion, despite the large number of in silico prediction methodologies in existence. Because of this limitation, different target prediction tools often report different and (occasionally conflicting) sets of targets. Therefore, we propose a novel target prediction methodology called stacking-based miRNA interaction learner ensemble (SMILE) that employs the concept of stacked generalization (stacking), which is a type of ensemble learning that integrates the outcomes of individual prediction tools with the aim of surpassing the performance of the individual tools. We tested the proposed SMILE method on human miRNA-mRNA interaction data derived from public databases. In our experiments. SMILE improved the accuracy of the target prediction significantly in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Any new target prediction tool can easily be incorporated into the proposed methodology as a component learner, and we anticipate that SMILE will provide a flexible and effective framework for elucidating in vivo miRNA-mRNA interaction.

Structural Topic Models for Open-Ended Survey Responses	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							POLITICAL TEXTS; QUESTIONS MEASURE; SOCIAL-SCIENCE; ISSUES	Collection and especially analysis of open-ended survey responses are relatively rare in the discipline and when conducted are almost exclusively done through human coding. We present an alternative, semiautomated approach, the structural topic model (STM) (Roberts, Stewart, and Airoldi 2013; Roberts et al. 2013), that draws on recent developments in machine learning based analysis of textual data. A crucial contribution of the method is that it incorporates information about the document, such as the author's gender, political affiliation, and treatment assignment (if an experimental study). This article focuses on how the STM is helpful for survey researchers and experimentalists. The STM makes analyzing open-ended responses easier, more revealing, and capable of being used to estimate treatment effects. We illustrate these innovations with analysis of text from surveys and experiments.

Neuropsychological data suggest that letter position within a word may be independently affected by brain damage, resulting in a dissociable subtype of peripheral dyslexia. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and supervised machine learning techniques to classify letter position based on activation patterns evoked during reading Hebrew words. Across the entire brain, activity patterns in the left intraparietal sulcus provided the best classification accuracy (80%) with respect to letter position. Importantly, the same set of voxels that showed highest classification performance of letter position using one letter-of-interest also showed highest classification performance using a different letter-of-interest. A functional connectivity analysis revealed that activity in these voxels co-varied with activity in the Visual Word Form Area, confirming cross-talk between these regions during covert reading. The results converge with reports of patients with acquired letter position dyslexia, who suffer from left occipito-parietal lesions. These findings provide direct and novel evidence for the role of left IPS within the reading network in processing relative letter positions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

At sea, DR requires the use of inertial sensors, usually a gyrocompass and an accelerometer, to estimate the orientation and distance traveled by the tracked object with respect to a reference coordinate system. In this paper, we consider the problem of DR navigation for vessels located close to or on the sea surface, where motion is caused by ocean waves. In such cases, the vessel pitch angle is fast time varying and its estimation by direct measurements of orientation is prone to drifts and noises of the gyroscope. Regarding this problem, we propose a method to compensate for the vessel pitch angle using a single acceleration sensor. Using a constraint expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, our method classifies acceleration measurements into states of similar pitch angles. Subsequently, for each class, we project acceleration measurements into the reference coordinate system along the vessel heading direction, and obtain distance estimations by integrating the projected measurements. Results in both simulated and actual sea environments demonstrate that, by using only acceleration measurements, our method achieves accurate results.

The approach is based on text mining the source code of the components. Namely, each component is characterized as a series of terms contained in its source code, with the associated frequencies. These features are used to forecast whether each component is likely to contain vulnerabilities. In an exploratory validation with 20 Android applications, we discovered that a dependable prediction model can be built. Such model could be useful to prioritize the validation activities, e. g., to identify the components needing special scrutiny.

A quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) machine-learning based method is applied to predict the thermodynamic stability constants of these complexes (log K-GdL), a property commonly associated with the toxicity of such organometallic pharmaceuticals. In this approach, the log K-GdL value of each complex is predicted by a graph machine, a combination of parametrized functions that encodes the 2D structure of the ligand. The efficiency of the predictive model is estimated on an independent test set; in addition, the method is shown to be effective (i) for estimating the stability constants of uncharacterized, newly synthesized polyamino-polycarboxylic compounds and (ii) for providing independent log K-GdL estimations for complexants for which conflicting or questionable experimental data were reported. The exhaustive database of log K-GdL values for 158 complexants, reported for potential application as contrast agents for MRI and used in the present study, is available in the Supporting Information (122 primary literature sources).

J	Sugaya, N				Sugaya, Nobuyoshi			Ligand Efficiency-Based Support Vector Regression Models for Predicting Bioactivities of Ligands to Drug Target Proteins	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH; CHEMOGENOMICS APPROACH; COUPLED-RECEPTORS; DISCOVERY; FINGERPRINT; VALIDATION; SEQUENCES; IMPROVES; DATABASE; INDEXES	The concept of ligand efficiency (LE) indices is widely accepted throughout the drug design community and is frequently used in a retrospective manner in the process of drug development. For example, LE indices are used to investigate LE optimization processes of already-approved drugs and to re-evaluate hit compounds obtained from structure-based virtual screening methods and/or high-throughput experimental assays. However, LE indices could also be applied in a prospective manner to explore drug candidates. Here, we describe the construction of machine learning-based regression models in which LE indices are adopted as an end point and show that LE-based regression models can outperform regression models based on pIC50 values. In addition to pIC50 values traditionally used in machine learning studies based on chemogenomics data, three representative LE indices (ligand lipophilicity efficiency (LLE), binding efficiency index (BEI), and surface efficiency index (SEI)) were adopted, then used to create four types of training data. We constructed regression models by applying a support vector regression (SVR) method to the training data. In cross-validation tests of the SVR models, the LE-based SVR models showed higher correlations between the observed and predicted values than the pIC50-based models. Application tests to new data displayed that, generally, the predictive performance of SVR models follows the order SEI > BEI > LLE > pIC50. Close examination of the distributions of the activity values (pIC50, LLE, BEI, and SEI) in the training and validation data implied that the performance order of the SVR models may be ascribed to the much higher diversity of the LE-based training and validation data. In the application tests, the LE-based SVR models can offer better predictive performance of compound-protein pairs with a wider range of ligand potencies than the pIC50-based models. This finding strongly suggests that LE-based SVR models are better than pIC50-based models at predicting bioactivities of compounds that could exhibit a much higher (or lower) potency.

J	Gabel, J; Desaphy, J; Rognan, D				Gabel, Joffrey; Desaphy, Jeremy; Rognan, Didier			Beware of Machine Learning-Based Scoring Functions-On the Danger of Developing Black Boxes	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							PROTEIN-LIGAND COMPLEXES; CSAR BENCHMARK EXERCISE; MOLECULAR DOCKING; TEST SET; AFFINITY PREDICTION; BINDING-AFFINITY; PDBBIND DATABASE; INHIBITORS; SELECTION; PROGRAMS	Training machine learning algorithms with protein-ligand descriptors has recently gained considerable attention to predict binding constants from atomic coordinates. Starting from a series of recent reports stating the advantages of this approach over empirical scoring functions, we could indeed reproduce the claimed superiority of Random Forest and Support Vector Machine-based scoring functions to predict experimental binding constants from protein-ligand X-ray structures of the PDBBind dataset. Strikingly, these scoring functions, trained on simple protein-ligand element-element distance counts, were almost unable to enrich virtual screening hit lists in true actives upon docking experiments of 10 reference DUD-E datasets; this is a a feature that, however, has been verified for an a priori less-accurate empirical scoring function (Surflex-Dock). By systematically varying ligand poses from true X-ray coordinates, we show that the Surflex-Dock scoring function is logically sensitive to the quality of docking poses. Conversely, our machine-learning based scoring functions are totally insensitive to docking poses (up to 10 angstrom root-mean square deviations) and just describe atomic element counts. This report does not disqualify using machine learning algorithms to design scoring functions. Protein-ligand element-element distance counts should however be used with extreme caution and only applied in a meaningful way. To avoid developing novel but meaningless scoring functions, we propose that two additional benchmarking tests must be systematically done when developing novel scoring functions: (i) sensitivity to docking pose accuracy, and (ii) ability to enrich hit lists in true actives upon structure-based (docking, receptor-ligand pharmacophore) virtual screening of reference datasets.

We have collected the evaluations of an experienced medicinal chemist on the likely chemistry quality of these probes based on a number of criteria including literature related to the probe and potential chemical reactivity. Over 20% of these probes were found to be undesirable. Analysis of the molecular properties of these compounds scored as desirable suggested higher pK(a), molecular weight, heavy atom count, and rotatable bond number. We were particularly interested whether the human evaluation aspect of medicinal chemistry due diligence could be computationally predicted. We used a process of sequential Bayesian model building and iterative testing as we included additional probes. Following external validation of these methods and comparing different machine learning methods, we identified Bayesian models with accuracy comparable to other measures of drug-likeness and filtering rules created to date.

The EKIFCM can obtain the advantages of intuitionistic fuzzy sets, kernel functions, and GA in actual clustering problems. Experiments on 2-D synthetic datasets and machine learning repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/beta/) datasets show that the proposed EKIFCM is more efficient than conventional algorithms such as the k-means (KM), FCM, Gustafson-Kessel (GK) clustering algorithm, Gath-Geva (GG) clustering algorithm, Chaira's intuitionistic fuzzy c-means (IFCM), and kernel-based fuzzy c-means with Gaussian kernel functions [KFCM(G)] in standard measurement indexes.

In this article, the dataset consists of 3426 subjects (1083 pathological and 2343 healthy cases) whose diagnosis was based on laboratory and osteal bone densitometry examination. In all cases, four diagnostic factors for osteoporosis risk prediction, namely age, sex, height and weight were stored for later evaluation with the selected classifiers. In order to categorize subjects into two classes (osteoporosis, non-osteoporosis), twenty machine learning techniques were assessed, based on their popularity and frequency in biomedical engineering problems. All classifiers have been evaluated using the well-known 10-fold cross validation method and the results are reported analytically. In addition, a feature selection method identified that with the use of only two diagnostic factors (age and weight), similar performance could be achieved. The scope of the proposed exhaustive methodology is to assist therapists in osteoporosis prediction, avoiding unnecessary further testing with bone densitometry.

VARIABLE SELECTION FOR GENERAL INDEX MODELS VIA SLICED INVERSE REGRESSION	ANNALS OF STATISTICS			English	Article						Interactions; inverse models; sliced inverse regression; sure independence screening; variable selection	SUFFICIENT DIMENSION REDUCTION; EMBRYONIC STEM-CELLS; ORACLE PROPERTIES; EXPRESSION; LASSO; LIKELIHOOD; DISCOVERY; CANCER	Variable selection, also known as feature selection in machine learning, plays an important role in modeling high dimensional data and is key to data-driven scientific discoveries. We consider here the problem of detecting influential variables under the general index model, in which the response is dependent of predictors through an unknown function of one or more linear combinations of them. Instead of building a predictive model of the response given combinations of predictors, we model the conditional distribution of predictors given the response. This inverse modeling perspective motivates us to propose a stepwise procedure based on likelihood-ratio tests, which is effective and computationally efficient in identifying important variables without specifying a parametric relationship between predictors and the response. For example, the proposed procedure is able to detect variables with pairwise, three-way or even higher-order interactions among p predictors with a computational time of O(p) instead of O(p(k)) (with k being the highest order of interactions). Its excellent empirical performance in comparison with existing methods is demonstrated through simulation studies as well as real data examples. Consistency of the variable selection procedure when both the number of predictors and the sample size go to infinity is established.

The use of data mining to assist crop protection decisions on kiwifruit in New Zealand	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Machine learning; Data mining; Pest management; Decision support	MACHINE; DAMAGE; SPAIN	Data mining algorithms were used to develop models to forecast the outcome of leafroller pest monitoring decisions on 'Hayward' kiwifruit crops in New Zealand. Using industry spray diary and pest monitoring data gathered at an orchard block level for compliance purposes, 80 attributes (independent variables) were created in three categories from the spray diary data: (1) individual insecticide applications applied during 2-week time windows, (2) groups of insecticide applications within time periods prior to or after fruit set and (3) orchard management attributes. Five machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Support Vector Machine) and one statistical method (Logistic regression) (classifiers) were used to develop models to forecast insecticide application decisions for leafroller control, by predicting whether pest monitoring results were above or below a spray threshold. Models to forecast 2011 spraying decisions were trained on 2008 and 2009 data and tested on 2010 data. Forecasts were made for spray and no-spray decisions based upon pre-determined acceptable rates of precision (proportion of correct decisions in test results). Orchard blocks in which a forecast could not be made to a prescribed degree of precision were recommended to be monitored, which is the normal practice. Spray decisions could not be forecast to an acceptable degree of precision, but decisions not to spray were successfully forecast for 49% of the blocks to a precision of 98% (AdaBoost) and 70% of the blocks to a precision of 95% (Naive Bayes). Models with as few as four attributes gave useful forecasts, and orchard management attributes were the most important determinants of model forecasting accuracy. The potential for this methodology to assist with pest spray forecasting using customised data sets is discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Hill, M.

Representation learning has been a fundamental problem in machine learning, and widely recognized as critical to the performance of end tasks. In this paper, we provide evidence that specially learned features will addresses the diverse, heterogeneous, and collective characteristics of social media data. Therefore, we propose to transfer the focus from the model development to latent feature learning, and present a unified framework of latent feature learning on social media. To address the noisy, diverse, heterogeneous, and interconnected characteristics of social media data, the popular deep learning is employed due to its excellent abstract abilities. In particular, we instantiate the proposed framework by (1) designing a novel relational generative deep learning model to solve the social media link analysis task, and (2) developing a multimodal deep learning to lambda rank model towards the social image retrieval task.

The distillation of knowledge from the huge amount of unstructured information on the Web can be a key factor for tasks such as social media marketing, branding, product positioning, and corporate reputation management. These online social data, however, remain hardly accessible to computers, as they are specifically meant for human consumption. The automatic analysis of online opinions involves a deep understanding of natural language text by machines, from which we are still very far. To this end, concept-level sentiment analysis aims to go beyond a mere word-level analysis of text and provide novel approaches to opinion mining and sentiment analysis that enable a more efficient passage from (unstructured) textual information to (structured) machine-processable data. A recent knowledge-based technology in this context is sentic computing, which relies on the ensemble application of common-sense computing and the psychology of emotions to infer the conceptual and affective information associated with natural language. Sentic computing, however, is limited by the richness of the knowledge base and by the fact that the bag-of-concepts model, despite more sophisticated than bag-of-words, misses out important discourse structure information that is key for properly detecting the polarity conveyed by natural language opinions. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm to concept-level sentiment analysis that merges linguistics, common-sense computing, and machine learning for improving the accuracy of tasks such as polarity detection. By allowing sentiments to flow from concept to concept based on the dependency relation of the input sentence, in particular, we achieve a better understanding of the contextual role of each concept within the sentence and, hence, obtain a polarity detection engine that outperforms state-of-the-art statistical methods.

Pure machine learning usually fails to recognize and interpret emotions in text accurately. The need for knowledge bases that give access to semantics and sentics (the conceptual and affective information) associated with natural language is growing exponentially in the context of big social data analysis. To this end, this paper proposes EmoSenticSpace, a new framework for affective common-sense reasoning that extends WordNet-Affect and SenticNet by providing both emotion labels and polarity scores for a large set of natural language concepts. The framework is built by means of fuzzy c-means clustering and support-vector-machine classification, and takes into account a number of similarity measures, including point-wise mutual information and emotional affinity. EmoSentic5pace was tested on three emotion-related natural language processing tasks, namely sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, and personality detection. In all cases, the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art. In particular, the direct evaluation of EmoSenticSpace against psychological features provided in the benchmark ISEAR dataset shows a 92.15% agreement. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We hypothesize that this expression does not adequately describe the natural history of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis during childhood. We propose that this paradigm arose from cross-sectional analyses of longitudinal studies, and may reflect a population pattern that may not predominate at the individual level. Methods and Findings: Data from 9,801 children in two population-based birth cohorts were used to determine individual profiles of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis and whether the manifestations of these symptoms followed an atopic march pattern. Children were assessed at ages 1, 3, 5, 8, and 11 y. We used Bayesian machine learning methods to identify distinct latent classes based on individual profiles of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis. This approach allowed us to identify groups of children with similar patterns of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis over time. Using a latent disease profile model, the data were best described by eight latent classes: no disease (51.3%), atopic march (3.1%), persistent eczema and wheeze (2.7%), persistent eczema with later-onset rhinitis (4.7%), persistent wheeze with later-onset rhinitis (5.7%), transient wheeze (7.7%), eczema only (15.3%), and rhinitis only (9.6%). When latent variable modelling was carried out separately for the two cohorts, similar results were obtained. Highly concordant patterns of sensitisation were associated with different profiles of eczema, rhinitis, and wheeze. The main limitation of this study was the difference in wording of the questions used to ascertain the presence of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis in the two cohorts. Conclusions: The developmental profiles of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis are heterogeneous; only a small proportion of children (similar to 7% of those with symptoms) follow trajectory profiles resembling the atopic march.

Citizen science initiatives such as Galaxy Zoo showed that large data sets of galaxy images can be analyzed effectively by nonscientist volunteers, but since databases generated by robotic telescopes grow much faster than the processing power of any group of citizen scientists, it is clear that computer analysis is required. Here, we propose to use citizen science data for training machine learning systems, and show experimental results demonstrating that machine learning systems can be trained with citizen science data. Our findings show that the performance of machine learning depends on the quality of the data, which can be improved by using samples that have a high degree of agreement between the citizen scientists.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of ground penetrating radar (GPR) in demining and unexploded ordnance detection using 2.3-GHz and 1-GHz high-frequency antennas. An automated detection tool based on machine learning techniques is also presented with the aim of automatically detecting underground explosive artifacts. A GPR survey was conducted on a designed scenario that included the most commonly buried items in historic battle fields, such as mines, projectiles and mortar grenades. The buried targets were identified using both frequencies, although the higher vertical resolution provided by the 2.3-GHz antenna allowed for better recognition of the reflection patterns. The targets were also detected automatically using machine learning techniques. Neural networks and logistic regression algorithms were shown to be able to discriminate between potential targets and clutter. The neural network had the most success, with accuracies ranging from 89% to 92% for the 1-GHz and 2.3-GHz antennas, respectively.

However, GNSS provides only single-point measurements that are defined with the antenna placed typically behind the skier's neck. A key issue is how to estimate other more relevant parameters of the skier's body, like the center of mass (COM) and ski trajectories. Previously, these parameters were estimated by modeling the skier's body with an inverted-pendulum model that oversimplified the skier's body. In this study, we propose two machine learning methods that overcome this shortcoming and estimate COM and skis trajectories based on a more faithful approximation of the skier's body with nine degrees-of-freedom. The first method utilizes a well-established approach of artificial neural networks, while the second method is based on a state-of-the-art statistical generalization method. Both methods were evaluated using the reference measurements obtained on a typical giant slalom course and compared with the inverted-pendulum method. Our results outperform the results of commonly used inverted-pendulum methods and demonstrate the applicability of machine learning techniques in biomechanical measurements of alpine skiing.

Over 1.6 million U. S. adults are treated for fall-related injuries in emergency rooms every year suffering fractures, loss of independence, and even death. It is clear then, that this problem must be addressed in a prompt manner, and the use of pervasive computing plays a key role to achieve this. Fall detection (FD) and fall prevention (FP) are research areas that have been active for over a decade, and they both strive for improving people's lives through the use of pervasive computing. This paper surveys the state of the art in FD and FP systems, including qualitative comparisons among various studies. It aims to serve as a point of reference for future research on the mentioned systems. A general description of FD and FP systems is provided, including the different types of sensors used in both approaches. Challenges and current solutions are presented and described in great detail. A 3-level taxonomy associated with the risk factors of a fall is proposed. Finally, cutting edge FD and FP systems are thoroughly reviewed and qualitatively compared, in terms of design issues and other parameters.

A global predictive model of carbon in mangrove soils	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						mangroves; blue carbon; REDD; soil carbon; ecosystem services; predictive modeling	ORGANIC-CARBON; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS; BLUE CARBON; EMISSIONS; FORESTS; SEDIMENTS; PATTERNS; BIOMASS	Mangroves are among the most threatened and rapidly vanishing natural environments worldwide. They provide a wide range of ecosystem services and have recently become known for their exceptional capacity to store carbon. Research shows that mangrove conservation may be a low-cost means of reducing CO2 emissions. Accordingly, there is growing interest in developing market mechanisms to credit mangrove conservation projects for associated CO2 emissions reductions. These efforts depend on robust and readily applicable, but currently unavailable, localized estimates of soil carbon. Here, we use over 900 soil carbon measurements, collected in 28 countries by 61 independent studies, to develop a global predictive model for mangrove soil carbon. Using climatological and locational data as predictors, we explore several predictive modeling alternatives, including machine-learning methods. With our predictive model, we construct a global dataset of estimated soil carbon concentrations and stocks on a high-resolution grid (5 arc min). We estimate that the global mangrove soil carbon stock is 5.00 +/- 0.94 Pg C (assuming a 1 meter soil depth) and find this stock is highly variable over space. The amount of carbon per hectare in the world's most carbon-rich mangroves (approximately 703 +/- 38 Mg C ha(-1)) is roughly a 2.6 +/- 0.14 times the amount of carbon per hectare in the world's most carbon-poor mangroves (approximately 272 +/- 49Mg C ha(-1)). Considerable within country variation in mangrove soil carbon also exists. In Indonesia, the country with the largest mangrove soil carbon stock, we estimate that the most carbon-rich mangroves contain 1.5 +/- 0.12 times as much carbon per hectare as the most carbon-poor mangroves. Our results can aid in evaluating benefits from mangrove conservation and designing mangrove conservation policy. Additionally, the results can be used to project changes in mangrove soil carbon stocks based on changing climatological predictors, e.g. to assess the impacts of climate change on mangrove soil carbon stocks.

With an increasing number of anonymous crime reports being filed and digitized, it is generally difficult for crime analysts to process and analyze crime reports efficiently. Complicating the problem is that the information has not been filtered or guided in a detective-led interview resulting in much irrelevant information. We are developing a decision support system (DSS), combining natural language processing (NLP) techniques, similarity measures, and machine learning, i.e., a Naive Bayes' classifier, to support crime analysis and classify which crime reports discuss the same and different crime. We report on an algorithm essential to the DSS and its evaluations. Two studies with small and big datasets were conducted to compare the system with a human expert's performance. The first study includes 10 sets of crime reports discussing 2 to 5 crimes. The highest algorithm accuracy was found by using binary logistic regression (89%) while Naive Bayes' classifier was only slightly lower (87%). The expert achieved still better performance (96%) when given sufficient time. The second study includes two datasets with 40 and 60 crime reports discussing 16 different types of crimes for each dataset The results show that our system achieved the highest classification accuracy (94.82%), while the crime analyst's classification accuracy (93.74%) is slightly lower.

Feature selection based on empirical-risk function to detect lesions in vascular computed tomography	IRBM			English	Article							AUTOMATIC DETECTION; SEGMENTATION; CLASSIFICATION; ANGIOGRAPHY; FRAMEWORK	Objective. - The overall goal of the study is to detect coronary artery lesions regardless their nature, calcified or hypo-dense. To avoid explicit modelling of heterogeneous lesions, we adopted an approach based on machine learning and using unsupervised or semi-supervised classifiers. The success of the classifiers based on machine learning strongly depends on the appropriate choice of features differentiating between lesions and regular appearance. The specific goal of this article is to propose a novel strategy devised to select the best feature set for the classifiers used, out of a given set of candidate features. Materials and methods. - The features are calculated in image planes orthogonal to the artery centerline, and the classifier assigns to each of these cross-sections a label "healthy" or "diseased". The contribution of this article is a feature-selection strategy based on the empirical risk function that is used as a criterion in the initial feature ranking and in the selection process itself. We have assessed this strategy in association with two classifiers based on the density-level detection approach that seeks outliers from the distribution corresponding to the regular appearance. The method was evaluated using a total of 13,687 cross-sections extracted from 53 coronary arteries in 15 patients. Results. - Using the feature subset selected by the risk-based strategy, balanced error rates achieved by the unsupervised and semi-supervised classifiers respectively were equal to 13.5% and 15.4%. These results were substantially better than the rates achieved using feature subsets selected by supervised strategies. The unsupervised and semi-supervised methods also outperformed supervised classifiers using feature subsets selected by the corresponding supervised strategies. Discussion. - Supervised methods require large data sets annotated by experts, both to select the features and to train the classifiers, and collecting these annotations is time-consuming. With these methods, lesions whose appearance differs from the training data may remain undetected. Lesion-detection problem is highly imbalanced, since healthy cross-sections usually are much more numerous than the diseased ones. Training the classifiers based on the density-level detection approach needs a small number of annotations or no annotations at all. The same annotations are sufficient to compute the empirical risk and to perform the selection. Therefore, our strategy associated with an unsupervised or semi-supervised classifier requires a considerably smaller number of annotations as compared to conventional supervised selection strategies. The approach proposed is also better suited for highly imbalanced problems and can detect lesions differing from the training set. Conclusion. - The risk-based selection strategy, associated with classifiers using the density-level detection approach, outperformed other strategies and classifiers when used to detect coronary artery lesions. It is well suited for highly imbalanced problems, where the lesions are represented as low-density regions of the feature space, and it can be used in other anomaly detection problems interpretable as a binary classification problem where the empirical risk can be calculated.

Bayesian Entropy Estimation for Countable Discrete Distributions	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						entropy; information theory; Bayesian estimation; Bayesian nonparametrics; Dirichlet process; Pitman-Yor process; neural coding	PROBABILITY-DISTRIBUTIONS; MUTUAL INFORMATION; DIRICHLET PROCESS; INFERENCE; SIZE; SAMPLES	We consider the problem of estimating Shannon's entropy H from discrete data, in cases where the number of possible symbols is unknown or even countably infinite. The Pitman-Yor process, a generalization of Dirichlet process, provides a tractable prior distribution over the space of countably infinite discrete distributions, and has found major applications in Bayesian non-parametric statistics and machine learning. Here we show that it provides a natural family of priors for Bayesian entropy estimation, due to the fact that moments of the induced posterior distribution over H can be computed analytically. We derive formulas for the posterior mean (Bayes' least squares estimate) and variance under Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor process priors. Moreover, we show that a fixed Dirichlet or Pitman-Yor process prior implies a narrow prior distribution over H, meaning the prior strongly determines the entropy estimate in the under-sampled regime. We derive a family of continuous measures for mixing Pitman-Yor processes to produce an approximately flat prior over H. We show that the resulting "Pitman-Yor Mixture" (PYM) entropy estimator is consistent for a large class of distributions. Finally, we explore the theoretical properties of the resulting estimator, and show that it performs well both in simulation and in application to real data.

We show that the recursive teaching dimension, recently introduced by Zilles et al. (2008), is strongly connected to known complexity notions in machine learning, e.g., the self-directed learning complexity and the VC-dimension. To the best of our knowledge these are the first results unveiling such relations between teaching and query learning as well as between teaching and the VC-dimension. It will turn out that for many natural classes the RTD is upper-bounded by the VCD, e.g., classes of VCdimension 1, intersection-closed classes and finite maximum classes. However, we will also show that there are certain (but rare) classes for which the recursive teaching dimension exceeds the VC-dimension. Moreover, for maximum classes, the combinatorial structure induced by the RTD, called teaching plan, is highly similar to the structure of sample compression schemes. Indeed one can transform any repetition-free teaching plan for a maximum class C into an unlabeled sample compression scheme for C and vice versa, while the latter is produced by (i) the corner-peeling algorithm of Rubinstein and Rubinstein (2012) and (ii) the tail matching algorithm of Kuzmin and Warmuth (2007).

The construction of protocells, which explores scenarios of the origin of life, has been the original motivations for such projects. With the advent of the synthetic biology era, bottom-up engineering approaches to synthetic cells are now conceivable. The modular design emerges as the most robust framework to construct a minimal cell from natural molecular components. Although significant advances have been made for each piece making this complex puzzle, the integration of the three fundamental parts, information-metabolism-self-organization, into cell-sized liposomes capable of sustained reproduction has failed so far. Our inability to connect these three elements is also a major limitation in this research area. New methods, such as machine learning coupled to high-throughput techniques, should be exploited to accelerate the cell-free synthesis of complex biochemical systems.

Distinguishing meanders of the Kuroshio using machine learning	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						Kuroshio; western boundary current; bimodality; machine learning	DATA ASSIMILATION; PATH SOUTH; JAPAN; OCEAN; BIMODALITY; EXTENSION; REPRESENTATION; CIRCULATION; SIMULATION; REDUCTION	The Kuroshio south of Japan is often described as being bimodal, with abrupt transitions between a straight path state that stays near the coast (small meander) and a meandering state that deviates from the coast (large meander). Despite evidence of the existence of two or more states of the Kuroshio, previous data-driven studies have shown only high variability of the current; they have not, however, demonstrated bimodality in the sense of two states of relatively high probability separated by a region of relatively low probability. We use singular value decomposition (SVD), a standard time series analysis method for characterizing variability, and diffusion maps and spectral clustering (DMSC), a machine learning algorithm that seeks multimodality, to investigate Kuroshio reanalysis output. By applying these methods to a time series of velocity fields, we find that (1) the Kuroshio is bimodal, with high inflow and low path variability in the small meander and low inflow and high path variability in the large meander, (2) the state of the system correlates highly with the location of the recirculation gyre south of Japan, and (3) the meanders are better characterized by path variability than by mean path. Because these results are consistent with satellite sea surface height data, they are not an artifact of the model used for reanalysis. Further, our results provide evidence for a previously proposed transition mechanism based on the strengthening, migration, and weakening of the recirculation gyre south of Japan and can therefore help direct future modeling studies.

Classification of Listeria monocytogenes Persistence in Retail Delicatessen Environments Using Expert Elicitation and Machine Learning	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						Bacterial persistence; expert elicitation; Listeria monocytogenes	UNITED-STATES; PROCESSING PLANTS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; CONTAMINATION; MEAT; STRAINS; PATHOGENS; OUTBREAK; ILLNESS; HEALTH	Increasing evidence suggests that persistence of Listeria monocytogenes in food processing plants has been the underlying cause of a number of human listeriosis outbreaks. This study extracts criteria used by food safety experts in determining bacterial persistence in the environment, using retail delicatessen operations as a model. Using the Delphi method, we conducted an expert elicitation with 10 food safety experts from academia, industry, and government to classify L. monocytogenes persistence based on environmental sampling results collected over six months for 30 retail delicatessen stores. The results were modeled using variations of random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression, and linear regression; variable importance values of random forest and support vector machine models were consolidated to rank important variables in the experts' classifications. The duration of subtype isolation ranked most important across all expert categories. Sampling site category also ranked high in importance and validation errors doubled when this covariate was removed. Support vector machine and random forest models successfully classified the data with average validation errors of 3.1% and 2.2% (n = 144), respectively. Our findings indicate that (i) the frequency of isolations over time and sampling site information are critical factors for experts determining subtype persistence, (ii) food safety experts from different sectors may not use the same criteria in determining persistence, and (iii) machine learning models have potential for future use in environmental surveillance and risk management programs. Future work is necessary to validate the accuracy of expert and machine classification against biological measurement of L. monocytogenes persistence.	[Vangay, P.; Wiedmann, M.; Stasiewicz, M.

Reliability and Data Density in High Capacity Color Barcodes	COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						color; classification; barcode		2D color barcodes have been introduced to obtain larger storage capabilities than traditional black and white barcodes. Unfortunately, the data density of color barcodes is substantially limited by the redundancy needed for correcting errors, which are due not only to geometric but also to chromatic distortions introduced by the printing and scanning process. The higher the expected error rate, the more redundancy is needed for avoiding failures in barcode reading, and thus, the lower the actual data density. Our work addresses this trade-off between reliability and data density in 2D color barcodes and aims at identifying the most effective algorithms, in terms of byte error rate and computational overhead, for decoding 2D color barcodes. In particular, we perform a thorough experimental study to identify the most suitable color classifiers for converting analog barcode cells to digital bit streams. To accomplish this task, we implemented a prototype capable of decoding 2D color barcodes by using different methods, including clustering algorithms and machine learning classifiers. We show that, even if state-of-art methods for color classification could be successfully used for decoding color barcodes in the desktop scenario, there is an emerging need for new color classification methods in the mobile scenario. In desktop scenarios, our experimental findings show that complex techniques, such as support vector machines, does not seem to pay off, as they do not achieve better accuracy in classifying color barcode cells. The lowest error rates are indeed obtained by means of clustering algorithms and probabilistic classifiers. From the computational viewpoint, classification with clustering seems to be the method of choice. In mobile scenarios, simple and efficient methods (in terms of computational time) such as the Euclidean and the K-means classifiers are not effective (in terms of error rate), while, more complex methods are effective but not efficient. Even if a few color barcode designs have been proposed in recent studies, to the best of our knowledge, there is no previous research that addresses a comparative and experimental analysis of clustering and machine learning methods for color classification in 2D color barcodes.

State-of-the-art packet-based traffic classification methods are either based on costly inspection of the payload of several packets in each flow or on basic flow statistics without taking into account the packet content. In this paper, we consider an intermediate approach of analyzing only the first few bytes of the first (or first few) packet(s) of each flow and propose automatic, machine-learning-based methods with very low computational complexity and memory footprint. The performance of these techniques are thoroughly analyzed, showing that outstanding early classification accuracy can be achieved on traffic traces generated by a diverse set of applications (including P2P TV and file sharing) in a laboratory environment as well as on a real-world data set collected in the network of a large European ISP.

In pixel-based OPC (PBOPC), the layout is divided into small pixels, which are then iteratively modified until the simulated print image on the wafer matches the desired pattern. However, the increasing complexity and size of modern integrated circuits make PBOPC techniques quite computationally intensive. This paper focuses on developing a practical and efficient PBOPC algorithm based on a nonparametric kernel regression, a well-known technique in machine learning. Specifically, we estimate the OPC patterns based on the geometric characteristics of the original layout corresponding to the same region and a series of training examples. Experimental results on metal layers show that our proposed approach significantly improves the speed of a current professional PBOPC software by a factor of 2 to 3, and may further reduce the mask complexity.

J	Li, YP; Li, X; Wang, HQ				Li, Yanpeng; Li, Xiang; Wang, Hongquang			Target Tracking in a Collaborative Sensor Network	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS			English	Article							MULTITARGET TRACKING; KALMAN FILTER; IMM	In a collaborative sensor network (CSN), the conventional target tracking algorithms employed are Kalman filtering (KF) or extended Kalman filtering (EKF). However, these techniques have a presumed probability distribution of the system noise and prediction noise. They also need some a priori information that may be unavailable in some circumstances. Therefore, the system is not flexible for a complicated scenario. With the help of a machine learning technique called expert prediction (EP), a novel target tracking approach for CSNs is developed. This scheme makes use of the aforementioned EP in parameter estimation course for the target of interest, instead of exploiting the filtering method as typically found in available literature. This idea is further unfolded with comparisons regarding the CSN using Kalman filters, extended Kalman filters, and decentralized sigma-point information filters (DSPIFs). The new tracking algorithm is investigated with both linear and nonlinear prediction methods. Simulation results demonstrate that this proposed measure will deliver forecasting output with more precision because of the built-in multimodel mode among different experts, the learning ability, and the self-perfection characteristic. Not only does this performance occur in a more robust way than those of the existing approaches - particularly in the presence of heavy clutter, highly maneuvering targets, and/or multiple targets but it simultaneously requires the least a priori information and imposes the least limitation on the observation model.

These signals contain hidden, but vital information, which enable clinicians to pre-diagnose a disease before any symptoms can be observed. This hidden information is better recognized in the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) domain than in time and frequency domains. The reason for this superiority comes from the fact that the DVVT domain provides an accurate time and frequency representation of a signal and this enables both detection and extraction of concealed information. For this project, two different classes of ECG signals were studied: Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB) and normal heart rhythm. We devised a sophisticated processing structure to extract relevant information from these signals. The first processing step was DWI based noise reduction followed by dimension reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The PCA output was fed to a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which was used to classify the signals into either normal or diseased. The 10-fold cross validated classification results show 99.93% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and 99.96% accuracy. The strong classification results indicate that computerized processing of ECG signals can reveal relevant information for disease diagnosis.

In this paper, we present algorithms for glaucoma diagnosis from fundus images by incorporating doctors' knowledge into algorithm development. We extract features of the fundus images from optic disc and optic cup boundary lines that were drawn by doctors, and from these features, predictions are made. To the optic disc and optic cup boundary lines, we meticulously divide the area based on doctors' knowledge and then conduct principal component analysis to extract the features. The extracted features correspond well with doctors' knowledge so that the diagnostic results can be intuitively explained, rather than just generate a black-box forecast. On a real sample set, the proposed feature extraction and diagnosis algorithms achieve good mean prediction accuracy.

However, determining correct genotype-phenotype interrelationships among many syndromes is tedious and labor-intensive, especially for extremely rare syndromes. Thus, a computer-aided system for pre-diagnosis can facilitate effective and efficient decision support, particularly when few similar cases are available, or in remote rural districts where diagnostic knowledge of syndromes is not readily available. Methods: The proposed methodology, visual diagnostic decision support system (visual diagnostic DSS), employs machine learning (ML) algorithms and digital image processing techniques in a hybrid approach for automated diagnosis in medical genetics. This approach uses facial features in reference images of disorders to identify visual genotype-phenotype interrelationships. Our statistical method describes facial image data as principal component features and diagnoses syndromes using these features. Results: The proposed system was trained using a real dataset of previously published face images of subjects with syndrcimes, which provided accurate diagnostic information. The method was tested using a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme with 15 different syndromes, each of comprised 5-9 cases, i.e., 92 cases in total. An accuracy rate of 83% was achieved using this automated diagnosis technique, which was statistically significant (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity values were 0.857 and 0.870, respectively. Conclusion: Our results show that the accurate classification of syndromes is feasible using ML techniques. Thus, a large number of syndromes with characteristic facial anomaly patterns could be diagnosed with similar diagnostic DSSs to that described in the present study, i.e., visual diagnostic DSS, thereby demonstrating the benefits of using hybrid image processing and ML-based computer-aided diagnostics for identifying facial phenotypes.

Tactile imaging measures the elastic modulus of a tumor, whereas hyperspectral imaging detects important biochemical markers. Spontaneous mammary tumors in canines were used to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The tactile sensor achieved a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 100% in identifying malignant tumors. The sensitivity and specificity of the hyperspectral sensor were 71% and 76%, respectively. We investigated several machine learning techniques for fusing the tactile and spectral data, which increased the sensitivity and specificity to 86% and 97%, respectively. Our tactile and hyperspectral imaging sensors are noninvasive and harmless (no ionized radiation is used). These imaging sensors may not only eliminate unnecessary surgeries, but will also motivate the development of similar sensors for human clinical use, due to the fact that canine and human tumors have similar physiology and biology.

This enables implementation of high-level functionalities such as service recommendation, composition, and provisioning. The current service search and discovery on the Web is mainly supported by text and keyword-based solutions which offer very limited semantic expressiveness to service developers and consumers. This paper presents a method using probabilistic machine-learning techniques to extract latent factors from semantically enriched service descriptions. The latent factors are used to construct a model to represent different types of service descriptions in a vector form. With this transformation, heterogeneous service descriptions can be represented, discovered, and compared on the same homogeneous plane. The proposed solution is scalable to large service datasets and provides an efficient mechanism that enables publishing and adding new services to the registry and representing them using latent factors after deployment of the system. We have evaluated our solution against logic-based and keyword-based service search and discovery solutions. The results show that the proposed method performs better than other solutions in terms of precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain values.

We propose a machine learning framework to determine the deciding features for a given discriminative problem. This approach is demonstrated by analyzing publicly available RR-interval recordings including a group of patients with severe congestive heart failure. As a result, very-low and low spectral power bands and specific ordinal patterns are identified as the best discriminating heart rate variability (HRV) features. HRV is generally reduced in comparison to the healthy condition; also the autonomic regulation of heart rate acceleration and deceleration appears to be pathlogically inversed.

The quantification of cell maturity at microscopic level is a tedious and error-prone task and heavily relies on the experience of the pathologists. The inter-observer variability in cellularity estimation may be reduced by employing supervised machine learning methods on digital histopathological images. The main goal of this paper is to examine echo state networks (ESN) for quantitative cell recognition. We show that a properly designed and trained ESN is able to discriminate early and late granulopoietic cells in histopathological images of the human bone marrow with overall mean accuracy (+/- SD) of 0.846 (+/- 0.013). This work gives strong indication that ESNs are able to work even with raw image patches directly and do not necessarily require image pre-processing, or feature extraction prior to classification.

It is therefore natural to ask: How faithfully do protocol designers really need to understand the networks they design for? What are the important signals that endpoints should listen to? How can researchers gain confidence that systems that work well on well-characterized test networks during development will also perform adequately on real networks that are inevitably more complex, or future networks yet to be developed? Is there a tradeoff between the performance of a protocol and the breadth of its intended operating range of networks? What is the cost of playing fairly with cross-traffic that is governed by another protocol? We examine these questions quantitatively in the context of congestion control, by using an automated protocol-design tool to approximate the best possible congestion-control scheme given imperfect prior knowledge about the network. We found only weak evidence of a tradeoff between operating range in link speeds and performance, even when the operating range was extended to cover a thousand-fold range of link speeds. We found that it may be acceptable to simplify some characteristics of the network such as its topology when modeling for design purposes. Some other features, such as the degree of multiplexing and the aggressiveness of contending endpoints, are important to capture in a model.

The accurate prediction of defect-prone software modules can help direct test effort, reduce costs, and improve the quality of software. Machine learning classification algorithms is a popular approach for predicting software defect. Various types of classification algorithms have been applied for software defect prediction. However, no clear consensus on which algorithm perform best when individual studies are looked at separately. In this research, a comparison framework is proposed, which aims to benchmark the performance of a wide range of classification models within the field of software defect prediction. For the purpose of this study, 10 classifiers are selected and applied to build classification models and test their performance in 9 NASA MDP datasets. Area under curve (AUC) is employed as an accuracy indicator in our framework to evaluate the performance of classifiers. Friedman and Nemenyi post hoc tests are used to test for significance of AUG differences between classifiers. The results show that the logistic regression perform best in most NASA MDP datasets. Naive bayes, neural network, support vector machine and k* classifiers also perform well. Decision tree based classifiers tend to underperform, as well as linear discriminant analysis and k-nearest neighbor.

Machine learning classification algorithms have been applied for software defect prediction. Neural network has strong fault tolerance and strong ability of nonlinear dynamic processing of software defect data. However, practicability of neural network is affected due to the difficulty of selecting appropriate parameters of network architecture. Software fault prediction datasets are often highly imbalanced class distribution. Class imbalance will reduce classifier performance. A combination of genetic algorithm and bagging technique is proposed for improving the performance of the software defect prediction. Genetic algorithm is applied to deal with the parameter optimization of neural network. Bagging technique is employed to deal with the class imbalance problem. The proposed method is evaluated using the datasets from NASA metric data repository. Results have indicated that the proposed method makes an improvement in neural network prediction performance.

Feature Selection Using Parallel Genetic Algorithm for the Prediction of Geometric Mean Diameter of Soil Aggregates by Machine Learning Methods	ARID LAND RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						artificial neural networks (ANNs); geometric mean diameter (GMD); parallel genetic algorithms (PGAs); support vector machines (SVMs)	NEURAL-NETWORK; STABILITY	Aggregate stability is a useful soil physical dynamic index of soil resistivity to surface wind and water erosion in all ecosystems, especially, in arid and semi-arid regions. Two machine learning techniques including support vector machines (SVMs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to develop predictive models for the estimation of geometric mean diameter (GMD) of soil aggregates. An empirical multiple linear regression (MLR) model was also constructed as the benchmark to compare their performances. Furthermore, the influence of feature space dimension reduction using parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) on the prediction accuracy of all investigated techniques was evaluated. The ANN model achieved greater accuracy in GMD prediction as compared to the MLR and SVM models. The obtained ERROR% value in GMD prediction using the ANN model was 6.9%, while it was 15.7 and 10.6% for the MLR and SVM models, respectively. Feature selection using PGA improved the prediction accuracy of all investigated techniques. The coefficient of determination (R-2) values between the measured and the predicted GMD values using PGA-based MLR, SVM, and ANN models increased by 20.0, 12.2, and 8.8% in comparison with the proposed MLR, SVM, and ANN models. In conclusion, it appears that the PGA-based ANN model could be considered as an alternative to conventional regression models for the GMD prediction.	[Besalatpour, A.

Neural learning of vector fields for encoding stable dynamical systems	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Extreme learning machine; Neural network; Vector fields; Dynamical systems learning; Motion generation; Movement generation	APPROXIMATION; MODEL; NETWORKS; FLOW	The data-driven approximation of vector fields that encode dynamical systems is a persistently hard task in machine learning. If data is sparse and given in the form of velocities derived from few trajectories only, state-space regions exist, where no information on the vector field and its induced dynamics is available. Generalization towards such regions is meaningful only if strong biases are introduced, for instance assumptions on global stability properties of the to-be-learned dynamics. We address this issue in a novel learning scheme that represents vector fields by means of neural networks, where asymptotic stability of the induced dynamics is explicitly enforced through utilizing knowledge from Lyapunov's stability theory, in a predefined workspace. The learning of vector fields is constrained through point-wise conditions, derived from a suitable Lyapunov function candidate, which is first adjusted towards the training data. We point out the significance of optimized Lyapunov function candidates and analyze the approach in a scenario where trajectories are learned and generalized from human handwriting motions. In addition, we demonstrate that learning from robotic data obtained by kinesthetic teaching of the humanoid robot iCub leads to robust motion generation. (C) 2014 Elsevier BAT. All rights reserved.

A convex formulation for informed source separation in the single channel setting	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Source separation; Machine learning; Music signal processing; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Nonsmooth optimization	NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; MINIMIZATION	Blind audio source separation is well-suited for the application of unsupervised techniques such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). It has been shown that on simple examples, it retrieves sensible solutions even in the single-channel setting, which is highly ill-posed. However, it is now widely accepted that NMF alone cannot solve single-channel source separation, for real world audio signals. Several proposals have appeared recently for systems that allow the user to control the output of NMF, by specifying additional equality constraints on the coefficients of the sources in the time-frequency domain. In this article, we show that matrix factorization problems involving these constraints can be formulated as convex problems, using the nuclear norm as a low-rank inducing penalty. We propose to solve the resulting nonsmooth convex formulation using a simple subgradient algorithm. Numerical experiments confirm that the nuclear norm penalty allows the recovery of (approximately) low-rank solutions that satisfy the additional user-imposed constraints. Moreover, for a given computational budget, we show that this algorithm matches the performance or even outperforms state-of-the-art NMF methods in terms of the quality of the estimated sources.

Recently, several LVQ schemes have been extended towards a kernelized or dissimilarity based version which can be applied if data are represented by pairwise similarities or dissimilarities only. This opens the way towards its application in domains where data are typically not represented in vectorial form. Albeit kernel LVQ still represents models by typical prototypes, interpretability is usually lost this way: since no vector space model is available, prototypes are represented indirectly in terms of combinations of data. In this contribution, we extend a recent kernel LVQ scheme by sparse approximations to overcome this problem: instead of the full coefficient vectors, few exemplars which represent the prototypes can be directly inspected by practitioners in the same way as data in this case. For this purpose, we investigate different possibilities to approximate a prototype by a sparse counterpart during or after training relying on different heuristics or approximation algorithms, respectively, in particular sparsity constraints while training, geometric approaches, orthogonal matching pursuit, and core techniques for the minimum enclosing ball problem. We discuss the behavior of these methods in several benchmark problems as concerns quality, sparsity, and interpretability, and we propose different measures how to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the approaches.

A methodology for training set instance selection using mutual information in time series prediction	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Instance selection; Mutual information; Time-series prediction	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; LEARNING ALGORITHMS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; VARIABLE SELECTION; MODELS; ESTIMATORS	Training set instance selection is an important preprocessing step in many machine learning problems, including time series prediction, and has to be considered in practice in order to increase the quality of the predictions and possibly reduce training time. Recently, the usage of mutual information (MI) has been proposed in regression tasks, mostly for feature selection and for identifying the real data from data sets that contain noise and outliers. This paper proposes a new methodology for training set instance selection for long-term time series prediction. The proposed methodology combines a recursive prediction strategy and advanced instance selection criterion the nearest neighbor based MI estimator. An application of the concept of MI is presented for the selection of training instances based on MI computation between initial training set instances and the current forecasting instance, for every prediction step. The novelty of the approach lies in the fact that it fits the initial training subset with the current forecasting instance, and consequently reduces the uncertainty of the prediction. In this way, by selecting instances which share a large amount of MI with the current forecasting instance in every prediction step, error propagation and accumulation can be reduced, both of which are well known shortcomings of the recursive prediction strategy, thus leading to better forecasting quality. Another element which sets this approach apart from others is that it is not proposed as an outlier detector, but for the instance selection of data which do not necessarily have to contain noise and outliers. The results obtained from the data sets from NN5 competition in time series prediction indicate that the proposed method increases the quality of long-term time series prediction, as well as reduces the amount of instances needed for building the model.

However, accurate genotyping of an unknown sample for which a large number of possible variants may exist will require an automated HRM curve identification method capable of comparing unknowns against a large cohort of known sequence variants. Herein, we describe a new method for automated HRM curve classification based on machine learning methods and learned tolerance for reaction condition deviations. We tested this method in silico through multiple cross-validations using curves generated from 9 different simulated experimental conditions to classify 92 known serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae and demonstrated over 99% accuracy with 8 training curves per serotype.

Aims To forecast the winter distribution of the Meadow Pipit in the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb (1 700 000 km(2)) by combining ring records and fields surveys. Methods We processed winter ring records with Maxent, a popular machine-learning technique used to predict the occurrence probability of species. We then tested whether the occurrence probabilities predicted by the model were significantly positively related to the actual abundance of the Pipit in Spain and Morocco. Results Occurrence probabilities provided by Maxent explained 6% of Pipit abundance distribution in partial least squares regression analyses. There was, in addition, a weak effect of geographical location (1.5%) and a strong effect of local vegetation (17.6%) on Pipit distribution. The occurrence probabilities were used to classify the winter range of the Meadow Pipit in sectors of high, medium and low suitability. The most suitable sector occupied 9% of the region (153 000 km(2)) and was restricted to warm and moist lowlands where Pipits gather in grasslands. Conclusion These results support the potential usefulness of cartographic models derived from ring records to describe the wintering range of migratory birds.

This study utilised the machine learning paradigm to evaluate the CI techniques while applying them to the prediction of porosity and permeability of heterogeneous petroleum reservoirs using six diverse well data sets. Porosity and permeability are the major petroleum reservoir properties that serve as indicators of reservoir quality and quantity. The results showed that the performance of support vector machines (SVM) and functional networks (FN) is competitively better than that of Type-2 fuzzy logic system (T2FLS) in terms of correlation coefficient. With execution time, FN and SVM were faster than T2FLS, which took the most time for both training and testing. The results also demonstrated the capability of SVM to handle small data sets. This work will assist artificial intelligence practitioners to determine the most appropriate technique to use especially in conditions of limited amount of data and low processing power.

We consider a sequence of response variables, where each response y depends on a covariate x according to an unobserved state z. The states form a stochastic process and their possible values are j=1, horizontal ellipsis , J. If z equals j the expected response of y is one of J unknown smooth functions evaluated at x. We call this model a switching nonparametric regression model. We develop an Expectation-Maximisation algorithm to estimate the parameters of the latent state process and the functions corresponding to the J states. We also obtain standard errors for the parameter estimates of the state process. We conduct simulation studies to analyse the frequentist properties of our estimates. We also apply the proposed methodology to the well-known motorcycle dataset treating the data as coming from more than one simulated accident run with unobserved run labels.	[de Souza, Camila P.

These approaches should be particularly useful because the need for scalable project-based and student-centered learning is growing considerably. In this article, we present studies focused on how students learn computer programming, based on data drawn from 154,000 code snapshots of computer programs under development by approximately 370 students enrolled in an introductory undergraduate programming course. We use methods from machine learning to discover patterns in the data and try to predict final exam grades. We begin with a set of exploratory experiments that use fully automated techniques to investigate how much students change their programming behavior throughout all assignments in the course. The results show that students' change in programming patterns is only weakly predictive of course performance. We subsequently hone in on 1 single assignment, trying to map students' learning process and trajectories and automatically identify productive and unproductive (sink) states within these trajectories. Results show that our process-based metric has better predictive power for final exams than the midterm grades. We conclude with recommendations about the use of such methods for assessment, real-time feedback, and course improvement.

The sentiment (tone, opinion) is assessed using several categorization schemes in order to explore various aspects of language used in the annual reports of U.S. companies. Further, we employ machine learning methods and neural networks to predict financial performance expressed in terms of the Z-score bankruptcy model. Eleven categories of sentiment (ranging from negative and positive to active and common) are used as the inputs of the prediction models. Support vector machines provide the highest forecasting accuracy. This evidence suggests that there exist non-linear relationships between the sentiment and financial performance. The results indicate that the sentiment information is an important forecasting determinant of financial performance and, thus, can be used to support decision-making process of corporate stakeholders.

This paper shows an attempt to select the most significant features for emotion recognition in spoken Basque and Spanish Languages using different methods for feature selection. RekEmozio database was used as the experimental data set. Several Machine Learning paradigms were used for the emotion classification task. Experiments were executed in three phases, using different sets of features as classification variables in each phase. Moreover, feature subset selection was applied at each phase in order to seek for the most relevant feature subset. The three phases approach was selected to check the validity of the proposed approach. Achieved results show that an instance-based learning algorithm using feature subset selection techniques based on evolutionary algorithms is the best Machine Learning paradigm in automatic emotion recognition, with all different feature sets, obtaining a mean of 80,05% emotion recognition rate in Basque and a 74,82% in Spanish. In order to check the goodness of the proposed process, a greedy searching approach (FSS-Forward) has been applied and a comparison between them is provided. Based on achieved results, a set of most relevant non-speaker dependent features is proposed for both languages and new perspectives are suggested.

The knowledge of the subcellular localization of proteins can provide valuable information about their molecular functions. Therefore, one of the fundamental goals in cell biology and proteomics is to analyze the subcellular localizations and functions of these proteins. Recent large-scale human genomics and proteomics studies have made it possible to characterize humah proteins at a subcellular localization level. In this study, according to the annotation in Swiss-Prot, 8842 human proteins were classified into seven subcellular localizations. Human proteins in the seven subcellular localizations were compared by using topological properties, biological properties, codon usage indices, mRNA expression levels, protein complexity and physicochemical properties. All these properties were found to be significantly different in the seven categories. In addition, based on these properties and pseudo-amino acid compositions, a machine learning classifier was built for the prediction of protein subcellular localization. The study presented here was an attempt to address the aforementioned properties for comparing human proteins of different subcellular localizations. We hope our findings presented in this study may provide important help for the prediction of protein subcellular localization and for understanding the general function of human proteins in cells.

We show that quantum superposition enables quantum learning that is faster than classical learning by expanding the approximate solution regions, i.e., the acceptable regions. This is also demonstrated by means of numerical simulations with a standard feedback model, namely random search, and a practical model, namely differential evolution.

FSS-MGSA is an evolutionary, stochastic search algorithm based on the law of gravity and mass interactions, and it can be executed when domain knowledge is not available. A wrapper approach, over Naive-Bayes, ID3, K-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine learning algorithms, is used to evaluate the goodness of each visited solution. The key to the success of the MGSA is to utilize the piecewise linear chaotic map for increasing its diversity of species, and to use sequential quadratic programming for accelerating local exploitation. Promising results are achieved in a variety of tasks where domain knowledge is not available. The experimental results show that the proposed method has the ability of selecting the discriminating input features correctly and can achieve high accuracy of classification, which is comparable to or better than well-known similar classifier systems. Furthermore, the MGSA is tested on ten functions provided by CEC 2005 special session and compared with various modified Gravitational Search Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Genetic Algorithm. The obtained results confirm the high performance of the MGSA in solving various problems in optimization. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, how to effectively tackle high-dimensional multilabel data, which are ubiquitous in real-world applications, is still an open issue in multilabel learning. Although many efforts have been made in variable selection for traditional data, little work concerns variable selection for multilabel data yet. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multilabel learning, which can achieve the purposes of variable selection and classification learning simultaneously. Specifically, our method exploits logistic regression to train models on multilabel data for classification. Besides, an elastic net penalty is performed on the logistic regression model to handle ill-conditioned and over-fitting problems of high-dimensional data. To further improve the efficiency, we solve the convex optimization problem of logistic regression with the elastic net penalty by a quadratic approximation technique. The experimental results on seven multilabel data sets show that our method has achieved encouraging performance and is competitive with six popular multilabel learning algorithms in most cases.

We propose a machine learning algorithm that maps out the Frequentist confidence limit on parameter space by intelligently targeting likelihood evaluations so as to quickly and accurately characterize the likelihood surface in both low-and high-likelihood regions. We compare our algorithm to Bayesian credible limits derived by the well-tested Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm using both multi-modal toy likelihood functions and the seven yr Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe cosmic microwave background likelihood function. We find that our algorithm correctly identifies the location, general size, and general shape of high-likelihood regions in parameter space while being more robust against multi-modality than MCMC.

Automatic diagnosis of melanoma using machine learning methods on a spectroscopic system	BMC MEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article							PIGMENTED SKIN-LESIONS; LIGHT-SCATTERING SPECTROSCOPY; COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS; POLARIZED-LIGHT; TURBID MEDIA; DIGITAL DERMOSCOPY; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; CANCER STATISTICS; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; ABCD RULE	Background: Early and accurate diagnosis of melanoma, the deadliest type of skin cancer, has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality rate. However, early diagnosis of melanoma is not trivial even for experienced dermatologists, as it needs sampling and laboratory tests which can be extremely complex and subjective. The accuracy of clinical diagnosis of melanoma is also an issue especially in distinguishing between melanoma and mole. To solve these problems, this paper presents an approach that makes non-subjective judgements based on quantitative measures for automatic diagnosis of melanoma. Methods: Our approach involves image acquisition, image processing, feature extraction, and classification. 187 images (19 malignant melanoma and 168 benign lesions) were collected in a clinic by a spectroscopic device that combines single-scattered, polarized light spectroscopy with multiple-scattered, un-polarized light spectroscopy. After noise reduction and image normalization, features were extracted based on statistical measurements (i.e. mean, standard deviation, mean absolute deviation, L-1 norm, and L-2 norm) of image pixel intensities to characterize the pattern of melanoma. Finally, these features were fed into certain classifiers to train learning models for classification. Results: We adopted three classifiers - artificial neural network, naive bayes, and k-nearest neighbour to evaluate our approach separately. The naive bayes classifier achieved the best performance - 89% accuracy, 89% sensitivity and 89% specificity, which was integrated with our approach in a desktop application running on the spectroscopic system for diagnosis of melanoma. Conclusions: Our work has two strengths. (1) We have used single scattered polarized light spectroscopy and multiple scattered unpolarized light spectroscopy to decipher the multilayered characteristics of human skin. (2) Our approach does not need image segmentation, as we directly probe tiny spots in the lesion skin and the image scans do not involve background skin. The desktop application for automatic diagnosis of melanoma can help dermatologists get a non-subjective second opinion for their diagnosis decision.

Bayesian Model of Protein Primary Sequence for Secondary Structure Prediction	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORKS; SCOP DATABASE; ALPHA-HELICES; PACKING; SERVER; ALIGNMENT; DESIGN; PHD	Determining the primary structure (i.e., amino acid sequence) of a protein has become cheaper, faster, and more accurate. Higher order protein structure provides insight into a protein's function in the cell. Understanding a protein's secondary structure is a first step towards this goal. Therefore, a number of computational prediction methods have been developed to predict secondary structure from just the primary amino acid sequence. The most successful methods use machine learning approaches that are quite accurate, but do not directly incorporate structural information. As a step towards improving secondary structure reduction given the primary structure, we propose a Bayesian model based on the knob-socket model of protein packing in secondary structure. The method considers the packing influence of residues on the secondary structure determination, including those packed close in space but distant in sequence. By performing an assessment of our method on 2 test sets we show how incorporation of multiple sequence alignment data, similarly to PSIPRED, provides balance and improves the accuracy of the predictions. Software implementing the methods is provided as a web application and a stand-alone implementation.

An active learning paradigm based on a priori data reduction and organization	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Pattern recognition; Active learning; Image annotation; Machine learning; Data mining	AUTOMATIC IMAGE ANNOTATION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; TEXT CLASSIFICATION; PATH; SELECTION; RETRIEVAL; SVMS	In the past few years, active learning has been reasonably successful and it has drawn a lot of attention. However, recent active learning methods have focused on strategies in which a large unlabeled dataset has to be reprocessed at each learning iteration. As the datasets grow, these strategies become inefficient or even a tremendous computational challenge. In order to address these issues, we propose an effective and efficient active learning paradigm which attains a significant reduction in the size of the learning set by applying an a priori process of identification and organization of a small relevant subset. Furthermore, the concomitant classification and selection processes enable the classification of a very small number of samples, while selecting the informative ones. Experimental results showed that the proposed paradigm allows to achieve high accuracy quickly with minimum user interaction, further improving its efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Tarasov, A; Delany, SJ; Mac Namee, B				Tarasov, Alexey; Delany, Sarah Jane; Mac Namee, Brian			Dynamic estimation of worker reliability in crowdsourcing for regression tasks: Making it work	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Supervised machine learning; Crowdsourcing; Worker reliability; Multi-armed bandits; Emotion recognition	MULTIPLE DATA SETS; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; MULTIARMED BANDIT; ANNOTATORS; CLASSIFIERS; CROWDS	One of the biggest challenges in crowdsourcing is detecting noisy and incompetent workers. A possible way of handling this problem is to dynamically estimate the reliability of workers as they do work and accept only those workers who are deemed to be reliable to date. Although many approaches to dynamic estimation of rater reliability exist, they are often only appropriate for very specific categories of tasks, for example, only for binary classification. They also can make unrealistic assumptions such as requiring access to a large number of gold standard answers or relying on the constant availability of any rater. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the dynamic estimation of rater reliability in regression (DER3) using multi-armed bandits. This approach is specifically suited for real-life crowdsourcing scenarios, where the task at hand is labelling or rating corpora to be used in supervised machine learning, and the annotations are continuous ratings, although it can be easily generalised to multi-class or binary classification tasks. We demonstrate that DER3 provides high-accuracy results and at the same time keeps the cost of the rating process low. Although our main motivating example is the recognition of emotion in speech, our approach shows similar results in other application areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Improving peak detection in high-resolution LC/MS metabolomics data using preexisting knowledge and machine learning approach	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							SPECTROMETRY-BASED METABOLOMICS; MS-BASED METABOLOMICS; LC-MS; IDENTIFICATION; EXTRACTION; ALIGNMENT	Motivation: Peak detection is a key step in the preprocessing of untargeted metabolomics data generated from high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The common practice is to use filters with predetermined parameters to select peaks in the LC/MS profile. This rigid approach can cause suboptimal performance when the choice of peak model and parameters do not suit the data characteristics. Results: Here we present a method that learns directly from various data features of the extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) to differentiate between true peak regions from noise regions in the LC/MS profile. It utilizes the knowledge of known metabolites, as well as robust machine learning approaches. Unlike currently available methods, this new approach does not assume a parametric peak shape model and allows maximum flexibility. We demonstrate the superiority of the new approach using real data. Because matching to known metabolites entails uncertainties and cannot be considered a gold standard, we also developed a probabilistic receiver-operating characteristic (pROC) approach that can incorporate uncertainties.

Uncovering cortical MEG responses to listened audiobook stories	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Canonical correlation analysis (CCA); Forward modeling; MEG; Single-trial analysis; Spatial filtering; Wavelet transform	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; SPACE SEPARATION METHOD; SPEECH COMPREHENSION; TEMPORAL STRUCTURE; PHASE; PATTERNS; INFORMATION; BRAIN; HIERARCHY	Naturalistic stimuli, such as normal speech and narratives, are opening up intriguing prospects in neuroscience, especially when merging neuroimaging with machine learning methodology. Here we propose a task-optimized spatial filtering strategy for uncovering individual magnetoencephalographic (MEG) responses to audiobook stories. Ten subjects listened to 1-h-long recording once, as well as to 48 repetitions of a 1-min-long speech passage. Employing response replicability as statistical validity and utilizing unsupervised learning methods, we trained spatial filters that were able to generalize over datasets of an individual. For this blind-signal-separation (BSS) task, we derived a version of multi-set similarity-constrained canonical correlation analysis (SimCCA) that theoretically provides maximal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in this setting. Irrespective of significant noise in unaveraged MEG traces, the method successfully uncovered feasible time courses up to similar to 120 Hz, with the most prominent signals below 20 Hz. Individual trial-to-trial correlations of such time courses reached the level of 0.55 (median 0.33 in the group) at similar to 0.5 Hz, with considerable variation between subjects. By this filtering, the SNR increased up to 20 times. In comparison, independent component analysis (ICA) or principal component analysis (PCA) did not improve SNR notably. The validity of the extracted brain signals was further assessed by inspecting their associations with the stimulus, as well as by mapping the contributing cortical signal sources. The results indicate that the proposed methodology effectively reduces noise in MEG recordings to that extent that brain responses can be seen to nonrecurring audiobook stories. The study paves the way for applications aiming at accurately modeling the stimulus-response-relationship by tackling the response variability, as well as for real-time monitoring of brain signals of individuals in naturalistic experimental conditions.

Populus tremula (European aspen) shows no evidence of sexual dimorphism	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						Sexual dimorphism; RNA-Sequencing; transcriptomics; Populus tremula; dioecious	DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS; BIASED HERBIVORY; BLACK-COTTONWOOD; PLANT BIOLOGY; ELEVATED CO2; CATHAYANA; RESPONSES; GENOME; EVOLUTION; TRICHOCARPA	Background: Evolutionary theory suggests that males and females may evolve sexually dimorphic phenotypic and biochemical traits concordant with each sex having different optimal strategies of resource investment to maximise reproductive success and fitness. Such sexual dimorphism would result in sex biased gene expression patterns in non-floral organs for autosomal genes associated with the control and development of such phenotypic traits. Results: We examined morphological, biochemical and herbivory traits to test for sexually dimorphic resource allocation strategies within collections of sexually mature and immature Populus tremula (European aspen) trees. In addition we profiled gene expression in mature leaves of sexually mature wild trees using whole-genome oligonucleotide microarrays and RNA-Sequencing. Conclusions: We found no evidence of sexual dimorphism or differential resource investment strategies between males and females in either sexually immature or mature trees. Similarly, single-gene differential expression and machine learning approaches revealed no evidence of large-scale sex biased gene expression. However, two significantly differentially expressed genes were identified from the RNA-Seq data, one of which is a robust diagnostic marker of sex in P. tremula.

Differentiating Coeliac Disease from Irritable Bowel Syndrome by Urinary Volatile Organic Compound Analysis - A Pilot Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ELECTRONIC E-NOSE; DIAGNOSTIC-ACCURACY; IGA DEFICIENCY; FERMENTONOMICS; ANTIBODIES; CHILDREN; INSIGHTS	Coeliac disease (CD), a T-cell-mediated gluten sensitive enteropathy, affects similar to 1% of the UK population and can present with wide ranging clinical features, often being mistaken for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Heightened clinical awareness and serological screening identifies those with potential coeliac disease; the diagnosis is confirmed with duodenal biopsies, and symptom improvement with a gluten-free diet. Limitations to diagnosis are false negative serology and reluctance to undergo biopsy. The gut microbiome is altered in several gastrointestinal disorders, causing altered gut fermentation patterns recognisable by volatile organic compounds (VOC) analysis in urine, breath and faeces. We aimed to determine if CD alters the urinary VOC pattern, distinguishing it from IBS. 47 patients were recruited, 27 with established CD, on gluten free diets, and 20 with diarrhoea-predominant IBS (D-IBS). Collected urine was stored frozen in 10 ml aliquots. For assay, the specimens were heated to 40 +/- 0.1 degrees C and the headspace analysed by Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometry (FAIMS). Machine learning algorithms were used for statistical evaluation. Samples were also analysed using Gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Sparse logistic regression showed that FAIMS distinguishes VOCs in CD vs D-IBS with ROC curve AUC of 0.91 (0.83-0.99), sensitivity and specificity of 85% respectively. GCMS showed a unique peak at 4'67 found only in CD, not D-IBS, which correlated with the compound 1,3,5,7 cyclooctatetraene. This study suggests that FAIMS offers a novel, non-invasive approach to identify those with possible CD, and distinguishes from D-IBS. It offers the potential for monitoring compliance with a gluten-free diet at home. The presence of cyclooctatetraene in CD specimens will need further validation.

They have been shown to be powerful tools to encode dependence relationships among the variables of a domain under uncertainty. Thanks to their generality, Bayesian networks can accommodate continuous and discrete variables, as well as temporal processes. In this paper we review Bayesian networks and how they can be learned automatically from data by means of structure learning algorithms. Also, we examine how a user can take advantage of these networks for reasoning by exact or approximate inference algorithms that propagate the given evidence through the graphical structure. Despite their applicability in many fields, they have been little used in neuroscience, where they have focused on specific problems, like functional connectivity analysis from neuroimaging data. Here we survey key research in neuroscience where Bayesian networks have been used with different aims: discover associations between variables, perform probabilistic reasoning over the model, and classify new observations with and without supervision. The networks are learned from data of any kind -morphological, electrophysiological, -omics and neuroimaging-, there by broadening the scope-molecular, cellular, structural, functional, cognitive and medical- of the brain aspects to be studied.

Precisely, we compare our three recent proposed feature selection methods [i.e., multiple kernel learning (MKL), high-order graph matching based feature selection (HGM-FS), sparse multimodal learning (SMML)] using four widely-used modalities [i.e., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and genetic modality single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)]. This study demonstrates the performance of each method using these modalities individually or integratively, and may be valuable to clinical tests in practice. Our experimental results suggest that for AD prediction, in general, (1) in terms of accuracy, PET is the best modality; (2) Even though the discriminant power of genetic SNP features is weak, adding this modality to other modalities does help improve the classification accuracy; (3) HGM-FS works best among the three feature selection methods; (4) Some of the selected features are shared by all the feature selection methods, which may have high correlation with the disease. Using all the modalities on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, the best accuracies, described as (mean +/- standard deviation)%, among the three methods are (76.2 +/- 11.3)% for AD vs. MCI, (94.8 +/- 7.3)% for AD vs. HC, (76.5 +/- 11.1)% for MCI vs. HC, and (71.0 +/- 8.4)% for AD vs. MCI vs. HC, respectively.

Temporal generalization of sub-pixel vegetation mapping with multiple machine learning and atmospheric correction algorithms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							SPECTRAL MIXTURE ANALYSIS; LANDSAT TM DATA; COVER CLASSIFICATION; IMPERVIOUS SURFACES; METROPOLITAN-AREA; NEURAL-NETWORK; URBAN-GROWTH; CHINA; REFLECTANCE; ENVIRONMENTS	Temporal generalization allows a trained classification algorithm to be applied to multiple images across time to derive reliable classification map products. It is a challenging remote-sensing research topic since the results are dependent on the selection of atmospheric correction methods, classification algorithms, validation processes, and their varying combinations. This study examined the temporal generalization of sub-pixel vegetation mapping using multiple Landsat images (1990, 1996, 2004, and 2010). All Landsat images were processed with two atmospheric correction methods: simple dark object subtraction (DOS) and the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) algorithm. For the sub-pixel vegetation mapping of the 2004 Landsat image, we used high-resolution OrbView-3 images as a training/validation data set and compared three machine learning algorithms (neural networks, random forests, and classification and regression trees) for their classification performance. The trained classifiers were then applied to other Landsat images (1990, 1996, and 2010) to derive sub-pixel vegetation map products. For the 2004 Landsat image classification, cross-validation shows similar classification results for neural networks (root mean square error (RMSE)=0.099) and random forests (RMSE=0.100) algorithms, and both are better than classification and regression trees (RMSE=0.123). Pseudo-invariant pixels between 2004 and 2010 were used as validation points to evaluate the temporal generalizability of classification algorithms. Simple DOS and LEDAPS atmospheric correction resulted in similar accuracy statistics. The neural-network-based classifier performed best in generating reliable sub-pixel vegetation map products across time.

Feature selection has been soon considered a de facto standard in this field since its introduction, and a huge number of feature selection methods were utilized trying to reduce the input dimensionality while improving the classification performance. This paper is devoted to reviewing the most up-to-date feature selection methods developed in this field and the microarray databases most frequently used in the literature. We also make the interested reader aware of the problematic of data characteristics in this domain, such as the imbalance of the data, their complexity, or the so-called dataset shift. Finally, an experimental evaluation on the most representative datasets using well-known feature selection methods is presented, bearing in mind that the aim is not to provide the best feature selection method, but to facilitate their comparative study by the research community.

Locality, compactness and consistency are considered as the key principles in distance metric learning. However, the existing metric learning methods just consider one or two of them. In this paper, we develop a multi-granularity distance learning technique. First, a new index, neighborhood granule margin, which simultaneously considers locality, compactness and consistency of neighborhood, is introduced to evaluate a distance metric. By maximizing neighborhood granule margin, we formulate the distance metric learning problem as a sample pair classification problem, which can be solved by standard support vector machine solvers. Then a set of distance metrics are learned in different granular spaces. The weights of the granular spaces are learned through optimizing the margin distribution. Finally, the decisions from different granular spaces are combined with weighted voting. Experiments on UCI datasets, gender classification and object categorization tasks show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art distance metric learning algorithms.

Detection of atypical genes in virus families using a one-class SVM	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Horizontal gene transfer; Viral evolution; Machine learning; SVM	BACTERIAL GENOMES; DNA; EVOLUTION; MIMIVIRUS; VIROPHAGE; PROTEIN; RATES	Background: The diversity of viruses, the absence of universally common genes in them, and their ability to act as carriers of genetic material make assessment of evolutionary paths of viral genes very difficult. One important factor contributing to this complexity is horizontal gene transfer. Results: We explore the possibility for the systematic identification of atypical genes within virus families, including viruses whose genome is not encoded by a double-stranded DNA. Our method is based on gene statistical features that differ in genes that were subject of recent horizontal gene transfer from those of the genome in which they are observed. We employ a one-class SVM approach to detect atypical genes within a virus family basing of their statistical signatures and without explicit knowledge of the source species. The simplicity of the statistical features used makes the method applicable to various viruses irrespective of their genome size or type. Conclusions: On simulated data, the method can robustly identify alien genes irrespective of the coding nucleic acid found in a virus. It also compares well to results obtained in related studies for double-stranded DNA viruses. Its value in practice is confirmed by the identification of isolated examples of horizontal gene transfer events that have already been described in the literature.

Unfortunately, it is both expensive and time-consuming to perform physical experiments to determine whether a drug and a protein are interacting with each other. Some previous attempts to design an automated system to perform this task were based on the knowledge of the 3D structure of a protein, which is not always available in practice. With the availability of protein sequences generated in the post-genomic age, however, a sequence-based solution to deal with this problem is necessary. Following other works in this area, we propose a new machine learning system based on several protein descriptors extracted from several protein representations, such as, variants of the position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) of proteins, the amino-acid sequence, and a matrix representation of a protein. The prediction engine is operated by an ensemble of support vector machines (SVMs), with each SVM trained on a specific descriptor and the results of each SVM combined by sum rule. The overall success rate achieved by our final ensemble is notably higher than previous results obtained on the same datasets using the same testing protocols reported in the literature.

J	Jo, T; Cheng, JL				Jo, Taeho; Cheng, Jianlin			Improving protein fold recognition by random forest	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th Annual Conference of the MidSouth-Computational-Biology-and-Bioinformatics-Society (MCBIOS)	MAR 06-08, 2014	Stillwater, OH	MidSouth Computat Biol & Bioinformat Soc	Oklahoma State Univ		HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; PROFILE-PROFILE ALIGNMENT; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; SOLVENT ACCESSIBILITY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; GAP PENALTIES; PSI-BLAST; PREDICTION; SEQUENCE; CLASSIFICATION	Background: Recognizing the correct structural fold among known template protein structures for a target protein (i.e. fold recognition) is essential for template-based protein structure modeling. Since the fold recognition problem can be defined as a binary classification problem of predicting whether or not the unknown fold of a target protein is similar to an already known template protein structure in a library, machine learning methods have been effectively applied to tackle this problem. In our work, we developed RF-Fold that uses random forest - one of the most powerful and scalable machine learning classification methods - to recognize protein folds. Results: RF-Fold consists of hundreds of decision trees that can be trained efficiently on very large datasets to make accurate predictions on a highly imbalanced dataset. We evaluated RF-Fold on the standard Lindahl's benchmark dataset comprised of 976 x 975 target-template protein pairs through cross-validation. Compared with 17 different fold recognition methods, the performance of RF-Fold is generally comparable to the best performance in fold recognition of different difficulty ranging from the easiest family level, the medium-hard superfamily level, and to the hardest fold level. Based on the top-one template protein ranked by RF-Fold, the correct recognition rate is 84.5%, 63.4%, and 40.8% at family, superfamily, and fold levels, respectively. Based on the top-five template protein folds ranked by RF-Fold, the correct recognition rate increases to 91.5%, 79.3% and 58.3% at family, superfamily, and fold levels. Conclusions: The good performance achieved by the RF-Fold demonstrates the random forest's effectiveness for protein fold recognition.

Topic modeling for cluster analysis of large biological and medical datasets	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th Annual Conference of the MidSouth-Computational-Biology-and-Bioinformatics-Society (MCBIOS)	MAR 06-08, 2014	Stillwater, OH	MidSouth Computat Biol & Bioinformat Soc	Oklahoma State Univ		GENE-EXPRESSION; PREDICTION; CANCER	Background: The big data moniker is nowhere better deserved than to describe the ever-increasing prodigiousness and complexity of biological and medical datasets. New methods are needed to generate and test hypotheses, foster biological interpretation, and build validated predictors. Although multivariate techniques such as cluster analysis may allow researchers to identify groups, or clusters, of related variables, the accuracies and effectiveness of traditional clustering methods diminish for large and hyper dimensional datasets. Topic modeling is an active research field in machine learning and has been mainly used as an analytical tool to structure large textual corpora for data mining. Its ability to reduce high dimensionality to a small number of latent variables makes it suitable as a means for clustering or overcoming clustering difficulties in large biological and medical datasets. Results: In this study, three topic model-derived clustering methods, highest probable topic assignment, feature selection and feature extraction, are proposed and tested on the cluster analysis of three large datasets: Salmonella pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) dataset, lung cancer dataset, and breast cancer dataset, which represent various types of large biological or medical datasets. All three various methods are shown to improve the efficacy/effectiveness of clustering results on the three datasets in comparison to traditional methods. A preferable cluster analysis method emerged for each of the three datasets on the basis of replicating known biological truths. Conclusion: Topic modeling could be advantageously applied to the large datasets of biological or medical research. The three proposed topic model-derived clustering methods, highest probable topic assignment, feature selection and feature extraction, yield clustering improvements for the three different data types. Clusters more efficaciously represent truthful groupings and subgroupings in the data than traditional methods, suggesting that topic model-based methods could provide an analytic advancement in the analysis of large biological or medical datasets.

Referred to as phenotypic overlap, these sets of disease-related symptoms suggest shared pathophysiological mechanisms. Few attempts have been made to visualize the phenotypic relationships between different human diseases from a machine learning perspective. The proposed research, it is anticipated, will visually assist researchers in quickly disambiguating symptoms which can confound the timely and accurate diagnosis of a disease. Methods: Our method is primarily based on multiple maps t-SNE (mm-tSNE), which is a probabilistic method for visualizing data points in multiple low dimensional spaces. We improved mm-tSNE by adding a Laplacian regularization term and subsequently provide an algorithm for optimizing the new objective function. The advantage of Laplacian regularization is that it adopts clustering structures of variables and provides more sparsity to the estimated parameters. Results: In order to further assess our modified mm-tSNE algorithm from a comparative standpoint, we reexamined two social network datasets used by the previous authors. Subsequently, we apply our method on phenotype dataset. In all these cases, our proposed method demonstrated better performance than the original version of mm-tSNE, as measured by the neighbourhood preservation ratio. Conclusions: Phenotype grouping reflects the nature of human disease genetics. Thus, phenotype visualization may be complementary to investigate candidate genes for diseases as well as functional relations between genes and proteins. These relationships can be modelled by the modified mm-tSNE method. The modified mm-tSNE can be applied directly in other domain including social and biological datasets.

Not all Adverse Drug Reactions are identified before a drug is made available in the market. Current post-marketing drug surveillance methods, which are based purely on voluntary spontaneous reports, are unable to provide the early indications necessary to prevent the occurrence of such injuries or fatalities. The objective of this research is to extract reports of adverse drug side-effects from messages in online healthcare forums and use them as early indicators to assist in post-marketing drug surveillance. Methods: We treat the task of extracting adverse side-effects of drugs from healthcare forum messages as a sequence labeling problem and present a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) based Text Mining system that can be used to classify a message as containing drug side-effect information and then extract the adverse side-effect mentions from it. A manually annotated dataset from www. medications. com is used in the training and validation of the HMM based Text Mining system. Results: A 10-fold cross-validation on the manually annotated dataset yielded on average an F-Score of 0.76 from the HMM Classifier, in comparison to 0.575 from the Baseline classifier. Without the Plain Text Filter component as a part of the Text Processing module, the F-Score of the HMM Classifier was reduced to 0.378 on average, while absence of the HTML Filter component was found to have no impact. Reducing the Drug names dictionary size by half, on average reduced the F-Score of the HMM Classifier to 0.359, while a similar reduction to the side-effects dictionary yielded an F-Score of 0.651 on average. Adverse side-effects mined from www. medications. com and www. steadyhealth. com were found to match the Adverse Drug Reactions on the Drug Package Labels of several drugs. In addition, some novel adverse side-effects, which can be potential Adverse Drug Reactions, were also identified. Conclusions: The results from the HMM based Text Miner are encouraging to pursue further enhancements to this approach. The mined novel side-effects can act as early indicators for health authorities to help focus their efforts in post-marketing drug surveillance.

The proposed methodology is multi-attribute towards considering several markers simultaneously to explain the phenotype and is based jointly on statistical tools, machine learning and computational intelligence. Results: The suggested method has shown potential in the simulated database 1, with additive effects only, and real database. In this simulated database, with a total of 1,000 markers, and 7 with major effect on the phenotype and the other 993 SNPs representing the noise, the method identified 21 markers. Of this total, 5 are relevant SNPs between the 7 but 16 are false positives. In real database, initially with 50,752 SNPs, we have reduced to 3,073 markers, increasing the accuracy of the model. In the simulated database 2, with additive effects and interactions (epistasis), the proposed method matched to the methodology most commonly used in GWAS. Conclusions: The method suggested in this paper demonstrates the effectiveness in explaining the real phenotype (PTA for milk), because with the application of the wrapper based on genetic algorithm and Support Vector Regression with Pearson Universal, many redundant markers were eliminated, increasing the prediction and accuracy of the model on the real database without quality control filters. The PUK demonstrated that it can replicate the performance of linear and RBF kernels.

Computational identification of multi-omic correlates of anticancer therapeutic response	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article							NEGATIVE BREAST-CANCER; GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; DRUG-SENSITIVITY; MYELOID-LEUKEMIA; MICROARRAY DATA; DOWN-REGULATION; SURVIVAL; PATHWAY; CLASSIFICATION; INHIBITION	Background: A challenge in precision medicine is the transformation of genomic data into knowledge that can be used to stratify patients into treatment groups based on predicted clinical response. Although clinical trials remain the only way to truly measure drug toxicities and effectiveness, as a scientific community we lack the resources to clinically assess all drugs presently under development. Therefore, an effective preclinical model system that enables prediction of anticancer drug response could significantly speed the broader adoption of personalized medicine. Results: Three large-scale pharmacogenomic studies have screened anticancer compounds in greater than 1000 distinct human cancer cell lines. We combined these datasets to generate and validate multi-omic predictors of drug response. We compared drug response signatures built using a penalized linear regression model and two non-linear machine learning techniques, random forest and support vector machine. The precision and robustness of each drug response signature was assessed using cross-validation across three independent datasets. Fifteen drugs were common among the datasets. We validated prediction signatures for eleven out of fifteen tested drugs (17-AAG, AZD0530, AZD6244, Erlotinib, Lapatinib, Nultin-3, Paclitaxel, PD0325901, PD0332991, PF02341066, and PLX4720). Conclusions: Multi-omic predictors of drug response can be generated and validated for many drugs. Specifically, the random forest algorithm generated more precise and robust prediction signatures when compared to support vector machines and the more commonly used elastic net regression. The resulting drug response signatures can be used to stratify patients into treatment groups based on their individual tumor biology, with two major benefits: speeding the process of bringing preclinical drugs to market, and the repurposing and repositioning of existing anticancer therapies.

Just like CTs for traditional drugs and biologics have helped accelerate the translation of biomedical findings into medical practice, CTs for nanodrugs and nanodevices could advance novel nanomaterials as agents for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is publicly available information about nanomedicine-related CTs, the online archiving of this information is carried out without adhering to criteria that discriminate between studies involving nanomaterials or nanotechnology-based processes (nano), and CTs that do not involve nanotechnology (non-nano). Finding out whether nanodrugs and nanodevices were involved in a study from CT summaries alone is a challenging task. At the time of writing, CTs archived in the well-known online registry ClinicalTrials.gov are not easily told apart as to whether they are nano or non-nano CTs-even when performed by domain experts, due to the lack of both a common definition for nanotechnology and of standards for reporting nanomedical experiments and results. Methods: We propose a supervised learning approach for classifying CT summaries from ClinicalTrials.gov according to whether they fall into the nano or the non-nano categories. Our method involves several stages: i) extraction and manual annotation of CTs as nano vs. non-nano, ii) pre-processing and automatic classification, and iii) performance evaluation using several state-of-the-art classifiers under different transformations of the original dataset. Results and Conclusions: The performance of the best automated classifier closely matches that of experts (AUC over 0.95), suggesting that it is feasible to automatically detect the presence of nanotechnology products in CT summaries with a high degree of accuracy. This can significantly speed up the process of finding whether reports on ClinicalTrials.gov might be relevant to a particular nanoparticle or nanodevice, which is essential to discover any precedents for nanotoxicity events or advantages for targeted drug therapy.

A systematic identification of mitochondrial proteomes and characterization of functional linkages among mitochondrial proteins are fundamental in understanding the mechanisms underlying biological functions and human diseases associated with mitochondria. Here we present a database MitProNet which provides a comprehensive knowledgebase for mitochondrial proteome, interactome and human diseases. First an inventory of mammalian mitochondrial proteins was compiled by widely collecting proteomic datasets, and the proteins were classified by machine learning to achieve a high-confidence list of mitochondrial proteins. The current version of MitProNet covers 1124 high-confidence proteins, and the remainders were further classified as middle-or low-confidence. An organelle-specific network of functional linkages among mitochondrial proteins was then generated by integrating genomic features encoded by a wide range of datasets including genomic context, gene expression profiles, protein-protein interactions, functional similarity and metabolic pathways. The functional-linkage network should be a valuable resource for the study of biological functions of mitochondrial proteins and human mitochondrial diseases. Furthermore, we utilized the network to predict candidate genes for mitochondrial diseases using prioritization algorithms. All proteins, functional linkages and disease candidate genes in MitProNet were annotated according to the information collected from their original sources including GO, GEO, OMIM, KEGG, MIPS, HPRD and so on. MitProNet features a user-friendly graphic visualization interface to present functional analysis of linkage networks. As an up-to-date database and analysis platform, MitProNet should be particularly helpful in comprehensive studies of complicated biological mechanisms underlying mitochondrial functions and human mitochondrial diseases.

Surprisingly, decades of research have not yet declared what the optimal HMI is in this context; in particular, the traditional approach based upon surface electromyography (sEMG) still yields unreliable results due to the inherent variability of the signal. To overcome this problem, the scientific community has recently been advocating the discovery, analysis, and usage of novel HMIs to supersede or augment sEMG; a comparative analysis of such HMIs is therefore a very desirable investigation. In this paper, we compare three such HMIs employed in the detection of finger forces, namely sEMG, ultrasound imaging, and pressure sensing. The comparison is performed along four main lines: the accuracy in the prediction, the stability over time, the wearability, and the cost. A psychophysical experiment involving ten intact subjects engaged in a simple finger-flexion task was set up. Our results show that, at least in this experiment, pressure sensing and sEMG yield comparably good prediction accuracies as opposed to ultrasound imaging; and that pressure sensing enjoys a much better stability than sEMG. Given that pressure sensors are as wearable as sEMG electrodes but way cheaper, we claim that this HMI could represent a valid alternative/augmentation to sEMG to control a multi-fingered hand prosthesis.

These data are annotated by increasingly extensive and widely disseminated knowledge organisation systems ranging from simple terminologies and structured vocabularies to formal ontologies. In order to solve the interoperability issue, which arises due to the heterogeneity of these ontologies, an alignment task is usually performed. However, while significant effort has been made to provide tools that automatically align small ontologies containing hundreds or thousands of entities, little attention has been paid to the matching of large sized ontologies in the life sciences domain. Results: We have designed and implemented ServOMap, an effective method for large scale ontology matching. It is a fast and efficient high precision system able to perform matching of input ontologies containing hundreds of thousands of entities. The system, which was included in the 2012 and 2013 editions of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative campaign, performed very well. It was ranked among the top systems for the large ontologies matching. Conclusions: We proposed an approach for large scale ontology matching relying on Information Retrieval (IR) techniques and the combination of lexical and machine learning contextual similarity computing for the generation of candidate mappings. It is particularly adapted to the life sciences domain as many of the ontologies in this domain benefit from synonym terms taken from the Unified Medical Language System and that can be used by our IR strategy. The ServOMap system we implemented is able to deal with hundreds of thousands entities with an efficient computation time.

Here, we report the first machine-learning technique for sequencebased prediction of theta and tau angles. Predicted angles based on an independent test have a mean absolute error of 9 degrees for h and 34 degrees for s with a distribution on the theta-tau plane close to that of native values. The average root-mean-square distance of 10-residue fragment structures constructed from predicted h and s angles is only 1.9 angstrom from their corresponding native structures. Predicted theta and tau angles are expected to be complementary to predicted phi and psi angles and secondary structures for using in model validation and template-based as well as template-free structure prediction. The deep neural network learning technique is available as an on-line server called Structural Property prediction with Integrated DEep neuRal network (SPIDER) at http://sparks-lab. org.

Visualization and unsupervised predictive clustering of high-dimensional multimodal neuroimaging data	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Multimodal neuroimaging; Unsupervised machine learning; t-Distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE); Big data; Research domain criteria (RDoC)	MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; DISORDER; DISEASE; HETEROGENEITY; VALIDATION; SCANS; NEURODEGENERATION; DEPRESSION	Background: Neuroimaging machine learning studies have largely utilized supervised algorithms meaning they require both neuroimaging scan data and corresponding target variables (e.g. healthy vs. diseased) to be successfully 'trained' for a prediction task. Noticeably, this approach may not be optimal or possible when the global structure of the data is not well known and the researcher does not have an a priori model to fit the data. New method: We set out to investigate the utility of an unsupervised machine learning technique; t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) in identifying 'unseen' sample population patterns that may exist in high-dimensional neuroimaging data. Multimodal neuroimaging scans from 92 healthy subjects were pre-processed using atlas-based methods, integrated and input into the t-SNE algorithm. Patterns and clusters discovered by the algorithm were visualized using a 2D scatter plot and further analyzed using the K-means clustering algorithm. Comparison with existing methods: t-SNE was evaluated against classical principal component analysis. Conclusion: Remarkably, based on unlabelled multimodal scan data, t-SNE separated study subjects into two very distinct clusters which corresponded to subjects' gender labels (cluster silhouette index value = 0.79). The resulting clusters were used to develop an unsupervised minimum distance clustering model which identified 93.5% of subjects' gender. Notably, from a neuropsychiatric perspective this method may allow discovery of data-driven disease phenotypes or sub-types of treatment responders. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We attempt to remedy these issues using deformable organisms to create an easily customizable segmentation plan. We validate our framework by creating a plan to locate the brain in 3D magnetic resonance images of the head (skull-stripping). New method: Our method borrows ideas from artificial life to govern a set of deformable models. We use control processes such as sensing, proactive planning, reactive behavior, and knowledge representation to segment an image. The image may have landmarks and features specific to that dataset; these may be easily incorporated into the plan. In addition, we use a machine learning method to make our segmentation more accurate. Results: Our method had the least Hausdorff distance error, but included slightly less brain voxels (false negatives). It also had the lowest false positive error and performed on par to skull-stripping specific method on other metrics. Comparison with existing method(s): We tested our method on 838 T1-weighted images, evaluating results using distance and overlap error metrics based on expert gold standard segmentations. We evaluated the results before and after the learning step to quantify its benefit; we also compare our results to three other widely used methods: BSE, BET, and the Hybrid Watershed algorithm. Conclusions: Our framework captures diverse categories of information needed for brain segmentation and will provide a foundation for tackling a wealth of segmentation problems.

Machine learning for many-body physics: The case of the Anderson impurity model	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							POTENTIAL-ENERGY SURFACES; INFINITE DIMENSIONS; MONTE-CARLO; HUBBARD-MODEL; FERMIONS; SYSTEMS; LIMIT	Machine learning methods are applied to finding the Green's function of the Anderson impurity model, a basic model system of quantum many-body condensed-matter physics. Different methods of parametrizing the Green's function are investigated; a representation in terms of Legendre polynomials is found to be superior due to its limited number of coefficients and its applicability to state of the art methods of solution. The dependence of the errors on the size of the training set is determined. The results indicate that a machine learning approach to dynamical mean-field theory may be feasible.

Recently, a high number of machine learning techniques have been introduced to tackle this problem, mostly based on neural networks and support vector machines. Gaussian process regression (GPR) is an alternative nonparametric method that provided excellent results in other biogeophysical parameter estimation. In this letter, we evaluate GPR for the estimation of solar irradiation. Noting the nonstationary temporal behavior of the signal, we develop a particular time-based composite covariance to account for the relevant seasonal signal variations. We use a unique meteorological data set acquired at a radiometric station that includes both measurements and radiosondes, as well as numerical weather prediction models. We show that the so-called temporal GPR outperforms ten state-of-the-art statistical regression algorithms (even when including time information) in terms of accuracy and bias, and it is more robust to the number of predictions used.

Nonetheless, the majority of information retrieval and text summarization methods rely on shallow document representations that do not account for the semantics of events. In this article, we present event graphs, a novel event-based document representation model that filters and structures the information about events described in text. To construct the event graphs, we combine machine learning and rule-based models to extract sentence-level event mentions and determine the temporal relations between them. Building on event graphs, we present novel models for information retrieval and multi-document summarization. The information retrieval model measures the similarity between queries and documents by computing graph kernels over event graphs. The extractive multi-document summarization model selects sentences based on the relevance of the individual event mentions and the temporal structure of events. Experimental evaluation shows that our retrieval model significantly outperforms well-established retrieval models on event-oriented test collections, while the summarization model outperforms competitive models from shared multi-document summarization tasks.

Random average shifted histograms	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Machine learning; Histogram; Density estimation; Bootstrap; Bagging; Average shifted histograms	DENSITY ESTIMATORS	A new density estimator called RASH, for Random Average Shifted Histogram, obtained by averaging several histograms as proposed in average shifted histograms, is presented. The principal difference between the two methods is that in RASH each histogram is built over a grid with random shifted breakpoints. The asymptotic behavior of this estimator is established for the one-dimensional case and its performance through several simulations is analyzed. RASH is compared to several classic density estimators and to some recent ensemble methods. Although RASH does not always outperform the other methods, it is very simple to implement, being also more intuitive. The two dimensional case is also analyzed empirically. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Existing probabilistic relational model (PRM) learning approaches based on search and scoring usually perform a heuristic search for the highest scoring structure. In this paper, we proposes the maximum likelihood tree based immune binary particle swarm optimization (MLT-IBPSO) method to learn structures of PRMs from relational data. First, a maximum likelihood tree (MLT) is generated from the data sample, and a population is created according to the MLT. Then, immune theory is combined with particle swarm optimization (PSO) for searching the structures. As a result, the probabilistic structure is learned based on the proposed method. Experiments show that the MLT-IBPSO method can learn structures from relational data effectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

H.; Wang, Jialei; Li, Bin			Online Transfer Learning	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Transfer learning; Online learning; Knowledge transfer	ALGORITHMS; PERCEPTRON; TRACKING	In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning framework called "Online Transfer Learning" (OTL), which aims to attack an online learning task on a target domain by transferring knowledge from some source domain. We do not assume data in the target domain follows the same distribution as that in the source domain, and the motivation of our work is to enhance a supervised online learning task on a target domain by exploiting the existing knowledge that had been learnt from training data in source domains. OTL is in general very challenging since data in both source and target domains not only can be different in their class distributions, but also can be diverse in their feature representations. As a first attempt to this new research problem, we investigate two different settings of OTL: (i) OTL on homogeneous domains of common feature space, and (ii) OTL across heterogeneous domains of different feature spaces. For each setting, we propose effective OTL algorithms to solve online classification tasks, and show some theoretical bounds of the algorithms. In addition, we also apply the OTL technique to attack the challenging online learning tasks with concept-drifting data streams. Finally, we conduct extensive empirical studies on a comprehensive testbed, in which encouraging results validate the efficacy of our techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using Copula distributions to support more accurate imaging-based diagnostic classifiers for neuropsychiatric disorders	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Article						Magnetic resonance imaging; Neuropsychiatric disorders; Machine learning; Support vector machines	BASAL GANGLIA VOLUMES; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; VECTOR MACHINES; TOURETTE-SYNDROME; BRAIN ATROPHY; CLASSIFICATION; AMYGDALA; MRI; HIPPOCAMPUS; RISK	Many investigators have tried to apply machine learning techniques to magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the brain in order to diagnose neuropsychiatric disorders. Usually the number of brain imaging measures (such as measures of cortical thickness and measures of local surface morphology) derived from the MRIs (i.e., their dimensionality) has been large (e.g. >10) relative to the number of participants who provide the MRI data (<100). Sparse data in a high dimensional space increase the variability of the classification rules that machine learning algorithms generate, thereby limiting the validity, reproducibility, and generalizability of those classifiers. The accuracy and stability of the classifiers can improve significantly if the multivariate distributions of the imaging measures can be estimated accurately. To accurately estimate the multivariate distributions using sparse data, we propose to estimate first the univariate distributions of imaging data and then combine them using a Copula to generate more accurate estimates of their multivariate distributions. We then sample the estimated Copula distributions to generate dense sets of imaging measures and use those measures to train classifiers. We hypothesize that the dense sets of brain imaging measures will generate classifiers that are stable to variations in brain imaging measures, thereby improving the reproducibility, validity, and generalizability of diagnostic classification algorithms in imaging datasets from clinical populations. In our experiments, we used both computer-generated and real-world brain imaging datasets to assess the accuracy of multivariate Copula distributions in estimating the corresponding multivariate distributions of real-world imaging data. Our experiments showed that diagnostic classifiers generated using imaging measures sampled from the Copula were significantly more accurate and more reproducible than were the classifiers generated using either the real-world imaging measures or their multivariate Gaussian distributions. Thus, our findings demonstrate that estimated multivariate Copula distributions can generate dense sets of brain imaging measures that can in turn be used to train classifiers, and those classifiers are significantly more accurate and more reproducible than are those generated using real-world imaging measures alone.

J	Mi, CR; Huettmann, F; Guo, YM				Mi, Chunrong; Huettmann, Falk; Guo, Yumin			Obtaining the best possible predictions of habitat selection for wintering Great Bustards in Cangzhou, Hebei Province with rapid machine learning analysis	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN			English	Article						Hebei Province (China); Wintering habitat; Great Bustards; Predictive modeling; Random Forest	REGRESSION; CLASSIFICATION	Great Bustards (Otis tarda dybowskii) are one of the world's heaviest flying birds, occupying grassland habitats in Eastern Asia. Our study is located at the most eastern Chinese wintering site in Cangzhou, Hebei Province, where approximately 100 individuals are concentrated in a small area (17.53 km(2)). Solid information is still lacking about the wintering areas for this subspecies in its eastern range and specifically for China. The study area consists of intensely used farmland in proximity to humans and is lacking conservation areas and wild, open fields. Here, we present our results from two years of field data collection on habitat selection. We choose a machine learning model approach based on a rapid assessment methodology for the winter habitat of the Great Bustard. It is based on a spatial analysis of the best available environmental data, which were collected relatively quickly. These relatively new methods in ecology are based on an ensemble of decision trees and include algorithms such as TreeNet, Random Forest and CART used in parallel. In this study, we collected bustard droppings (presence only) from 48 locations between December 2011 and January 2012 and used the sites as training data. Droppings from 23 locations were collected in November 2012, and those sites were used as test data. We used eight environmental variables as predictor layers for the response variable of bustard presence/availability. We employed a Geographic Information System (ArcGIS 10.1 and Geospatial Modelling Environment) and Google Earth. Compared with the other three models, we found that predictions from Random Forest obtained a significant difference between presence and absence. According to this model, the three most important factors for wintering Great Bustards are distance to residential area, distance to water pools, and farmland area. Our model shows that wintering Great Bustards prefer locations that are over 400 m away from residential areas, within 900 m of water pools and on areas of farmland smaller than 0.5 km(2). We think we can apply our analysis to Great Bustard management in our study area and the adjacent region and that this work sets a baseline for future research.

There is however one area which does not receive due attention in the literature - preparation of the fMRI data for subsequent modelling. In this study we focus on the issue of synchronization of the stream of fMRI snapshots with the mental states of the subject, which is a form of smart filtering of the input data, performed prior to building a predictive model. We demonstrate, investigate and thoroughly discuss the negative effects of lack of alignment between the two streams and propose an original data-driven approach to efficiently address this problem. Our solution involves casting the issue as a constrained optimization problem in combination with an alternative classification accuracy assessment scheme, applicable to both batch and on-line scenarios and able to capture information distributed across a number of input samples lifting the common simplifying i.i.d. assumption. The proposed method is tested using real fMRI data and experimentally compared to the state-of-the-art ensemble models reported in the literature, outperforming them by a wide margin.

J	Heo, J; Yang, JY				Heo, Junyoung; Yang, Jin Yong			AdaBoost based bankruptcy forecasting of Korean construction companies	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Bankruptcy; AdaBoost; Z-score	NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTION	A lot of bankruptcy forecasting model has been studied. Most of them uses corporate finance data and is intended for general companies. It may not appropriate for forecasting bankruptcy of construction companies which has big liquidity. It has a different capital structure, and the model to judge the financial risk of general companies can be difficult to apply the construction companies. The existing studies such as traditional Z-score and bankruptcy prediction using machine learning focus on the companies of nonspecific industries. The characteristics of companies are not considered at all. In this paper, we showed that AdaBoost (adaptive boosting) is an appropriate model to judge the financial risk of Korean construction companies. We classified construction companies into three groups - large, middle, and small based on the capital of a company. We analyzed the predictive ability of the AdaBoost and other algorithms for each group of companies. The experimental results showed that the AdaBoost has more predictive power than others, especially for the large group of companies that has the capital more than 50 billion won.

Fuzzy lattice reasoning (FLR) was described lately as a lattice data domain extension of fuzzy-ARTMAP based on a lattice inclusion measure function. In this work, we develop a fuzzy lattice reasoning classifier using various distance metrics. As a consequence, the new algorithm named FLRC-MD shows better classification results and more generalization and it will lead to generate fewer induced rules. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed model, twenty benchmark data sets are tested. The results are compared favorably with those from a number of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques published in the literature. Results obtained confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A comparative study of classifier ensembles for bankruptcy prediction	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Bankruptcy prediction; Credit scoring; Classifier ensembles; Data mining; Machine learning	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CREDIT SCORING MODELS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DECISION TREES; STRATEGIES; TASKS	The aim of bankruptcy prediction in the areas of data mining and machine learning is to develop an effective model which can provide the higher prediction accuracy. In the prior literature, various classification techniques have been developed and studied, in/with which classifier ensembles by combining multiple classifiers approach have shown their outperformance over many single classifiers. However, in terms of constructing classifier ensembles, there are three critical issues which can affect their performance. The first one is the classification technique actually used/adopted, and the other two are the combination method to combine multiple classifiers and the number of classifiers to be combined, respectively. Since there are limited, relevant studies examining these aforementioned disuses, this paper conducts a comprehensive study of comparing classifier ensembles by three widely used classification techniques including multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), and decision trees (DT) based on two well-known combination methods including bagging and boosting and different numbers of combined classifiers. Our experimental results by three public datasets show that DT ensembles composed of 80-100 classifiers using the boosting method perform best. The Wilcoxon signed ranked test also demonstrates that DT ensembles by boosting perform significantly different from the other classifier ensembles. Moreover, a further study over a real-world case by a Taiwan bankruptcy dataset was conducted, which also demonstrates the superiority of DT ensembles by boosting over the others.

Since there are thousands of compounds in early-phase of drug discovery, a fast classification method, which can distinguish between active and inactive molecules, can be used for screening large compound collections. In this study, we used Support Vector Machines (SVM) for this type of classification task. SVM is a powerful classification tool that is becoming increasingly popular in various machine-learning applications. The data sets consist of 631 compounds for training set and 216 compounds for a separate test set. In data pre-processing step, the Pearson's correlation coefficient used as a filter to eliminate redundant features. After application of the correlation filter, a single SVM has been applied to this reduced data set. Moreover, we have investigated the performance of SVM with different feature selection strategies, including SVM-Recursive Feature Elimination, Wrapper Method and Subset Selection. All feature selection methods generally represent better performance than a single SVM while Subset Selection outperforms other feature selection methods. We have tested SVM as a classification tool in a real-life drug discovery problem and our results revealed that it could be a useful method for classification task in early-phase of drug discovery.

Therefore, it is essential to know the hemoglobin (Hb) levels in these patients. The aim of this paper is to predict the hemoglobin (Hb) value using a database of European hemodialysis patients provided by Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) for improving the treatment of this kind of patients. For the prediction of Hb, both analytical measurements and medication dosage of patients suffering from chronic renal failure (CRF) are used. Two kinds of models were trained, global and local models. In the case of local models, clustering techniques based on hierarchical approaches and the adaptive resonance theory (ART) were used as a first step, and then, a different predictor was used for each obtained cluster. Different global models have been applied to the dataset such as Linear Models, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Regression Trees among others. Also a relevance analysis has been carried out for each predictor model, thus finding those features that are most relevant for the given prediction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

As the discrete approximation of data manifold, the graph plays a crucial role in these kinds of learning approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel learning method for graph construction, which is distinct from previous methods in that it solves an optimization problem with the aim of directly preserving the local information of the original data set. We show that the proposed objective has close connections with the popular Laplacian Eigenmap problem, and is hence well justified. The optimization turns out to be a quadratic programming problem with n(n -1)/2 variables (n is the number of data points). Exploiting the sparsity of the graph, we further propose a more efficient cutting plane algorithm to solve the problem, making the method better scalable in practice. In the context of clustering and semi-supervised learning, we demonstrated the advantages of our proposed method by experiments.

Low computational complexity here means not only fast speed but also less energy consumption. The sliding window object detection method with linear support vector machines (SVMs) is a general object detection framework. The computational cost is herein mainly paid in complex feature extraction and innerproduct-based classification. This paper first develops a distributed object detection framework (DOD) by making the best use of spatial-temporal correlation, where the process of feature extraction and classification is distributed in the current frame and several previous frames. In each framework, only subfeature vectors are extracted and the response of partial linear classifier (i.e., subdecision value) is computed. To reduce the dimension of traditional block-based histograms of oriented gradients (BHOG) feature vector, this paper proposes a cell-based HOG (CHOG) algorithm, where the features in one cell are not shared with overlapping blocks.

For example, v-support vector machine (v-SVM) minimizes the conditional value at risk (CVaR) of margin distribution. The measure is popular in finance because of the subadditivity property, but it is very sensitive to a few outliers in the tail of the distribution. We propose a new classification method, extended robust SVM (ER-SVM), which minimizes an intermediate risk measure between the CVaR and value at risk (VaR) by expecting that the resulting model becomes less sensitive than v-SVM to outliers. We can regard ER-SVM as an extension of robust SVM, which uses a truncated hinge loss. Numerical experiments imply the ER-SVM's possibility of achieving a better prediction performance with proper parameter setting.

However, this process requires substantial experience and a thorough knowledge of human anatomy. Therefore it is very challenging for novices and even time consuming for experienced examiners. We proposed a hierarchical, supervised learning framework for automatically detecting the standard plane from consecutive 2-D ultrasound images. We tested this technique by developing a system that localizes the fetal abdominal standard plane from ultrasound video by detecting three key anatomical structures: the stomach bubble, umbilical vein and spine. We first proposed a novel radial component-based model to describe the geometric constraints of these key anatomical structures. We then introduced a novel selective search method which exploits the vessel probability algorithm to produce probable locations for the spine and umbilical vein. Next, using component classifiers trained by random forests, we detected the key anatomical structures at their probable locations within the regions constrained by the radial component-based model. Finally, a second-level classifier combined the results from the component detection to identify an ultrasound image as either a "fetal abdominal standard plane'' or a "non-fetal abdominal standard plane.'' Experimental results on 223 fetal abdomen videos showed that the detection accuracy of our method was as high as 85.6% and significantly outperformed both the full abdomen and the separate anatomy detection methods without geometric constraints. The experimental results demonstrated that our system shows great promise for application to clinical practice. (C) 2014 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

Short Communication: Cheminformatics Analysis to Identify Predictors of Antiviral Drug Penetration into the Female Genital Tract	AIDS RESEARCH AND HUMAN RETROVIRUSES			English	Article							QSAR; DISCOVERY	The exposure of oral antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in the female genital tract (FGT) is variable and almost unpredictable. Identifying an efficient method to find compounds with high tissue penetration would streamline the development of regimens for both HIV preexposure prophylaxis and viral reservoir targeting. Here we describe the cheminformatics investigation of diverse drugs with known FGT penetration using cluster analysis and quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) modeling. A literature search over the 1950-2012 period identified 58 compounds (including 21 ARVs and representing 13 drug classes) associated with their actual concentration data for cervical or vaginal tissue, or cervicovaginal fluid. Cluster analysis revealed significant trends in the penetrative ability for certain chemotypes. QSAR models to predict genital tract concentrations normalized to blood plasma concentrations were developed with two machine learning techniques utilizing drugs' molecular descriptors and pharmacokinetic parameters as inputs. The QSAR model with the highest predictive accuracy had R-test(2)=0.47. High volume of distribution, high MRP1 substrate probability, and low MRP4 substrate probability were associated with FGT concentrations >= 1.5-fold plasma concentrations. However, due to the limited FGT data available, prediction performances of all models were low. Despite this limitation, we were able to support our findings by correctly predicting the penetration class of rilpivirine and dolutegravir. With more data to enrich the models, we believe these methods could potentially enhance the current approach of clinical testing.	[Thompson, Corbin G.; Nicol, Melanie R.; Kashuba, Angela D.

Scalable Nearest Neighbor Algorithms for High Dimensional Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Nearest neighbor search; big data; approximate search; algorithm configuration	SEARCH; TREES; RECOGNITION; OBJECT	For many computer vision and machine learning problems, large training sets are key for good performance. However, the most computationally expensive part of many computer vision and machine learning algorithms consists of finding nearest neighbor matches to high dimensional vectors that represent the training data. We propose new algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor matching and evaluate and compare them with previous algorithms. For matching high dimensional features, we find two algorithms to be the most efficient: the randomized k-d forest and a new algorithm proposed in this paper, the priority search k-means tree. We also propose a new algorithm for matching binary features by searching multiple hierarchical clustering trees and show it outperforms methods typically used in the literature. We show that the optimal nearest neighbor algorithm and its parameters depend on the data set characteristics and describe an automated configuration procedure for finding the best algorithm to search a particular data set. In order to scale to very large data sets that would otherwise not fit in the memory of a single machine, we propose a distributed nearest neighbor matching framework that can be used with any of the algorithms described in the paper. All this research has been released as an open source library called fast library for approximate nearest neighbors (FLANN), which has been incorporated into OpenCV and is now one of the most popular libraries for nearest neighbor matching.

Manifold learning algorithms have recently emerged as alternatives to traditional linear dimension reduction techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel projection method that can be combined with any manifold learning methods to improve their dimension reduction performance when applied to high-dimensional data with a high level of noise. The method first builds a dispersion function that describes the distribution of dispersed manifold where the data lie. It then projects the noisy data onto a region wrapping the true manifold sufficiently close to it by applying a dynamical projection system associated with the constructed dispersion function. The effectiveness of the proposed projection method is validated by applying it to some real-world data sets with promising results.

Probability Models for Open Set Recognition	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Machine learning; support vector machines; open set recognition; statistical extreme value theory	CLASSIFICATION; MACHINES; SUPPORT	Real-world tasks in computer vision often touch upon open set recognition: multi-class recognition with incomplete knowledge of the world and many unknown inputs. Recent work on this problem has proposed a model incorporating an open space risk term to account for the space beyond the reasonable support of known classes. This paper extends the general idea of open space risk limiting classification to accommodate non-linear classifiers in a multi-class setting. We introduce a new open set recognition model called compact abating probability (CAP), where the probability of class membership decreases in value (abates) as points move from known data toward open space. We show that CAP models improve open set recognition for multiple algorithms. Leveraging the CAP formulation, we go on to describe the novel Weibull-calibrated SVM (W-SVM) algorithm, which combines the useful properties of statistical extreme value theory for score calibration with one-class and binary support vector machines. Our experiments show that the W-SVM is significantly better for open set object detection and OCR problems when compared to the state-of-the-art for the same tasks.

Therefore, service-specific groups of related software classes called modules arise in OO systems. Extracting the modules is critical for better software comprehension, efficient architecture recovery, determination of service candidates to migrate legacy software to a service-oriented architecture, and transportation of such services to cloud-based distributed systems. In this study, we propose a novel approach to automatic module extraction to identify services in OO software systems. In our approach, first we create a weighted and directed graph of the software system in which vertices and edges represent the classes and their relations, respectively. Then, we apply a clustering algorithm over the graph to extract the modules. We calculate the weight of an edge by considering its probability of being within a module or between modules. To estimate these positional probabilities, we propose a machine-learning-based classification system that we train with data gathered from a real-world OO reference system. We have implemented an automatic module extraction tool and evaluated the proposed approach on several open-source and industrial projects. The experimental results show that the proposed approach generates highly accurate decompositions that are close to authoritative module structures and outperforms existing methods.

In order to make full use of the data, an online platform for ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) using publicly accessible databases has been developed. LBVS adopts Bayesian learning approach to create virtual screening models because of its noise tolerance, speed, and efficiency in extracting knowledge from data. LBVS currently includes data derived from BindingDB and ChEMBL. Three validation approaches have been employed to evaluate the virtual screening models created from LBVS. The tenfold cross validation results of twenty different LBVS models demonstrate that LBVS achieves an average AUC value of 0.86.

Predictive models can be used to pursue both regulatory and chemical design (green chemistry) objectives, which are most effectively met when models are easy to use and available free of charge. The objective of this work was to evaluate no-cost estimation programs with respect to prediction of ready biodegradability. Fragrance materials, which are structurally diverse and have significant exposure potential, were used for this purpose. Using a database of 222 fragrance compounds with measured ready biodegradability, 10 models were compared on the basis of overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), a measure of quality for binary classification. The 10 models were VEGA(C) Non-Interactive Client, START (Toxtree(C)), Biowin(C)1-6, and two models based on inductive machine learning. Applicability domain (AD) was also considered. Overall accuracy was ca. 70% and varied little over all models, but sensitivity, specificity and MCC showed wider variation. Based on MCC, the best models for fragrance compounds were Biowin6, VEGA and Biowin3. VEGA performance was slightly better for the <50% of the compounds it identified as having "high reliability" predictions (AD index >0.8). However, removing compounds with one and only one quaternary carbon yielded similar improvement in predictivity for VEGA, START, and Biowin3/6, with a smaller penalty in reduced coverage. Of the nine compounds for which the eight models (VEGA, START, Biowin1-6) all disagreed with the measured value, measured analog data were available for seven, and all supported the predicted value. VEGA, Biowin3 and Biowin6 are judged suitable for ready biodegradability screening of fragrance compounds. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The proposed method is based on a combination of link prediction and machine learning techniques. First, a weighted co-authorship network is constructed. We calculate scores for each node pair according to different measures called predictors. The resulting scores can be interpreted as indicative of the likelihood of future linkage for the given node pair. To determine the relative merit of each predictor, we train a random forest classifier on older data. The same classifier can then generate predictions for newer data. The top predictions are treated as recommendations for future collaboration. We apply the technique to research collaborations between cities in Africa, the Middle East and South-Asia, focusing on the topics of malaria and tuberculosis. Results show that the method yields accurate recommendations. Moreover, the method can be used to determine the relative strengths of each predictor.

To investigate the use of machine learning to empirically determine the risk of individual surgical procedures and to improve surgical models with this information. Methods. American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) data from 2005 to 2009 were used to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to learn the relationship between textual constructs in current procedural terminology (CPT) descriptions and mortality, morbidity, Clavien 4 complications, and surgical-site infections (SSI) within 30 days of surgery. The procedural risk scores produced by the SVM classifiers were validated on data from 2010 in univariate and multivariate analyses. Results. The procedural risk scores produced by the SVM classifiers achieved moderate-to-high levels of discrimination in univariate analyses (area under receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.871 for mortality, 0.789 for morbidity, 0.791 for SSI, 0.845 for Clavien 4 complications). Addition of these scores also substantially improved multivariate models comprising patient factors and previously proposed correlates of procedural risk (net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement: 0.54 and 0.001 for mortality, 0.46 and 0.011 for morbidity, 0.68 and 0.022 for SSI, 0.44 and 0.001 for Clavien 4 complications; P < .05 for all comparisons). Similar improvements were noted in discrimination and calibration for other statistical measures, and in subcohorts comprising patients with general or vascular surgery. Conclusion. Machine learning provides clinically useful estimates of surgical risk for individual procedures. This information can be measured in an entirely data-driven manner and substantially improves multifactorial models to predict postoperative complications.

Computer vision and driver distraction: Developing a behaviour-flagging protocol for naturalistic driving data	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Naturalistic driving; Driver distraction; Observational study; Computer vision; Video processing; Machine learning	RISK; ROAD	Naturalistic driving studies (NDS) allow researchers to discreetly observe everyday, real-world driving to better understand the risk factors that contribute to hazardous situations. In particular, NDS designs provide high ecological validity in the study of driver distraction. With increasing dataset sizes, current best practice of manually reviewing videos to classify the occurrence of driving behaviours, including those that are indicative of distraction, is becoming increasingly impractical. Current statistical solutions underutilise available data and create further epistemic problems. Similarly, technical solutions such as eye-tracking often require dedicated hardware that is not readily accessible or feasible to use. A computer vision solution based on open-source software was developed and tested to improve the accuracy and speed of processing NDS video data for the purpose of quantifying the occurrence of driver distraction. Using classifier cascades, manually-reviewed video data from a previously published NDS was reanalysed and used as a benchmark of current best practice for performance comparison. Two software coding systems were developed - one based on hierarchical clustering (HC), and one based on gender differences (MF). Compared to manual video coding, HC achieved 86 percent concordance, 55 percent reduction in processing time, and classified an additional 69 percent of target behaviour not previously identified through manual review. MF achieved 67 percent concordance, a 75 percent reduction in processing time, and classified an additional 35 percent of target behaviour not identified through manual review. The findings highlight the improvements in processing speed and correctly classifying target behaviours achievable through the use of custom developed computer vision solutions. Suggestions for improved system performance and wider implementation are discussed. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bot, RI; Heinrich, A				Bot, Radu Ioan; Heinrich, Andre			Regression tasks in machine learning via Fenchel duality	ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article						Machine learning; Tikhonov regularization; Conjugate duality; Support vector regression		Supervised learning methods are powerful techniques to learn a function from a given set of labeled data, the so-called training data. In this paper the support vector machines approach for regression is investigated under a theoretical point of view that makes use of convex analysis and Fenchel duality. Starting with the corresponding Tikhonov regularization problem, reformulated as a convex optimization problem, we introduce a conjugate dual problem to it and prove that, whenever strong duality holds, the function to be learned can be expressed via the optimal solutions of the dual problem. Corresponding dual problems are then derived for different loss functions. The theoretical results are applied by numerically solving the regression task for two data sets and the accuracy of the regression when choosing different loss functions is investigated.

J	Jeon, JS; Shafieezadeh, A; DesRoches, R				Jeon, Jong-Su; Shafieezadeh, Abdollah; DesRoches, Reginald			Statistical models for shear strength of RC beam-column joints using machine-learning techniques	EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING & STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS			English	Article						joint shear strength; multivariate adaptive regression splines; symbolic regression; reinforced and unreinforced joint database; machine-learning methods	SEISMIC RESISTANCE; CONCRETE FRAMES; BEHAVIOR; CONNECTIONS	This paper proposes a new set of probabilistic joint shear strength models using the conventional multiple linear regression method, and advanced machine-learning methods of multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and symbolic regression (SR). In order to achieve high-fidelity regression models with reduced model errors and bias, this study constructs extensive experimental databases for reinforced and unreinforced concrete joints by collecting existing beam-column joint subassemblage tests from multiple sources. Various influential parameters that affect joint shear strength such as material properties, design parameters, and joint configuration are investigated through tests of statistical significance. After performing a set of regression analyses, the comparison of simulation results indicates that MARS approach is the best estimation method. Moreover, the accuracy of analytical predictions of the derived MARS model is compared with that of existing joint shear strength relationships. The comparison results show that the proposed model is more accurate compared to existing relationships. This joint shear strength prediction model can be readily implemented into joint response models for evaluation of earthquake performance and inelastic responses of building frames.
