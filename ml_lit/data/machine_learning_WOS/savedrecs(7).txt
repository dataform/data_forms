This potentially leads to erroneous conflation of model explanatory and predictive power, to predictive models that lack ecological interpretability, or to limited feedback between predictive modelling and theory development. These are fundamental challenges to appropriate statistical and scientific use of ecological models. To help address such challenges, we propose a novel, integrated modelling framework which couples explanatory modelling for causal understanding and input variable selection with a machine learning approach for empirical prediction. Exemplar datasets from the field of freshwater ecology are used to develop and evaluate the framework, based on 267 stream and river monitoring stations across England, UK. These data describe spatial patterns in benthic macro-invertebrate community indices that are hypothesised to be driven by meso-scale physical and chemical habitat conditions. Whilst explanatory models developed using structural equation modelling performed strongly (r(2) for two macroinvertebrate indices = 0.64-0.70), predictive models based on extremely randomised trees demonstrated moderate performance (r(2) for the same indices = 0.50-0.61). However, through coupling explanatory and predictive components, our proposed framework yields ecologically-interpretable predictive models which also maintain the parsimony and accuracy of models based on solely predictive approaches. This significantly enhances the opportunity for feedback among causal theory, empirical data and prediction within environmental modelling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Generalizing the use of geographical weights in biodiversity modelling	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Biodiversity; macroecological modelling; method; non-stationarity; prediction; spatial scale; species distribution modelling	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; RICHNESS PATTERNS; NON-STATIONARITY; SCALE; ECOLOGY; REGRESSION; DISTRIBUTIONS; DIVERSITY; SELECTION; FISH	AimDetermining how ecological processes vary across space is a major focus in ecology. Current methods that investigate such effects remain constrained by important limiting assumptions. Here we provide an extension to geographically weighted regression in which local regression and spatial weighting are used in combination. This method can be used to investigate non-stationarity and spatial-scale effects using any regression technique that can accommodate uneven weighting of observations, including machine learning. InnovationWe extend the use of spatial weights to generalized linear models and boosted regression trees by using simulated data for which the results are known, and compare these local approaches with existing alternatives such as geographically weighted regression (GWR). The spatial weighting procedure (1) explained up to 80% deviance in simulated species richness, (2) optimized the normal distribution of model residuals when applied to generalized linear models versus GWR, and (3) detected nonlinear relationships and interactions between response variables and their predictors when applied to boosted regression trees. Predictor ranking changed with spatial scale, highlighting the scales at which different species-environment relationships need to be considered. Main conclusionsGWR is useful for investigating spatially varying species-environment relationships. However, the use of local weights implemented in alternative modelling techniques can help detect nonlinear relationships and high-order interactions that were previously unassessed. Therefore, this method not only informs us how location and scale influence our perception of patterns and processes, it also offers a way to deal with different ecological interpretations that can emerge as different areas of spatial influence are considered during model fitting.

J	Wang, J; Ren, FJ; Li, L				Wang, Jun; Ren, Fuji; Li, Lei			Recognizing Sentiment of Relations between Entities in Text	IEEJ TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						sentiment recognition; machine learning; syntactic dependency tree	NETWORK; CONFLICT	Recently, sentiment analysis for identifying positive or negative opinions from texts has received much attention. In this paper, we introduce sentiment analysis into a new field, which recognizes sentiment of relations between entities in the text. Three sentiment polarities between entities are recognized, namely positive, negative, and neutral. The difficulty in this work is that several pairs of entities may appear in the same sentence, and their sentiment polarities are determined by different related regions of the sentence. In addition, different features of words and their interactions in a related region will affect the final sentiment. It is difficult to process this using rigid rule-based methods. Therefore, we propose a machine-learning method based on statistics. In the proposed method, the model of conditional random fields (CRFs) is used to annotate the sentiment polarity between entities with the help of the syntactic dependency tree. The string of words that connects two entities in the dependency tree is used as the related region to recognize the sentiment. Experimental results and comparison with the other methods based on different principles and related regions suggest that the proposed method shows better performance and proves its validity. Moreover, the effect of different features on the CRF is word of the ith word in the sentence. We can get a CRF model using the CRF++ tool based on feature template and training corpus. After obtaining the model, sentiment of relations could be assigned automatically. The algorithm is shown in Fig. 2. (c) 2014 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Although its performance is better than traditional support vector machine (SVM), the kernel selection problem still affects the performance of TWSVM directly. Wavelet analysis has the characteristics of multivariate interpolation and sparse change, and it is suitable for the analysis of local signals and the detection of transient signals. The wavelet kernel function based on wavelet analysis can approximate any nonlinear functions. Based on the wavelet kernel features and the kernel function selection problem, wavelet twin support vector machine (WTWSVM) is proposed by this paper. It introduces the wavelet kernel function into TWSVM to make the combination of wavelet analysis techniques and TWSVM come true. The experimental results indicate that WTWSVM is feasible, and it improves the classification accuracy and generalization ability of TWSVM significantly.

In this paper, we design a new classification algorithm to solve the PU problem: biased twin support vector machine (B-TWSVM). In B-TWSVM, two nonparallel hyperplanes are constructed such that the positive examples can be classified correctly, and the number of unlabeled examples classified as positive is minimized. Moreover, considering that the unlabeled set also contains positive data, different penalty parameters for positive and negative data are allowed in B-TWSVM. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in most cases.

Pre-eminence of Combined Web Pre-fetching and Web Caching Based on Machine Learning Technique	ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Cache; Classification; Support; Confidence; Hit ratio; Byte machine learning	NEURAL-NETWORK; SCHEME	It is always wise to keep the frequently used information by various users in the cache memory. This makes the users feel that their needed information is available almost immediately. Apart from experiencing less access delay, caching process also helps in better bandwidth utilization and load reduction in the origin server. Pre-fetching is the process of fetching few of the Web pages in advance by assuming that those pages will be needed by the user in the near future. Combining pre-fetching and caching techniques results in experiencing much less access delay and much better bandwidth utilization. Many works have been reported in the literature, separately for Web caching techniques and pre-fetching of Web pages. In this paper, pre-fetching technique that uses clustering is combined with SVM (support vector machine)-LRU algorithm, a machine learning method for Web proxy caching. By using real-time data, it is demonstrated that the latter approach will be advantageous than clustering-based pre-fetching technique using traditional LRU-based caching policy. The efficiency of our proposed method is also compared with caching using Bayesian networks and neuro-fuzzy system.	[Baskaran, K.

Gout flares are not well documented by diagnosis codes, making it difficult to conduct accurate database studies. We implemented a computer-based method to automatically identify gout flares using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) from electronic clinical notes. Methods. Of 16,519 patients, 1,264 and 1,192 clinical notes from 2 separate sets of 100 patients were selected as the training and evaluation data sets, respectively, which were reviewed by rheumatologists. We created separate NLP searches to capture different aspects of gout flares. For each note, the NLP search outputs became the ML system inputs, which provided the final classification decisions. The note-level classifications were grouped into patient-level gout flares. Our NLP+ML results were validated using a gold standard data set and compared with the claims-based method used by prior literatures. Results. For 16,519 patients with a diagnosis of gout and a prescription for a urate-lowering therapy, we identified 18,869 clinical notes as gout flare positive (sensitivity 82.1%, specificity 91.5%): 1,402 patients with >= 3 flares (sensitivity 93.5%, specificity 84.6%), 5,954 with 1 or 2 flares, and 9,163 with no flare (sensitivity 98.5%, specificity 96.4%). Our method identified more flare cases (18,869 versus 7,861) and patients with >= 3 flares (1,402 versus 516) when compared to the claims-based method. Conclusion. We developed a computer-based method (NLP and ML) to identify gout flares from the clinical notes. Our method was validated as an accurate tool for identifying gout flares with higher sensitivity and specificity compared to previous studies.

Many sophisticated algorithms have been proposed in the statistics and machine learning literature, but in practice simpler algorithms are often used. However, few simple algorithms have been formally described or systematically investigated. Results: We give a precise definition of a popular simple method we refer to as mas-o-menos, which calculates prognostic scores for discrimination by summing standardized predictors, weighted by the signs of their marginal associations with the outcome. We study its behavior theoretically, in simulations and in an extensive analysis of 27 independent gene expression studies of bladder, breast and ovarian cancer, altogether totaling 3833 patients with survival outcomes. We find that despite its simplicity, mas-o-menos can achieve good discrimination performance. It performs no worse, and sometimes better, than popular and much more CPU-intensive methods for discrimination, including lasso and ridge regression.

Prediction of pediatric bipolar disorder using neuroanatomical signatures of the amygdala	BIPOLAR DISORDERS			English	Article						amygdala; machine learning; multivariate pattern analysis; neuroimaging; pediatric bipolar disorder	GRAY-MATTER VOLUME; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; MOOD DISORDERS; NEUROBIOLOGICAL MARKERS; THALAMIC VOLUMES; NEUTRAL FACES; YOUNG-ADULTS; ADOLESCENTS; ABNORMALITIES	ObjectivesPediatric bipolar disorder is currently diagnosed based on signs and symptoms, and without objective diagnostic biomarkers. In the present study, we investigated the utility of structural neuroanatomical signatures of the amygdala to objectively differentiate individual subjects with pediatric bipolar disorder from matched healthy controls. MethodsStructural T-1-weighted neuroimaging scans were obtained from 16 children and adolescents with unmedicated DSM-IV bipolar disorder (11 males, five females) and 16 matched healthy controls (11 males, five females). Voxel-based gray matter morphometric features extracted from a bilateral region-of-interest within the amygdala were used to develop a multivariate pattern analysis model which was utilized in predicting novel or unseen' individual subjects as either bipolar disorder or healthy controls. ResultsThe model assigned 25 out of 32 subjects the correct label (bipolar disorder/healthy) translating to a 78.12% diagnostic accuracy, 81.25% sensitivity, 75.00% specificity, 76.47% positive predictive value, and 80.00% negative predictive value and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.81. The predictions were significant at p=0.0014 ((2) test p-value). ConclusionsThese results reaffirm previous reports on the existence of neuroanatomical abnormalities in the amygdala of pediatric patients with bipolar disorder. Remarkably, the present study also demonstrates that neuroanatomical signatures of the amygdala can predict individual subjects with bipolar disorder with a relatively high specificity and sensitivity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to present a proof-of-concept diagnostic marker of pediatric bipolar disorder based on structural neuroimaging scans of largely medication-naive patients.

J	Wang, K; Huang, Z; Zhong, ZH				Wang Ke; Huang Zhi; Zhong Zhihua			Simultaneous Multi-vehicle Detection and Tracking Framework with Pavement Constraints Based on Machine Learning and Particle Filter Algorithm	CHINESE JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						simultaneous detection and tracking; pavement segmentation; layered machine learning; particle filter	LOCAL BINARY PATTERNS; VEHICLE DETECTION; FEATURES; RECOGNITION	Due to the large variations of environment with ever-changing background and vehicles with different shapes, colors and appearances, to implement a real-time on-board vehicle recognition system with high adaptability, efficiency and robustness in complicated environments, remains challenging. This paper introduces a simultaneous detection and tracking framework for robust on-board vehicle recognition based on monocular vision technology. The framework utilizes a novel layered machine learning and particle filter to build a multi-vehicle detection and tracking system. In the vehicle detection stage, a layered machine learning method is presented, which combines coarse-search and fine-search to obtain the target using the AdaBoost-based training algorithm. The pavement segmentation method based on characteristic similarity is proposed to estimate the most likely pavement area. Efficiency and accuracy are enhanced by restricting vehicle detection within the downsized area of pavement. In vehicle tracking stage, a multi-objective tracking algorithm based on target state management and particle filter is proposed. The proposed system is evaluated by roadway video captured in a variety of traffics, illumination, and weather conditions. The evaluating results show that, under conditions of proper illumination and clear vehicle appearance, the proposed system achieves 91.2% detection rate and 2.6% false detection rate. Experiments compared to typical algorithms show that, the presented algorithm reduces the false detection rate nearly by half at the cost of decreasing 2.7%-8.6% detection rate. This paper proposes a multi-vehicle detection and tracking system, Which is promising for implementation in an on-board vehicle recognition system with high precision, strong robustness and low computational cost.

J	Dowlatshahi, MB; Nezamabadi-pour, H				Dowlatshahi, Mohammad Bagher; Nezamabadi-pour, Hossein			GGSA: A Grouping Gravitational Search Algorithm for data clustering	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Gravitational Search Algorithm; Grouping encoding; Data clustering; Nature-inspired algorithm; Swarm Intelligence	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; K-MEANS; CLASSIFICATION; FILTER	Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) is a stochastic population-based metaheuristic designed for solving continuous optimization problems. It has a flexible and well-balanced mechanism for enhancing exploration and exploitation abilities. In this paper, we adapt the structure of GSA for solving the data clustering problem, the problem of grouping data into clusters such that the data in each cluster share a high degree of similarity while being very dissimilar to data from other clusters. The proposed algorithm, which is called Grouping GSA (GGSA), differs from the standard GSA in two important aspects. First, a special encoding scheme, called grouping encoding, is used in order to make the relevant structures of clustering problems become parts of solutions. Second, given the encoding, special GSA updating equations suitable for the solutions with grouping encoding are used. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through several benchmark datasets from the well-known UCI Machine Learning Repository. Its performance is compared with the standard GSA, the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), the Firefly Algorithm (FA), and nine other well-known classical classification techniques from the literature. The simulation results indicate that GGSA can effectively be used for multivariate data clustering. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The system was based on microwave scattering measurements with an antenna system worn on the head. Measurement data were analyzed with a machine-learning algorithm that is based on training using data from patients with a known condition. Computer tomography images were used as reference. The detection methodology was evaluated with the leave-one-out validation method combined with a Monte Carlo-based bootstrap step. The clinical motivation for this project is that ischemic stroke patients may receive acute thrombolytic treatment at hospitals, dramatically reducing or abolishing symptoms. A microwave system is suitable for prehospital use, and therefore has the potential to allow significantly earlier diagnosis and treatment than today.

J	Cecotti, H; Eckstein, MP; Giesbrecht, B				Cecotti, Hubert; Eckstein, Miguel P.; Giesbrecht, Barry			Single-Trial Classification of Event-Related Potentials in Rapid Serial Visual Presentation Tasks Using Supervised Spatial Filtering	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); common spatial patterns (CSP); convolution; electroencephalogram (EEG); neural networks; rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP); spatial filters	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; P300 AMPLITUDE; IMAGE SEARCH; EEG; MODEL; TIME; RECOGNITION; RESPONSES; VISION; BCI	Accurate detection of single-trial event-related potentials (ERPs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) is a difficult problem that requires efficient signal processing and machine learning techniques. Supervised spatial filtering methods that enhance the discriminative information in EEG data are commonly used to improve single-trial ERP detection. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a layer dedicated to spatial filtering for the detection of ERPs and with training based on the maximization of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The CNN is compared with three common classifiers: 1) Bayesian linear discriminant analysis; 2) multilayer perceptron (MLP); and 3) support vector machines. Prior to classification, the data were spatially filtered with xDAWN (for the maximization of the signal-to-signal-plus-noise ratio), common spatial pattern, or not spatially filtered. The 12 analytical techniques were tested on EEG data recorded in three rapid serial visual presentation experiments that required the observer to discriminate rare target stimuli from frequent nontarget stimuli. Classification performance discriminating targets from nontargets depended on both the spatial filtering method and the classifier. In addition, the nonlinear classifier MLP outperformed the linear methods. Finally, training based AUC maximization provided better performance than training based on the minimization of the mean square error. The results support the conclusion that the choice of the systems architecture is critical and both spatial filtering and classification must be considered together.

Cogency is only computed based on pairwise item conditional probability, so the proposed algorithm mines association rules by only one pass through the file. The proposed algorithm is also more efficient for dealing with infrequent items due to its cogency-inspired approach. The problem of associative classification is used here for evaluating the proposed algorithm. We evaluate CARM over both synthetic and real benchmark data sets obtained from the UC Irvine machine learning repository. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is consistently faster due to its one time file access and consumes less memory space than the Conditional Frequent Patterns growth algorithm. In addition, statistical analysis reveals the superiority of the approach for classifying minority classes in unbalanced data sets.

Internet Traffic Classification Using Constrained Clustering	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Algorithms; clustering; machine learning; traffic analysis; network security		Statistics-based Internet traffic classification using machine learning techniques has attracted extensive research interest lately, because of the increasing ineffectiveness of traditional port-based and payload-based approaches. In particular, unsupervised learning, that is, traffic clustering, is very important in real-life applications, where labeled training data are difficult to obtain and new patterns keep emerging. Although previous studies have applied some classic clustering algorithms such as K-Means and EM for the task, the quality of resultant traffic clusters was far from satisfactory. In order to improve the accuracy of traffic clustering, we propose a constrained clustering scheme that makes decisions with consideration of some background information in addition to the observed traffic statistics. Specifically, we make use of equivalence set constraints indicating that particular sets of flows are using the same application layer protocols, which can be efficiently inferred from packet headers according to the background knowledge of TCP/IP networking. We model the observed data and constraints using Gaussian mixture density and adapt an approximate algorithm for the maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters. Moreover, we study the effects of unsupervised feature discretization on traffic clustering by using a fundamental binning method. A number of real-world Internet traffic traces have been used in our evaluation, and the results show that the proposed approach not only improves the quality of traffic clusters in terms of overall accuracy and per-class metrics, but also speeds up the convergence.

In this paper we describe our approach to this task, which integrates computer vision, machine listening, and machine learning. At the low level processing, we improve upon our previously proposed state-of-the-art tennis ball tracking algorithm and employ audio signal processing techniques to detect key events and construct features for classifying the events. At high level analysis, we model event classification as a sequence labelling problem, and investigate four machine learning techniques using simulated event sequences. Finally, we evaluate our proposed approach on three real world tennis games, and discuss the interplay between audio, vision and learning. To the best of our knowledge, our system is the only one that can annotate tennis game at such a detailed level. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the availability of sequence and structure data has now made it possible to develop approaches to design pharmacological agents that can discriminate successfully between their related binding sites. In this study, we have quantified the relationship between 12 625 distinct protease inhibitors and their bioactivity against 67 targets of the serine protease family (20 213 data points) in an integrative manner, using proteochemometric modelling (PCM). The benchmarking of 21 different target descriptors motivated the usage of specific binding pocket amino acid descriptors, which helped in the identification of active site residues and selective compound chemotypes affecting compound affinity and selectivity. PCM models performed better than alternative approaches (models trained using exclusively compound descriptors on all available data, QSAR) employed for comparison with R2/RMSE values of 0.64 +/- 0.23/ 0.66 +/- 0.20 vs. 0.35 +/- 0.27/1.05 +/- 0.27 log units, respectively. Moreover, the interpretation of the PCM model singled out various chemical substructures responsible for bioactivity and selectivity towards. particular proteases (thrombin, trypsin and coagulation factor 10) in agreement with the literature. For instance, absence of a tertiary sulphonamide was identified to be responsible for decreased selective activity (by on average 0.27 +/- 0.65 pChEMBL units) on FA10. Among the binding pocket residues, the amino acids (arginine, leucine and tyrosine) at positions 35, 39, 60, 93, 140 and 207 were observed as key contributing residues for selective affinity on these three targets.

A parametric model for classifying land cover and evaluating training data based on multi-temporal remote sensing data	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Maximum likelihood estimation; Image classification	TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; MODIS DATA; CLIMATE; AVHRR; VEGETATION; ALGORITHM; EXCHANGE; BALANCE; CAP	Time series of multispectral images are widely used to monitor and map land cover. However, high dimensionality and missing data present significant challenges for classification algorithms that use multi-temporal remotely sensed data. Further, generation and assessment of high quality training data, including detection of outliers and changed pixels in training data, is difficult. In this paper we present a new statistical framework that is based on a parametric model that enables a targeted principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of multi-temporal remote sensing data. In doing so, the model provides a novel basis for land cover classification and evaluating the nature and quality of training data used for supervised classifications. The methodology we describe uses a Kronecker operator to reduce the spectral dimensionality of multi-temporal images while preserving their temporal structure, thereby providing low-dimensional data that is well-suited for classification and outlier detection problems. As part of our framework, we use an expectation-maximization method to impute missing data, and propose new metrics that characterize the representativeness and pixel-to-pixel homogeneity of training sites used for supervised classification. To evaluate our approach, we use data from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and extracted more than 200 training sites where the land cover has been characterized from high spatial resolution imagery. The original input data was composed of 196 features (28 dates x 7 bands), and the PCA-based approach we describe captured 91% of the variance, in these 7 bands, in 3 components. Results from maximum likelihood classification show that the retained principal components successfully distinguish land cover classes from one another, with classification results that were comparable to supervised machine learning methods applied to the original MODIS data. Analysis of our site composition metrics show that they successfully characterize the homogeneity (or lack thereof) and representativeness of individual pixels and entire sites relative to other training sites in the same class.

LIDAR is one of the fastest growing technologies to support a multitude of civil engineering applications, such as transportation, urban planning, flood control, and city 3D reconstruction. For the above applications, LIDAR data need to be classified into binary classes (i.e., terrain and nonterrain) or multiple classes (e. g., ground, vegetation, and buildings). The proposed framework is designed to enhance the generalization performance of binary classification approach by minimizing type II errors. The authors developed and tested the framework on different LIDAR data sets representing geographic sites in Germany and the United States. The results showed that the proposed ensemble framework performed better compared to the existing methods. In addition, the AdaBoost method outperformed the Bagging method on all the terrain types. However, the framework has some limitations in terms of dealing with rough terrain and discontinuous surfaces.

Ex vivo organotypic slice cultures may offer an opportunity to investigate some aspects of spontaneous activity, because they self-restore their networks that collapsed during slicing procedures. In hippocampal networks, we compared the levels and patterns of in vivo spontaneous activity to those in acute and cultured slices. We found that the firing rates and excitatory synaptic activity in the in vivo hippocampus are more similar to those in slice cultures compared to acute slices. The soft confidence-weighted algorithm, a machine learning technique without human bias, also revealed that hippocampal slice cultures resemble the in vivo hippocampus in terms of the overall tendency of the parameters of spontaneous activity.

We employ a manual human-coding approach to classify book reviews in the field of history based on reviewers' assessments of a book author's scholarly credibility (SC) and writing style (WS). In total, 100 book reviews were selected from the American Historical Review and coded for their positive/negative valence on these two dimensions. Most were coded as positive (68% for SC and 47% for WS), and there was also a small positive correlation between SC and WS (r=0.2). We then constructed a classifier, combining both manual design and machine learning, to categorize sentiment-based sentences in history book reviews. The machine classifier produced a matched accuracy (matched to the human coding) of approximately 75% for SC and 64% for WS. WS was found to be more difficult to classify by machine than SC because of the reviewers' use of more subtle language. With further training data, a machine-learning approach could be useful for automatically classifying a large number of history book reviews at once. Weighted megacitations can be especially valuable if they are used in conjunction with regular book/journal citations, and libcitations (i.e., library holding counts) for a comprehensive assessment of a book/monograph's scholarly impact.

The task can be described as: user-dependent, small vocabulary, fixed camera, one-shot-learning. The data include 54,000 hand and arm gestures recorded with an RGB-D camera. The data are organized into batches of 100 gestures pertaining to a small gesture vocabulary of 8-12 gestures, recorded by the same user. Short continuous sequences of 1-5 randomly selected gestures are recorded. We provide man-made annotations (temporal segmentation into individual gestures, alignment of RGB and depth images, and body part location) and a library of function to preprocess and automatically annotate data. We also provide a subset of batches in which the user's horizontal position is randomly shifted or scaled. We report on the results of the challenge and distribute sample code to facilitate developing new solutions. The data, datacollection software and the gesture vocabularies are downloadable from http://gesture.chalearn.org.

Meningiomas are the tumors of brain and spinal cord. They account for 20% of all the brain tumors. Meningioma subtype classification involves the classification of benign meningioma into four major subtypes: meningothelial, fibroblastic, transitional, and psammomatous. Under the microscope, the histology images of these four subtypes show a variety of textural and structural characteristics. High intraclass and low interclass variabilities in meningioma subtypes make it an extremely complex classification problem. A number of techniques have been proposed for meningioma subtype classification with varying performances on different subtypes. Most of these techniques employed wavelet packet transforms for textural features extraction and analysis of meningioma histology images. In this article, a hybrid classification technique based on texture and shape characteristics is proposed for the classification of meningioma subtypes. Meningothelial and fibroblastic subtypes are classified on the basis of nuclei shapes while grey-level co-occurrence matrix textural features are used to train a multilayer perceptron for the classification of transitional and psammomatous subtypes. On the whole, average classification accuracy of 92.50% is achieved through the proposed hybrid classifier; which to the best of our knowledge is the highest. Microsc. Res. Tech. 77:862-873, 2014.

For example, to characterize a natural scene image, it is essential to extract a set of visual features representing its color, texture, and shape information. However, integrating multimodal features for recognition is challenging because: (1) each feature has its specific statistical property and physical interpretation, (2) huge number of features may result in the curse of dimensionality (When data dimension is high, the distances between pairwise objects in the feature space become increasingly similar due to the central limit theory. This phenomenon influences negatively to the recognition performance), and (3) some features may be unavailable. To solve these problems, a new multimodal feature selection algorithm, termed Grassmann manifold feature selection (GMFS), is proposed. In particular, by defining a clustering criterion, the multimodal features are transformed into a matrix, and further treated as a point on the Grassmann manifold in Hamm and Lee (Grassmann discriminant analysis: a unifying view on subspace-based learning. In: Proceedings of the 25th international conference on machine learning (ICML), pp. 376-383, Helsinki, Finland [2008]). To deal with the unavailable features, L2-Hausdorff distance, a metric between different-sized matrices, is computed and the kernel is obtained accordingly. Based on the kernel, we propose supervised/unsupervised feature selection algorithms to achieve a physically meaningful embedding of the multimodal features. Experimental results on eight data sets validate the effectiveness the proposed approach.

So far, research on this problem or problems alike has proposed a wide verity of techniques and algorithms for both information representation and classification. Very recently, Farajzadeh et al. in Int J Pattern Recognit Artif Intell 25(8):1219-1241, (2011) proposed a novel information representation approach that uses machine-learning techniques to derive a set of new informative and descriptive features from the original features. The new features, so called meta probability codes (MPC), have shown a good performance in a wide range of domains. In this paper, we aim to study the performance of the MPC features for the recognition of facial expression via proposing an MPC-based framework. In the proposed framework any feature extractor and classifier can be incorporated using the meta-feature generation mechanism. In the experimental studies, we use four state-of-the-art information representation techniques; local binary pattern, Gabor-wavelet, Zernike moment and facial fiducial point, as the original feature extractors; and four multiclass classifiers, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, radial basis function neural network, and sparse representation-based classifier. The results of the extensive experiments conducted on three facial expression datasets, Cohn-Kanade, JAFFE, and TFEID, show that the MPC features promote the performance of facial expression recognition inherently.

Although there has been much research into small infrared target detection methods, we cannot apply them in real field situations due to the high false alarm rate caused by clutter. This paper presents a novel target attribute extraction and machine learning-based target discrimination method. In our study, eight target features were extracted and analyzed statistically. Learning-based classifiers, such as SVM and Adaboost, have been incorporated and then compared to conventional classifiers using real infrared images. In addition, the generalization capability has also been inspected for various types of infrared clutter.

However, validated algorithms for predicting activity type from wrist-worn accelerometer data are lacking. This study compared the activity recognition rates of an activity classifier trained on acceleration signal collected on the wrist and hip. Methodology: 52 children and adolescents (mean age 13.7 +/- 3.1 year) completed 12 activity trials that were categorized into 7 activity classes: lying down, sitting, standing, walking, running, basketball, and dancing. During each trial, participants wore an ActiGraph GT3X+ tri-axial accelerometer on the right hip and the non-dominant wrist. Features were extracted from 10-s windows and inputted into a regularized logistic regression model using R (Glmnet + L1). Results: Classification accuracy for the hip and wrist was 91.0% +/- 3.1% and 88.4% +/- 3.0%, respectively. The hip model exhibited excellent classification accuracy for sitting (91.3%), standing (95.8%), walking (95.8%), and running (96.8%); acceptable classification accuracy for lying down (88.3%) and basketball (81.9%); and modest accuracy for dance (64.1%). The wrist model exhibited excellent classification accuracy for sitting (93.0%), standing (91.7%), and walking (95.8%); acceptable classification accuracy for basketball (86.0%); and modest accuracy for running (78.8%), lying down (74.6%) and dance (69.4%). Potential Impact: Both the hip and wrist algorithms achieved acceptable classification accuracy, allowing researchers to use either placement for activity recognition.

In this study we compare accelerometers worn on the wrist and hip, and the added value of heart rate (HR) data, for predicting PA type and EE using machine learning. Forty adults performed locomotion and household activities in a lab setting while wearing three ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers (left hip, right hip, non-dominant wrist) and a HR monitor (Polar RS400). Participants also wore a portable indirect calorimeter (COSMED K4b2), from which EE and metabolic equivalents (METs) were computed for each minute. We developed two predictive models: a random forest classifier to predict activity type and a random forest of regression trees to estimate METs. Predictions were evaluated using leave-one-user-out cross-validation. The hip accelerometer obtained an average accuracy of 92.3% in predicting four activity types (household, stairs, walking, running), while the wrist accelerometer obtained an average accuracy of 87.5%. Across all 8 activities combined (laundry, window washing, dusting, dishes, sweeping, stairs, walking, running), the hip and wrist accelerometers obtained average accuracies of 70.2% and 80.2% respectively. Predicting METs using the hip or wrist devices alone obtained root mean square errors (rMSE) of 1.09 and 1.00 METs per 6 min bout, respectively. Including HR data improved MET estimation, but did not significantly improve activity type classification. These results demonstrate the validity of random forest classification and regression forests for PA type and MET prediction using accelerometers. The wrist accelerometer proved more useful in predicting activities with significant arm movement, while the hip accelerometer was superior for predicting locomotion and estimating EE.

An alternative approach to the determination of scaling law expressions for the L-H transition in Tokamaks utilizing classification tools instead of regression	PLASMA PHYSICS AND CONTROLLED FUSION			English	Article						power law; L-H threshold; neural networks; support vector machines	CONFINEMENT; THRESHOLD; POWER; BETA	A new approach to determine the power law expressions for the threshold between the H and L mode of confinement is presented. The method is based on two powerful machine learning tools for classification: neural networks and support vector machines. Using as inputs clear examples of the systems on either side of the transition, the machine learning tools learn the input-output mapping corresponding to the equations of the boundary separating the confinement regimes. Systematic tests with synthetic data show that the machine learning tools provide results competitive with traditional statistical regression and more robust against random noise and systematic errors. The developed tools have then been applied to the multi-machine International Tokamak Physics Activity International Global Threshold Database of validated ITER-like Tokamak discharges. The machine learning tools converge on the same scaling law parameters obtained with non-linear regression. On the other hand, the developed tools allow a reduction of 50% of the uncertainty in the extrapolations to ITER. Therefore the proposed approach can effectively complement traditional regression since its application poses much less stringent requirements on the experimental data, to be used to determine the scaling laws, because they do not require examples exactly at the moment of the transition.

To test the procedure, we used a dataset composed of 137 training sites, 15 validation sites and 174 test sites (potentially disturbed) from Portuguese streams. The combined use of three machine learning techniques was more effective in the prediction of invertebrate taxa at a site than their individual use. The three methods were always tested for all invertebrate taxa, but from the three techniques tested, SVM and KNN were most often the best performing techniques (the most accurate among the three for a higher number of taxa) in the prediction of invertebrate taxa with the present dataset. The combination of all algorithms implemented in Hydra resulted in good models for stream bioassessment (e.g. SD OE50<0.2, regression of O vs E: R-2>0.6, Spearman correlations with global degradation >0.7). We also found no advantage in removing rare taxa from the training dataset, and 50% accuracy is the most adequate accuracy level for calculation of OE ratios through Hydra. Future work should consist of comparing the performance of this technique with others, such as the RIVPACS models, using the same datasets. Considering the flexibility of this technique, self-adjustment and easy implementation through a website (aquaweb.uc.pt), we expect it to be also useful in the prediction of other aquatic elements such as fishes and algae.

Metamorphic malware detection using base malware identification approach	SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS			English	Article						metamorphic malware; histogram intersection kernel; obfuscation; support vector machine		Malware is a malicious program that is intentionally developed to harm computer systems. Because the metamorphic malwares are advanced in nature, they mutate their code in each generation by employing code obfuscation techniques to thwart detection. Conventional scanners even fail to detect all variants of such malware. In the view of metamorphic malware detection, we have proposed the concept of machine learning approach like support vector machine with histogram intersection kernel. It has been successfully implemented in the area of image classification, bioinformatics (protein classification and cancer classification). This method provides more accuracy in terms of detection rate to build the effective detection system for metamorphic malwares. In the proposed method, we first extract feature histograms from each portable executable file and map them into the feature space using a histogram intersection kernel. The histogram intersection kernel helps us to find the optimal hyperplane for separating the metamorphic variants from benign programs in a feature space of very high dimension. The results show that our proposed method is capable of detecting metamorphic variants with few false alarms or misses. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

While most denoising procedures require some knowledge about the noise level, which may be unknown in practice, here we assume that the signal expansion in a given dictionary has a distribution that is more heavy-tailed than the noise. We show how this hypothesis leads to a stopping criterion for greedy pursuit algorithms which is independent from the noise level. Inspired by the success of ensemble methods in machine learning, we propose a strategy to reduce the variance of greedy estimates by averaging pursuits obtained from randomly subsampled dictionaries. We call this denoising procedure Blind Random Pursuit Denoising (BIRD). We offer a generalization to multidimensional signals, with a structured sparse model (S-BIRD). The relevance of this approach is demonstrated on synthetic and experimental MEG signals where, without any parameter tuning, BIRD outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms even when they are informed by the noise level. Code is available to reproduce all experiments.

The ability to reason about and assess the potential risks in carrying out such transactions is essential for providing a safe and reliable interaction environment. A traditional approach to reason about the risk of a transaction is to determine if the involved agent is trustworthy on the basis of its behavior history. As a departure from such traditional trust models, we propose a generic, trust framework based on machine learning where an agent uses its own previous transactions (with other agents) to build a personal knowledge base. This is used to assess the trustworthiness of a transaction on the basis of the associated features, particularly using the features that help discern successful transactions from unsuccessful ones. These features are handled by applying appropriate machine learning algorithms to extract the relationships between the potential transaction and the previous ones. Experiments based on real data sets show that our approach is more accurate than other trust mechanisms, especially when the information about past behavior of the specific agent is rare, incomplete, or inaccurate.

The gyroscope, accelerometer and the magnetometer in each unit are tri-axial. Naive Bayesian classifier, artificial neural networks (ANNs), dissimilarity-based classifier, three types of decision trees, Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and support vector machines (SVMs) are considered. A feature set extracted from the raw sensor data using principal component analysis is used for classification. Three different cross-validation techniques are employed to validate the classifiers. A performance comparison of the classifiers is provided in terms of their correct differentiation rates, confusion matrices and computational cost. The highest correct differentiation rates are achieved with ANNs (99.2%), SVMs (99.2%) and a GMM (99.1%). GMMs may be preferable because of their lower computational requirements. Regarding the position of sensor units on the body, those worn on the legs are the most informative. Comparing the different sensor modalities indicates that if only a single sensor type is used, the highest classification rates are achieved with magnetometers, followed by accelerometers and gyroscopes. The study also provides a comparison between two commonly used open source machine learning environments (WEKA and PRTools) in terms of their functionality, manageability, classifier performance and execution times.

In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy matching model which extracts appropriate feature vectors of hotspot and nonhotspot patterns. Our model can dynamically tune appropriate fuzzy regions around known hotspots. Based on this paper, we develop a fast algorithm for lithography hotspot detection with high accuracy of detection and low probability of false-alarm counts. In addition, since higher dimensional size of feature vectors can produce better accuracy but requires longer run time, this paper proposes a grid reduction technique to significantly reduce the CPU run time with very minor impact on the advantages of higher dimensional space. Our results are very encouraging, with average 94.5% accuracy and low false-alarm counts on a set of test benchmarks.

We propose an information flow model (IFM) of belief that captures how interactions among members affect the diffusion and eventual convergence of a belief. The IFM model includes a generalized Markov Graph (GMG) model as a social network model, which reveals that the diffusion of beliefs depends heavily on two characteristics of the social network characteristics, namely degree centralities and clustering coefficients. We apply the IFM to both converged belief estimation and belief control strategy optimization. The model is compared with an IFM including the Barabasi-Albert model, and is evaluated via experiments with published real social network data.

In the first stage of the proposed method, a parametric technique called autoregressive signal modeling is utilized to extract signal features from voltage and current signals at the point of common coupling with the grid. In the second stage, advanced machine learning technique based on support vector machine, which takes calculated features as inputs is utilized to predict islanding state. The extensive study is performed on the IEEE 13 bus system and feature vectors corresponding to various islanding and nonislanding conditions are used for support vector machine classifier training and testing. Simulation results show that the proposed method can accurately detect system islanding operation mode 50 ms after the event starts. Further, the robustness of the proposed method is analyzed by examining its performances in the systems with multiple distributed generations, and when system loading condition, grid disturbance types, and characteristics are altered.

This approach is based on matching pursuit decomposition (MPD) using Gaussian atom dictionary, hidden Markov model (HMM) of real-time frequency and voltage variation features, and fault contour maps generated by machine learning algorithms in smart grid (SG) systems. Specifically, the time-frequency features are extracted by MPD from the frequency and voltage signals, which are sampled by the frequency disturbance recorders in SG. A hybrid clustering algorithm is then developed and used to cluster the frequency and voltage signal features into various symbols. Using the symbols, two detection HMMs are trained for fault detection to distinguish between normal and abnormal SG operation conditions. Also, several identification HMMs are trained under different system fault scenarios, and if a fault occurs, the trained identification HMMs are used to identify different fault types. In the meantime, if the fault is detected by the detection HMMs, a fault contour map will be generated using the feature extracted by the MPD from the voltage signals and topology information of SG. The numerical results demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness, and accuracy of the proposed approach for the diagnosis of various types of faults with different measurement signal-to-noise ratios in SG systems.

In many real-life applications, the forward model is not known, but training data is readily available. In this paper, we develop a new framework that uses training data, as a substitute for knowledge of the forward model, to compute an optimal low-rank regularized inverse matrix directly, allowing for very fast computation of a regularized solution. We consider a statistical framework based on Bayes and empirical Bayes risk minimization to analyze theoretical properties of the problem. We propose an efficient rank update approach for computing an optimal low-rank regularized inverse matrix for various error measures. Numerical experiments demonstrate the benefits and potential applications of our approach to problems in signal and image processing.

We fit Bayesian principal component regression models with known and unknown signal arrival times to reconstruct gravitational wave signals, and subsequently fit known astrophysical parameters on the posterior means of the principal component coefficients using a linear model. We predict the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational energy of the inner core at bounce by sampling from the posterior predictive distribution, and find that these predictions are generally very close to the true parameter values, with 90% credible intervals similar to 0.04 and similar to 0.06 wide for the known and unknown arrival time models respectively. Two supervised machine learning methods are implemented to classify precollapse differential rotation, and we find that these methods discriminate rapidly rotating progenitors particularly well. We also introduce a constrained optimization approach to model selection to find an optimal number of principal components in the signal reconstruction step. Using this approach, we select 14 principal components as the most parsimonious model.

The approach is based on satellite-derived information on cloud-top height, cloud-top temperature, cloud phase, and cloud water path retrieved from Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) data and uses the random forests (RF) machine-learning algorithm. The technique is realized in three steps: (i) precipitating cloud areas are identified, (ii) the areas are separated into convective and advective-stratiform precipitating areas, and (iii) rainfall rates are assigned separately to the convective and advective-stratiform precipitating areas. Validation studies were carried out for each individual step as well as for the overall procedure using collocated ground-based radar data. Regarding each individual step, the models for rain area and convective precipitation detection produce good results. Both retrieval steps show a general tendency toward elevated prediction skill during summer months and daytime. The RF models for rainfall-rate assignment exhibit similar performance patterns, yet it is noteworthy how well the model is able to predict rainfall rates during nighttime and twilight. The performance of the overall procedure shows a very promising potential to estimate rainfall rates at high temporal and spatial resolutions in an automated manner.

CSI 2.0: a significantly improved version of the Chemical Shift Index	JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR NMR			English	Article						Nuclear magnetic resonance; Chemical shifts; Secondary structure multi-class support-vector machine; Markov model	PROTEIN SECONDARY STRUCTURE; STRUCTURE PREDICTION; STRUCTURE ASSIGNMENT; WEB SERVER; NMR-SPECTROSCOPY; TORSION ANGLES; GENERATION; IDENTIFICATION; BACKBONE; RECOGNITION	Protein chemical shifts have long been used by NMR spectroscopists to assist with secondary structure assignment and to provide useful distance and torsion angle constraint data for structure determination. One of the most widely used methods for secondary structure identification is called the Chemical Shift Index (CSI). The CSI method uses a simple digital chemical shift filter to locate secondary structures along the protein chain using backbone C-13 and H-1 chemical shifts. While the CSI method is simple to use and easy to implement, it is only about 75-80 % accurate. Here we describe a significantly improved version of the CSI (2.0) that uses machine-learning techniques to combine all six backbone chemical shifts (C-13(alpha), C-13(beta), C-13, N-15, (HN)-H-1, H-1(alpha)) with sequence-derived features to perform far more accurate secondary structure identification. Our tests indicate that CSI 2.0 achieved an average identification accuracy (Q3) of 90.56 % for a training set of 181 proteins in a repeated tenfold cross-validation and 89.35 % for a test set of 59 proteins. This represents a significant improvement over other state-of-the-art chemical shift-based methods. In particular, the level of performance of CSI 2.0 is equal to that of standard methods, such as DSSP and STRIDE, used to identify secondary structures via 3D coordinate data. This suggests that CSI 2.0 could be used both in providing accurate NMR constraint data in the early stages of protein structure determination as well as in defining secondary structure locations in the final protein model(s). A CSI 2.0 web server (http://csi.wishartlab.com) is available for submitting the input queries for secondary structure identification.

The effects of co-morbidity in defining major depression subtypes associated with long-term course and severity	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Co-morbidity; data mining; depression subtypes; depression symptom profiles; elastic net; machine learning; predictive modeling; risk assessment	RECURSIVE PARTITIONING ANALYSIS; LARGE-SAMPLE; DISORDER; PREDICTORS; INPATIENTS; REMISSION; RISK; REGULARIZATION; SUICIDALITY; POPULATION	Background. Although variation in the long-term course of major depressive disorder (MDD) is not strongly predicted by existing symptom subtype distinctions, recent research suggests that prediction can be improved by using machine learning methods. However, it is not known whether these distinctions can be refined by added information about co-morbid conditions. The current report presents results on this question. Method. Data came from 8261 respondents with lifetime DSM-IV MDD in the World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys. Outcomes included four retrospectively reported measures of persistence/severity of course (years in episode; years in chronic episodes; hospitalization for MDD; disability due to MDD). Machine learning methods (regression tree analysis; lasso, ridge and elastic net penalized regression) followed by k-means cluster analysis were used to augment previously detected subtypes with information about prior co-morbidity to predict these outcomes. Results. Predicted values were strongly correlated across outcomes. Cluster analysis of predicted values found three clusters with consistently high, intermediate or low values. The high-risk cluster (32.4% of cases) accounted for 56.6-72.9% of high persistence, high chronicity, hospitalization and disability. This high-risk cluster had both higher sensitivity and likelihood ratio positive (LR+; relative proportions of cases in the high-risk cluster versus other clusters having the adverse outcomes) than in a parallel analysis that excluded measures of co-morbidity as predictors. Conclusions. Although the results using the retrospective data reported here suggest that useful MDD subtyping distinctions can be made with machine learning and clustering across multiple indicators of illness persistence/severity, replication with prospective data is needed to confirm this preliminary conclusion.

Due to the OOI consisting of visually different fragments, traditional segmentation algorithms that are based on the identification of homogeneous regions usually do not perform well. In order to narrow this gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantics, some recent methods employ machine learning to generate more accurate models of the OOI. The main contribution of this paper is the inclusion of spatial relationships among the OOI fragments into the model. For this purpose, we employ Bayesian networks as a probabilistic approach for learning the spatial relationships which, in turn, becomes evidence that is used for the process of segmenting future instances of the OOI. The algorithm presented in this paper also uses multiple instance learning to obtain prototypical descriptions of each fragment of the OOI based on low-level visual features. The experimental results on both artificial and real image datasets indicate that the addition of spatial relationships improves segmentation performance.

Through quantitative study, we show that existing event detection approaches are challenged to explore the sensing capability of a deployed system and choose the right sensors to meet user-specified accuracy. Event detection systems are also challenged to provide a generic system that efficiently adapts to environmental dynamics and works easily with a range of applications, machine learning approaches, and sensor modalities. Consequently, we propose Watchdog, a modality-agnostic event detection framework that clusters the right sensors to meet user-specified detection accuracy during runtime while significantly reducing energy consumption. Watchdog can use different machine learning techniques to learn the sensing capability of a heterogeneous sensor deployment and meet accuracy requirements. To address environmental dynamics and ensure energy savings, Watchdog wakes up and puts to sleep sensors as needed to meet user-specified accuracy. Through evaluation with real vehicle detection trace data and a building traffic monitoring testbed of IRIS motes, we demonstrate the superior performance of Watchdog over existing solutions in terms of meeting user-specified detection accuracy, energy savings, and environmental adaptability.

In the field of computational neuroscience, much effort has been dedicated to building up computational models of neural plasticity to replicate experimental data. Most recently, increasing attention has been paid to understanding the role of neural plasticity in functional and structural neural self-organization, as well as its influence on the learning performance of neural networks for accomplishing machine learning tasks such as classification and regression. Although many ideas and hypothesis have been suggested, the relationship between the structure, dynamics and learning performance of neural networks remains elusive. The purpose of this article is to review the most important computational models for neural plasticity and discuss various ideas about neural plasticity's role. Finally, we suggest a few promising research directions, in particular those along the line that combines findings in computational neuroscience and systems biology, and their synergetic roles in understanding learning, memory and cognition, thereby bridging the gap between computational neuroscience, systems biology and computational intelligence.

The content of ALA is highly variable, ranging from 0 to 1% in rice and corn to > 50% in perilla and flax. ALA production is strongly correlated with the enzymatic activity of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase. To unravel the underlying mechanisms of omega-3 diversity, 895 protein features of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase were compared between plants with high and low omega-3. Attribute weighting showed that this enzyme in plants with high omega-3 content has higher amounts of Lys, Lys-Phe, and Pro-Asn but lower Aliphatic index, Gly-His, and Pro-Leu. The Random Forest model with Accuracy criterion when run on the dataset pre-filtered with Info Gain algorithm was the best model in distinguishing high omega-3 content based on the frequency of Lys-Lys in the structure of fatty acid desaturase. Interestingly, the discriminant function algorithm could predict the level of omega-3 only based on the six important selected attributes (out of 895 protein attributes) of fatty acid desaturase with 75% accuracy. We developed "Plant omega3 predictor" to predict the content of alpha-linolenic acid based on structural features of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase. The software calculates the 6 key structural protein features from imported Fasta sequence of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase or utilizes the imported features and predicts the ALA content using discriminant function formula.

Recently, considerable research has been conducted in order to potentially automate signal classification for assisting in disease diagnosis. However, the biosignal type (ECG, EEG, EMG or other) needs to be known prior to the classification process. If the given biosignal is of an unknown type, none of the existing methodologies can be utilized. In this paper, a blind biosignal classification model ((BSC)-S-2 Model) is proposed in order to identify the source biosignal type automatically, and thus ultimately benefit the diagnostic decision. The approach employs time series algorithms for constructing the model. It uses a dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm with clustering to discover the similarity between two biosignals, and consequently classifies disease without prior knowledge of the source signal type. The empirical experiments presented in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the method as well as the scalability of the approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The whole system is composed of a part of intelligent core and of an HF special-purpose management tool also providing the function to act as interface for the artificial intelligence training and use. To implement the smart intelligent functions, we adopted a machine learning approach. In this paper, we compare the performance of a neural network (NN), a support vector machine, a system with fuzzy rules genetically produced, and a classification and regression tree and its direct evolution, which is the random forest, in analyzing our database. Best performances in both HF severity evaluation and HF-type prediction functions are obtained by using the random forest algorithm. The management tool allows the cardiologist to populate a "supervised database" suitable for machine learning during his or her regular outpatient consultations. The idea comes from the fact that in literature there are a few databases of this type, and they are not scalable to our case.

Gene expression profile alone is inadequate in predicting complete response in multiple myeloma	LEUKEMIA			English	Article							LENALIDOMIDE PLUS DEXAMETHASONE; STEM-CELL TRANSPLANTATION; MOLECULAR CLASSIFICATION; INTERGROUPE FRANCOPHONE; THERAPEUTIC TARGETS; MICROARRAY DATA; BREAST-CANCER; FOLLOW-UP; CHEMOTHERAPY; BORTEZOMIB	With advent of several treatment options in multiple myeloma (MM), a selection of effective regimen has become an important issue. Use of gene expression profile (GEP) is considered an important tool in predicting outcome; however, it is unclear whether such genomic analysis alone can adequately predict therapeutic response. We evaluated the ability of GEP to predict complete response (CR) in MM. GEP from pretreatment MM cells from 136 uniformly treated MM patients with response data on an IFM, France led study were analyzed. To evaluate variability in predictive power due to microarray platform or treatment types, additional data sets from three different studies (n = 511) were analyzed using same methods. We used several machine learning methods to derive a prediction model using training and test subsets of the original four data sets. Among all methods employed for GEP-based CR predictive capability, we got accuracy range of 56-78% in test data sets and no significant difference with regard to GEP platforms, treatment regimens or in newly diagnosed or relapsed patients. Importantly, permuted P-value showed no statistically significant CR predictive information in GEP data. This analysis suggests that GEP-based signature has limited power to predict CR in MM, highlighting the need to develop comprehensive predictive model using integrated genomics approach.	[Amin, S.

Inferring resting-state connectivity is often based on correlations, which are sensitive to indirect connections, leading to an inaccurate representation of the real backbone of the network. The precision matrix is a better representation for whole brain connectivity, as it considers only direct connections. The network structure can be estimated using the graphical lasso (GL), which achieves sparsity through l(1)-regularization on the precision matrix. In this paper, we propose a structural connectivity adaptive version of the GL, where weaker anatomical connections are represented as stronger penalties on the corresponding functional connections. We applied beamformer source reconstruction to the resting state MEG recordings of 81 subjects, where 29 were healthy controls, 22 were single-domain amnestic Mild Cognitive Impaired (MCI), and 30 were multiple-domain amnestic MCI. An atlas-based anatomical parcellation of 66 regions was obtained for each subject, and time series were assigned to each of the regions. The fiber densities between the regions, obtained with deterministic tractography from diffusion-weighted MRI, were used to define the anatomical connectivity. Precision matrices were obtained with the region specific time series in five different frequency bands. We compared our method with the traditional GL and a functional adaptive version of the GL, in terms of log-likelihood and classification accuracies between the three groups. We conclude that introducing an anatomical prior improves the expressivity of the model and, inmost cases, leads to a better classification between groups. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Given that the using experience is most valued by the user, we propose that the power optimization should directly respect the user experience. We conduct a statistical sample survey and study the correlation among the user experience, system runtime activities, and computational performance of an application processor. We find that there exists a minimal frequency requirement, called "saturated frequency". Above this frequency, the device consumes more power but provides little improvements in user experience. This study motivates an intelligent self-adaptive scheme, SmartCap, that automatically identifies the most power-efficient state of the application processor. Compared to prior Linux power adaptation schemes, SmartCap can help save power from 11% to 84%, depending on applications, with little decline in user experience.

Intrusive memories are key to cognitive behavioural treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, and an aetiological understanding is warranted. We present here analyses using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and a machine learning classifier to investigate whether peri-traumatic brain activation was able to predict later intrusive memories (i.e. before they had happened). To provide a methodological basis for understanding the context of the current results, we first show how functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an experimental analogue of trauma (a trauma film) via a prospective event-related design was able to capture an individual's later intrusive memories. Results showed widespread increases in brain activation at encoding when viewing a scene in the scanner that would later return as an intrusive memory in the real world. These fMRI results were replicated in a second study. While traditional mass univariate regression analysis highlighted an association between brain processing and symptomatology, this is not the same as prediction. Using MVPA and a machine learning classifier, it was possible to predict later intrusive memories across participants with 68% accuracy, and within a participant with 97% accuracy; i.e. the classifier could identify out of multiple scenes those that would later return as an intrusive memory. We also report here brain networks key in intrusive memory prediction. MVPA opens the possibility of decoding brain activity to reconstruct idiosyncratic cognitive events with relevance to understanding and predicting mental health symptoms. (C) 2014 The Authors.

However, up-to-date, instances of successful production of soluble recombinant proteins in E. coli expression system with high yield remain scarce. This is mainly due to the difficulties in improving the overall production capacity, as most of the well-established strategies usually involve a series of trial and error steps with unguaranteed success. One way to concurrently improve the production yield and minimize the production cost would be incorporating the potency of bioinformatics tools to conduct in silico studies, which forecasts the outcome before actual experimental work. In this article, we review and compare seven prediction tools available, which predict the solubility of protein expressed in E. coli, using the following criteria: prediction performance, usability, utility, prediction tool development and validation methodologies. This comprehensive review will be a valuable resource for researchers with limited prior experience in bioinformatics tools. As such, this will facilitate their choice of appropriate tools for studies related to enhancement of intracellular recombinant protein production in E. coli.

J	Imran, A; Zoha, A; Abu-Dayya, A				Imran, Ali; Zoha, Ahmed; Abu-Dayya, Adnan			Challenges in 5G: How to Empower SON with Big Data for Enabling 5G	IEEE NETWORK			English	Article								While an al dente character of 5G is yet to emerge, network densification, miscellany of node types, split of control and data plane, network virtualization, heavy and localized cache, infrastructure sharing, concurrent operation at multiple frequency bands, simultaneous use of different medium access control and physical layers, and flexible spectrum allocations can be envisioned as some of the potential ingredients of 5G. It is not difficult to prognosticate that with such a conglomeration of technologies, the complexity of operation and OPEX can become the biggest challenge in 5G. To cope with similar challenges in the context of 3G and 4G networks, recently, self-organizing networks, or SONs, have been researched extensively. However, the ambitious quality of experience requirements and emerging multifarious vision of 5G, and the associated scale of complexity and cost, demand a significantly different, if not totally new, approach toward SONs in order to make 5G technically as well as financially feasible. In this article we first identify what challenges hinder the current self-optimizing networking paradigm from meeting the requirements of 5G. We then propose a comprehensive framework for empowering SONs with big data to address the requirements of 5G. Under this framework we first characterize big data in the context of future mobile networks, identifying its sources and future utilities. We then explicate the specific machine learning and data analytics tools that can be exploited to transform big data into the right data that provides a readily useable knowledge base to create end-to-end intelligence of the network. We then explain how a SON engine can build on the dynamic models extractable from the right data. The resultant dynamicity of a big data empowered SON (BSON) makes it more agile and can essentially transform the SON from being a reactive to proactive paradigm and hence act as a key enabler for 5G's extremely low latency requirements. Finally, we demonstrate the key concepts of our proposed BSON framework through a case study of a problem that the classic 3G/4G SON fails to solve.

The various vulnerabilities in these systems and the heterogeneity of cyberattacks make the task extremely difficult for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS). Modeling cyberattacks has become nearly impossible and their potential consequences may be very severe. The primary objective of this work is to detect malicious intrusions once they have already bypassed traditional IDS and firewalls. This paper investigates the use of machine learning for intrusion detection in SCADA systems using one-class classification algorithms. Two approaches of one-class classification are investigated: 1) the support vector data description (SVDD); and 2) the kernel principle component analysis. The impact of the considered metric is examined in detail with the study of l(p)-norms in radial basis function (RBF) kernels. A heuristic is proposed to find an optimal choice of the bandwidth parameter in these kernels. Tests are conducted on real data with several types of cyberattacks.

However, most methods in the literature view this task as a special case of motion recognition. In contrast, we propose to employ the three main components of a physiotherapy exercise (the motion patterns, the stance knowledge, and the exercise object) as different recognition tasks and embed them separately into the recognition system. The low level information about each component is gathered using machine learning methods. Then, we use a generative Bayesian network to recognize the exercise types by combining the information from these sources at an abstract level, which takes the advantage of domain knowledge for a more robust system. Finally, a novel postprocessing step is employed to estimate the exercise repetitions counts. The performance evaluation of the system is conducted with a new dataset which contains RGB (red, green, and blue) and depth videos of home-based exercise sessions for commonly applied shoulder and knee exercises. The proposed system works without any body-part segmentation, bodypart tracking, joint detection, and temporal segmentation methods. In the end, favorable exercise recognition rates and encouraging results on the estimation of repetition counts are obtained.

The kappa statistic was strongly pushed by the medical field where it could be successfully applied via analyzing diagnoses of identical patient groups. Kappa is well suited for classification tasks where ranking is not considered. The main advantage of kappa is its simplicity and the general applicability to multi-class problems which is the major difference to receiver operating characteristic area under the curve. In this manuscript, I will outline the usage of kappa for classification tasks, and I will evaluate the role and uses of kappa in specifically machine learning and cheminformatics.

However, these approaches do not consider the fact that the contacts in a protein are neither randomly, nor independently distributed, but actually follow precise rules governed by the structure of the protein and thus are interdependent. Here, we present PconsC2, a novel method that uses a deep learning approach to identify protein-like contact patterns to improve contact predictions. A substantial enhancement can be seen for all contacts independently on the number of aligned sequences, residue separation or secondary structure type, but is largest for b-sheet containing proteins. In addition to being superior to earlier methods based on statistical inferences, in comparison to state of the art methods using machine learning, PconsC2 is superior for families with more than 100 effective sequence homologs. The improved contact prediction enables improved structure prediction.

Still there is a consensus that it is to a large extent systematic but can be approached appropriately only if many heterogeneous factors are taken into account. Over thirty variables influencing this variation have been proposed. However, it is actually unclear how effective they can be, and above all, how they interact. In this paper, the potential influencing variables are evaluated statistically in a machine learning approach and modelled in decision trees in order to predict the genitive marking variants. Working with decision trees based exclusively on statistically significant data enables us to determine what combination of factors is decisive in the choice of a marking variant of a given noun. Consequently the variation factors can be assessed with respect to their explanatory power for corpus data and put in a hierarchized order.

(Sabrina)			A relative patterns discovery for enhancing outlier detection in categorical data	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Association analysis; Categorical data; Frequent itemsets mining; Outlier detection; Unsupervised method	DISTANCE-BASED OUTLIERS; DIMENSIONAL DATA SETS; EFFICIENT ALGORITHM	Outlier (also known as anomaly) detection technology is widely applied to many areas, such as diagnosing diseases, evaluating credit, and investigating cybercrime. Recently, several studies, based on frequent itemset mining (FIM), have been proposed to detect outliers in categorical data. For efficiency, these FIM-based studies pruned (ignored) the majority of data by either imposing a threshold or restricting the length of the pattern or both, and they further adopted the limited information to evaluate observations. In spite of high efficiency, such a pruning approach encounters the problem of distortion, i.e., the accuracy decreases to a low level of discernment or even causes the contrary judgment in certain cases. In this paper, we introduce the concept relative patterns discovery from a new perspective on association analysis. To efficiently explore the relative patterns, we devise a hash-index-based intersecting approach (called the HA). Based on the knowledge of relative patterns, we propose an unsupervised approach (called the UA) to evaluate which observations are anomalous. Instead of using the limited information, our method can differentiate the features of observations without the problem of distortion. The results of the empirical investigation, conducted with eight real-world datasets on the UCI Machine Learning Repository, demonstrate that our method generally outperforms the previous studies not only in accuracy but also inefficiency. We also demonstrate that the execution complexity of our method is significantly efficient, especially in high-dimensional data. Furthermore, our method can represent a natural panorama of data, which is appropriate in controlled experiments for discovering more decisive factors in outlier detection. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A reference process for automating bee species identification based on wing images and digital image processing	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Reference process; Digital image processing; Machine learning; Bee wing classification; Taxonomic classification	AFRICANIZED HONEY-BEES; GEOMETRIC MORPHOMETRICS; APIDAE; HYMENOPTERA; BIODIVERSITY; MELIPONINI	Pollinators play a key role in biodiversity conservation, since they provide vital services to both natural ecosystems and agriculture. In particular, bees are excellent pollinators; therefore, their mapping, classification, and preservation help to promote biodiversity conservation. However, these tasks are difficult and time consuming since there is a lack of classification keys, sampling efforts and trained taxonomists. The development of tools for automating and assisting the identification of bee species represents an important contribution to biodiversity conservation. Several studies have shown that features extracted from patterns of bee wings are good discriminatory elements to differentiate among species, and some have devoted efforts to automate this process. However, the automated identification of bee species is a particularly hard problem, because (i) individuals of a given species may vary hugely in morphology, and (ii) closely related species may be extremely similar to one another. This paper proposes a reference process for bee classification based on wing images to provide a complete understanding of the problem from the experts' point of view, and a foundation to software systems development and integration using Internet services. The results can be extended to other species identification and taxonomic classification, as long as similar criteria are applicable. The reference process may also be helpful for beginners in this research field, as they can use the process and the experiments presented here as a guide to this complex activity.

A total of 876 models have been constructed based on physicochemical descriptors and fingerprints. The overall predictive accuracies of the best models exceeded 80% for both training and test sets. The best model was employed for the virtual screening of anti-MRSA compounds, which were then validated by a cell-based assay using the broth microdilution method with three types of highly resistant MRSA strains (ST239, ST5, and 252). A total of 12 new anti-MRSA agents were confirmed, which had MIC values ranging from 4 to 64 mg/L. This work proves the capacity of combined multiple ligand-based approaches for the discovery of new agents active against MRSA with cell-based assays. We think this work may inspire other lead identification processes when cell-based assay data are available.

With the popularity of social media growing, the Internet is a source for syndromic surveillance due to the availability of large amounts of data. In this study, tweets, or posts of 140 characters or less, from the website Twitter were collected and analyzed for their potential as surveillance for seasonal influenza. Objective: There were three aims: (1) to improve the correlation of tweets to sentinel-provided influenza-like illness (ILI) rates by city through filtering and a machine-learning classifier, (2) to observe correlations of tweets for emergency department ILI rates by city, and (3) to explore correlations for tweets to laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in San Diego. Methods: Tweets containing the keyword "flu" were collected within a 17-mile radius from 11 US cities selected for population and availability of ILI data. At the end of the collection period, 159,802 tweets were used for correlation analyses with sentinel-provided ILI and emergency department ILI rates as reported by the corresponding city or county health department. Two separate methods were used to observe correlations between tweets and ILI rates: filtering the tweets by type (non-retweets, retweets, tweets with a URL, tweets without a URL), and the use of a machine-learning classifier that determined whether a tweet was " valid", or from a user who was likely ill with the flu. Results: Correlations varied by city but general trends were observed. Non-retweets and tweets without a URL had higher and more significant (P<.05) correlations than retweets and tweets with a URL. Correlations of tweets to emergency department ILI rates were higher than the correlations observed for sentinel-provided ILI for most of the cities. The machine-learning classifier yielded the highest correlations for many of the cities when using the sentinel-provided or emergency department ILI as well as the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in San Diego. High correlation values (r=.93) with significance at P<.001 were observed for laboratory-confirmed influenza cases for most categories and tweets determined to be valid by the classifier. Conclusions: Compared to tweet analyses in the previous influenza season, this study demonstrated increased accuracy in using Twitter as a supplementary surveillance tool for influenza as better filtering and classification methods yielded higher correlations for the 2013-2014 influenza season than those found for tweets in the previous influenza season, where emergency department ILI rates were better correlated to tweets than sentinel-provided ILI rates. Further investigations in the field would require expansion with regard to the location that the tweets are collected from, as well as the availability of more ILI data.

More specifically, a support vector classified is trained on the corpus annotations to identify emotions in facial expressions. In the classification experiments, we test to what extent emotions expressed in naturally-occurring conversations can be identified automatically by a classifier trained on the manual annotations of the shape of facial expressions and co-occurring speech tokens. We also investigate the relation between emotions and the communicative functions of facial expressions. Both emotion labels and their values in a three dimensional space are identified. The three dimensions are Pleasure, Arousal and Dominance. The results of our experiments indicate that the classifiers perform well in identifying emotions from the coarse-grained descriptions of facial expressions and co-occurring speech. The communicative functions of facial expressions also contribute to emotion identification. The results are promising because the emotion label list comprises fine grained emotions and affective states in naturally occurring conversations, while the shape features of facial expressions are very coarse grained. The classification results also assess that the annotation scheme combining a discrete and a dimensional description, and the manual annotations produced according to it are reliable and can be used to model and test emotional behaviours in emotional cognitive infocommunicative systems.

Automatic melody composition based on a probabilistic model of music style and harmonic rules	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Automatic melody composition; Music style; Music analysis; Probabilistic model; Machine learning	PERCEPTION	The aim of the present work is to perform a step towards the design of specific algorithms and methods for automatic music generation. A novel probabilistic model for the characterization of music learned from music samples is designed. This model makes use of automatically extracted music parameters, namely tempo, time signature, rhythmic patterns and pitch contours, to characterize music. Specifically, learned rhythmic patterns and pitch contours are employed to characterize music styles. Then, a novel autonomous music compositor that generates new melodies using the model developed will be presented. The methods proposed in this paper take into consideration different aspects related to the traditional way in which music is composed by humans such as harmony evolution and structure repetitions and apply them together with the probabilistic reutilization of rhythm patterns and pitch contours learned beforehand to compose music pieces.

Here we have examined microenvironment control over two different tumor cell motility phenotypes required for metastasis. By high-resolution multiphoton microscopy of mammary carcinoma in mice, we detected two phenotypes of motile tumor cells, different in locomotion speed. Only slower tumor cells exhibited protrusions with molecular, morphological, and functional characteristics associated with invadopodia. Each region in the primary tumor exhibited either fast-or slow-locomotion. To understand how the tumor microenvironment controls invadopodium formation and tumor cell locomotion, we systematically analyzed components of the microenvironment previously associated with cell invasion and migration. No single microenvironmental property was able to predict the locations of tumor cell phenotypes in the tumor if used in isolation or combined linearly. To solve this, we utilized the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to classify phenotypes in a nonlinear fashion. This approach identified conditions that promoted either motility phenotype. We then demonstrated that varying one of the conditions may change tumor cell behavior only in a context-dependent manner. In addition, to establish the link between phenotypes and cell fates, we photoconverted and monitored the fate of tumor cells in different microenvironments, finding that only tumor cells in the invadopodium-rich microenvironments degraded extracellular matrix (ECM) and disseminated. The number of invadopodia positively correlated with degradation, while the inhibiting metalloproteases eliminated degradation and lung metastasis, consistent with a direct link among invadopodia, ECM degradation, and metastasis. We have detected and characterized two phenotypes of motile tumor cells in vivo, which occurred in spatially distinct microenvironments of primary tumors. We show how machine-learning analysis can classify heterogeneous microenvironments in vivo to enable prediction of motility phenotypes and tumor cell fate. The ability to predict the locations of tumor cell behavior leading to metastasis in breast cancer models may lead towards understanding the heterogeneity of response to treatment.

Eleven XC skiers (seven men, four women) with regional-to-international levels of performance carried out roller skiing trials on a treadmill using fixed gears (G2left, G2right, G3, G4left, G4right) and a 950-m trial using different speeds and inclines, applying gears and sides as they normally would. Gear classification by the Smartphone (on the chest) and based on video recordings were compared. Formachine-learning, a collective database was compared to individual data. The Smartphone application identified the trials with fixed gears correctly in all cases. In the 950-m trial, participants executed 140 +/- 22 cycles as assessed by video analysis, with the automatic Smartphone application giving a similar value. Based on collective data, gears were identified correctly 86.0% +/- 8.9% of the time, a value that rose to 90.3% +/- 4.1% (P < 0.01) with machine learning from individual data. Classification was most often incorrect during transition between gears, especially to or from G3. Identification was most often correct for skiers who made relatively few transitions between gears. The accuracy of the automatic procedure for identifying G2left, G2right, G3, G4left and G4right was 96%, 90%, 81%, 88% and 94%, respectively. The algorithm identified gears correctly 100% of the time when a single gear was used and 90% of the time when different gears were employed during a variable protocol. This algorithm could be improved with respect to identification of transitions between gears or the side employed within a given gear.

To this end, one usually departs from some notion of similarity, comparing two enzymes by looking for correspondences in their sequences, structures or surfaces. For a given query, the search operation results in a ranking of the enzymes in the database, from very similar to dissimilar enzymes, while information about the biological function of annotated database enzymes is ignored. In this work, we show that rankings of that kind can be substantially improved by applying kernel-based learning algorithms. This approach enables the detection of statistical dependencies between similarities of the active cleft and the biological function of annotated enzymes. This is in contrast to search-based approaches, which do not take annotated training data into account. Similarity measures based on the active cleft are known to outperform sequence-based or structure-based measures under certain conditions. We consider the Enzyme Commission (EC) classification hierarchy for obtaining annotated enzymes during the training phase. The results of a set of sizeable experiments indicate a consistent and significant improvement for a set of similarity measures that exploit information about small cavities in the surface of enzymes.

Classification of breast tissue based on spectral features of impedance loci has frequently been done to classify malignant tissue with further requirement of more complex classification methodologies needed to improve the characterisation. In current study, tissue classification is done using in vivo electrical impedance data of 18 human subjects, from four quadrants of breast, palm, nail, arm, bicep and classified using algorithms involving machine learning methodologies, specifically support vector machines (SVMs) that are supervised learning models. They consist of learning algorithms based on the principal of structural risk minimisation. Two methodologies of SVM have been used in this study: with data binning and data pruning and without data binning and data pruning. Data binning and data pruning have improved the sensitivity of the SVM from 76.76 to 89.23%, but the specificity has decreased from 76.23 to 74.15%. This is a pilot study towards testing the reliability of the developed electrical impedance measuring system and developing a data mining-based decision making system into an electrical impedance spectroscopy system, to help users (physicians) with tissue classification leading to reliable objective decision making.

Besides positive association rules, negative association rule mining, which find out negation relationships of frequent item-sets are also important. The importance of negative association rule mining is accounted in customer-driven domains such as market basket analysis for identifying products that conflict with each other. In multi-database mining context, mining negation relation among item-sets and synthesizing global negative association rules from multiple data sources located in different places are having importance in arriving decisions both at strategic and branch levels. This paper made an attempt for synthesizing global negative association rules which are voted by most of the participating data sources while mining multiple data sources. Experimental data are employed to test the theoretical analysis of the proposal using UCI machine learning repository data set. The space and time complexity analysis presented in the paper show the efficiency of the proposed approach.

The development of efficient ASP systems is, thus, crucial. Having in mind the task of improving the solving methods for ASP, there are two usual ways to reach this goal: (i) extending state-of-the-art techniques and ASP solvers or (ii) designing a new ASP solver from scratch. An alternative to these trends is to build on top of state-of-the-art solvers, and to apply machine learning techniques for choosing automatically the "best" available solver on a per-instance basis. In this paper, we pursue this latter direction. We first define a set of cheap-to-compute syntactic features that characterize several aspects of ASP programs. Then, we apply classification methods that, given the features of the instances in a training set and the solvers' performance on these instances, inductively learn algorithm selection strategies to be applied to a test set. We report the results of a number of experiments considering solvers and different training and test sets of instances taken from the ones submitted to the "System Track" of the Third ASP Competition. Our analysis shows that by applying machine learning techniques to ASP solving, it is possible to obtain very robust performance: our approach can solve more instances compared with any solver that entered the Third ASP Competition.

Detection of emotions in Parkinson's disease using higher order spectral features from brain's electrical activity	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Emotion recognition; Parkinson's disease; Bispectrum; Support vector machine	FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION; GAMMA BAND; EEG; SIGNALS; SPEECH; MUSIC; OSCILLATIONS; METAANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; IMPAIRMENT	Objective: Non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) involving cognition and emotion have been progressively receiving more attention in recent times. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, being an activity of central nervous system, can reflect the underlying true emotional state of a person. This paper presents a computational framework for classifying PD patients compared to healthy controls (HC) using emotional information from the brain's electrical activity. Approach: Emotional EEG data were obtained from 20 PD patients and 20 healthy age-, gender- and education level-matched controls by inducing the six basic emotions of happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust using multimodal (audio and visual) stimuli. In addition, participants were asked to report their subjective affect. Because of the nonlinear and dynamic nature of EEG signals, we utilized higher order spectral features (specifically, bispectrum) for analysis. Two different classifiers namely K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used to investigate the performance of the HOS based features to classify each of the six emotional states of PD patients compared to HC. Ten-fold cross-validation method was used for testing the reliability of the classifier results. Main results: From the experimental results with our EEG data set, we found that (a) classification performance of bispectrum features across ALL frequency bands is better than individual frequency bands in both the groups using SVM classifier; (b) higher frequency band plays a more important role in emotion activities than lower frequency band; and (c) PD patients showed emotional impairments compared to HC, as demonstrated by a lower classification performance, particularly for negative emotions (sadness, fear, anger and disgust). Significance: These results demonstrate the effectiveness of applying EEG features with machine learning techniques to classify the each emotional state difference of PD patients compared to HC, and offer a promising approach for detection of emotional impairments associated with other neurological disorders.

The development of a similar capacity in a robot will contribute to the future success of intuitive human-robot interactions. This paper presents experiments on the classification of social touch on a fullsized mannequin arm covered with touch-sensitive artificial skin. The flexible and stretchable sensitive skin was implemented using electrical impedance tomography. A classifier based on the LogitBoost algorithm was used to classify six emotions and six social messages transmitted by humans when touching the artificial arm. Experimental results show that classification of social touch can be achieved with accuracies comparable to those achieved by humans.

Clinical Characteristics of Familial and Sporadic Age-Related Macular Degeneration: Differences and Similarities	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article						AMD; family history; clinical characteristics	COMPLEMENT FACTOR-H; BEAVER-DAM EYE; CARDIOVASCULAR RISK-FACTORS; BLUE MOUNTAINS EYE; CUTICULAR DRUSEN; TERM INCIDENCE; CFH GENE; DISEASE; ASSOCIATION; MACULOPATHY	PURPOSE. We describe the differences and similarities in clinical characteristics and phenotype of familial and sporadic patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). METHODS. We evaluated data of 1828 AMD patients and 1715 controls enrolled in the European Genetic Database. All subjects underwent ophthalmologic examination, including visual acuity testing and fundus photography. Images were graded and fundus photographs were used for automatic drusen quantification by a machine learning algorithm. Data on disease characteristics, family history, medical history, and lifestyle habits were obtained by a questionnaire. RESULTS. The age at first symptoms was significantly lower in AMD patients with a positive family history (68.5 years) than in those with no family history (71.6 years, P = 1.9 x 10(-5)). Risk factors identified in sporadic and familial subjects were increasing age (odds ratio [OR], 1.08 per year; P = 3.0 x 10(-51), and OR, 1.15; P = 5.3 x 10(-36), respectively) and smoking (OR, 1.01 per pack year; P = 1.1 x 10(-6) and OR, 1.02; P = 0.005). Physical activity and daily red meat consumption were significantly associated with AMD in sporadic subjects only (OR, 0.49; P = 3.7 x 10(-10) and OR, 1.81; P = 0.001). With regard to the phenotype, geographic atrophy and cuticular drusen were significantly more prevalent in familial AMD (17.5% and 21.7%, respectively) compared to sporadic AMD (9.8% and 12.1%). CONCLUSIONS. Familial AMD patients become symptomatic at a younger age. The higher prevalence of geographic atrophy and cuticular drusen in the familial AMD cases may be explained by the contribution of additional genetic factors segregating within families.

In this direction, in the current study, the capability of artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained with back propagation (BP) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), to correlate the solubility of H2S in 11different ILs have been investigated. Different structures of three-layer feed forward neural network using acentric factor (omega), critical temperature (T-c), critical pressure (P-c) of ILs accompanied by pressure (P) and temperature (T), as input parameters, were examined and an optimized architecture has been proposed as 5-9-1.Implementation of these models for 465 experimental data points collected from the literature shows coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.99218 and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.00025 from experimental values for PSO-ANN predicted solubilities while the values of R-2=0.95151 and MSE=0.00335 were obtained for BP-ANN model. Therefore, through PSO training algorithm we are able to attain significantly better results than with BP training procedure based on the statistical criteria. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: The application was developed and tested using data collected in a Brazilian hospital. The available data were used to feed an ML pipeline that was designed to create a simulator capable of predicting the outcome (death probability) for newborns admitted to neonatal intensive care units. However, unlike previous scoring systems, our computational tool is not intended to be used at the patients bedside, although it is possible. Our primary goal is to deliver a computational system to aid medical research in understanding the correlation of key variables with the studied outcome so that new standards can be established for future clinical decisions. In the implemented simulation environment, the values of key attributes can be changed using a user-friendly interface, where the impact of each change on the outcome is immediately reported, allowing a quantitative analysis, in addition to a qualitative investigation, and delivering a totally interactive computational tool that facilitates hypothesis construction and testing. Results: Our statistical experiments showed that the resulting model for death prediction could achieve an accuracy of 86.7% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84 for the positive class. Using this model, three physicians and a neonatal nutritionist performed simulations with key variables correlated with chance of death. The results indicated important tendencies for the effect of each variable and the combination of variables on prognosis. We could also observe values of gestational age and birth weight for which a low Apgar score and the occurrence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) could be less or more severe. For instance, we have noticed that for a newborn with 2000 g or more the occurrence of RDS is far less problematic than for neonates weighing less. Conclusions: The significant accuracy demonstrated by our predictive model shows that NICeSim might be used for hypothesis testing to minimize in vivo experiments. We observed that the model delivers predictions that are in very good agreement with the literature, demonstrating that NICeSim might be an important tool for supporting decision making in medical practice. Other very important characteristics of NICeSim are its flexibility and dynamism. NICeSim is flexible because it allows the inclusion and deletion of variables according to the requirements of a particular study. It is also dynamic because it trains a justin-time model. Therefore, the system is improved as data from new patients become available. Finally, NICeSim can be extended in a cooperative manner because it is an open-source system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

MeSH has over 26,000 terms and indexers look at each article's full text while assigning the terms. Recent automated attempts focused on using the article title and abstract text to identify MeSH terms for the corresponding article. Most of these approaches used supervised machine learning techniques that use already indexed articles and the corresponding MeSH terms. In this paper, we present a new indexing approach that leverages term co-occurrence frequencies and latent term associations computed using MeSH term sets corresponding to a set of nearly 18 million articles already indexed with MeSH terms by indexers at NLM. The main goal of our study is to gauge the potential of output label co-occurrences, latent associations, and relationships extracted from free text in both unsupervised and supervised indexing approaches. In this paper, using a novel and purely unsupervised approach, we achieve a micro-F-score that is comparable to those obtained using supervised machine learning techniques. By incorporating term co-occurrence and latent association features into a supervised learning framework, we also improve over the best results published on two public datasets.

After contrast agents are administered, it is possible to identify a lesion type from its enhancement pattern. However, CEUS image reading is not easy because there are various types of enhancement patterns even for the same type of lesion, and clear classification criteria have not yet been defined. Some studies have used conventional time intensity curves (TICs), which show the vessel dynamics of a lesion. It is possible to predict lesion type from the TIC parameters, such as the coefficients obtained by curve fitting, peak intensity, flow rate and time to peak. However, these parameters are not always provide sufficient accuracy. In this paper, we prepare 1D Haar-like features which describe intensity changes in a TIC and adopt the Adaboost machine learning technique, which eases understanding of which features are useful. Hyperparameters of weak classifiers, e.g., the step size of a Haar-like filter length and threshold for output of the filter, are optimized by searching for those parameters that give the best accuracy. We evaluate the proposed method using 36 focal splenic lesions in canines 16 of which were benign and 20 malignant. The accuracies were 91.7% (33/36) when inspected by an experienced veterinarian, 75.0% (27/36) by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) using conventional three TIC parameters: time to peak, area under curve and peak intensity, and 91.7% (33/36) using our proposed method. McNemar testing shows the p-value to be less than 0.05 between the proposed method and LDA. This result shows the statistical significance of differences between the proposed method and the conventional TIC analysis method using LDA.

This modeling approach integrates two simpler, well established prior techniques, namely one related to social network structure and another related to thematic structure of text. As an illustrative application of the integrated technique's use and utility, we use it as a lens for exploring student dropout behavior in three different MOOCs. In particular, we use the model to identify twenty emerging subcommunities within the threaded discussions of each of the three MOOCs. We then use a survival model to measure the impact of participation in identified subcommunities on attrition along the way for students who have participated in the course discussion forums of the three courses. In each of three MOOCs we find evidence that participation in two to four subcommunities out of the twenty is associated with significantly higher or lower dropout rates than average. A qualitative post-hoc analysis illustrates how the learned models can be used as a lens for understanding the values and focus of discussions within the subcommunities, and in the illustrative example to think about the association between those and detected higher or lower dropout rates than average in the three courses. Our qualitative analysis demonstrates that the patterns that emerge make sense: It associates evidence of stronger expressed motivation to actively participate in the course as well as evidence of stronger cognitive engagement with the material in subcommunities associated with lower attrition, and the opposite in subcommunities associated with higher attrition. We conclude with a discussion of ways the modeling approach might be applied, along with caveats from limitations, and directions for future work.

Finance message board over the period January 2005 to December 2010, we examine whether investor sentiment as expressed in posted messages has predictive power for stock returns, volatility, and trading volume. In intertemporal and cross-sectional regression analyses, we find no evidence that investor sentiment forecasts future stock returns either at the aggregate or at the individual firm level. Rather, we find evidence that investor sentiment is positively affected by prior stock price performance. We also find no significant evidence that investor sentiment from Internet postings has predictive power for volatility and trading volume. A distinctive feature of our study is the use of sentiment information explicitly revealed by retail investors as well as classified by a machine learning classification algorithm and a much longer sample period relative to prior studies.

Scoping prediction of re-radiated ground-borne noise and vibration near high speed rail lines with variable soils	SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING			English	Article						ScopeRail; High speed rail vibration; Environmental impact assessment (EIA); Initial vibration assessment; Structural vibration; In-door noise; Scoping assessment; High speed train; Urban railway	CALCULATING VIBRATION; NUMERICAL-MODEL; TRAIN; TRACK; SIMULATION; PASSAGE; TUNNEL; LOADS; BEM	This paper outlines a vibration prediction tool, ScopeRail, capable of predicting in-door noise and vibration, within structures in close proximity to high speed railway lines. The tool is designed to rapidly predict vibration levels over large track distances, while using historical soil information to increase accuracy. Model results are compared to an alternative, commonly used, scoping model and it is found that ScopeRail offers higher accuracy predictions. This increased accuracy can potentially reduce the cost of vibration environmental impact assessments for new high speed rail lines. To develop the tool, a three-dimensional finite element model is first outlined capable of simulating vibration generation and propagation from high speed rail lines. A vast array of model permutations are computed to assess the effect of each input parameter on absolute ground vibration levels. These relations are analysed using a machine learning approach, resulting in a model that can instantly predict ground vibration levels in the presence of different train speeds and soil profiles. Then a collection of empirical factors are coupled with the model to allow for the prediction of structural vibration and indoor noise in buildings located near high speed lines. Additional factors are also used to enable the prediction of vibrations in the presence of abatement measures (e.g. ballast mats and floating slab tracks) and additional excitation mechanisms (e.g. wheelflats and switches/crossings).

Features are derived from remote sensing data to characterize the urban environment and are subsequently combined with in situ observations. Machine learning approaches are deployed in a sequential way to identify meaningful sets of features that are suitable to predict seismic vulnerability levels of buildings. When assessing the vulnerability level according to a scoring method, the overall mean absolute percentage error is 10.6%, if using a supervised support vector regression approach. When predicting EMS-98 classes, the results show an overall accuracy of 65.4% and a kappa statistic of 0.36, if using a naive Bayes learning scheme. This study shows potential for a rapid screening assessment of large areas that should be explored further in the future.

In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of using techniques from machine learning and data mining to determine the future vacancy risks for individual properties and for neighborhoods using a variety of structural, demographic, socioeconomic, and city activity features with high accuracy. Within a larger systems-of-systems framework that we develop, these predictive analytics will allow a city to move from decision-making based on 'educated anecdotes' and reactive strategies aimed at the most urgent need, to policy development based on informed, holistic insight and proactive interventions that prevent and reverse decline.

We develop a new theoretical framework that posits that veil piercing is done to achieve three discrete public policy goals, each of which is consistent with economic efficiency: (1) achieving the purpose of an existing statute or regulation; (2) preventing shareholders from obtaining credit by misrepresentation; and (3) promoting the bankruptcy values of achieving the orderly, efficient resolution of a bankrupt's estate. We analyze the facts of veil-piercing cases to show how the outcomes are explained by our taxonomy. We demonstrate that a supposed justification for veil piercing-undercapitalization-in fact rarely, if ever, provides an independent basis for piercing the corporate veil. Finally, we employ modern quantitative machine learning methods never before utilized in legal scholarship to analyze the full text of 9,380 judicial opinions. We demonstrate that our theories systematically predict veil-piercing outcomes, that the widely invoked rationale of "undercapitalization" of the business poorly explains these cases, and that our theories most closely reflect the actual textual structure of the opinions.

Seeded Graph Matching for Correlated Erdos-Renyi Graphs	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						graph matching; Erdos-Renyi graph; consistency; estimation; seeded vertices; Frank-Wolfe; assignment problem		Graph matching is an important problem in machine learning and pattern recognition. Herein, we present theoretical and practical results on the consistency of graph matching for estimating a latent alignment function between the vertex sets of two graphs, as well as subsequent algorithmic implications when the latent alignment is partially observed. In the correlated Erdos-Renyi graph setting, we prove that graph matching provides a strongly consistent estimate of the latent alignment in the presence of even modest correlation. We then investigate a tractable, restricted-focus version of graph matching, which is only concerned with adjacency involving vertices in a partial observation of the latent alignment; we prove that a logarithmic number of vertices whose alignment is known is sufficient for this restricted-focus version of graph matching to yield a strongly consistent estimate of the latent alignment of the remaining vertices. We show how Frank-Wolfe methodology for approximate graph matching, when there is a partially observed latent alignment, inherently incorporates this restricted-focus graph matching. Lastly, we illustrate the relationship between seeded graph matching and restricted-focus graph matching by means of an illuminating example from human connectomics.

J	Wipf, D; Zhang, HC				Wipf, David; Zhang, Haichao			Revisiting Bayesian Blind Deconvolution	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						blind deconvolution; blind image deblurring; variational Bayes; sparse priors; sparse estimation	ALGORITHMS	Blind deconvolution involves the estimation of a sharp signal or image given only a blurry observation. Because this problem is fundamentally ill-posed, strong priors on both the sharp image and blur kernel are required to regularize the solution space. While this naturally leads to a standard MAP estimation framework, performance is compromised by unknown trade-off parameter settings, optimization heuristics, and convergence issues stemming from non-convexity and/or poor prior selections. To mitigate some of these problems, a number of authors have recently proposed substituting a variational Bayesian (VB) strategy that marginalizes over the high-dimensional image space leading to better estimates of the blur kernel. However, the underlying cost function now involves both integrals with no closed-form solution and complex, function-valued arguments, thus losing the transparency of MAP. Beyond standard Bayesian-inspired intuitions, it thus remains unclear by exactly what mechanism these methods are able to operate, rendering understanding, improvements and extensions more difficult. To elucidate these issues, we demonstrate that the VB methodology can be recast as an unconventional MAP problem with a very particular penalty/prior that conjoins the image, blur kernel, and noise level in a principled way. This unique penalty has a number of useful characteristics pertaining to relative concavity, local minima avoidance, normalization, and scale-invariance that allow us to rigorously explain the success of VB including its existing implementational heuristics and approximations. It also provides strict criteria for learning the noise level and choosing the optimal image prior that, perhaps counter-intuitively, need not reflect the statistics of natural scenes. In so doing we challenge the prevailing notion of why VB is successful for blind deconvolution while providing a transparent platform for introducing enhancements and extensions. Moreover, the underlying insights carry over to a wide variety of other bilinear models common in the machine learning literature such as independent component analysis, dictionary learning/sparse coding, and non-negative matrix factorization.

Semi-Supervised Eigenvectors for Large-Scale Locally-Biased Learning	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						semi-supervised learning; spectral clustering; kernel methods; large-scale machine learning; local spectral methods; locally-biased learning	NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; GEOMETRIC FRAMEWORK; NYSTROM METHOD; GRAPHS; NETWORKS; PAGERANK	In many applications, one has side information, e.g., labels that are provided in a semi-supervised manner, about a specific target region of a large data set, and one wants to perform machine learning and data analysis tasks "nearby" that prespecified target region. For example, one might be interested in the clustering structure of a data graph near a prespecified "seed set" of nodes, or one might be interested in finding partitions in an image that are near a prespecified "ground truth" set of pixels. Locally-biased problems of this sort are particularly challenging for popular eigenvector-based machine learning and data analysis tools. At root, the reason is that eigenvectors are inherently global quantities, thus limiting the applicability of eigenvector-based methods in situations where one is interested in very local properties of the data. In this paper, we address this issue by providing a methodology to construct semi-supervised eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian, and we illustrate how these locally-biased eigenvectors can be used to perform locally-biased machine learning. These semi-supervised eigenvectors capture successively-orthogonalized directions of maximum variance, conditioned on being well-correlated with an input seed set of nodes that is assumed to be provided in a semi-supervised manner. We show that these semi-supervised eigenvectors can be computed quickly as the solution to a system of linear equations; and we also describe several variants of our basic method that have improved scaling properties. We provide several empirical examples demonstrating how these semi-supervised eigenvectors can be used to perform locally-biased learning; and we discuss the relationship between our results and recent machine learning algorithms that use global eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian.

Massive Atomics for Massive Parallelism on GPUs	ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES			English	Article						Performance; Management; GPU; Atomics; Parallelism; Concurrency		One important type of parallelism exploited in many applications is reduction type parallelism. In these applications, the order of the read-modify-write updates to one shared data object can be arbitrary as long as there is an imposed order for the read-modify-write updates. The typical way to parallelize these types of applications is to first let every individual thread perform local computation and save the results in thread-private data objects, and then merge the results from all worker threads in the reduction stage. All applications that fit into the map reduce framework belong to this category. Additionally, the machine learning, data mining, numerical analysis and scientific simulation applications may also benefit from reduction type parallelism. However, the parallelization scheme via the usage of thread-private data objects may not be viable in massively parallel GPU applications. Because the number of concurrent threads is extremely large (at least tens of thousands of), thread-private data object creation may lead to memory space explosion problems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to deal with shared data object management for reduction type parallelism on GPUs. Our approach exploits fine-grained parallelism while at the same time maintaining good programmability. It is based on the usage of intrinsic hardware atomic instructions. Atomic operation may appear to be expensive since it causes thread serialization when multiple threads atomically update the same memory object at the same time. However, we discovered that, with appropriate atomic collision reduction techniques, the atomic implementation can outperform the non-atomics implementation, even for benchmarks known to have high performance non-atomics GPU implementations. In the meantime, the usage of atomics can greatly reduce coding complexity as neither thread-private object management or explicit thread-communication (for the shared data objects protected by atomic operations) is necessary.

The paper discusses how model interpretability and uncertainty estimates can address this problem. A new semi-parametric approach is proposed for providing an interpretable model with improved accuracy by combining a symbolic regression model with a residual Gaussian Process. While the learned symbolic model is highly interpretable the residual model usually is not. However, by limiting the output of the residual model to a defined range a worst-case guarantee can be given in the sense that the maximal deviation from the symbolic model is always below a defined limit. The limitation of the residual model can include the uncertainty estimate of the Gaussian Process, thus giving the residual model more impact in high-confidence regions. When ranking the accuracy and interpretability of several different approaches on the SARCOS data benchmark the proposed combination yields the best result (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Specifically, given pairs of similar samples and pairs of dissimilar samples, our metric learning model aims to maximize the margin between these two kinds of sample pairs while maintaining a large mean squared distance ratio. In this way, the learned model benefits from exploiting the distributions of sample pairs and thus becomes more reliable and effective. Furthermore, the optimization problem of our model can be solved efficiently by a proposed generic iterative approximate method. The effectiveness of our model is demonstrated on various datasets including a challenging face verification dataset called Labeled Faces in the Wild. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the method, the small classes are oversampled and large classes are under-sampled. The resampling scale is determined by the ratio of the min class number and max class number. And multiple machine learning methods are selected to construct the ensemble. Numerical results show that the algorithm performance is highly related to the ratio of minority class number and attribute number. When the ratio is less than 3, the performance will be greatly hindered. Experimental results also show that the ensemble of different types of methods could improve the algorithm performance efficiently. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, its performance depends crucially on the distance function used to compute distance between samples. In this paper, we first define the concept of sample's neighborhood and present two related criteria according to neighborhood influence. Then, the influence of sample's neighborhood is comprehensively considered when computing the distances between the query and training samples. Finally, we propose an improved nearest neighbor classification algorithm via fusing neighborhood information. The proposed method can precisely characterize the distance among samples as well as enhance the predictive power of classifier to some extent. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm basically outperforms classical nearest neighbor classifier and some other state-of-the-art classification methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This has the effect of making the derivative of the activation function with respect to the net inputs, be bi-modal. That is, the derivative of the activation functions has two maxima of equal values for nonzero values of the parameter, that parametrises the proposed class of activation functions. On a set of ten function approximation tasks, the usage of the proposed activation function demonstrates that there exists network(s), using the proposed activation, and are able to achieve lower generalisation error, in equal epochs of training using the resilient backpropagation algorithm. On a set of four benchmark problems taken from UCI machine learning repository, for which the networks are trained using the resilient backpropagation algorithm, the scaled conjugate algorithm, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and the quasi-Newton BFGS algorithm, we observe that the usage of the proposed algorithms leads to better generalisation results, similar to the results for the ten function approximation tasks wherein the networks were trained using the resilient backpropagation algorithm.

The key of success is to properly tune the architecture and the connection weights of the ANN and to have the trained ANN own higher generalization ability. For complicated problems, artificial neural network ensemble classifier, instead of a single ANN classifier, is considered. But, it is not so straight forward to construct the ANN ensemble. In this paper, we propose a unified evolutionary training scheme (UETS) which can either train a generalized feedforward neural network or construct an ANN ensemble. The performance of the UETS was evaluated by applying it to solve the n-bit parity problem and the classification problems on five datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. By comparing with the previous studies, the experimental results reveal that the neural networks and the ensembles trained by the UETS have very good classification ability for unseen cases.

The approach is optimised for tasks that require a student to make interpretations across sets of resources, where opinions and justifications may be hard to articulate. We adopt a dialogue-based approach to learning whereby the student creates an external representation to reflect their current understanding of the task. This in turn prompts immediate feedback, designed to help the learner to see patterns or irregularities in their current perspective. Through the on-going feedback, the student is encouraged to make incremental changes to achieve a coherent outcome. In this approach, learners are encouraged to generate meaningful responses for themselves, rather than relying on feedback which explicitly provides an answer. This is aimed at prompting deeper processing and understanding of source materials in the context of the given learning goal.

In this paper, we systematically and comprehensively review the fundamental, brief history, and state-of-the-art developments of IQA, with emphasis on natural image quality assessment (NIQA). First, the definition of image quality is discussed, which contains three aspects and lead to different philosophies of designing IQA metrics. Afterwards, classic NIQA metrics are presented with some further discussions. Widely used databases and the performances of classic NIQA metrics on them are also listed. We highlight the most significant works and some open issues about the developments of IQA, and provide the benchmarks for the researchers and scholars who work on IQA.

Thus, recently, semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods including graph-based algorithms have attracted many interests from researchers. However, most of these algorithms used the Gaussian function to calculate weights of the edge of the graph. In this paper, we proposed a novel weight for graph-based semi-supervised algorithms. In this new algorithm, the label information is added from problem into SSL algorithm, and the geodesic distance is utilized instead of Euclidean distance to calculate the distance between two instances. Furthermore, class prior knowledge is also added from problem into the target function. In this paper, we focus on learning with local and global consistency. We found that the effect of class prior knowledge maybe different between under low-label rate and high-label rate. Experiments on two University of California Irvine (UCI) data sets and United States Postal Service handwritten digit recognition show that our proposed algorithm is really effective.

Thus, predicting the results of the grouting activity is a particularly interesting topic that has drawn the attention of researchers both from the academic field and industry. Recent literature has indicated that artificial intelligence (AI) approaches for groutability prediction are capable of delivering better performance than traditional formula-based ones. In this study, a novel AI method, evolutionary Least Squares Support Vector Machine Inference Model for groutability prediction (ELSIM-GP), is proposed to forecast the result of grouting activity that utilizes microfine cement grout. In the model, Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) is a supervised machine learning technique that is employed to learn the decision boundary for classifying high dimensional data. Differential Evolution (DE) is integrated into ELSIM-GP for automatically optimizing its tuning parameters. 240 historical cases of grouting process for sandy silt soil have been collected to train, validate, and test the inference model. Experimental results demonstrated that ELSIM-GP can overcome other benchmark approaches in terms of forecasting accuracy. Therefore, the proposed approach is a promising alternative for predicting groutability.

Motivation behind sentiment analysis is that it provides companies' methods to determine the product acceptance and ways to improve its quality. It also helps users to take purchasing decisions. Various parsing schemes/feature extraction methods have been proposed in the literature to process unstructured text to extract patterns that may help machine learning model to learn. The main limitation of the existing feature extraction techniques is the sparseness of the data and inability to incorporate semantic information. In this paper, a new feature extraction method is proposed, namely clustering features. Proposed feature extraction technique focuses on alleviating the data sparsity faced by supervised sentiment analysis by clustering of semantic features. Proposed clustering features are capable of including semantic information and alleviating data sparseness for machine learning algorithm. In all the experiments, support vector machine and Boolean Multinomial Naive Bayes (BMNB) machine learning algorithms are used for classification. Experimental results show that the proposed clustering features significantly outperform other features for document-level sentiment classification. All the experiments are performed on standard movie review data-set and product review data-sets, namely book, electronics, kitchen appliances.

J	Aguilar-Bonavides, C; Sanchez-Arias, R; Lanzas, C				Aguilar-Bonavides, Clemente; Sanchez-Arias, Reinaldo; Lanzas, Cristina			Accurate prediction of major histocompatibility complex class II epitopes by sparse representation via l(1)-minimization	BIODATA MINING			English	Article						Peptide binding; Sparse representation; MHC class II; Epitope prediction; Immunoinformatics; Machine learning; Classification algorithms	PEPTIDE BINDING PREDICTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; MHC CLASS-I	Background: The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is responsible for presenting antigens (epitopes) on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). When pathogen-derived epitopes are presented by MHC class II on an APC surface, T cells may be able to trigger an specific immune response. Prediction of MHC-II epitopes is particularly challenging because the open binding cleft of the MHC-II molecule allows epitopes to bind beyond the peptide binding groove; therefore, the molecule is capable of accommodating peptides of variable length. Among the methods proposed to predict MHC-II epitopes, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs) are the most effective methods. We propose a novel classification algorithm to predict MHC-II called sparse representation via l(1)-minimization. Results: We obtained a collection of experimentally confirmed MHC-II epitopes from the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) and applied our l(1)-minimization algorithm. To benchmark the performance of our proposed algorithm, we compared our predictions against a SVM classifier. We measured sensitivity, specificity abd accuracy; then we used Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate the performance of our method. The prediction performance of MHC-II epitopes of the l(1)-minimization algorithm was generally comparable and, in some cases, superior to the standard SVM classification method and overcame the lack of robustness of other methods with respect to outliers. While our method consistently favoured DPPS encoding with the alleles tested, SVM showed a slightly better accuracy when "11-factor" encoding was used. Conclusions: l(1)-minimization has similar accuracy than SVM, and has additional advantages, such as overcoming the lack of robustness with respect to outliers. With l(1)-minimization no model selection dependency is involved.

J	Barman, RK; Saha, S; Das, S				Barman, Ranjan Kumar; Saha, Sudipto; Das, Santasabuj			Prediction of Interactions between Viral and Host Proteins Using Supervised Machine Learning Methods	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HEPATITIS-E VIRUS; INFORMATION; SEQUENCES; NETWORK; SWINE; MODEL; INDIA	Background: Viral-host protein-protein interaction plays a vital role in pathogenesis, since it defines viral infection of the host and regulation of the host proteins. Identification of key viral-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs) has great implication for therapeutics. Methods: In this study, a systematic attempt has been made to predict viral-host PPIs by integrating different features, including domain-domain association, network topology and sequence information using viral-host PPIs from VirusMINT. The three well-known supervised machine learning methods, such as SVM, Naive Bayes and Random Forest, which are commonly used in the prediction of PPIs, were employed to evaluate the performance measure based on five-fold cross validation techniques. Results: Out of 44 descriptors, best features were found to be domain-domain association and methionine, serine and valine amino acid composition of viral proteins. In this study, SVM-based method achieved better sensitivity of 67% over Naive Bayes (37.49%) and Random Forest (55.66%). However the specificity of Naive Bayes was the highest (99.52%) as compared with SVM (74%) and Random Forest (89.08%). Overall, the SVM and Random Forest achieved accuracy of 71% and 72.41%, respectively. The proposed SVM-based method was evaluated on blind dataset and attained a sensitivity of 64%, specificity of 83%, and accuracy of 74%. In addition, unknown potential targets of hepatitis B virus-human and hepatitis E virus-human PPIs have been predicted through proposed SVM model and validated by gene ontology enrichment analysis. Our proposed model shows that, hepatitis B virus "C protein'' binds to membrane docking protein, while "X protein'' and "P protein'' interacts with cell-killing and metabolic process proteins, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed method can predict large scale interspecies viral-human PPIs. The nature and function of unknown viral proteins (HBV and HEV), interacting partners of host protein were identified using optimised SVM model.

J	Zhang, Q; Yu, H				Zhang, Qing; Yu, Hong			Computational Approaches for Predicting Biomedical Research Collaborations	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION; SMALL-WORLD; NETWORKS; BIOLOGY; SCIENCE; TOOL; WEB	Biomedical research is increasingly collaborative, and successful collaborations often produce high impact work. Computational approaches can be developed for automatically predicting biomedical research collaborations. Previous works of collaboration prediction mainly explored the topological structures of research collaboration networks, leaving out rich semantic information from the publications themselves. In this paper, we propose supervised machine learning approaches to predict research collaborations in the biomedical field. We explored both the semantic features extracted from author research interest profile and the author network topological features. We found that the most informative semantic features for author collaborations are related to research interest, including similarity of out-citing citations, similarity of abstracts. Of the four supervised machine learning models (naive Bayes, naive Bayes multinomial, SVMs, and logistic regression), the best performing model is logistic regression with an ROC ranging from 0.766 to 0.980 on different datasets. To our knowledge we are the first to study in depth how research interest and productivities can be used for collaboration prediction. Our approach is computationally efficient, scalable and yet simple to implement. The datasets of this study are available at https://github.com/qingzhanggithub/medline-collaboration-datasets.

The most common method for determining an unknown protein's structural class is to perform expensive and time-consuming manual experiments. Because of the availability of amino acid sequences generated in the post-genomic age, it is possible to predict an unknown protein's structural class using machine learning methods given a protein's amino-acid sequence and/or its secondary structural elements. Following recent research in this area, we propose a new machine learning system that is based on combining several protein descriptors extracted from different protein representations, such as position specific scoring matrix (PSSM), the amino-acid sequence, and secondary structural sequences. The prediction engine of our system is operated by an ensemble of support vector machines (SVMs), where each SVM is trained on a different descriptor. The results of each SVM are combined by sum rule. Our final ensemble produces a success rate that is substantially better than previously reported results on three well-established datasets.

J	Gasparotto, P; Ceriotti, M				Gasparotto, Piero; Ceriotti, Michele			Recognizing molecular patterns by machine learning: An agnostic structural definition of the hydrogen bond	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							LIQUID WATER; DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; HEXAGONAL ICE; DENSITY; ENERGY; PSEUDOPOTENTIALS; APPROXIMATION; PROTEINS	The concept of chemical bonding can ultimately be seen as a rationalization of the recurring structural patterns observed in molecules and solids. Chemical intuition is nothing but the ability to recognize and predict such patterns, and how they transform into one another. Here, we discuss how to use a computer to identify atomic patterns automatically, so as to provide an algorithmic definition of a bond based solely on structural information. We concentrate in particular on hydrogen bonding a central concept to our understanding of the physical chemistry of water, biological systems, and many technologically important materials. Since the hydrogen bond is a somewhat fuzzy entity that covers a broad range of energies and distances, many different criteria have been proposed and used over the years, based either on sophisticate electronic structure calculations followed by an energy decomposition analysis, or on somewhat arbitrary choices of a range of structural parameters that is deemed to correspond to a hydrogen-bonded configuration. We introduce here a definition that is univocal, unbiased, and adaptive, based on our machine-learning analysis of an atomistic simulation. The strategy we propose could be easily adapted to similar scenarios, where one has to recognize or classify structural patterns in a material or chemical compound. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

Metabolomics as a Tool for Discovery of Biomarkers of Autism Spectrum Disorder in the Blood Plasma of Children	PLOS ONE			English	Article							OXIDATIVE STRESS; AMINO-ACIDS; MITOCHONDRIAL; ABNORMALITIES; SPECTROMETRY; PERFORMANCE; ALIGNMENT; PROFILES; DATABASE; MARKERS	Background: The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at the earliest age possible is important for initiating optimally effective intervention. In the United States the average age of diagnosis is 4 years. Identifying metabolic biomarker signatures of ASD from blood samples offers an opportunity for development of diagnostic tests for detection of ASD at an early age. Objectives: To discover metabolic features present in plasma samples that can discriminate children with ASD from typically developing (TD) children. The ultimate goal is to identify and develop blood-based ASD biomarkers that can be validated in larger clinical trials and deployed to guide individualized therapy and treatment. Methods: Blood plasma was obtained from children aged 4 to 6, 52 with ASD and 30 age-matched TD children. Samples were analyzed using 5 mass spectrometry-based methods designed to orthogonally measure a broad range of metabolites. Univariate, multivariate and machine learning methods were used to develop models to rank the importance of features that could distinguish ASD from TD. Results: A set of 179 statistically significant features resulting from univariate analysis were used for multivariate modeling. Subsets of these features properly classified the ASD and TD samples in the 61-sample training set with average accuracies of 84% and 86%, and with a maximum accuracy of 81% in an independent 21-sample validation set. Conclusions: This analysis of blood plasma metabolites resulted in the discovery of biomarkers that may be valuable in the diagnosis of young children with ASD. The results will form the basis for additional discovery and validation research for 1) determining biomarkers to develop diagnostic tests to detect ASD earlier and improve patient outcomes, 2) gaining new insight into the biochemical mechanisms of various subtypes of ASD 3) identifying biomolecular targets for new modes of therapy, and 4) providing the basis for individualized treatment recommendations.

The analysis and identification of essential genes are very important for understanding the minimal requirements of cellular survival and for practical purposes. Proteins do not exert their function in isolation of one another but rather interact together in PPI networks. A global analysis of protein interaction networks provides an effective way to elucidate the relationships between proteins. With the recent large-scale identifications of essential genes and the production of large amounts of PPIs in humans, we are able to investigate the topological properties and biological properties of essential genes. However, until recently, no one has ever investigated human essential genes using topological and biological properties. In this study, for the first time, 28 topological properties and 22 biological properties were used to investigate the characteristics of essential and non-essential genes in humans. Most of the properties were statistically discriminative between essential and non-essential genes. The F-score was used to estimate the essentiality of each property. The GO-enrichment analysis was performed to investigate the functions of the essential and non-essential genes. Finally, based on the topological features and the biological characteristics, a machine-learning classifier was constructed to predict the essential genes. The results of the jackknife test and 10-fold cross validation test are encouraging, indicating that our classifier is an effective human essential gene discovery method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we constructed living and unlabelled colony image libraries of various human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines for supervised machine learning pattern recognition to accurately distinguish bona fide iPSCs from improperly reprogrammed cells. Furthermore, we found that image features for efficient discrimination reside in cellular components. In fact, extensive analysis of nuclear morphologies revealed dynamic and characteristic signatures, including the linear form of the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML)-defined structure in iPSCs, which was reversed to a regular sphere upon differentiation. Our data revealed that iPSCs have a markedly different overall nuclear architecture that may contribute to highly accurate discrimination based on the cell reprogramming status.

This work proposes that an optimizable solution does not equal a generalizable solution. We introduce a new machine learning-based Polarity Module for detecting negation in clinical text, and extensively compare its performance across domains. Using four manually annotated corpora of clinical text, we show that negation detection performance suffers when there is no in-domain development (for manual methods) or training data (for machine learning-based methods). Various factors (e.g., annotation guidelines, named entity characteristics, the amount of data, and lexical and syntactic context) play a role in making generalizability difficult, but none completely explains the phenomenon. Furthermore, generalizability remains challenging because it is unclear whether to use a single source for accurate data, combine all sources into a single model, or apply domain adaptation methods. The most reliable means to improve negation detection is to manually annotate in-domain training data (or, perhaps, manually modify rules); this is a strategy for optimizing performance, rather than generalizing it. These results suggest a direction for future work in domain-adaptive and task-adaptive methods for clinical NLP.

Most previous studies of casual relation extraction focus on simple cases like causal relations between two noun phrases indicated by fixed verbs or prepositions. For more complicated causal relations, such as causal relations between clauses, the previously developed algorithm may not work. To solve this problem, this paper develops a system that is able to extract causal relations in multi-level language expressions such as, words, phrases and clauses without fixed relators. The information extraction system is composed of a multi-level relation extractor and an ensemble-based relation classifier. It may extract more subtypes of causal relations than previous work because extracting domain is expanded in terms of both syntactic expressions and semantic meanings. In addition, the proposed method outperforms previously developed methods because extended features based on lexical semantic resources are explored. Experiments show that our system achieves an accuracy of 88.69% and F-score of 0.6637 in a dataset with 300 sentences. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	de Vries, GKD; van Someren, M				de Vries, Gerben Klaas Dirk; van Someren, Maarten			An analysis of alignment and integral based kernels for machine learning from vessel trajectories	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Alignment measures; Integral over time similarity; Vessel trajectories; Trajectory kernels	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; TIME-SERIES; SIMILARITY; DATABASES	In this paper we present an analysis of the application of the two most important types of similarity measures for moving object trajectories in machine learning from vessel movement data. These similarities are applied in the tasks of clustering, classification and outlier detection. The first similarity type are alignment measures, such as dynamic time warping and edit distance. The second type are based on the integral over time between two trajectories. Following earlier work we define these measures in the context of kernel methods, which provide state-of-the-art, robust algorithms for the tasks studied. Furthermore, we include the influence of applying piecewise linear segmentation as pre-processing to the vessel trajectories when computing alignment measures, since this has been shown to give a positive effect in computation time and performance. In our experiments the alignment based measures show the best performance. Regular versions of edit distance give the best performance in clustering and classification, whereas the softmax variant of dynamic time warping works best in outlier detection. Moreover, piecewise linear segmentation has a positive effect on alignments, due to the fact that salient points in a trajectory, especially important in clustering and outlier detection, are highlighted by the segmentation and have a large influence in the alignments. Based on our experiments, integral over time based similarity measures are not well-suited for learning from vessel trajectories. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Predicting winning and losing businesses when changing electricity tariffs	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Energy; Tariff switching; Classification; Neural Networks; Support Vector Machines; Regression models	NETWORKS	By using smart meters, more data about how businesses use energy is becoming available to energy retailers (providers). This is enabling innovation in the structure and type of tariffs on offer in the energy market. We have applied Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and Naive Bayesian Classifiers to a data set of the electrical power use by 12,000 businesses (in 44 sectors) to investigate predicting which businesses will gain or lose by switching between tariffs (a two-classes problem). We have used only three features of each company: their business sector, load profile category, and mean power use. We are particularly interested in the switch between a static tariff (fixed price or time-of-use) and a dynamic tariff (half-hourly pricing). We have extended the two-classes problem to include a price elasticity factor (a three-classes problem). We show how the classification error for the two- and three-classes problems varies with the amount of available data. Furthermore, we used Ordinary Least Squares and Support Vector Regression models to compute the exact values of the amount gained or lost by a business if it switched tariff types. Our analysis suggests that the machine learning classifiers required less data to reach useful performance levels than the regression models. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Determining the protein-protein binding affinity has been recognized not only as an important step but also as a challenging task for further understanding of the molecular mechanism and the modeling of the biological systems. Unlike the traditional methods like empirical scoring algorithms and molecular dynamic which are time consuming, we developed a fast and reliable machine learning method for the prediction of protein-protein binding affinity. Based on diverse protein-protein interface features calculated using commonly used available tools, 432 features were obtained to represent hydrogen bond, Van der Waals force, hydrophobic interaction, electrostatic force, interface shape and configuration and allosteric effect. Considering the limited number of the available structures and affinity-known protein complexes, in order to avoid overfitting and remove noises in the feature set, feature importance evaluation was implemented and 154 optimal features were selected, then the prediction model based on random forest (RF) was constructed. We demonstrate that the RE model yields promising results and the predictive power of our method is better than other existing methods. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, our model gives a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.708 on the whole benchmark dataset of 133 complexes and a high r of 0.806 on the validated set of 53 samples. When performing the same two independent datasets, our method outperforms other two methods and achieves a high r of 0.793 and 0.907 respectively. All results indicate that our method can be a useful implement in determining protein-protein binding affinity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, a method is proposed to map complex networks of AIDS prevalence in the US counties, incorporating information about the chemical structure, molecular target, organism, and results in preclinical protocols of assay for all drugs in the cocktail. Different machine learning methods were trained and validated to select the best model. The Shannon information invariants of molecular graphs for drugs, and social networks of income inequality were used as input. The nodes in molecular graphs represent atoms weighed by Pauling electronegativity values, and the links correspond to the chemical bonds. On the other hand, the nodes in the social network represent the US counties and have Gini coefficients as weights. We obtained the data about anti-HIV drugs from the ChEMBL database and the data about AIDS prevalence and Gini coefficient from the AIDSVu database of Emory University. Box-Jenkins operators were used to measure the shift with respect to average behavior of drugs from reference compounds assayed with/in a given protocol, target, or organism. To train/validate the model and predict the complex network, we needed to analyze 152,628 data points including values of AIDS prevalence in 2310 counties in the US vs. ChEMBL results for 21,582 unique drugs, 9 viral or human protein targets, 4856 protocols, and 10 possible experimental measures. The best model found was a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity above 0.80 in training and external validation series. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Bias correction for selecting the minimal-error classifier from many machine learning models	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							CROSS-VALIDATION; MICROARRAY DATA	Motivation: Supervised machine learning is commonly applied in genomic research to construct a classifier from the training data that is generalizable to predict independent testing data. When test datasets are not available, cross-validation is commonly used to estimate the error rate. Many machine learning methods are available, and it is well known that no universally best method exists in general. It has been a common practice to apply many machine learning methods and report the method that produces the smallest cross-validation error rate. Theoretically, such a procedure produces a selection bias. Consequently, many clinical studies with moderate sample sizes (e.g. n = 30-60) risk reporting a falsely small cross-validation error rate that could not be validated later in independent cohorts. Results: In this article, we illustrated the probabilistic framework of the problem and explored the statistical and asymptotic properties. We proposed a new bias correction method based on learning curve fitting by inverse power law (IPL) and compared it with three existing methods: nested cross-validation, weighted mean correction and Tibshirani-Tibshirani procedure. All methods were compared in simulation datasets, five moderate size real datasets and two large breast cancer datasets. The result showed that IPL outperforms the other methods in bias correction with smaller variance, and it has an additional advantage to extrapolate error estimates for larger sample sizes, a practical feature to recommend whether more samples should be recruited to improve the classifier and accuracy. An R package 'MLbias' and all source files are publicly available.

This new approach allows for improved EEG spatial resolution based on simultaneous fMRI activity measurements. Advanced signal processing and machine learning methods were applied on EEG data acquired simultaneously with fMRI during relaxation training guided by on-line continuous feedback on changing alpha/theta EEG measure. We focused on demonstrating improved EEG prediction of activation in sub-cortical regions such as the amygdala. Our analysis shows that a ridge regression model that is based on time/frequency representation of EEG data from a single electrode, can predict the amygdala related activity significantly better than a traditional theta/alpha activity sampled from the best electrode and about 1/3 of the times, significantly better than a linear combination of frequencies with a pre-defined delay. The far-reaching goal of our approach is to be able to reduce the need for fMRI scanning for probing specific sub-cortical regions such as the amygdala as the basis for brain-training procedures. On the other hand, activity in those regions can be characterized with higher temporal resolution than is obtained by fMRI alone thus revealing additional information about their processing mode.

Non-negative matrix factorization of multimodal MRI, fMRI and phenotypic data reveals differential changes in default mode subnetworks in ADHD	NEUROIMAGE			English	Review						fMRI; Multimodal data; NMF; ADHD; Phenotype; MRI; Latent variables; Biomarkers; Sparsity; Machine learning; Topic modeling; Attention deficit; Default mode	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY-DISORDER; ABNORMAL FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EEG/FMRI ANALYSIS; BRAIN-FUNCTION; LEAST-SQUARES; RESTING-STATE; NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION	In the multimodal neuroimaging framework, data on a single subject are collected from inherently different sources such as functional MRI, structural MRI, behavioral and/or phenotypic information. The information each source provides is not independent; a subset of features from each modality maps to one or more common latent dimensions, which can be interpreted using generative models. These latent dimensions, or "topics," provide a sparse summary of the generative process behind the features for each individual. Topic modeling, an unsupervised generative model, has been used to map seemingly disparate features to a common domain. Weuse Non-NegativeMatrix Factorization (NMF) to infer the latent structure of multimodal ADHD data containing fMRI, MRI, phenotypic and behavioral measurements. We compare four different NMF algorithms and find that the sparsest decomposition is also the most differentiating between ADHD and healthy patients. Weidentify dimensions that map to interpretable, recognizable dimensions such as motion, default mode network activity, and other such features of the input data. For example, structural and functional graph theory features related to default mode subnetworks clustered with the ADHD-Inattentive diagnosis. Structural measurements of the default mode network (DMN) regions such as the posterior cingulate, precuneus, and parahippocampal regions were all related to the ADHD-Inattentive diagnosis. Ventral DMN subnetworks may have more functional connections in ADHD-I, while dorsal DMN may have less. ADHD topics are dependent upon diagnostic site, suggesting diagnostic differences across geographic locations. We assess our findings in light of the ADHD-200 classification competition, and contrast our unsupervised, nominated topics with previously published supervised learning methods. Finally, we demonstrate the validity of these latent variables as biomarkers by using them for classification of ADHD in 730 patients. Cumulatively, this manuscript addresses how multimodal data in ADHD can be interpreted by latent dimensions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Read			Nonpolitical Images Evoke Neural Predictors of Political Ideology	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; EMOTION; DISGUST; CONSERVATISM; ATTITUDES; COGNITION; BRAIN; FMRI; REGULARIZATION; ORIENTATIONS	Political ideologies summarize dimensions of life that define how a person organizes their public and private behavior, including their attitudes associated with sex, family, education, and personal autonomy [1, 2]. Despite the abstract nature of such sensibilities, fundamental features of political ideology have been found to be deeply connected to basic biological mechanisms [3-7] that may serve to defend against environmental challenges like contamination and physical threat [8-12]. These results invite the provocative claim that neural responses to nonpolitical stimuli (like contaminated food or physical threats) should be highly predictive of abstract political opinions (like attitudes toward gun control and abortion) [13]. We applied a machine-learning method to fMRI data to test the hypotheses that brain responses to emotionally evocative images predict individual scores on a standard political ideology assay. Disgusting images, especially those related to animal-reminder disgust (e.g., mutilated body), generate neural responses that are highly predictive of political orientation even though these neural predictors do not agree with participants' conscious rating of the stimuli. Images from other affective categories do not support such predictions. Remarkably, brain responses to a single disgusting stimulus were sufficient to make accurate predictions about an individual subject's political ideology. These results provide strong support for the idea that fundamental neural processing differences that emerge under the challenge of emotionally evocative stimuli may serve to structure political beliefs in ways formerly unappreciated.

However, difficulties remain because it is unclear which elements best discriminate between tsunami and non-tsunami deposits. Herein, we propose a mathematical methodology for the geochemical discrimination of tsunami deposits using machine-learning techniques. The proposed method can determine the appropriate combinations of elements and the precise discrimination plane that best discerns tsunami deposits from non-tsunami deposits in high-dimensional compositional space through the use of data sets of bulk composition that have been categorised as tsunami or non-tsunami sediments. We applied this method to the 2011 Tohoku tsunami and to background marine sedimentary rocks. After an exhaustive search of all 262,144 (=2(18)) combinations of the 18 analysed elements, we observed several tens of combinations with discrimination rates higher than 99.0%. The analytical results show that elements such as Ca and several heavy-metal elements are important for discriminating tsunami deposits from marine sedimentary rocks. These elements are considered to reflect the formation mechanism and origin of the tsunami deposits. The proposed methodology has the potential to aid in the identification of past tsunamis by using other tsunami proxies.

This implies that only a few miRNAs can function as effective tumor suppressors. It is also the basis of our strategy to define functionally relevant miRNA target genes that are not under redundant control by other miRNAs. We identified a functionally interconnected group of miRNAs that exhibited a reduced abundance in leukemia cells from patients with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). To pinpoint relevant target genes, we applied a machine learning approach to eliminate genes that were subject to redundant miRNA-mediated control and to identify those genes that were exclusively targeted by tumor-suppressive miRNAs. This strategy revealed the convergence of a small group of tumor suppressor miRNAs on the Myb oncogene, as well as their effects on HBP1, which encodes a transcription factor. The expression of both genes was increased in T-ALL patient samples, and each gene promoted the progression of T-ALL in mice. Hence, our systematic analysis of tumor suppressor miRNA action identified a widespread mechanism of oncogene activation in T-ALL.

Research has identified miRNAs dysregulations in several but distinct pathophysiological processes, which hints at distinct systems-biology functions of miRNAs. The present analysis approached the role of miRNAs from a genomics perspective and assessed the biological roles of 2954 genes and 788 human miRNAs, which can be considered to interact, based on empirical evidence and computational predictions of miRNA versus gene interactions. Results: From a genomics perspective, the biological processes in which the genes that are influenced by miRNAs are involved comprise of six major topics comprising biological regulation, cellular metabolism, information processing, development, gene expression and tissue homeostasis. The usage of this knowledge as a guidance for further research is sketched for two genetically defined functional areas: cell death and gene expression. Results suggest that the latter points to a fundamental role of miRNAs consisting of hyper-regulation of gene expression, i.e., the control of the expression of such genes which control specifically the expression of genes. Conclusions: Laboratory research identified contributions of miRNA regulation to several distinct biological processes. The present analysis transferred this knowledge to a systems-biology level. A comprehensible and precise description of the biological processes in which the genes that are influenced by miRNAs are notably involved could be made. This knowledge can be employed to guide future research concerning the biological role of miRNA (dys-) regulations. The analysis also suggests that miRNAs especially control the expression of genes that control the expression of genes.

Geometric features may easily lose much feature information characterizing facial beauty, rely heavily on accurate manual landmark localization of facial features and impose strict restrictions on training samples. Deep architectures have been recently demonstrated to be a promising area of research in statistical machine learning. In this paper, deep self-taught learning is utilized to obtain hierarchical representations, learn the concept of facial beauty and produce human-like predictor. Deep learning is helpful to recognize a broad range of visual concept effectively characterizing facial beauty. Through deep learning, reasonable apparent features of face images are extracted without depending completely on artificial feature selection. Self-taught learning, which has the ability of automatically improving network systems to understand the characteristics of data distribution and making recognition significantly easier and cheaper, is used to relax strict restrictions of training samples. Moreover, in order to choose a more appropriate method for mapping high-level representations into beauty ratings efficiently, we compare the performance of five regression methods and prove that support vector machine (SVM) regression is better. In addition, novel applications of deep self-taught learning on local binary pattern (LBP) and Gabor filters are presented, and the improvements on facial beauty prediction are shown by deep self-taught learning combined with LBP. Finally, human-like performance is obtained with learning features in full-sized and high-resolution images. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

L2-norm regularization has been commonly used. If the training data set contains many noise features, L1-norm regularization SVM will provide a better performance. However, both L1-norm and L2-norm are not the optimal regularization method when handling a large number of redundant features and only a small amount of data points are useful for machine learning. We have therefore proposed an adaptive learning algorithm using the p-norm regularization SVM for 0 < p <= 2. Leveraging on the theory of Legendre-Fenchel duality, we derive a variational quadratic upper bound of non-differentiable non-convex Lp-norm regularized term when 0 < p <= 1. Generalization error bounds for non-integer norm regularization SVM were provided. Five cancer data sets from public data banks were used for the evaluation. All five evaluations empirically showed that the new adaptive algorithm was able to achieve the optimal prediction error using a less than L1 norm. On the seven different data sets having different sizes and different application domains, our approach was evaluated and compared to current state-of-the-art L1-norm and L2-norm SVM, repeatedly demonstrating that proposed method substantially improved performance. Moreover, we observed that the proposed p-norm penalty is more robust to noise features than the L1-norm and L2-norm penalties. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Analysis and applications to large-scale SVM training	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Learning from massive datasets; Large-scale support vector machines; Frank-Wolfe methods; Concave optimization; Quadratic programming	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CLASSIFIER DESIGN; CORE-SETS; CONVERGENCE; BALLS; POINT; SMO	Recently, there has been a renewed interest in the machine learning community for variants of a sparse greedy approximation procedure for concave optimization known as the Frank-Wolfe (FW) method. In particular, this procedure has been successfully applied to train large-scale instances of non-linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Specializing FW to SVM training has allowed to obtain efficient algorithms, but also important theoretical results, including convergence analysis of training algorithms and new characterizations of model sparsity. In this paper, we present and analyze a novel variant of the FW method based on a new way to perform away steps, a classic strategy used to accelerate the convergence of the basic FW procedure. Our formulation and analysis is focused on a general concave maximization problem on the simplex. However, the specialization of our algorithm to quadratic forms is strongly related to some classic methods in computational geometry, namely the Gilbert and MDM algorithms. On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that the method matches the guarantees in terms of convergence rate and number of iterations obtained by using classic away steps. In particular, the method enjoys a linear rate of convergence, a result that has been recently proved for MDM on quadratic forms. On the practical side, we provide experiments on several classification datasets, and evaluate the results using statistical tests. Experiments show that our method is faster than the FW method with classic away steps, and works well even in the cases in which classic away steps slow down the algorithm. Furthermore, these improvements are obtained without sacrificing the predictive accuracy of the obtained SVM model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Lack of glottal-induced pitch leads to low energy, and an inherent noise-like spectral distribution reduces intelligibility. Much research has been devoted to processing of whispers, including conversion of whispers to speech. Unfortunately, among several approaches, the best reconstructed speech to date still contains obviously artificial muffles and suffers from an unnatural prosody. To address these issues, the novel use of multiple restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) is reported as a statistical conversion model between whisper and speech spectral envelopes. Moreover, the accuracy of estimated pitch is improved using machine learning techniques for pitch estimation within only voiced (V) regions. Both objective and subjective evaluations show that this new method improves the quality of whisper-reconstructed speech compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

A method to determine the mammographic regions that show early changes due to the development of breast cancer	PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						region-of-interest; breast cancer risk assesment; machine learning; statistical modelling; model selection; image analysis; mammography	PARENCHYMAL PATTERNS; TEXTURE ANALYSIS; RISK-FACTORS; CLASSIFICATION; TISSUE; FEATURES; MICROCALCIFICATIONS; DENSITIES; DIAGNOSIS; IMAGES	It is well understood nowadays that changes in the mammographic parenchymal pattern are an indicator of a risk of breast cancer and we have developed a statistical method that estimates the mammogram regions where the parenchymal changes, due to breast cancer, occur. This region of interest is computed from a score map by utilising the anatomical breast coordinate system developed in our previous work. The method also makes an automatic scale selection to avoid overfitting while the region estimates are computed by a nested cross-validation scheme. In this way, it is possible to recover those mammogram regions that show a significant difference in classification scores between the cancer and the control group. Our experiments suggested that the most significant mammogram region is the region behind the nipple and that can be justified by previous findings from other research groups. This result was conducted on the basis of the cross-validation experiments on independent training, validation and testing sets from the case-control study of 490 women, of which 245 women were diagnosed with breast cancer within a period of 2-4 years after the baseline mammograms. We additionally generalised the estimated region to another, mini-MIAS study and showed that the transferred region estimate gives at least a similar classification result when compared to the case where the whole breast region is used. In all, by following our method, one most likely improves both preclinical and follow-up breast cancer screening, but a larger study population will be required to test this hypothesis.

J	Chu, C; Zhang, J; Wu, YF				Chu, Chong; Zhang, Jin; Wu, Yufeng			GINDEL: Accurate Genotype Calling of Insertions and Deletions from Low Coverage Population Sequence Reads	PLOS ONE			English	Article							COPY NUMBER VARIATION; SCALE; DISCOVERY; MAP	Insertions and deletions (indels) are important types of structural variations. Obtaining accurate genotypes of indels may facilitate further genetic study. There are a few existing methods for calling indel genotypes from sequence reads. However, none of these tools can accurately call indel genotypes for indels of all lengths, especially for low coverage sequence data. In this paper, we present GINDEL, an approach for calling genotypes of both insertions and deletions from sequence reads. GINDEL uses a machine learning approach which combines multiple features extracted from next generation sequencing data. We test our approach on both simulated and real data and compare with existing tools, including Genome STRiP, Pindel and Clever-sv. Results show that GINDEL works well for deletions larger than 50 bp on both high and low coverage data. Also, GINDEL performs well for insertion genotyping on both simulated and real data. For comparison, Genome STRiP performs less well for shorter deletions (50-200 bp) on both simulated and real sequence data from the 1000 Genomes Project. Clever-sv performs well for intermediate deletions (200-1500 bp) but is less accurate when coverage is low. Pindel only works well for high coverage data, but does not perform well at low coverage. To summarize, we show that GINDEL not only can call genotypes of insertions and deletions (both short and long) for high and low coverage population sequence data, but also is more accurate and efficient than other approaches.

The identification of cell types from structure, a classic method, relies on the time-consuming step of arbor tracing. However, as genetic tools and imaging methods make data-driven approaches to neuronal circuit analysis feasible, the need for automated processing increases. Here, we first establish that mouse retinal ganglion cell types can be as precise about distributing their arbor volumes across the inner plexiform layer as they are about distributing the skeletons of the arbors. Then, we describe an automated approach to computing the spatial distribution of the dendrite arbors, or arbor density, with respect to a global depth coordinate based on this observation. Our method involves three-dimensional reconstruction of neuronal arbors by a supervised machine learning algorithm, post-processing of the enhanced stacks to remove somata and isolate the neuron of interest, and registration of neurons to each other using automatically detected arbors of the starburst amacrine interneurons as fiducial markers. In principle, this method could be generalizable to other structures of the CNS, provided that they allow sparse labeling of the cells and contain a reliable axis of spatial reference.

J	Liu, ZY; Zhou, P; Chen, G; Guo, LD				Liu, Zhiyong; Zhou, Ping; Chen, Gang; Guo, Ledong			Evaluating a coupled discrete wavelet transform and support vector regression for daily and monthly streamflow forecasting	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Wavelet analysis; Support vector regression; Streamflow forecasting; Model averaging; Indiana	TIME-SERIES; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MODEL SELECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MACHINES; PREDICTION; RIVER; IDENTIFICATION; PRECIPITATION; INFERENCE	This study investigated the performance and potential of a hybrid model that combined the discrete wavelet transform and support vector regression (the DWT-SVR model) for daily and monthly stream-flow forecasting. Three key factors of the wavelet decomposition phase (mother wavelet, decomposition level, and edge effect) were proposed to consider for improving the accuracy of the DWT-SVR model. The performance of DWT-SVR models with different combinations of these three factors was compared with the regular SVR model. The effectiveness of these models was evaluated using the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE). Daily and monthly streamflow data observed at two stations in Indiana, United States, were used to test the forecasting skill of these models. The results demonstrated that the different hybrid models did not always outperform the SVR model for 1-day and 1-month lead time streamflow forecasting. This suggests that it is crucial to consider and compare the three key factors when using the DVVT-SVR model (or other machine learning methods coupled with the wavelet transform), rather than choosing them based on personal preferences. We then combined forecasts from multiple candidate DWT-SVR models using a model averaging technique based upon Akaike's information criterion (AIC). This ensemble prediction was superior to the single best DWT-SVR model and regular SVR model for both 1-day and 1-month ahead predictions. With respect to longer lead times (i.e., 2- and 3-day and 2-month), the ensemble predictions using the AIC averaging technique were consistently better than the best DWT-SVR model and SVR model. Therefore, integrating model averaging techniques with the hybrid DVVT-SVR model would be a promising approach for daily and monthly streamflow forecasting. Additionally, we strongly recommend considering these three key factors when using wavelet-based SVR models (or other wavelet-based forecasting models). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Giggins, OM; Sweeney, KT; Caulfield, B				Giggins, Oonagh M.; Sweeney, Kevin T.; Caulfield, Brian			Rehabilitation exercise assessment using inertial sensors: a cross-sectional analytical study	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						Inertial sensors; Rehabilitation; Exercise; Performance classification	THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; WII FIT; BALANCE; OSTEOARTHRITIS; SYSTEM; PAIN	Background: Accurate assessments of adherence and exercise performance are required in order to ensure that patients adhere to and perform their rehabilitation exercises correctly within the home environment. Inertial sensors have previously been advocated as a means of achieving these requirements, by using them as an input to an exercise biofeedback system. This research sought to investigate whether inertial sensors, and in particular a single sensor, can accurately classify exercise performance in patients performing lower limb exercises for rehabilitation purposes. Methods: Fifty-eight participants (19 male, 39 female, age: 53.9 +/- 8.5 years, height: 1.69 +/- 0.08 m, weight: 74.3 +/- 13.0 kg) performed ten repetitions of seven lower limb exercises (hip abduction, hip flexion, hip extension, knee extension, heel slide, straight leg raise, and inner range quadriceps). Three inertial sensor units, secured to the thigh, shin and foot of the leg being exercised, were used to acquire data during each exercise. Machine learning classification methods were applied to quantify the acquired data. Results: The classification methods achieved relatively high accuracy at distinguishing between correct and incorrect performance of an exercise using three, two, or one sensor while moderate efficacy scores were also achieved by the classifier when attempting to classify the particular error in exercise performance. Results also illustrated that a reduction in the number of inertial sensor units employed has little effect on the overall efficacy results. Conclusion: The results revealed that it is possible to classify lower limb exercise performance using inertial sensors with satisfactory levels of accuracy and reducing the number of sensors employed does not reduce the accuracy of the method.

In this paper, an effective and efficient Web-based knowledge acquisition approach is proposed for extracting Web news full content from news site databases using site-side news search engines as query interfaces. We do not crawl the news sites to collect news pages. Instead, we use news search engines affiliated to the news sites to search for the desired news articles directly from the news site databases. We give the search keywords to the search engines and extract the full content of the news articles without the process of machine learning or pattern matching. This approach is applicable to general news sites, and the experimental results show that it can extract a large amount of Web news content from news site databases automatically, quickly, and accurately.

To be used as a MSR, the mobile robot should have the abilities to follow a running human and avoid dynamically moving obstacles in an unstructured outdoor environment. To detect a human by a laser range finder (LRF), we defined features of the human body in LRF data and employed a support vector data description method. In order to avoid moving obstacles while tracking a running person, we defined a weighted radius for each obstacle using the relative velocity between the robot and an obstacle. For smoothly bypassing obstacles without collision, a dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithm for the MSR is implemented, which directly employed a real-time position vector between the robot and the shortest path around the obstacle. We verified the feasibility of these proposed algorithms through experimentation in different outdoor environments.

Usually used to control virtual cells in developmental models, recent works showed that gene regulatory networks are also capable to control various kinds of agents such as foraging agents, pole cart, swarm robots, etc. This paper details how a gene regulatory network is evolved to drive on any track through a three-stages incremental evolution. To do so, the inputs and outputs of the network are directly mapped to the car sensors and actuators. To make this controller a competitive racer, we have distorted its inputs online to make it drive faster and to avoid opponents. Another interesting property emerges from this approach: the regulatory network is naturally resistant to noise. To evaluate this approach, we participated in the 2013 simulated racing car competition against eight other evolutionary and scripted approaches. After its first participation, this approach finished in third place in the competition.

J	Shahbaba, M; Beheshti, S				Shahbaba, Mahdi; Beheshti, Soosan			MACE-means clustering	SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Clustering; Validity index; Order selection; Overlapping clusters	NUMBER	In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating the correct number of clusters from a new perspective. The proposed method probabilistically estimates the Average Central Error (ACE), which is the difference between the true cluster centers and their estimations. The novelty of this work is partly in estimating the unavailable ACE by using the available cluster compactness that is the difference between estimated centers and their members. The application of this approach is explored with K-means clustering. The proposed method denoted by Minimum ACE K-means (MACE-means) is shown to have unique advantages both with synthetic and real data. MACE-means clustering is applied to benchmark real world data sets from UCI machine learning repository and other synthesized clusters that represent a wide class of clustering scenarios. Our analysis confirms superiority of MACE-means over the state of the art clustering methods in robustness to the initialization error, accuracy in detecting the correct number of clusters, having less time complexity, and robustness to cluster overlapping.

Feature selection addresses the dimensionality reduction problem by determining a subset of available features to build a good model for classification or prediction, while the class-imbalance problem arises when the class distribution is too skewed. Both issues have been independently studied in the literature, and a plethora of methods to address high dimensionality as well as class-imbalance has been proposed. The aim of this work is to simultaneously explore both issues, proposing a family of methods that select those attributes that are relevant for the identification of the target class in binary classification. We propose a backward elimination approach based on successive holdout steps, whose contribution measure is based on a balanced loss function obtained on an independent subset. Our experiments are based on six highly imbalanced microarray data sets, comparing our methods with well-known feature selection techniques, and obtaining a better prediction with consistently fewer relevant features.

Segmentation of blurred objects by classification of isolabel contours	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Blurred objects segmentation; Isolabel-contour map; Support vector machine; Supervised machine learning; Brain lesion segmentation	MEDICAL IMAGE SEGMENTATION; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS LESIONS; MODELS; QUANTIFICATION	Segmentation of objects with blurred boundaries is an important and challenging problem, especially in the field of medical image analysis. A new approach to segmentation of homogeneous blurred objects in grayscale images is described in this paper. The proposed algorithm is based on building of an isolabel-contour map of the image and classification of closed isolabel contours by the SVM. Each closed isolabel contour is described by the feature vector that can include intensity-based features of the image area enclosed by the contour, as well as geometrical features of the contour shape. The image labeling procedure for construction of the training base becomes very fast and convenient because it is reduced to clicking on isolabel contours delineating the objects of interest on the isolabel-contour map. The proposed algorithm was applied to the problem of brain lesion segmentation in MRI and demonstrated performance figures above 98% on real data, both in sensitivity and in specificity.

However, it is very sensitive to noisy, redundant and irrelevant features, which may cause its performance to deteriorate. Feature weighting methods try to overcome this problem by incorporating weights into the similarity function to increase or reduce the importance of each feature, according to how they behave in the classification task. This paper proposes a new feature weighting classifier, in which the computation of the weights is based on a novel idea combining imputation methods - used to estimate a new distribution of values for each feature based on the rest of the data - and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov nonparametric statistical test to measure the changes between the original and imputed distribution of values. This proposal is compared with classic and recent feature weighting methods. The experimental results show that our feature weighting scheme is very resilient to the choice of imputation method and is an effective way of improving the performance of the Nearest Neighbor classifier, outperforming the rest of the classifiers considered in the comparisons.

Mapping model validation metrics to subject matter expert scores for model adequacy assessment	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						Model validation; Validation metrics; Subject matter experts; Probabilistic neural networks; Machine learning	PROBABILISTIC NEURAL-NETWORKS; PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; COMPUTATIONAL MODELS; VERIFICATION; SYSTEMS; QUANTIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION; UNCERTAINTY; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK	This paper develops a novel approach to incorporate the contributions of both quantitative validation metrics and qualitative subject matter expert (SME) evaluation criteria in model validation assessment. The relationship between validation metrics (input) and SME scores (output) is formulated as a classification problem, and a probabilistic neural network (PNN) is constructed to execute this mapping. Establishing PNN classifiers for a wide variety of combinations of validation metrics allows for a quantitative comparison of validation metric performance in representing SME judgment. An advantage to this approach is that it semi-automates the model validation process and subsequently is capable of incorporating the contributions of large data sets of disparate response quantities of interest in model validation assessment. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on a complex real-world problem involving the shock qualification testing of a floating shock platform. A data set of experimental and simulated pairs of time history comparisons along with associated SME scores and computed validation metrics is obtained and utilized to construct the PNN classifiers through K-fold cross validation. A wide range of validation metrics for time history comparisons is considered including feature-specific metrics (phase and magnitude error), a frequency metric (shock response spectra), a time-frequency metric (wavelet decomposition), and a global metric (index of agreement). The PNN classifiers constructed using a Parzen kernel for the class conditional probability density function whose smoothing parameter is optimized using a genetic algorithm performs well in representing SME judgment.

Conventional approaches based on manual qualitative evaluations (e. g., artifacts inspection) are deficient in the sense that (i) they are time-consuming, (ii) they usually suffer from the authority constraints, and (iii) they are often subjective. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a novel semi-automated approach to software process evaluation using machine learning techniques. In this study, we mainly focus on the procedure aspect of software processes, and formulate the problem as a sequence (with additional information, e. g., time, roles, etc.) classification task, which is solved by applying machine learning algorithms. Based on the framework, we define a new quantitative indicator to evaluate the execution of a software process more objectively. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we apply it to evaluate the execution of a defect management (DM) process in nine real industrial software projects. Our empirical results show that our approach is effective and promising in providing a more objective and quantitative measurement for the DM process evaluation task. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to compare our proposed machine learning approach with an existing conventional approach (i. e., artifacts inspection). Finally, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches in detail.	[Chen, Ning; Hoi, Steven C.

We study software bug characteristics by sampling 2,060 real world bugs in three large, representative open-source projects-the Linux kernel, Mozilla, and Apache. We manually study these bugs in three dimensions-root causes, impacts, and components. We further study the correlation between categories in different dimensions, and the trend of different types of bugs. The findings include: (1) semantic bugs are the dominant root cause. As software evolves, semantic bugs increase, while memory-related bugs decrease, calling for more research effort to address semantic bugs; (2) the Linux kernel operating system (OS) has more concurrency bugs than its non-OS counterparts, suggesting more effort into detecting concurrency bugs in operating system code; and (3) reported security bugs are increasing, and the majority of them are caused by semantic bugs, suggesting more support to help developers diagnose and fix security bugs, especially semantic security bugs. In addition, to reduce the manual effort in building bug benchmarks for evaluating bug detection and diagnosis tools, we use machine learning techniques to classify 109,014 bugs automatically.

Locus minimization in breed prediction using artificial neural network approach	ANIMAL GENETICS			English	Article						breed assignment; DNA markers; goat breed; webserver	MICROSATELLITE MARKERS; GENETIC DIVERSITY; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; ASSIGNMENT; IDENTIFICATION	Molecular markers, viz. microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms, have revolutionized breed identification through the use of small samples of biological tissue or germplasm, such as blood, carcass samples, embryos, ova and semen, that show no evident phenotype. Classical tools of molecular data analysis for breed identification have limitations, such as the unavailability of referral breed data, causing increased cost of collection each time, compromised computational accuracy and complexity of the methodology used. We report here the successful use of an artificial neural network (ANN) in background to decrease the cost of genotyping by locus minimization. The webserver is freely accessible () to the research community. We demonstrate that the machine learning (ANN) approach for breed identification is capable of multifold advantages such as locus minimization, leading to a drastic reduction in cost, and web availability of reference breed data, alleviating the need for repeated genotyping each time one investigates the identity of an unknown breed. To develop this model web implementation based on ANN, we used 51850 samples of allelic data of microsatellite-marker-based DNA fingerprinting on 25 loci covering 22 registered goat breeds of India for training. Minimizing loci to up to nine loci through the use of a multilayer perceptron model, we achieved 96.63% training accuracy. This server can be an indispensable tool for identification of existing breeds and new synthetic commercial breeds, leading to protection of intellectual property in case of sovereignty and bio-piracy disputes. This server can be widely used as a model for cost reduction by locus minimization for various other flora and fauna in terms of variety, breed and/or line identification, especially in conservation and improvement programs.

Major EDCs are associated with the androgen receptor (AR) and oestrogen receptors (ERs). Because of the high cost and time-consuming nature of experimental tests, in silico methods are valuable alternative tools for the identification of EDCs. In this study, a large dataset related to EDCs was constructed. Each molecule was represented with seven fingerprints, and computational models were subsequently developed to predict AR and ER binders via machine learning methods including k-nearest neighbour (kNN), C4.5 decision tree (C4.5 DT), naive Bayes (NB), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. The best model for predicting AR binders was PubChem Fingerprint-SVM, which exhibited an accuracy of 0.84. For ER binders, the best method was Extended Fingerprint-SVM with an accuracy of 0.79. Moreover, several representative substructure alerts for characterizing EDCs, such as phenol, trifluoromethyl, and annelated rings, were identified using the combination of information gain and substructure frequency analysis. Our study involved a systematic computational assessment of EDCs related to AR and ERs, and provides significant information on the structural characteristics of these chemicals, which are a great help in identifying EDCs.

Joint Demosaicing and Denoising via Learned Nonparametric Random Fields	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						Demosaicing; denoising; regression tree fields	SENSOR DIGITAL CAMERAS; SAMPLED COLOR IMAGES; ALTERNATING PROJECTIONS; QUALITY ASSESSMENT; NOISE; INTERPOLATION; ALGORITHM; VISION; MODEL	We introduce a machine learning approach to demosaicing, the reconstruction of color images from incomplete color filter array samples. There are two challenges to overcome by a demosaicing method: 1) it needs to model and respect the statistics of natural images in order to reconstruct natural looking images and 2) it should be able to perform well in the presence of noise. To facilitate an objective assessment of current methods, we introduce a public ground truth data set of natural images suitable for research in image demosaicing and denoising. We then use this large data set to develop a machine learning approach to demosaicing. Our proposed method addresses both demosaicing challenges by learning a statistical model of images and noise from hundreds of natural images. The resulting model performs simultaneous demosaicing and denoising. We show that the machine learning approach has a number of benefits: 1) the model is trained to directly optimize a user-specified performance measure such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) or structural similarity; 2) we can handle novel color filter array layouts by retraining the model on such layouts; and 3) it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art, in some setups by 0.7-dB PSNR, faithfully reconstructing edges, textures, and smooth areas. Our results demonstrate that in demosaicing and related imaging applications, discriminatively trained machine learning models have the potential for peak performance at comparatively low engineering effort.

Quantitative forecasting of PTSD from early trauma responses: A Machine Learning application	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); Course and prognosis; Early prediction; Forecasting; Machine Learning; Markov boundary feature selection; Support Vector Machines	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; SELF-REPORT; METAANALYSIS; SCALE; RISK; PREDICTORS; SURVIVORS; SYMPTOMS; INJURY; ADULTS	There is broad interest in predicting the clinical course of mental disorders from early, multimodal clinical and biological information. Current computational models, however, constitute a significant barrier to realizing this goal. The early identification of trauma survivors at risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is plausible given the disorder's salient onset and the abundance of putative biological and clinical risk indicators. This work evaluates the ability of Machine Learning (ML) forecasting approaches to identify and integrate a panel of unique predictive characteristics and determine their accuracy in forecasting non-remitting PTSD from information collected within10 days of a traumatic event. Data on event characteristics, emergency department observations, and early symptoms were collected in 957 trauma survivors, followed for fifteen months. An ML feature selection algorithm identified a set of predictors that rendered all others redundant. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as well as other ML classification algorithms were used to evaluate the forecasting accuracy of i) ML selected features, ii) all available features without selection, and iii) Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) symptoms alone. SVM also compared the prediction of a) PTSD diagnostic status at 15 months to b) posterior probability of membership in an empirically derived non-remitting PTSD symptom trajectory. Results are expressed as mean Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC). The feature selection algorithm identified 16 predictors, present in >= 95% cross-validation trials. The accuracy of predicting non-remitting PTSD from that set (AUC = .77) did not differ from predicting from all available information (AUC = .78). Predicting from ASD symptoms was not better then chance (AUC = .60). The prediction of PTSD status was less accurate than that of membership in a non-remitting trajectory (AUC = .71). ML methods may fill a critical gap in forecasting PTSD. The ability to identify and integrate unique risk indicators makes this a promising approach for developing algorithms that infer probabilistic risk of chronic posttraumatic stress psychopathology based on complex sources of biological, psychological, and social information.

We discuss an approximation approach that we call matrix ridge approximation. In particular, we define the matrix ridge approximation as an incomplete matrix factorization plus a ridge term. Moreover, we present probabilistic interpretations using a normal latent variable model and a Wishart model for this approximation approach. The idea behind the latent variable model in turn leads us to an efficient EM iterative method for handling the matrix ridge approximation problem. Finally, we illustrate the applications of the approximation approach in multivariate data analysis. Empirical studies in spectral clustering and Gaussian process regression show that the matrix ridge approximation with the EM iteration is potentially useful.

The proposed CPG aims to be a model free solution for the generation of bipedal walking, not requiring the use of inverse kinematical models and previously defined joint trajectories. The proposed incremental construction of bipedal walking allows an easier parametrization and performance evaluation throughout the design process. Furthermore, the approach provides for a developmental mechanism, which enables progressively building a motor repertoire. It would easily benefit from evolutionary robotics and machine learning to explore this aspect. The proposed CPG system also offers a good substrate for the inclusion of feedback mechanisms for modulation and adaptation. It is explored a phase regulation mechanism using load sensory information, observable in vertebrate legged animals. Results from simulations, on HOAP and DARwIn-OP in Webots software show the adequacy of the locomotor system to generate bipedal walk on different robots. Experiments on a DARwIn-OP demonstrates how it can accomplish locomotion and how the proposed work can generalize, achieving several distinct locomotor behaviors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Of daemons and men: A file system approach towards intrusion detection	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Intrusion detection systems; Information security; Machine learning; Data mining; File system; Anomaly detection	CLASSIFICATION; NETWORKS; SUPPORT; MODELS; CALLS	We present (FIDS)-D-2 a file system, host based anomaly detection system that monitors Basic Security Module (BSM) audit records and determines whether a web server has been compromised by comparing monitored activity generated from the web server to a normal usage profile. Additionally, we propose a set of features extracted from file system specific BSM audit records, as well as an IDS that identifies attacks based on a decision engine that employs one-class classification using a moving window on incoming data. We have used two different machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and our evaluation is performed on real-world datasets collected from three web servers and a honeynet. Results are very promising, since FI2DS detection rates range between 91% and 95.9% with corresponding false positive rates ranging between 8.1 x 10(-2) % and 9.3 x 10(-4) %. Comparison of (FIDS)-D-2 to another state-of-the-art filesystem-based IDS, FWRAP, indicates higher effectiveness of the proposed IDS in all three datasets. Within the context of this paper FI2DS is evaluated for the web daemon user; nevertheless, it can be directly extended to model any daemon-user for both intrusion detection and postmortem analysis.

Training algorithms for Radial Basis Function Networks to tackle learning processes with imbalanced data-sets	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Imbalanced data sets; Radial Basis Function Networks; Training algorithms; Evolutionary computation	TIME-SERIES PREDICTION; FUNCTION NEURAL-NETWORKS; BASIS FUNCTION CENTERS; MULTIPLE DATA SETS; RBF NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS; CLASSIFIERS; IDENTIFICATION	Nowadays, many real applications comprise data-sets where the distribution of the classes is significantly different. These data-sets are commonly known as imbalanced data-sets. Traditional classifiers are not able to deal with these kinds of data-sets because they tend to classify only majority classes, obtaining poor results for minority classes. The approaches that have been proposed to address this problem can be categorized into three types: resampling methods, algorithmic adaptations and cost sensitive techniques. Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs), artificial neural networks composed of local models or RBFs, have demonstrated their efficiency in different machine learning areas. Centers, widths and output weights for the RBFs must be determined when designing RBFNs. Taking into account the locally tuned response of RBFs, the objective of this paper is to study the influence of global and local paradigms on the weights training phase, within the RBFNs design methodology, for imbalanced data-sets. Least Mean Square and the Singular Value Decomposition have been chosen as representatives of local and global weights training paradigms respectively. These learning algorithms are inserted into classical RBFN design methods that are run on imbalanced data-sets and also on these data-sets preprocessed with re-balance techniques. After applying statistical tests to the results obtained, some guidelines about the RBFN design methodology for imbalanced data-sets are provided. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The exploration of human brain function using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a promising method to understand brain activity. However, the complexity of the big data generated by fMRI facilitates the analysis of various levels of human brain activity, such as the distribution of neural representations, the interaction between different regions, and the dynamic interaction over time. These different levels can depict distinct prospects of the human brain activity, and considerable progress has been achieved. In the future, more big data analysis methods combining advances in computer science, including larger-scale computing, machine learning, and graph theory, will promote the understanding of the human brain.

One of the most frequent hallmarks and usually also the first manifestation of PD is deterioration of handwriting characterized by micrographia and changes in kinematics of handwriting. There is no objective quantitative method of clinical diagnosis of PD. It is thought that PD can only be definitively diagnosed at postmortem, which further highlights the complexities of diagnosis. Methods: We exploit the fact that movement during handwriting of a text consists not only from the on-surface movements of the hand, but also from the in-air trajectories performed when the hand moves in the air from one stroke to the next. We used a digitizing tablet to assess both in-air and on-surface kinematic variables during handwriting of a sentence in 37 PD patients on medication and 38 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Results: By applying feature selection algorithms and support vector machine learning methods to separate PD patients from healthy controls, we demonstrated that assessing the in-air/on-surface hand movements led to accurate classifications in 84% and 78% of subjects, respectively. Combining both modalities improved the accuracy by another 1% over the evaluation of in-air features alone and provided medically relevant diagnosis with 85.61% prediction accuracy. Conclusions: Assessment of in-air movements during handwriting has a major impact on disease classification accuracy. This study confirms that handwriting can be used as a marker for PD and can be with advance used in decision support systems for differential diagnosis of PD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A machine learning approach to multi-level ECG signal quality classification	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						ECG; Signal quality; Multi-level classification; Machine learning; Support vector machine	ARRHYTHMIA DATABASE; DATA FUSION; ALGORITHM; INDEXES; FILTER; RULES	Current electrocardiogram (ECG) signal quality assessment studies have aimed to provide a two-level classification: clean or noisy. However, clinical usage demands more specific noise level classification for varying applications. This work outlines a five-level ECG signal quality classification algorithm. A total of 13 signal quality metrics were derived from segments of ECG waveforms, which were labeled by experts. A support vector machine (SVM) was trained to perform the classification and tested on a simulated dataset and was validated using data from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB). The simulated training and test datasets were created by selecting clean segments of the ECG in the 2011 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge database, and adding three types of real ECG noise at different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels from the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database (NSTDB). The MITDB was re-annotated for five levels of signal quality. Different combinations of the 13 metrics were trained and tested on the simulated datasets and the best combination that produced the highest classification accuracy was selected and validated on the MITDB. Performance was assessed using classification accuracy (Ac), and a single class overlap accuracy (OAc), which assumes that an individual type classified into an adjacent class is acceptable. An Ac of 80.26% and an OAc of 98.60% on the test set were obtained by selecting 10 metrics while 57.26% (Ac) and 94.23% (OAc) were the numbers for the unseen MITDB validation data without retraining. By performing the fivefold cross validation, an Ac of 88.07 +/- 0.32% and OAc of 99.34 +/- 0.07% were gained on the validation fold of MITDB. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Automated Scoring of Teachers' Open-Ended Responses to Video Prompts: Bringing the Classroom-Video-Analysis Assessment to Scale	EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						classroom-video-analysis assessment; automated scoring; naive Bayes; teacher knowledge; short answer items; text classification	TEXT CATEGORIZATION; MATHEMATICS; KNOWLEDGE; INSTRUCTION	In this study, we explored the potential for machine scoring of short written responses to the Classroom-Video-Analysis (CVA) assessment, which is designed to measure teachers' usable mathematics teaching knowledge. We created naive Bayes classifiers for CVA scales assessing three different topic areas and compared computer-generated scores to those assigned by trained raters. Using cross-validation techniques, average correlations between rater- and computer-generated total scores exceeded .85 for each assessment, providing some evidence for convergent validity of machine scores. These correlations remained moderate to large when we controlled for length of response. Machine scores exhibited internal consistency, which we view as a measure of reliability. Finally, correlations between machine scores and another measure of teacher knowledge were close in size to those observed for human scores, providing further evidence for the validity of machine scores. Findings from this study suggest that machine learning techniques hold promise for automating scoring of the CVA.

J	Zhang, XW; Hu, BG				Zhang, Xiaowan; Hu, Bao-Gang			A New Strategy of Cost-Free Learning in the Class Imbalance Problem	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Classification; class imbalance; cost-free learning; cost-sensitive learning; abstaining; mutual information; ROC	NEURAL-NETWORKS; REJECT-OPTION; CLASSIFICATION; CLASSIFIERS; TREES; RECOGNITION; PERFORMANCE; ROBUST	In this work, we define cost-free learning (CFL) formally in comparison with cost-sensitive learning (CSL). The main difference between them is that a CFL approach seeks optimal classification results without requiring any cost information, even in the class imbalance problem. In fact, several CFL approaches exist in the related studies, such as sampling and some criteria-based approaches. However, to our best knowledge, none of the existing CFL and CSL approaches are able to process the abstaining classifications properly when no information is given about errors and rejects. Based on information theory, we propose a novel CFL which seeks to maximize normalized mutual information of the targets and the decision outputs of classifiers. Using the strategy, we can handle binary/multi-class classifications with/without abstaining. Significant features are observed from the new strategy. While the degree of class imbalance is changing, the proposed strategy is able to balance the errors and rejects accordingly and automatically. Another advantage of the strategy is its ability of deriving optimal rejection thresholds for abstaining classifications and the "equivalent" costs in binary classifications. The connection between rejection thresholds and ROC curve is explored. Empirical investigation is made on several benchmark data sets in comparison with other existing approaches. The classification results demonstrate a promising perspective of the strategy in machine learning.

While a bulk of research has focused on mining evolutionary patterns of homogeneous networks (e.g., networks of friends), however, most real-world networks are heterogeneous, containing objects of different types, such as authors, papers, venues, and terms in a bibliographic network. Modeling co-evolution of multityped objects can capture richer information than that on single-typed objects alone. For example, studying co-evolution of authors, venues, and terms in a bibliographic network can tell better the evolution of research areas than just examining co-author network or term network alone. In this paper, we study mining co-evolution of multityped objects in a special type of heterogeneous networks, called star networks, and examine how the multityped objects influence each other in the network evolution. A hierarchical Dirichlet process mixture model-based evolution model is proposed, which detects the co-evolution of multityped objects in the form of multityped cluster evolution in dynamic star networks. An efficient inference algorithm is provided to learn the proposed model. Experiments on several real networks (DBLP, Twitter, and Delicious) validate the effectiveness of the model and the scalability of the algorithm.

New techniques have added capabilities that far surpass those of the early methods. Modern classification trees can partition the data with linear splits on subsets of variables and fit nearest neighbor, kernel density, and other models in the partitions. Regression trees can fit almost every kind of traditional statistical model, including least-squares, quantile, logistic, Poisson, and proportional hazards models, as well as models for longitudinal and multiresponse data. Greater availability and affordability of software (much of which is free) have played a significant role in helping the techniques gain acceptance and popularity in the broader scientific community.

The proposed ensemble of classifiers outperform each of the four classifiers individually in accuracy and composite error rate. The experimental results indicate that non-financial risk factors and a rule-based system help decrease the error rates. The proposed approach outperforms machine learning methods in assessing the risk of financial statement fraud. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

LAD is a datamining, artificial intelligence approach that is based on pattern recognition. In the context of condition based maintenance (CBM), historical data containing condition indices and the state of the machine are the inputs to LAD. After training and testing phases, LAD generates patterns that characterize the faulty states according to the type of fault, and differentiate between these states and the normal state. These patterns are found by solving a mixed 0-1 integer linear programming problem. They are then used to detect and to identify a future unknown state of equipment. The diagnostic technique has already been tested on several known machine learning datasets. The results proved that the performance of this technique is comparable to other conventional approaches, such as neural network and support vector machine, with the added advantage of the clear interpretability of the generated patterns, which are rules characterizing the faults' types. To demonstrate its merit in fault diagnosis, the technique is used in the detection and identification of faults in power transformers using dissolved gas analysis data. The paper reaches the conclusion that the multi-class LAD based fault detection and identification is a promising diagnostic approach in CBM.

PAKDD'12 best paper: generating balanced classifier-independent training samples from unlabeled data	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Training data selection; Semi-supervised active learning; Skewed data; Imbalanced data; Machine learning		We consider the problem of generating balanced training samples from an unlabeled data set with an unknown class distribution. While random sampling works well when the data are balanced, it is very ineffective for unbalanced data. Other approaches, such as active learning and cost-sensitive learning, are also suboptimal as they are classifier-dependent and require misclassification costs and labeled samples, respectively. We propose a new strategy for generating training samples, which is independent of the underlying class distribution of the data and the classifier that will be trained using the labeled data. Our methods are iterative and can be seen as variants of active learning, where we use semi-supervised clustering at each iteration to perform biased sampling from the clusters. We provide several strategies to estimate the underlying class distributions in the clusters and to increase the balancedness in the training samples. Experiments with both highly skewed and balanced data from the UCI repository and a private data set show that our algorithm produces much more balanced samples than random sampling or uncertainty sampling. Further, our sampling strategy is substantially more efficient than active learning methods. The experiments also validate that, with more balanced training data, classifiers trained with our samples outperform classifiers trained with random sampling or active learning.

High-dimensional analysis of the murine myeloid cell system	NATURE IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							CD11B(+) DENDRITIC CELLS; GM-CSF; TISSUE MACROPHAGES; SUPPRESSOR-CELLS; STEADY-STATE; T-CELLS; MONOCYTES; HOMEOSTASIS; IMMUNE; MOUSE	Advances in cell-fate mapping have revealed the complexity in phenotype, ontogeny and tissue distribution of the mammalian myeloid system. To capture this phenotypic diversity, we developed a 38-antibody panel for mass cytometry and used dimensionality reduction with machine learning-aided cluster analysis to build a composite of murine (mouse) myeloid cells in the steady state across lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues. In addition to identifying all previously described myeloid populations, higher-order analysis allowed objective delineation of otherwise ambiguous subsets, including monocyte-macrophage intermediates and an array of granulocyte variants. Using mice that cannot sense granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor GM-CSF (Csf2rb(-/-)), which have discrete alterations in myeloid development, we confirmed differences in barrier tissue dendritic cells, lung macrophages and eosinophils. The methodology further identified variations in the monocyte and innate lymphoid cell compartment that were unexpected, which confirmed that this approach is a powerful tool for unambiguous and unbiased characterization of the myeloid system.

So researches focus on the nature of knowledge processing in the mind. This paper proposes a semantic model (CKRMCC) based on cognitive aspects that enables cognitive computer to process the knowledge as the human mind and find a suitable representation of that knowledge. In cognitive computer, knowledge processing passes through three major stages: knowledge acquisition and encoding, knowledge representation, and knowledge inference and validation. The core of CKRMCC is knowledge representation, which in turn proceeds through four phases: prototype formation phase, discrimination phase, generalization phase, and algorithm development phase. Each of those phases is mathematically formulated using the notions of real-time process algebra. The performance efficiency of CKRMCC is evaluated using some datasets from the well-known UCI repository of machine learning datasets. The acquired datasets are divided into training and testing data that are encoded using concept matrix. Consequently, in the knowledge representation stage, a set of symbolic rule is derived to establish a suitable representation for the training datasets. This representation will be available in a usable form when it is needed in the future. The inference stage uses the rule set to obtain the classes of the encoded testing datasets. Finally, knowledge validation phase is validating and verifying the results of applying the rule set on testing datasets. The performances are compared with classification and regression tree and support vector machine and prove that CKRMCC has an efficient performance in representing the knowledge using symbolic rules.

J	Zhou, J; Sun, SL				Zhou, Jin; Sun, Shiliang			Active learning of Gaussian processes with manifold-preserving graph reduction	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Manifold-preserving graph reduction; Space connectivity; Active learning; Gaussian process	FRAMEWORK	As a recently proposed machine learning method, active learning of Gaussian processes can effectively use a small number of labeled examples to train a classifier, which in turn is used to select the most informative examples from unlabeled data for manual labeling. However, in the process of example selection, active learning usually need consider all the unlabeled data without exploiting the structural space connectivity among them. This will decrease the classification accuracy to some extent since the selected points may not be the most informative. To overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, we present a method which applies the manifold-preserving graph reduction (MPGR) algorithm to the traditional active learning method of Gaussian processes. MPGR is a simple and efficient example sparsification algorithm which can construct a subset to represent the global structure and simultaneously eliminate the influence of noisy points and outliers. Thereby, when actively selecting examples to label, we just choose from the subset constructed by MPGR instead of the whole unlabeled data. We report experimental results on multiple data sets which demonstrate that our method obtains better classification performance compared with the original active learning method of Gaussian processes.

The algorithm is used to predict short-term traffic flow by combining information from multiple traffic sensors (spatial lag) and time series prediction (temporal lag). It extends previously developed Advanced Uncertain Reasoning Architecture (AURA) k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) techniques. Our task was to produce a fast and accurate traffic flow predictor. The AURA k-NN predictor is comparable to other machine learning techniques with respect to recall accuracy but is able to train and predict rapidly. We incorporated consistency evaluations to determine whether the AURA k-NN has an ideal algorithmic configuration or an ideal data configuration or whether the settings needed to be varied for each data set. The results agree with previous research in that settings must be bespoke for each data set. This configuration process requires rapid and scalable learning to allow the predictor to be set-up for new data. The fast processing abilities of the AURA k-NN ensure this combinatorial optimisation will be computationally feasible for real-world applications. We intend to use the predictor to proactively manage traffic by predicting traffic volumes to anticipate traffic network problems.

This uncertainty can be approached by the artificial intelligence techniques and experts systems. This paper presents the adaptive relevance vector machine (ARVM) for stability inference of soil slopes. Based on failure mechanisms and due to data availability, the stability inference here is realized according to the three categories of slope parameters: (1) geomaterial parameters, (2) slope geometry parameters, and (3) the pore pressure coefficient R (u) . A database of dozens of slope cases is collected to reasonably execute the stability inference. Then, the ARVM is introduced to approach the problem. Some cases in the database are used to train the ARVM model so that an optimized ARVM model can be obtained. Some other cases are then used to test the inference ability of the optimized model. Four models obtained by different numbers of cases are compared to show possible effects of dataset size. Also, the sensitivity of the ARVM parameters is investigated. The results show that the width hyper-parameter has apparent effects on the performance of the ARVMs, and the kernel type as well as the dataset size can result in different optimal hyper-parameter values. Meanwhile, the ARVM is compared to other techniques such as the generalized regression neural network and the support vector machines (SVM) for the stability inference of the slope cases by the inference accuracy function. The results suggest that the ARVMs have satisfactory generalization ability and perform better than the simple SVM and the applied neural networks.

Current classification methods are resource-intensive, relying on specialty-trained professionals (nursing exams, transcranial dopplers, and perfusion imaging). More passively obtained variables such as cerebrospinal fluid drainage volumes, sodium, glucose, blood pressure, intracranial pressure, and heart rate, have not been used to predict vasospasm. We hypothesize that these features may yield as much information as resource-intensive features to classify vasospasm. We studied data from 81 aSAH patients presenting within two days of onset. Vasospasm class (VSP) was defined by angiographic vasospasm warranting endovascular treatment. Na < ve Bayes (NB) and logistic regression (LR) classifiers were trained on selected variable feature sets from the first three days of illness. Performance of trained classifiers was evaluated using area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC classifier) and F-measure (F classifier). Ablation analysis determined incremental utility of each variable and subsets. 43.2 % developed VSP. During feature selection, the only passively collected variable that did not yield a statistically significant summary statistic was CSF drainage volume. NB classifier trained on all passively obtained features (AUC NB 0.708 and F NB 0.636) outperformed NB classifier trained on resource-intensive features (AUC NB 0.501 and F NB 0.349). Data-driven analysis of passively obtained clinical data predicted VSP better than current targeted resource-intensive monitoring techniques after aSAH. Automated classification of VSP may be possible.

They learn two hyperplanes rather than one as in usual support vector machines and often bring performance improvements. Semi-supervised learning has attracted great attention in machine learning in the last decade. Laplacian support vector machines and Laplacian twin support vector machines have been proposed in the semi-supervised learning framework. In this paper, inspired by the recent success of multi-view learning we propose multi-view Laplacian twin support vector machines, whose dual optimization problems are quadratic programming problems. We further extend them to kernel multi-view Laplacian twin support vector machines. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods are effective.

J	Parson, O; Ghosh, S; Weal, M; Rogers, A				Parson, Oliver; Ghosh, Siddhartha; Weal, Mark; Rogers, Alex			An unsupervised training method for non-intrusive appliance load monitoring	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Machine learning; Bayesian networks; Unsupervised learning; Computational sustainability; Smart grid	MAJOR END-USES; RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS; MARKOV-MODELS; ELECTRICITY; DISAGGREGATION; CONSUMPTION; ALGORITHM	Non-intrusive appliance load monitoring is the process of disaggregating a household's total electricity consumption into its contributing appliances. In this paper we propose an unsupervised training method for non-intrusive monitoring which, unlike existing supervised approaches, does not require training data to be collected by sub-metering individual appliances, nor does it require appliances to be manually labelled for the households in which disaggregation is performed. Instead, we propose an approach which combines a one-off supervised learning process over existing labelled appliance data sets, with an unsupervised learning method over unlabelled household aggregate data. First, we propose an approach which uses the Tracebase data set to build probabilistic appliance models which generalise to previously unseen households, which we empirically evaluate through cross validation. Second, we use the Reference Energy Disaggregation Data set to evaluate the accuracy with which these general models can be tuned to the appliances within a specific household using only aggregate data. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that general appliance models can be constructed using data from only a small number of appliances (typically 3-6 appliances), and furthermore that 28-99% of the remaining behaviour which is specific to a single household can be learned using only aggregate data from existing smart meters.

There exist many general-purpose enhancements for MCTS, which improve its efficiency and effectiveness by learning information from one part of the search space and using it to guide the search in other parts. We introduce the Information Capture And ReUse Strategy (ICARUS) framework for describing and combining such enhancements. We demonstrate the ICARUS framework's usefulness as a frame of reference for understanding existing enhancements, combining them, and designing new ones. We also use ICARUS to adapt some well-known MCTS enhancements (originally designed for games of perfect information) to handle information asymmetry between players and randomness, features which can make decision-making much more difficult. We also introduce a new enhancement designed within the ICARUS framework, EPisodic Information Capture and reuse (EPIC), designed to exploit the episodic nature of many games. Empirically we demonstrate that EPIC is stronger and more robust than existing enhancements in a variety of game domains, thus validating ICARUS as a powerful tool for enhancement design within MCTS.

Eliciting good teaching from humans for machine learners	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Algorithmic teaching; Interactive machine learning	FACES; MODEL	We propose using computational teaching algorithms to improve human teaching for machine learners. We investigate example sequences produced naturally by human teachers and find that humans often do not spontaneously generate optimal teaching sequences for arbitrary machine learners. To elicit better teaching, we propose giving humans teaching guidance, which are instructions on how to teach, derived from computational teaching algorithms or heuristics. We present experimental results demonstrating that teaching guidance substantially improves human teaching in three different problem domains. This provides promising evidence that human intelligence and flexibility can be leveraged to achieve better sample efficiency when input data to a learning system comes from a human teacher.

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to shed light on some of the techniques that employ machine translation available in literature, to encourage researchers to study these techniques. We discuss some of the linguistic characteristics of the Arabic language. Features of Arabic that are related to machine translation are discussed in detail, along with possible difficulties that they might present. This paper summarizes the major techniques used in machine translation from Arabic into English, and discusses their strengths and weaknesses.

This survey has revealed that most works on AIRS was dedicated to the application of the algorithm to real-world problems rather than to theoretical developments of the algorithm. Based on this finding, we propose an improved version of the AIRS algorithm which we dub AIRS3. AIRS3 takes into account an important parameter that was ignored by the original algorithm, namely, the number of training antigens represented by each memory cell at the end of learning (numRepAg). Experiments of the new AIRS3 algorithm on data sets taken from the UCI machine learning repository have shown that taking into account the numRepAg information enhances the classification accuracy of AIRS.

Markov networks are probabilistic graphical models, a widely used formalism for handling probability distributions in intelligent systems. This document focuses on a technology called independence-based learning, which allows for the learning of the independence structure of Markov networks from data in an efficient and sound manner, whenever the dataset is sufficiently large, and data is a representative sample of the target distribution. In the analysis of such technology, this work surveys the current state-of-the-art algorithms, discussing its limitations, and posing a series of open problems where future work may produce some advances in the area, in terms of quality and efficiency.

Such models provide information about the power consumption behavior of workloads prior to running them. Power consumption depends on the characteristics of both the machine and the workload. However, combinational features such as the cache miss rate cannot be considered due to their unavailability before running the workload. Therefore, pre-execution power modeling requires both machine-independent workload characteristics and workload-independent machine characteristics. In this paper the predictive modeling problem is tackled by the proposal of a two-stage modeling framework. In the first stage, a machine learning approach is taken to predict single-threaded workload power consumption at a specific frequency. The second stage analytically scales this output to any intended thread/frequency configuration. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can yield highly accurate predictions about workload power consumption with an average error of 3.7 % on six different test platforms.

In the first part of this article, the problem is formulated with a Hybrid Model Predictive Control approach. However, the implementation of this solution on an industrial product remains a big challenge due to the limited computing capacity of this latter. As a result, we propose in the second part a logical controller whose rules and parameters are based on a learning from the behavior of the optimal controller using support vector machine (SVMs). In addition, we aim to demonstrate the importance of a proper selection of the measurements for the learning problem. In the last part, various simulations are performed with SIMBAD, a Matlab toolbox dedicated to building simulation, to assess the performance of the learned controller. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Gao, XF; Malkawi, A				Gao, Xuefeng; Malkawi, Ali			A new methodology for building energy performance benchmarking: An approach based on intelligent clustering algorithm	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						Building performance; Energy benchmarking; Clustering algorithm; Multi-dimensional features		Though many building energy benchmarking programs have been developed during the past decades, they hold certain limitations. The major concern is that they may cause misleading benchmarking due to not fully considering the impacts of the multiple features of buildings on energy performance. The existing methods classify buildings according to only one of many features of buildings the use type, which may result in a comparison between two buildings that are tremendously different in other features and not properly comparable as a result. This paper aims to tackle this challenge by proposing a new methodology based on the clustering concept. The clustering concept, which reflects on machine learning algorithms, classifies buildings based on a multi-dimensional domain of building features, rather than the single dimension of use type. Buildings with the greatest similarity of features that influence energy performance are classified into the same cluster, and benchmarked according to the centroid reference of the cluster. The proposed methodology contains four steps: feature selection, clustering algorithm adaptation, results validation, and interpretation. The experimentation was carried out with a comparison between the proposed methodology and the Energy Star approach. It was shown that the proposed methodology could account for the total building energy performance and was able to provide a more comprehensive approach to benchmarking. In addition, the multi-dimensional clustering concept enables energy benchmarking among different types of buildings, and inspires a new perspective to investigate building performance typology.

Novel in silico technology in combination with microarrays: a state-of-the-art technology for allergy diagnosis and management?	EXPERT REVIEW OF CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Editorial Material						allergen; allergy; artificial intelligence; component; expert systems; laboratory test; microarray	MOLECULAR DIAGNOSIS; IMMUNOTHERAPY; SYMPTOMS; EUROPE; ISAC	Allergen microarrays, in poly-sensitized allergic patients, represent a real value added in the accurate IgE profiling and in the identification of allergen(s) to administer for an effective allergen immunotherapy.' Allergen microarrays (AMA) were developed in the early 2000s to improve the diagnostic pathway of patients with allergic reactions. Nowadays, AMA are constituted by more than 100 different components (either purified or recombinant), representing genuine and cross-reacting molecules from plants and animals. The cost of the procedure had suggested its use as third-level diagnostics (following in vivo- and in vitro-specific IgE tests) in poly-sensitized patients. The complexity of the interpretation had inspired the development of in silico technologies to help clinicians in their work. Both machine learning techniques and expert systems are now available. In particular, an expert system that has been recently developed not only identifies positive and negative components but also lists dangerous components and classifies patients based on their potential responsiveness to allergen immunotherapy, on the basis of published algorithms. For these characteristics, AMA represents the state-of-the-art technology for allergy diagnosis in poly-sensitized patients.

Bioassessment of freshwater ecosystems using the Reference Condition Approach: comparing established and new methods with common data sets	FRESHWATER SCIENCE			English	Article						bioassessment; reference condition approach; AUSRIVAS; predictive models; BEAST; simpacts	PREDICTION; CATCHMENT	Although used in many jurisdictions around the world, analytical approaches of the Reference Condition Approach (RCA) to bioassessment of freshwater ecosystems have evolved quite slowly over the past 2 decades. For this special series of papers in Freshwater Science, researchers analyzed 3 data sets that included both benthic macroinvertebrate and environmental data from a number of reference sites. Australian Capital Territory (ACT) reference sites (n(total) = 107) were wadeable streams in the upper Murrumbidgee River catchment, Australian Capital Territory, Australia. Yukon Territory (YT) reference sites were wadeable streams (ntotal = 158) in the Yukon Territory, Canada, part of the Yukon River basin. Great Lakes (GL) sites (n(total) = 164) were all nearshore (<20 m) lentic sites in the North American Great Lakes. For each data set, sites were divided into model-building (training) and model-testing (validation) groups. Each validation site was further subjected to 3 levels of simulated degradation based on the sensitivity of the biota to eutrophication. The analytical approaches ranged from standard or slight modifications of methods used in national programs (Australian River Assessment [AUSRIVAS], Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Network [CABIN]), to improved matching of sites to be assessed and appropriate reference sites, and Bayesian and machine-learning modeling. In comparing Type 1 error rates (proportion of validation sites deemed not in reference condition) and power (proportion of simulated impairment sites deemed not in reference condition), we found no obvious pattern among the 3 data sets or approaches. Approaches commonly used in RCA programs would benefit from incorporating newer methods that better match reference and test-site environments and build better predictive models.

HYDRA differs from standard models based on discriminant function analysis (DFA) in 2 main ways: 1) HYDRA predicts taxa directly without a priori reference-site classification, and 2) all environmental variables provided for model building contribute to predictions instead of only those that best explain differences among groups. Probabilities of taxon occurrence were used to calculate the Observed/Expected index (O/E50), based on taxa predicted with >50% probability of occurrence. We tested the hypothesis that a combination of models (HYDRA) would perform better than each model alone (SVM, MLP, KNN). We measured performance as: 1) taxon prediction accuracy, 2) precision given by the O/E50 standard deviation (SD O/E50), 3) accuracy of the validation O vs E linear regression, and 4) sensitivity to impairment. We used 3 data sets covering a wide range of environmental conditions (Yukon Territory, Great Lakes, Australian Capital Territory) and calculated O/E50 values for reference, validation, and sites with 3 known levels of simulated impairment. We created 4 quality classes (Good-Severe) and used the 10th percentile O/E50 values of training sites to define the boundary between Good (= reference) and Moderate classes. HYDRA was the best solution for all data sets and was able to distinguish levels of impairment. Taxon prediction accuracy was not related to taxonomic group. Models (SVM, MLP, KNN) varied in accuracy among data sets, and accuracy seemed to depend on the distribution of the taxa across training sites. SVM provided good models, but showed poor sensitivity with 1 data set, which indicated inability to deal with low-richness communities.

Specifically, we have built upon Medical Knowledge Analysis Tool pipeline (MedKATp), which is an extraction framework focused on pathology reports. Our particular contributions include additional customization and development on MedKATp to extract data elements and relationships from cancer pathology reports in richer detail than at present, an abstraction layer that provides significantly easier configuration of MedKATp for extraction tasks, and a machine-learning-based approach that makes the extraction more resilient to deviations from the common reporting format in a pathology reports corpus. We present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of our pipeline for information extraction in a real-world task, demonstrating performance improvement due to our approach for increasing extractor resilience to format deviation, and finally demonstrating the scalability of the pipeline across pathology reports for different cancer types.

Automated Biosignal Quality Analysis for Electromyography Using a One-Class Support Vector Machine	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Biomedical measurements; biosignal quality analysis; electromyography (EMG); machine learning; myoelectric signals; support vector machines (SVMs)	POWER-LINE INTERFERENCE; WEARABLE SENSORS; EMG GENERATION; ECG; SIGNALS; MODEL; SYSTEMS; SIMULATION; ELECTRODES	This paper introduces the importance of biosignal quality assessment and presents a pattern classification approach to differentiate clean from contaminated electromyography (EMG) signals. Alternatively to traditional bottom-up approaches, which examine specific contaminants only, we present a top-down approach using a one-class support vector machine (SVM) trained on clean EMG and tested on artificially contaminated EMG. Both simulated and real EMG are used. Results are evaluated for each contaminant: 1) power line interference; 2) motion artifact; 3) ECG interference; 4) quantization noise; 5) analog-to-digital converter clipping; and 6) amplifier saturation, as a function of the level of signal contamination. Results show that different ranges of contamination can be detected in the EMG depending on the type of contaminant. At high levels of contamination, the SVM classifies all EMG signals as contaminated, whereas at low levels of contamination, it classifies the majority of EMG signals as contaminant free. A transition point for each contaminant is identified, where the classification accuracy drops and variance in classification increases. In some cases, contamination can be detected with the SVM when it is not visually discernible. This method is shown to be successful in detecting problems due to single contaminants but is generic to all forms of contamination in EMG.	[Fraser, Graham D.; Chan, Adrian D.

Gleaned from recent advances in computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning, computational intelligence based racial face analysis has been particularly popular due to its significant potential and broader impacts in extensive real-world applications, such as security and defense, surveillance, human computer interface (HCI), biometric-based identification, among others. These studies raise an important question: How implicit, non-declarative racial category can be conceptually modeled and quantitatively inferred from the face? Nevertheless, race classification is challenging due to its ambiguity and complexity depending on context and criteria. To address this challenge, recently, significant efforts have been reported toward race detection and categorization in the community. This survey provides a comprehensive and critical review of the state-of-the-art advances in face-race perception, principles, algorithms, and applications. We first discuss race perception problem formulation and motivation, while highlighting the conceptual potentials of racial face processing. Next, taxonomy of feature representational models, algorithms, performance and racial databases are presented with systematic discussions within the unified learning scenario. Finally, in order to stimulate future research in this field, we also highlight the major opportunities and challenges, as well as potentially important cross-cutting themes and research directions for the issue of learning race from face.

J	Turner, RE; Sahani, M				Turner, Richard E.; Sahani, Maneesh			Time-Frequency Analysis as Probabilistic Inference	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Audio signal processing; inference; machine-learning; time-frequency analysis	NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; FOURIER-TRANSFORM; REPRESENTATION; NOISE; DEMODULATION; EM	This paper proposes a new view of time-frequency analysis framed in terms of probabilistic inference. Natural signals are assumed to be formed by the superposition of distinct time-frequency components, with the analytic goal being to infer these components by application of Bayes' rule. The framework serves to unify various existing models for natural time-series; it relates to both the Wiener and Kalman filters, and with suitable assumptions yields inferential interpretations of the short-time Fourier transform, spectrogram, filter bank, and wavelet representations. Value is gained by placing time-frequency analysis on the same probabilistic basis as is often employed in applications such as denoising, source separation, or recognition. Uncertainty in the time-frequency representation can be propagated correctly to application-specific stages, improving the handing of noise and missing data. Probabilistic learning allows modules to be co-adapted; thus, the time-frequency representation can be adapted to both the demands of the application and the time-varying statistics of the signal at hand. Similarly, the application module can be adapted to fine properties of the signal propagated by the initial time-frequency processing. We demonstrate these benefits by combining probabilistic time-frequency representations with non-negative matrix factorization, finding benefits in audio denoising and inpainting tasks, albeit with higher computational cost than incurred by the standard approach.

This paper presents an alternative workflow, progressive visual analytics, which enables an analyst to inspect partial results of an algorithm as they become available and interact with the algorithm to prioritize subspaces of interest. Progressive visual analytics depends on adapting analytical algorithms to produce meaningful partial results and enable analyst intervention without sacrificing computational speed. The paradigm also depends on adapting information visualization techniques to incorporate the constantly refining results without overwhelming analysts and provide interactions to support an analyst directing the analytic. The contributions of this paper include: a description of the progressive visual analytics paradigm; design goals for both the algorithms and visualizations in progressive visual analytics systems; an example progressive visual analytics system (Progressive Insights) for analyzing common patterns in a collection of event sequences; and an evaluation of Progressive Insights and the progressive visual analytics paradigm by clinical researchers analyzing electronic medical records.

However, in current visual analytics systems, the computer has limited means of knowing about its users and their analysis processes. While existing research has shown that a user's interactions with a system reflect a large amount of the user's reasoning process, there has been limited advancement in developing automated, real-time techniques that mine interactions to learn about the user. In this paper, we demonstrate that we can accurately predict a user's task performance and infer some user personality traits by using machine learning techniques to analyze interaction data. Specifically, we conduct an experiment in which participants perform a visual search task, and apply well-known machine learning algorithms to three encodings of the users' interaction data. We achieve, depending on algorithm and encoding, between 62% and 83% accuracy at predicting whether each user will be fast or slow at completing the task. Beyond predicting performance, we demonstrate that using the same techniques, we can infer aspects of the user's personality factors, including locus of control, extraversion, and neuroticism. Further analyses show that strong results can be attained with limited observation time: in one case 95% of the final accuracy is gained after a quarter of the average task completion time. Overall, our findings show that interactions can provide information to the computer about its human collaborator, and establish a foundation for realizing mixed-initiative visual analytics systems.

In order to improve the performance of such classifiers, machine learning experts need to analyze classification results for a large number of labeled samples to find possible reasons for incorrect classification. Confusion matrices are widely used for this purpose. However, they provide no information about classification scores and features computed for the samples. We propose a set of integrated visual methods for analyzing the performance of probabilistic classifiers. Our methods provide insight into different aspects of the classification results for a large number of samples. One visualization emphasizes at which probabilities these samples were classified and how these probabilities correlate with classification error in terms of false positives and false negatives. Another view emphasizes the features of these samples and ranks them by their separation power between selected true and false classifications. We demonstrate the insight gained using our technique in a benchmarking classification dataset, and show how it enables improving classification performance by interactively defining and evaluating post-classification rules.

Certain tasks, however, require that insights derived from visual abstractions are verified by a human expert perusing the source text. So far, this problem is typically solved by offering overview+detail techniques. which present different views with different levels of abstractions. This often leads to problems with visual continuity. Focus+context techniques, on the other hand, succeed in accentuating interesting subsections of large text documents but are normally not suited for integrating visual abstractions. With VarifocalReader we present a technique that helps to solve some of these approaches' problems by combining characteristics from both. In particular, our method simplifies working with large and potentially complex text documents by simultaneously offering abstract representations of varying detail, based on the inherent structure of the document, and access to the text itself. In addition, VarifocalReader supports intra-document exploration through advanced navigation concepts and facilitates visual analysis tasks. The approach enables users to apply machine learning techniques and search mechanisms as well as to assess and adapt these techniques. This helps to extract entities, concepts and other artifacts from texts. In combination with the automatic generation of intermediate text levels through topic segmentation for thematic orientation, users can test hypotheses or develop interesting new research questions. To illustrate the advantages of our approach, we provide usage examples from literature studies.

Everyday, millions of messages are created, commented, and shared by people on social media websites, such as Twitter and Facebook. This provides valuable data for researchers and practitioners in many application domains, such as marketing, to inform decision-making. Distilling valuable social signals from the huge crowd's messages, however, is challenging, due to the heterogeneous and dynamic crowd behaviors. The challenge is rooted in data analysts' capability of discerning the anomalous information behaviors, such as the spreading of rumors or misinformation, from the rest that are more conventional patterns, such as popular topics and newsworthy events, in a timely fashion. FluxFlow incorporates advanced machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies, and offers a set of novel visualization designs for presenting the detected threads for deeper analysis. We evaluated FluxFlow with real datasets containing the Twitter feeds captured during significant events such as Hurricane Sandy. Through quantitative measurements of the algorithmic performance and qualitative interviews with domain experts, the results show that the back-end anomaly detection model is effective in identifying anomalous retweeting threads, and its front-end interactive visualizations are intuitive and useful for analysts to discover insights in data and comprehend the underlying analytical model.

Despite the success of TAVI, side effects such as paravalvular leakages can occur postoperatively. The goal of this project is to quantitatively analyze the co-occurrence of this complication and several potential risk factors such as stent shape after implantation. implantation height, amount and distribution of calcifications. and contact forces between stent and surrounding structure. In this paper, we present a two-dimensional visualization (stent maps), which allows (1) to comprehensively display all these aspects from CT data and mechanical simulation results and (2) to compare different datasets to identify patterns that are typical for adverse effects. The area of a stent map represents the surface area of the implanted stent virtually straightened and uncoiled. Several properties of interest, like radial forces or stent compression. are displayed in this stent map in a heatmap-like fashion. Important anatomical landmarks and calcifications are plotted to show their spatial relation to the stent and possible correlations with the color-coded parameters. To provide comparability, the maps of different patient datasets are spatially adjusted according to a corresponding anatomical landmark. Also, stent maps summarizing the characteristics of different populations (e.g. with or without side effects) can be generated. Up to this point several interesting patterns have been observed with our technique, which remained hidden when examining the raw CT data or 3D visualizations of the same data. One example are obvious radial force maxima between the right and non-coronary valve leaflet occurring mainly in cases without leakages. These observations confirm the usefulness of our approach and give starting points for new hypotheses and further analyses. Because of its reduced dimensionality, the stent map data is an appropriate input for statistical group evaluation and machine learning methods.

Identifying Splicing Regulatory Elements with de Bruijn Graphs	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						combinatorics; sequences; literature data mining; probability; machine learning; graphs and networks; algorithms; computational molecular biology	PRE-MESSENGER-RNA; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; HUMAN GENES; IDENTIFICATION; ENHANCERS; MOTIFS; DEFINITION; SITES; CODE; DISCOVERY	Splicing regulatory elements (SREs) are short, degenerate sequences on pre-mRNA molecules that enhance or inhibit the splicing process via the binding of splicing factors, proteins that regulate the functioning of the spliceosome. Existing methods for identifying SREs in a genome are either experimental or computational. Here, we propose a formalism based on de Bruijn graphs that combines genomic structure, word count enrichment analysis, and experimental evidence to identify SREs found in exons. In our approach, SREs are not restricted to a fixed length (i.e., k-mers, for a fixed k). As a result, we identify 2001 putative exonic enhancers and 3080 putative exonic silencers for human genes, with lengths varying from 6 to 15 nucleotides. Many of the predicted SREs overlap with experimentally verified binding sites. Our model provides a novel method to predict variable length putative regulatory elements computationally for further experimental investigation.

Identifying imaging examinations appropriate for a given research question from the unstructured radiology reports is extremely useful, but labor-intensive. Using the machine learning text-mining methods implemented in LingPipe [1], we evaluated the performance of the dynamic language model (DLM) and the Na < ve Bayesian (NB) classifiers in classifying radiology reports to facilitate identification of radiological examinations for research projects. The training dataset consisted of 14,325 sentences from 11,432 radiology reports randomly selected from a database of 5,104,594 reports in all disciplines of radiology. The training sentences were categorized manually into six categories (Positive, Differential, Post Treatment, Negative, Normal, and History). A 10-fold cross-validation [2] was used to evaluate the performance of the models, which were tested in classification of radiology reports for cases of sellar or suprasellar masses and colloid cysts. The average accuracies for the DLM and NB classifiers were 88.5 % with 95 % confidence interval (CI) of 1.9 % and 85.9 % with 95 % CI of 2.0 %, respectively. The DLM performed slightly better and was used to classify 1,397 radiology reports containing the keywords "sellar or suprasellar mass", or "colloid cyst". The DLM model produced an accuracy of 88.2 % with 95 % CI of 2.1 % for 959 reports that contain "sellar or suprasellar mass" and an accuracy of 86.3 % with 95 % CI of 2.5 % for 437 reports of "colloid cyst". We conclude that automated classification of radiology reports using machine learning techniques can effectively facilitate the identification of cases suitable for retrospective research.

Personalized Coaching Systems to support healthy behavior in people with chronic conditions	JOURNAL OF ELECTROMYOGRAPHY AND KINESIOLOGY			English	Article						Ambulant sensing; Personal health; Feedback; Coaching; Personalisation; Context aware	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; DAILY PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; TELETREATMENT SERVICE; TRAPEZIUS MUSCLE; COMPUTER-WORK; MENTAL STRESS; SHOULDER PAIN; NECK-SHOULDER; BACK-PAIN; COPD	Chronic conditions cannot be cured but daily behavior has a major effect on the severity of secondary problems and quality of life. Changing behavior however requires intensive support in daily life, which is not feasible with a human coach. A new coaching approach - so-called Personal Coaching Systems (PCSs) - use on-body sensing, combined with smart reasoning and context-aware feedback to support users in developing and maintaining a healthier behavior. Three different PCSs will be used to illustrate the different aspects of this approach: (1) Treatment of neck/shoulder pain. EMG patterns of the Trapezius muscles are used to estimate their level of relaxation. Personal vibrotactile feedback is given, to create awareness and enable learning when muscles are insufficiently relaxed. (2) Promoting a healthy activity pattern. Using a 3D accelerometer to measure activity and a smart-phone to provide feedback. Timing and content of the feedback are adapted real-time, using machine-learning techniques, to optimize adherence. (3) Management of stress during daily living. The level of stress is quantified using a personal model involving a combination of different sensor signals (EMG, ECG, skin conductance, respiration). Results show that Personal Coaching Systems are feasible and a promising and challenging way forward to coach people with chronic conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We aimed to develop a data-based individualized model for flow decline and to explore the relationship between model parameters and COPD presence. A second-order transfer function model was chosen and the model parameters (namely the two poles and the steady state gain (SSG)) from 474 individuals were correlated with COPD presence. The capability of the model to predict disease presence was explored using 5 machine learning classifiers and tenfold cross-validation. Median (95 % CI) poles in subjects without disease were 0.9868 (0.9858-0.9878) and 0.9333 (0.9256-0.9395), compared with 0.9929 (0.9925-0.9933) and 0.9082 (0.9004-0.9140) in subjects with COPD (p < 0.001 for both poles). A significant difference was also found when analysing the SSG, being lower in COPD group 3.8 (3.5-4.2) compared with 8.2 (7.8-8.7) in subjects without (p < 0.0001). A combination of all three parameters in a support vector machines corresponded with highest sensitivity of 85 %, specificity of 98.1 % and accuracy of 88.2 % to COPD diagnosis. The forced expiration of COPD can be modelled by a second-order system which parameters identify most COPD cases. Our approach offers an additional tool in case FEV1/FVC ratio-based diagnosis is doubted.

Most of these structural health problems are accumulative damages such as slight changes in structural deformations which are very hard to be detected. In addition, the complexity of real structure and environmental noises make structural health monitoring more difficult. Existing methods largely use various types of sensors to collect useful parameters and then train a machine learning model to diagnose damage level and location, in which a large amount of training data are needed for the model training, while the labeled data are rare in the real world. To overcome this problem, sparse coding is employed in this paper to achieve structural health monitoring of a bridge equipped with a wireless sensor network, so that a large amount of unlabeled examples can be used to train a feature extractor based on the sparse coding algorithm. Features learned from sparse coding are then used to train a neural network classifier to distinguish different statuses of the bridge. Experimental results show the sparse coding-based deep learning algorithm achieves higher accuracy for structural health monitoring under the same level of environmental noises, compared with some existing methods.

Discerning intersecting fusion-activation pathways in the Nipah virus using machine learning	PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						support vector machines; machine learning; molecular dynamics; allosteric signaling; protein-protein interactions; viral fusion	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; RECEPTOR-BINDING SITE; HENDRA-VIRUS; HEMAGGLUTININ-NEURAMINIDASE; G-GLYCOPROTEIN; ATTACHMENT GLYCOPROTEIN; PROTEIN DYNAMICS; STALK DOMAIN; PDZ DOMAIN; ALLOSTERIC COMMUNICATION	The fusion of Nipah with host cells is facilitated by two of their glycoproteins, the G and the F proteins. The binding of cellular ephrins to the G head domain causes the G stalk domain to interact differently with F, which activates F to mediate virus-host fusion. To gain insight into how the ephrin-binding signal transduces from the head to the stalk domain of G, we examine quantitatively the differences between the conformational ensembles of the G head domain in its ephrin-bound and unbound states. We consider the human ephrins B2 and B3, and a double mutant of B2, all of which trigger fusion. The ensembles are generated using molecular dynamics, and the differences between them are quantified using a new machine learning method. We find that the portion of the G head domain whose conformational density is altered equivalently by the three ephrins is large, and comprises approximate to 25% of the residues in the G head domain. This subspace also includes the residues that are known to be important to F activation, which suggests that it contains at least one common signaling pathway. The spatial distribution of the residues constituting this subspace supports the model of signal transduction in which the signal transduces via the G head dimer interface. This study also adds to the growing list of examples where signaling does not depend solely on backbone deviations. In general, this study provides an approach to filter out conserved patterns in protein dynamics. Proteins 2014; 82:3241-3254. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To figure out the cell function, the protein-DNA interactions decrypt the protein domain structures in recent research. Several machine-learning based methods are applied to the issue; however, they are not efficient to translate the tertiary structure characteristics of proteins into appropriate features for predicting the DNA-binding proteins. In this work, a novel machine-learning approach based on hidden Markov models identifies the characteristics of DNA-binding proteins with their amino acid sequences and tertiary structures. After we distill the features from DNA-binding proteins, a support vector machine based classifier predicts general DNA-binding proteins with the accuracy of 88.45 % through fivefolds cross-validation. Furthermore, we construct a response element specific classifier for predicting response element specific DNA-binding proteins, and the performance achieves the precision of 96.57% with recall rate as 88.83% in average. To verify the prediction of DNA-binding proteins, we used the DNA-binding proteins from MCF-7 that are likely to bind with estrogen response elements (ERE), and the results show that our methods can apply to practice.

Mobile crowdsensing seems a promising solution for enabling the design/development and deployment of a wide range of advanced applications in various fields. In particular, public safety, transportation, and energy monitoring and management in urban environments can benefit from mobile crowdsensing in terms of advanced provisioned applications as well as savings of investments in the urban sensing infrastructure. However, enabling those advanced smart urban applications requires complex signal processing, machine learning, and resource management algorithms that are often beyond the skills of many mobile app developers. This paper describes the pivotal relevance of these facilities for mobile crowdsensing applications and presents our open-source solution, called Mobile Sensing Technology (MoST), for activity detection and geofencing, comparing it with the reference implementations provided by Google as part of the Google Play Services library. Experimental results within the testbed framework of a crowd-management application scenario validate MoST design guidelines and demonstrate the general-purpose, unintrusive, and power-efficient characteristics of MoST sensing capabilities.

Recently, studies have attempted to estimate affective movie content with computational features, but results have been mixed, one of the main reasons being a lack of data on perceptual stylistic and aesthetic attributes of film, which would provide a ground truth for the features. The distinctions between energetic and tense arousal as well as perceived and felt affect are also often neglected. In this study, we present a data set of ratings by 73 viewers of 83 stylistic, aesthetic, and affective attributes for a selection of movie clips containing complete scenes taken from mainstream movies. The affective attributes include the temporal progression of perceived and felt valence and arousal within the clips. The data set is aimed to be used to train algorithms that predict viewer assessments based on low-level computational features. With this data set, we performed a baseline study modeling the relation between a large selection of low-level computational features (i.e., visual, auditory, and temporal) and perceptual stylistic, aesthetic, and affective attributes of movie clips. Two algorithms were compared in a realistic prediction scenario: linear regression and the neural-network-based Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Felt and perceived affect as well as stylistic attributes were shown to be equally easy to predict, whereas the prediction of aesthetic attributes failed. The performance of the ELM predictor was overall found to be slightly better than the linear regression. A feature selection experiment illustrated that features from all low-level computational modalities, visual, auditory and temporal, contribute to the prediction of the affect assessments. We have made our assessment data and extracted computational features publicly available.

First, we propose a multi-resolution string representation scheme based on the tree-structured vector quantization (TSVQ) to transform the time-series of human poses into codeword sequences. Then, we take the temporal variations of human poses into account via codeword sequence matching. Furthermore, we develop a family of pose-histogram-based classifiers to examine the spatial distribution of human poses. We analyze the performance of the temporal and spatial classifiers separately. To achieve a higher classification rate, we merge their decisions and soft scores using novel fusion methods. The proposed fusion solutions are tested on a wide variety of sequences from the CMU mocap database using five-fold cross validation, and a correct classification rate of 99.6% is achieved.

Measurement of gas and liquid flow rates in two-phase pipe flows by the application of machine learning techniques to differential pressure signals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW			English	Article						Two-phase; Flow rates; Differential pressure; Independent Component Analysis; Principal Component Analysis; Neural networks	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; IDENTIFICATION; REGIME; ORIFICES	A new method for the determination of gas and liquid flow rates in vertical upward gas-liquid pipe flows has been proposed. This method consists of an application of machine learning techniques on the probability density function (PDF) and the power spectral density (PSD) of the normalized output of a differential pressure transducer connected to two axially separated wall pressure taps in the pipe. The two-phase flow regime was first identified by the application of the elastic maps method on the differential pressure PDF. The transducer signal was then pre-processed using Principal Component Analysis, and independent features were extracted using Independent Component Analysis. The extracted features were used as inputs to multi-layer back-propagation neural networks, which gave the phase flow rates as output. The present method was used to calibrate a differential pressure sensor to estimate the flow rates of both phases in air-water flow in a vertical pipe of diameter 32.5 mm and in the pressure range from 100 to 140 kPa. Predictions of the present method were in good agreement with direct flow rate measurements. Compared to previously used methods of feature extraction from differential pressure signals, the present method was the only one to have a good, consistent performance over all flow regimes and for all flow conditions encountered in this study.

In order to relieve the cost of memory and time during training and prediction, we propose a novel approach for label ranking problem based on Gaussian mixture model in this paper. The key idea of the approach is to divide the label ranking training data into multiple clusters using clustering algorithm, and each cluster is described by a Gaussian prototype. Then, a Gaussian mixture model is introduced to model the mapping from instances to rankings. Finally, a predicted ranking is obtained with maximum posterior probability. In the experiments, we compare our method with two state-of-the-art label ranking approaches. Experimental results show that our method is fully competitive in terms of predictive accuracy. Moreover, the proposed method also provides a measure of the reliability of the corresponding predicted ranking. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Denoising the speaking brain: Toward a robust technique for correcting artifact-contaminated fMRI data under severe motion	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI; Motion artifacts; Independent component analysis; Speech production; Resting-state functional connectivity	INDEPENDENT-COMPONENT ANALYSIS; RESTING-STATE FMRI; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY MRI; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; TIME-SERIES; IMAGE REGISTRATION; BLIND SEPARATION; SUBJECT MOTION; HEAD MOTION; SPEECH	A comprehensive set of methods based on spatial independent component analysis (sICA) is presented as a robust technique for artifact removal, applicable to a broad range of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments that have been plagued by motion-related artifacts. Although the applications of sICA for fMRI denoising have been studied previously, three fundamental elements of this approach have not been established as follows: 1) a mechanistically-based ground truth for component classification; 2) a general framework for evaluating the performance and generalizability of automated classifiers; and 3) a reliable method for validating the effectiveness of denoising. Here we perform a thorough investigation of these issues and demonstrate the power of our technique by resolving the problem of severe imaging artifacts associated with continuous overt speech production. As a key methodological feature, a dual-mask sICA method is proposed to isolate a variety of imaging artifacts by directly revealing their extracerebral spatial origins. It also plays an important role for understanding the mechanistic properties of noise components in conjunction with temporal measures of physical or physiological motion. The potentials of a spatially-based machine learning classifier and the general criteria for feature selection have both been examined, in order to maximize the performance and generalizability of automated component classification. The effectiveness of denoising is quantitatively validated by comparing the activation maps of fMRI with those of positron emission tomography acquired under the same task conditions. The general applicability of this technique is further demonstrated by the successful reduction of distance-dependent effect of head motion on resting-state functional connectivity.

JET-EFDA Contributors	Adaptive high learning rate probabilistic disruption predictors from scratch for the next generation of tokamaks	NUCLEAR FUSION			English	Article						disruption prediction; probabilistic predictors; adaptive disruption predictors	NEURAL-NETWORKS; ASDEX UPGRADE; JET; CLASSIFICATION	The development of accurate real-time disruption predictors is a pre-requisite to any mitigation action. Present theoretical models of disruptions do not reliably cope with the disruption issues. This article deals with data-driven predictors and a review of existing machine learning techniques, from both physics and engineering points of view, is provided. All these methods need large training datasets to develop successful predictors. However, ITER or DEMO cannot wait for hundreds of disruptions to have a reliable predictor. So far, the attempts to extrapolate predictors between different tokamaks have not shown satisfactory results. In addition, it is not clear how valid this approach can be between present devices and ITER/DEMO, due to the differences in their respective scales and possibly underlying physics. Therefore, this article analyses the requirements to create adaptive predictors from scratch to learn from the data of an individual machine from the beginning of operation. A particular algorithm based on probabilistic classifiers has been developed and it has been applied to the database of the three first ITER-like wall campaigns of JET (1036 non-disruptive and 201 disruptive discharges). The predictions start from the first disruption and only 12 re-trainings have been necessary as a consequence of missing 12 disruptions only. Almost 10 000 different predictors have been developed (they differ in their features) and after the chronological analysis of the 1237 discharges, the predictors recognize 94% of all disruptions with an average warning time (AWT) of 654 ms. This percentage corresponds to the sum of tardy detections (11%), valid alarms (76%) and premature alarms (7%). The false alarm rate is 4%. If only valid alarms are considered, the AWT is 244 ms and the standard deviation is 205 ms. The average probability interval about the reliability and accuracy of all the individual predictions is 0.811 +/- 0.189.

However, brain biomarkers that are sensitive and specific to chronic pelvic pain (CPP) have not yet been adequately identified. Using data from the Trans-MAPP Research Network, we examined the changes in brain morphology associated with CPP. We used a multivariate pattern classification approach to detect these changes and to identify patterns that could be used to distinguish participants with CPP from age-matched healthy controls. In particular, we used a linear support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to differentiate gray matter images from the 2 groups. Regions of positive SVM weight included several regions within the primary somatosensory cortex, pre-supplementary motor area, hippocampus, and amygdala were identified as important drivers of the classification with 73% overall accuracy. Thus, we have identified a preliminary classifier based on brain structure that is able to predict the presence of CPP with a good degree of predictive power. Our regional findings suggest that in individuals with CPP, greater gray matter density may be found in the identified distributed brain regions, which are consistent with some previous investigations in visceral pain syndromes. Future studies are needed to improve upon our identified preliminary classifier with integration of additional variables and to assess whether the observed differences in brain structure are unique to CPP or generalizable to other chronic pain conditions.

(i) It automatically derives a compact, sparse and meaningful feature representation of sensor data that does not rely on prior expert knowledge and generalizes well across domain boundaries. (ii) It exploits unlabeled sample data for bootstrapping effective activity recognizers, i.e., substantially reduces the amount of ground truth annotation required for model estimation. Such unlabeled data is easy to obtain, e. g., through contemporary smartphones carried by users as they go about their everyday activities. Based on the self-taught learning paradigm we automatically derive an over-complete set of basis vectors from unlabeled data that captures inherent patterns present within activity data. Through projecting raw sensor data onto the feature space defined by such over-complete sets of basis vectors effective feature extraction is pursued. Given these learned feature representations, classification backends are then trained using small amounts of labeled training data. We study the new approach in detail using two datasets which differ in terms of the recognition tasks and sensor modalities. Primarily we focus on a transportation mode analysis task, a popular task in mobile-phone based sensing. The sparse-coding framework demonstrates better performance than the state-of-the-art in supervised learning approaches. More importantly, we show the practical potential of the new approach by successfully evaluating its generalization capabilities across both domain and sensor modalities by considering the popular Opportunity dataset. Our feature learning approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches to analyzing activities of daily living. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Segmentation and classification of capnograms: application in respiratory variability analysis	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						capnograph; signal quality; machine learning; variability analysis	CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; SIGNAL QUALITY INDEXES; MECHANICAL VENTILATION; EXTUBATION; COMPLEXITY; HEART; SHAPE	Variability analysis of respiratory waveforms has been shown to provide key insights into respiratory physiology and has been used successfully to predict clinical outcomes. The current standard for quality assessment of the capnogram signal relies on a visual analysis performed by an expert in order to identify waveform artifacts. Automated processing of capnograms is desirable in order to extract clinically useful features over extended periods of time in a patient monitoring environment. However, the proper interpretation of capnogram derived features depends upon the quality of the underlying waveform. In addition, the comparison of capnogram datasets across studies requires a more practical approach than a visual analysis and selection of high-quality breath data. This paper describes a system that automatically extracts breath-by-breath features from capnograms and estimates the quality of individual breaths derived from them. Segmented capnogram breaths were presented to expert annotators, who labeled the individual physiological breaths into normal and multiple abnormal breath types. All abnormal breath types were aggregated into the abnormal class for the purpose of this manuscript, with respiratory variability analysis as the end-application. A database of 11 526 breaths from over 300 patients was created, comprising around 35% abnormal breaths. Several simple classifiers were trained through a stratified repeated ten-fold cross-validation and tested on an unseen portion of the labeled breath database, using a subset of 15 features derived from each breath curve. Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes classifiers were close in terms of performance (AUC of 90%, 89% and 88% respectively), while using 7, 4 and 5 breath features, respectively. When compared to airflow derived timings, the 95% confidence interval on the mean difference in interbreath intervals was +/- 0.18 s. This breath classification system provides a fast and robust pre-processing of continuous respiratory waveforms, thereby ensuring reliable variability analysis of breath-by-breath parameter time series.

A combined segmenting and non-segmenting approach to signal quality estimation for ambulatory photoplethysmography	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						photoplethysmography; machine learning; signal quality index; heart rate; digital signal processing; pulse oximeter	CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; MEMS ACCELEROMETERS; EXERCISE; SENSORS; REHABILITATION; CANCELLATION; BIOSENSORS; REDUCTION; INDEXES; TIME	Continuous cardiac monitoring of healthy and unhealthy patients can help us understand the progression of heart disease and enable early treatment. Optical pulse sensing is an excellent candidate for continuous mobile monitoring of cardiovascular health indicators, but optical pulse signals are susceptible to corruption from a number of noise sources, including motion artifact. Therefore, before higher-level health indicators can be reliably computed, corrupted data must be separated from valid data. This is an especially difficult task in the presence of artifact caused by ambulation (e.g. walking or jogging), which shares significant spectral energy with the true pulsatile signal. In this manuscript, we present a machine-learning-based system for automated estimation of signal quality of optical pulse signals that performs well in the presence of periodic artifact. We hypothesized that signal processing methods that identified individual heart beats (segmenting approaches) would be more error-prone than methods that did not (nonsegmenting approaches) when applied to data contaminated by periodic artifact. We further hypothesized that a fusion of segmenting and nonsegmenting approaches would outperform either approach alone. Therefore, we developed a novel non-segmenting approach to signal quality estimation that we then utilized in combination with a traditional segmenting approach. Using this system we were able to robustly detect differences in signal quality as labeled by expert human raters (Pearson's r = 0.9263). We then validated our original hypotheses by demonstrating that our non-segmenting approach outperformed the segmenting approach in the presence of contaminated signal, and that the combined system outperformed either individually. Lastly, as an example, we demonstrated the utility of our signal quality estimation system in evaluating the trustworthiness of heart rate measurements derived from optical pulse signals.	[Wander, J.

Because the majority of known disease-causing mutations are exonic non-synonymous single nucleotide variations (nsSNVs), most studies focus on whether these nsSNVs affect protein function. Computational studies show that the impact of nsSNVs on protein function reflects sequence homology and structural information and predict the impact through statistical methods, machine learning techniques, or models of protein evolution. Here, we review impact prediction methods and discuss their underlying principles, their advantages and limitations, and how they compare to and complement one another. Finally, we present current applications and future directions for these methods in biological research and medical genetics.

One particularly challenging problem is cellular nuclear segmentation in highly anisotropic and noisy 3D image data. Manually localizing and segmenting each and every cellular nucleus is very time-consuming, which remains a bottleneck in large-scale biological experiments. In this work, we present a tool for automated segmentation of cellular nuclei from 3D fluorescent microscopic data.

Craters reveal the relative ages of surface units and provide information on surface geology. Extracting craters is one of the fundamental tasks in planetary research. Although many automated crater detection algorithms have been developed to exact craters from image or topographic data, most of them are applicable only in particular regions, and only a few can be widely used, especially in complex surface settings. In this study, we present a machine learning approach to crater detection from topographic data. This approach includes two steps: detecting square regions which contain one crater with the use of a boosting algorithm and delineating the rims of the crater in each square region by local terrain analysis and circular Hough transform. A new variant of Haar-like features (scaled Haar-like features) is proposed and combined with traditional Haar-like features and local binary pattern features to enhance the performance of the classifier. Experimental results with the use of Mars topographic data demonstrate that the developed approach can significantly decrease the false positive detection rate while maintaining a relatively high true positive detection rate even in challenging sites.

Childhood arthritis encompasses a heterogeneous family of diseases. Significant variation in clinical presentation remains despite consensusdriven diagnostic classifications. Developments in data analysis provide powerful tools for interrogating large heterogeneous data sets. We report a novel approach to integrating biologic and clinical data toward a new classification for childhood arthritis, using computational biology for data-driven pattern recognition. Methods. Probabilistic principal components analysis was used to transform a large set of data into 4 interpretable indicators or composite variables on which patients were grouped by cluster analysis. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine key variables in determining indicators and cluster assignment. Results were validated against an independent validation cohort. Results. Meaningful biologic and clinical charac-teristics, including levels of proinflammatory cytokines and measures of disease activity, defined axes/indicators that identified homogeneous patient subgroups by cluster analysis. The new patient classifications resolved major differences between patient subpopulations better than International League of Associations for Rheumatology subtypes. Fourteen variables were identified by sensitivity analysis to crucially determine indicators and clusters. This new schema was conserved in an independent validation cohort. Conclusion. Data-driven unsupervised machine learning is a powerful approach for interrogating clinical and biologic data toward disease classification, providing insight into the biology underlying clinical heterogeneity in childhood arthritis. Our analytical framework enabled the recovery of unique patterns from small cohorts and addresses a major challenge, patient numbers, in studying rare diseases.	[Eng, Simon W.

Characterizing Thalamo-Cortical Disturbances in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Illness	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						bipolar illness; connectivity; resting state; schizophrenia; thalamus	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; INTRINSIC FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; WORKING-MEMORY; BASAL GANGLIA; STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY; HALLUCINATED VOICES; PREDICTION-ERROR; PATTERN-ANALYSIS; HUMAN THALAMUS	Schizophrenia is a devastating neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with distributed brain dysconnectivity that may involve large-scale thalamo-cortical systems. Incomplete characterization of thalamic connectivity in schizophrenia limits our understanding of its relationship to symptoms and to diagnoses with shared clinical presentation, such as bipolar illness, which may exist on a spectrum. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we characterized thalamic connectivity in 90 schizophrenia patients versus 90 matched controls via: (1) Subject-specific anatomically defined thalamic seeds; (2) anatomical and data-driven clustering to assay within-thalamus dysconnectivity; and (3) machine learning to classify diagnostic membership via thalamic connectivity for schizophrenia and for 47 bipolar patients and 47 matched controls. Schizophrenia analyses revealed functionally related disturbances: Thalamic over-connectivity with bilateral sensory-motor cortices, which predicted symptoms, but thalamic under-connectivity with prefrontal-striatal-cerebellar regions relative to controls, possibly reflective of sensory gating and top-down control disturbances. Clustering revealed that this dysconnectivity was prominent for thalamic nuclei densely connected with the prefrontal cortex. Classification and cross-diagnostic results suggest that thalamic dysconnectivity may be a neural marker for disturbances across diagnoses. Present findings, using one of the largest schizophrenia and bipolar neuroimaging samples to date, inform basic understanding of large-scale thalamo-cortical systems and provide vital clues about the complex nature of its disturbances in severe mental illness.

This contribution reports a complementary approach that can be applied to paleoenvironmental research. The choice to use a machine learning method, here regression trees (RT), relied in the ability to learn complex patterns, integrating multiple types of data with different statistical distributions to obtain a knowledge model of geochemical behavior along a paleo-platform. The Late Jurassic epioceanic deposits under scope are represented by six stratigraphic sections located in SE Spain and on the Majorca Island. The used database comprises a total of 1960 data points corresponding to eight variables (stable C and O isotopes, the elements Ca, Mg, Sr, Fe, Mn and skeletal content). This study uses RT models in which the predictive variables are the geochemical proxies, whilst skeletal content is used as a target variable. The resulting model is data driven, explaining variations in the target variable and providing additional information on the relative importance of each variable to each prediction, as well as its corresponding threshold values. The obtained RT revealed a structured distribution of samples, organized either by stratigraphic section or sets of nearby sections. Averaged estimated skeletal abundance confirmed the initial observations of higher skeletal content for the most distal sections with estimated values from 18% to 27%. In contrast, lower skeletal abundance from 5% to 15% is proposed for the remaining sections. The geochemical variable that best discriminates this major trend is delta O-18, at a threshold value of -0.2 parts per thousand, interpreted as evidence for separation of water-mass properties across the studied areas. Other four variables were considered relevant by the obtained decision tree: C isotopes, Ca, Sr and Mn, providing new insights for further differentiation between sets of samples.

Because brain function is a result of coherent activations of a collection of functionally related voxels, lesion-symptom relations are generally contributed by multiple voxels simultaneously. Although voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) has made substantial contributions to the understanding of brain-behavior relationships, a better understanding of the brain-behavior relationship contributed by multiple brain regions needs a multivariate lesion-symptom mapping (MLSM). The purpose of this artilce was to develop an MLSM using a machine learning-based multivariate regression algorithm: support vector regression (SVR). In the proposed SVR-LSM, the symptom relation to the entire lesion map as opposed to each isolated voxel is modeled using a nonlinear function, so the intervoxel correlations are intrinsically considered, resulting in a potentially more sensitive way to examine lesion-symptom relationships. To explore the relative merits of VLSM and SVR-LSM we used both approaches in the analysis of a synthetic dataset. SVR-LSM showed much higher sensitivity and specificity for detecting the synthetic lesion-behavior relations than VLSM. When applied to lesion data and language measures from patients with brain damages, SVR-LSM reproduced the essential pattern of previous findings identified by VLSM and showed higher sensitivity than VLSM for identifying the lesion-behavior relations. Our data also showed the possibility of using lesion data to predict continuous behavior scores. Hum Brain Mapp 35:5861-5876, 2014. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Evolutionary Design of Decision-Tree Algorithms Tailored to Microarray Gene Expression Data Sets	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						Automatic algorithm design; classification; decision trees; evolutionary algorithms; hyper-heuristics; machine learning	CLASSIFICATION TREES; INDUCTION; SELECTION; DISCRETIZATION; RULE	Decision-tree induction algorithms are widely used in machine learning applications in which the goal is to extract knowledge from data and present it in a graphically intuitive way. The most successful strategy for inducing decision trees is the greedy top-down recursive approach, which has been continuously improved by researchers over the past 40 years. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift in the research of decision trees: instead of proposing a new manually designed method for inducing decision trees, we propose automatically designing decision-tree induction algorithms tailored to a specific type of classification data set (or application domain). Following recent breakthroughs in the automatic design of machine learning algorithms, we propose a hyper-heuristic evolutionary algorithm called hyper-heuristic evolutionary algorithm for designing decision-tree algorithms (HEAD-DT) that evolves design components of top-down decision-tree induction algorithms. By the end of the evolution, we expect HEAD-DT to generate a new and possibly better decision-tree algorithm for a given application domain. We perform extensive experiments in 35 real-world microarray gene expression data sets to assess the performance of HEAD-DT, and compare it with very well known decision-tree algorithms such as C4.5, CART, and REPTree. Results show that HEAD-DT is capable of generating algorithms that significantly outperform the baseline manually designed decision-tree algorithms regarding predictive accuracy and F-measure.

This paper develops a two-step approach to evolving ensembles using genetic programming (GP) for unbalanced data. The first step uses multiobjective (MO) GP to evolve a Pareto-approximated front of GP classifiers to form the ensemble by trading-off the minority and the majority class against each other during learning. The MO component alleviates the reliance on sampling to artificially rebalance the data. The second step, which is the focus this paper, proposes a novel ensemble selection approach using GP to automatically find/choose the best individuals for the ensemble. This new GP approach combines multiple Pareto-approximated front members into a single composite genetic program solution to represent the (optimized) ensemble. This ensemble representation has two main advantages/novelties over traditional genetic algorithm (GA) approaches. First, by limiting the depth of the composite solution trees, we use selection pressure during evolution to find small highly-cooperative groups of individuals for the ensemble. This means that ensemble sizes are not fixed a priori (as in GA), but vary depending on the strength of the base learners. Second, we compare different function set operators in the composite solution trees to explore new ways to aggregate the member outputs and thus, control how the ensemble computes its output. We show that the proposed GP approach evolves smaller more diverse ensembles compared to an established ensemble selection algorithm, while still performing as well as, or better than the established approach. The evolved GP ensembles also perform well compared to other bagging and boosting approaches, particularly on tasks with high levels of class imbalance.

This paper introduces Minitaur, an event-driven neural network accelerator, which is designed for low power and high performance. As an field-programmable gate array-based system, it can be integrated into existing robotics or it can offload computationally expensive neural network tasks from the CPU. The version presented here implements a spiking deep network which achieves 19 million postsynaptic currents per second on 1.5 W of power and supports up to 65 K neurons per board. The system records 92% accuracy on the MNIST handwritten digit classification and 71% accuracy on the 20 newsgroups classification data set. Due to its event-driven nature, it allows for trading off between accuracy and latency.

Detection of low-volume blood loss: Compensatory reserve versus traditional vital signs	JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	44th Annual Meeting of the Western-Trauma-Association	MAR 02-07, 2014	Steamboat Springs, CO	Western Trauma Assoc		Machine learning; compensatory reserve index; photoplethysmogram; acute blood loss	BODY NEGATIVE-PRESSURE; PLETH VARIABILITY INDEX; FLUID RESPONSIVENESS; BASE DEFICIT; CENTRAL HYPOVOLEMIA; TRAUMA PATIENTS; EARLY-DIAGNOSIS; SHOCK; HEMORRHAGE; THERAPY	BACKGROUND: Humans are able to compensate for low-volume blood loss with minimal change in traditional vital signs. We hypothesized that a novel algorithm, which analyzes photoplethysmogram (PPG) wave forms to continuously estimate compensatory reserve would provide greater sensitivity and specificity to detect low-volume blood loss compared with traditional vital signs. The compensatory reserve index (CRI) is a measure of the reserve remaining to compensate for reduced central blood volume, where a CRI of 1 represents supine normovolemia and 0 represents the circulating blood volume at which hemodynamic decompensation occurs; values between 1 and 0 indicate the proportion of reserve remaining. METHODS: Subjects underwent voluntary donation of 1 U (approximately 450 mL) of blood. Demographic and continuous noninvasive vital sign wave form data were collected, including PPG, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, cardiac output, and stroke volume. PPG wave forms were later processed by the algorithm to estimate CRI values. RESULTS: Data were collected from 244 healthy subjects (79 males and 165 females), with a mean (SD) age of 40.1 (14.2) years and mean (SD) body mass index of 25.6 (4.7). After blood donation, CRI significantly decreased in 92% (alpha = 0.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 88-95%) of the subjects. With the use of a threshold decrease in CRI of 0.05 or greater for the detection of 1 U of blood loss, the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve was 0.90, with a sensitivity of 0.84 and specificity of 0.86. In comparison, systolic blood pressure (52%; 95% CI, 45-59%), heart rate (65%; 95% CI, 58-72%), cardiac output (47%; 95% CI, 40-54%), and stroke volume (74%; 95% CI, 67-80%) changed in fewer subjects, had significantly lower receiver operating characteristic area under the curve values, and significantly lower specificities for detecting the same volume of blood loss. CONCLUSION: Consistent with our hypothesis, CRI detected low-volume blood loss with significantly greater specificity than other traditional physiologic measures. These findings warrant further evaluation of the CRI algorithm in actual trauma settings.

HamleDT is a compilation of existing dependency treebanks (or dependency conversions of other treebanks), transformed so that they all conform to the same annotation style. In the present article, we provide a thorough investigation and discussion of a number of phenomena that are comparable across languages, though their annotation in treebanks often differs. We claim that transformation procedures can be designed to automatically identify most such phenomena and convert them to a unified annotation style.

Among all the World's oceans, coastal ecosystems are the most modified by human impact and changing at accelerating pace. It is complicated to understand, how various environmental factors affect feeding rates of suspension feeders in their natural habitats. Thus, shapes of such relationships are poorly described for several intersections of environmental gradients. In this study, relationships between grazing rates of an invasive bivalve Dreissena polymorpha and ambient environmental factors were investigated in a turbid eutrophic bay of the central Baltic Sea using a novel modelling method of Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), a statistical tool able to handle non-normal distributions, complex relationships, and interactive effects. Feeding rates of mussels were derived from field populations by measuring the content of algal pigments in specimens collected from their natural habitat. The content of pigments was converted to feeding rate separately each time using field experiments measuring simultaneously the content of pigments and biodeposition of mussels. The results suggest that feeding rates of D. polymorpha are related to several environmental factors which gradients outreach the optimal range for the local mussel population. All the observed effects were non-linear with complex shapes. Variability along the resource gradient was the most important predictor of mussel feeding, followed by salinity and disturbance caused by wind. The most important interaction occurred between disturbance and resource gradient, while feeding function showed more plasticity along the latter. Mapping of environmental tipping points with the aid of machine learning methods may enable to concentrate the most relevant information about ecological functions worldwide. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Automated Indexing of Internet Stories for Health Behavior Change: Weight Loss Attitude Pilot Study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						behavioral medicine; natural language processing; animation; consumer health; health informatics; self-efficacy	DECISIONAL BALANCE; SELF-EFFICACY; UNITED-STATES; OBESITY; MODEL	Background: Automated health behavior change interventions show promise, but suffer from high attrition and disuse. The Internet abounds with thousands of personal narrative accounts of health behavior change that could not only provide useful information and motivation for others who are also trying to change, but an endless source of novel, entertaining stories that may keep participants more engaged than messages authored by interventionists. Objective: Given a collection of relevant personal health behavior change stories gathered from the Internet, the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate an automated indexing algorithm that could select the best possible story to provide to a user to have the greatest possible impact on their attitudes toward changing a targeted health behavior, in this case weight loss. Methods: An indexing algorithm was developed using features informed by theories from behavioral medicine together with text classification and machine learning techniques. The algorithm was trained using a crowdsourced dataset, then evaluated in a 2x2 between-subjects randomized pilot study. One factor compared the effects of participants reading 2 indexed stories vs 2 randomly selected stories, whereas the second factor compared the medium used to tell the stories: text or animated conversational agent. Outcome measures included changes in self-efficacy and decisional balance for weight loss before and after the stories were read. Results: Participants were recruited from a crowdsourcing website (N=103; 53.4%, 55/103 female; mean age 35, SD 10.8 years; 65.0%, 67/103 precontemplation; 19.4%, 20/103 contemplation for weight loss). Participants who read indexed stories exhibited a significantly greater increase in self-efficacy for weight loss compared to the control group (F-1,F-107=5.5, P=.02). There were no significant effects of indexing on change in decisional balance (F-1,F-97=0.05, P=.83) and no significant effects of medium on change in self-efficacy (F-1,F-107=0.04, P=.84) or decisional balance (F-1,F-97=0.78, P=.38). Conclusions: Personal stories of health behavior change can be harvested from the Internet and used directly and automatically in interventions to affect participant attitudes, such as self-efficacy for changing behavior. Such approaches have the potential to provide highly tailored interventions that maximize engagement and retention with minimal intervention development effort.

J	Navarretta, C				Navarretta, Costanza			The Automatic Identification of the Producers of Co-occurring Communicative Behaviours	COGNITIVE COMPUTATION			English	Article						Multimodal corpora; Machine learning; Communicative behaviours; Co-occurring behaviours	BAYESIAN DECISION NETWORKS; SPEAKER IDENTIFICATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ICONIC GESTURES; HEAD MOVEMENTS; SPEECH; RECOGNITION; FEATURES; FEEDBACK	Multimodal communicative behaviours depend on numerous factors such as the communicative situation, the task, the culture and respective relationship of the people involved, their role, age, and background. This paper addresses the identification of the producers of co-occurring communicative non-verbal behaviours in a manually annotated multimodal corpus of spontaneous conversations. The work builds upon a preceding study in which a support vector machine was trained to identify the producers of communicative body behaviours using the annotations of individual behaviour types. In the present work, we investigate to which extent classification results can be improved adding to the training data the shape description of co-occurring body behaviours and temporal information. The inclusion of co-occurring behaviours reflects the fact that people often use more body behaviours at the same time when they communicate. The results of the classification experiments show that the identification of the producers of communicative behaviours improves significantly if co-occurring behaviours are added to the training data. Classification performance further improves when it also uses temporal information. Even though the results vary from body type to body type, they all show that the individual variation of communicative behaviours is large even in a very homogeneous group of people and that this variation is better modelled using information on co-occurring behaviours than individual behaviours. Being able to identify and then react correctly to individual behaviours of people is extremely important in the field of social robotics which involves the use of robots in private homes where they must interact in a natural way with different types of persons having varying needs.

We present a novel model to simulate the two stages of visual processing that are involved in attention. Firstly, the proto-object features are extracted in the pre-attentive stage. On the one hand, the salient pixels and regions are extracted. On the other hand, the semantic proto-objects, which involve all possible states of the observer's memories such as face, person, car, and text, are detected. Then, the support vector machines are utilized to simulate the learning process. As a consequence, the association between the proto-object features and the salient information is established. A visual attention model is built via the method of machine learning, and the saliency information of a new image can be obtained by the way of reasoning. To validate the model, the eye fixations prediction problem on the MIT dataset is studied. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model effectively improves the predictive accuracy rates compared with other approaches.

A classification study of kinematic gait trajectories in hip osteoarthritis	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Gait analysis; Arthritis; Support vector machines; Kinematic trajectories; Trajectory selection	RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS PATIENTS; KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS; 3-DIMENSIONAL KINEMATICS; HUMAN LOCOMOTION; JOINT MOTION; WALKING; WOMAC; DETERMINANTS; REPLACEMENT; IMPAIRMENT	The clinical evaluation of patients in hip osteoarthritis is often done using patient questionnaires. While this provides important information it is also necessary to continue developing objective measures. In this work we further investigate the studies concerning the use of 3D gait analysis to attain this goal. The gait analysis was associated with machine learning methods in order to provide a direct measure of patient control gait discrimination. The applied machine learning method was the support vector machine (SVM). Applying the SVM on all the measured kinematic trajectories, we were able to classify individual patient and control gait cycles with a mean success rate of 88%. With the use of an ROC curve to establish the threshold number of cycles necessary for a subject to be identified as a patient, this allowed for an accuracy of higher than 90% for discriminating patient and control subjects. We then went on to determine the importance of each trajectory. By ranking the capacity of each trajectory for this discrimination, we provided a guide on their order of importance in evaluating patient severity. In order to be clinically relevant, any measure of patient deficit must be compared with clinically validated scores of functional disability. In the case of hip osteoarthritis (OA), the WOMAC scores are currently one of the most widely accepted clinical scores for quantifying OA severity. The kinematic trajectories that provided the best patient-control discrimination with the SVM were found to correlate well but imperfectly with the WOMAC scores, hence indicating the presence of complementary information in the two.

As part of the harvest process, some families have maintained annual harvest diaries, some dating back to the 1950s. We used generalized boosted regression models, a machine-learning algorithm, to calculate a harvest index that takes into account factors that could impact the numbers of birds taken on any given hunt. For predicted vs. observed values, r(2) was between 0.59 and 0.90 for the nanao (first half of the season, when chicks are harvested from burrows during the day) and 0.67 and 0.88 for the rama (second half of the season, during which chicks are harvested from the surface at night). Exploration of the controlling factors of the models revealed that day of season plays an important role in predicting daily harvest during the second half of the season (the rama). The nightly tally in the rama peaked approximately halfway through (10-15 days in), which is probably related to the timing of birds emerging from burrows to fledge. The models also suggested that data from the rama (when chicks are 100-120 days old) may be the most suitable for long-term monitoring of populations of Sooty Shearwaters due to consistencies in calculated harvest indices between diaries. Nanao harvest indices, although less consistent, showed patterns similar to those of the rama. When comparing these data to the harvest indices calculated by general linear models by Clucas and colleagues, we found that the agreement between both indices was r(2) = 0.31 and r(2) = 0.59 for the nanao and rama, respectively. The use of machine learning to correct for extraneous factors (e.g., hunting effort, skill level, or weather) and to create standardized measures could be applied to other systems such as fisheries or terrestrial resource management.

Supervised and subsymbolic approaches have proven accurate in learning a problem's classes. However, in the complex image recognition domain, there is a need for investigation of learning techniques that allow humans to interpret the learned rules in order to gain an insight about the problem. Learning classifier systems (LCSs) are a machine learning technique that have been minimally explored for image classification. This work has developed the feature pattern classification system (FPCS) framework by adopting Haar-like features from the image recognition domain for feature extraction. The FPCS integrates Haar-like features with XCS, which is an accuracy-based LCS. A major contribution of this work is that the developed framework is capable of producing human-interpretable rules. The FPCS system achieved 91 +/- 1% accuracy on the unseen test set of the MNIST dataset. In addition, the FPCS is capable of autonomously adjusting the rotation angle in unaligned images. This rotation adjustment raised the accuracy of FPCS to 95%. Although the performance is competitive with equivalent approaches, this was not as accurate as subsymbolic approaches on this dataset. However, the benefit of the interpretability of rules produced by FPCS enabled us to identify the distribution of the learned angles-a normal distribution around 0 degrees-which would have been very difficult in subsymbolic approaches. The analyzable nature of FPCS is anticipated to be beneficial in domains such as speed sign recognition, where underlying reasoning and confidence of recognition needs to be human interpretable.

Conventional genetic mapping methods typically assume parametric models with Gaussian errors and obtain parameter estimates through maximum-likelihood estimation. In contrast with univariate regression and interval-mapping methods, our model requires fewer assumptions and also accommodates various machine-learning algorithms. Estimation is performed with targeted maximum-likelihood learning methods. We demonstrate our semiparametric targeted learning approach in a simulation study and a well-studied barley data set.

Knowledge about the nature of PPIs can help fill the widening gap between sequence information and functional annotations. Although experimental methods have produced valuable PPI data, they also suffer from significant limitations. Computational PPI prediction methods have attracted tremendous attentions. Despite considerable efforts, PPI prediction is still in its infancy in complex multicellular organisms such as humans. Here, we propose a novel ensemble learning method, LocFuse, which is useful in human PPI prediction. This method uses eight different genomic and proteomic features along with four types of different classifiers. The prediction performance of this classifier selection method was found to be considerably better than methods employed hitherto. This confirms the complex nature of the PPI prediction problem and also the necessity of using biological information for classifier fusion. The LocFuse is available at: http://lbb.ut.ac.ir/Download/LBBsoft/LocFuse. Biological significance: The results revealed that if we divide proteome space according to the cellular localization of proteins, then the utility of some classifiers in PPI prediction can be improved. Therefore, to predict the interaction for any given protein pair, we can select the most accurate classifier with regard to the cellular localization information. Based on the results, we can say that the importance of different features for PPI prediction varies between differently localized proteins; however in general, our novel features, which were extracted from position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs), are the most important ones and the Random Forest (RF) classifier performs best in most cases. LocFuse was developed with a user-friendly graphic interface and it is freely available for Linux, Mac OSX and MS Windows operating systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Previously, gene expression microarrays were successfully used to identify biomarkers and explore immune responses during PA immunotherapy. Objective: We aimed to characterize peanut-specific responses from patients with PA, subjects with PS, and atopic children without peanut allergy (NA children). Methods: A preliminary exploratory microarray investigation of gene expression in peanut-activated memory TH subsets from 3 children with PA and 3 NA children identified potential PA diagnostic biomarkers. Microarray findings were confirmed by using real-time quantitative PCR in 30 subjects (12 children with PA, 12 children with PS, and 6 NA children). Flow cytometry was used to identify the TH subsets involved. Results: Among 12,257 differentially expressed genes, IL9 showed the greatest difference between children with PA and NA children (45.59-fold change, P < .001), followed by IL5 and then IL13. Notably, IL9 allowed the most accurate classification of children with PA and NA children by using a machine-learning approach with recursive feature elimination and the random forest algorithm. Skin- and gut-homing TH cells from donors with PA expressed similar T(H)2- and T(H)9-associated genes. Real-time quantitative PCR confirmed that IL9 was the highest differentially expressed gene between children with PA and NA children (23.3-fold change, P < .01) and children with PS (18.5-fold change, P < .05). Intracellular cytokine staining showed that IL-9 and the T(H)2-specific cytokine IL-5 are produced by distinct T-H populations. Conclusion: In this study IL9 best differentiated between children with PA and children with PS (and atopic NA children). Mutually exclusive production of IL-9 and the T(H)2-specific cytokine IL-5 suggests that the IL-9-producing cells belong to the recently described T(H)9 subset.

Consequently, lists of potential interactions must be pruned of contaminants before network construction and interpretation, historically an expensive, time-intensive, and error-prone task. In recent years, numerous computational methods were developed to identify genuine interactions from the hundreds of candidates. Here, comparative analysis of three popular algorithms, HGSCore, CompPASS, and SAINT, revealed complementarity in their classification accuracies, which is supported by their divergent scoring strategies. We improved each algorithm by an average area under a receiver operating characteristics curve increase of 16% by integrating a variety of indirect data known to correlate with established protein-protein interactions, including mRNA coexpression, gene ontologies, domain-domain binding affinities, and homologous protein interactions. Each APMS scoring approach was incorporated into a separate logistic regression model along with the indirect features; the resulting three classifiers demonstrate improved performance on five diverse APMS data sets. To facilitate APMS data scoring within the scientific community, we created Spotlite, a user-friendly and fast web application. Within Spotlite, data can be scored with the augmented classifiers, annotated, and visualized (http://cancer.unc.edu/majorlab/software.php). The utility of the Spotlite platform to reveal physical, functional, and disease-relevant characteristics within APMS data is established through a focused analysis of the KEAP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase.

In silico chemogenomic methods are recently recognized as a promising approach for genome-wide scale prediction of drug-target interactions, but the prediction performance depends heavily on the descriptors and similarity measures of drugs and proteins. In this paper, we investigated the performance of various descriptors and similarity measures of drugs and proteins for the drug-target interaction prediction using a chemogenomic approach. We compared the prediction accuracy of 18 chemical descriptors of drugs (e.g., ECFP, FCFP, E-state, CDK, Klekota-Roth, MACCS, PubChem, Dragon, KCF-S, and graph kernels) and 4 descriptors of proteins (e.g., amino acid composition, domain profile, local sequence similarity, and string kernel) on about one hundred thousand drug-target interactions. We examined the combinatorial effects of drug descriptors and protein descriptors using the same benchmark data under several experimental conditions. Large-scale experiments showed that our proposed KCF-S descriptor worked the best in terms of prediction accuracy. The comparative results are expected to be useful for selecting chemical descriptors in various pharmaceutical applications.

In this study, we assessed the effect of a HSD on the transcriptional activity of adipogenic genes in a time-course study to provide insight regarding the genetic networks involved in the rWAT response to dietary sugar. Methods and results: Weaned male Wistar rats were fed a standard chow diet or HSD (68% carbohydrates) for 4, 8 or 12 weeks, and rWAT was removed for histopathology and PCR array (adipogenesis) analyses. The HSD induced adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia in rWAT after 12 weeks of ingestion. Additionally, the HSD altered serum VLDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerol and glucometabolic parameters. Hierarchical clustering revealed HSD-induced changes in the expression patterns of the tested gene set. Pathway analysis, which used the enrichment analysis algorithm of the Thompson Reuters MetaCore platform, associated a cluster of differentially expressed genes with canonical pathways related to regulating adipocyte differentiation and proliferation (p-value < 10(-7)). Conclusion: HSD feeding post-weaning increased both the adipocyte size and number by simultaneously up-regulating pro-adipogenic signals (the PPAR gamma pathway) and down-regulating anti-adipogenic signals (Wnt pathway) in young adults.

The present study aimed to apply a novel data-driven machine-learning approach to functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data obtained during a cognitive task in order to delineate the neural mechanisms involved in two schizophrenia subgroups: schizophrenia patients with and without Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Methods: 16 schizophrenia patients with OCD ("schizo-obsessive"), 17 pure schizophrenia patients, and 20 healthy controls underwent fMRI while performing a working memory task. A whole brain search for activation clusters of cognitive load was performed using a recently developed data-driven multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) approach, termed Searchlight Based Feature Extraction (SBFE), and which yields a robust fMRI-based classifier. Results: The SBFE successfully classified the two schizophrenia groups with 91% accuracy based on activations in the right intraparietal sulcus (r-IPS), which further correlated with reduced symptom severity among schizo-obsessive patients.

Insight into bacterial colonization patterns and microbiota stability at a young age might elucidate healthy or susceptible conditions for development of respiratory disease. Objectives: To study bacterial succession of the respiratory microbiota in the first 2 years of life and its relation to respiratory health characteristics. Methods: Upper respiratory microbiota profiles of 60 healthy children at the ages of 1.5, 6, 12, and 24 months were characterized by 16S-based pyrosequencing. We determined consecutive microbiota profiles by machine-learning algorithms and validated the findings cross-sectionally in an additional cohort of 140 children per age group. Measurements and Main Results: Overall, we identified eight distinct microbiota profiles in the upper respiratory tract of healthy infants. Profiles could already be identified at 1.5 months of age and were associated with microbiota stability and change over the first 2 years of life. More stable patterns were marked by early presence and high abundance of Moraxella and Corynebacterium/ Dolosigranulum and were positively associated with breastfeeding in the first period of life and with lower rates of parental-reported respiratory infections in the consecutive periods. Less stable profiles were marked by high abundance of Haemophilus or Streptococcus. Conclusions: These findings provide novel insights into microbial succession in the respiratory tract in infancy and link early-life profiles to microbiota stability and respiratory health characteristics. New prospective studies should elucidate potential implications of our findings for early diagnosis and prevention of respiratory infections.	[Biesbroek, Giske; Sanders, Elisabeth A.

About 30% of patients do not respond to this therapy for unknown reasons. In this study, we aimed at the identification and classification of CRT responder by the use of genetic variants and clinical parameters. Methods and Results-Of 1421 CRT patients, 207 subjects were consecutively selected, and CRT responder and nonresponder were matched for their baseline parameters before CRT. Treatment success of CRT was defined as a decrease in left ventricular end-systolic volume >15% at follow-up echocardiography compared with left ventricular end-systolic volume at baseline. All other changes classified the patient as CRT nonresponder. A genetic association study was performed, which identified 4 genetic variants to be associated with the CRT responder phenotype at the allelic (P<0.035) and genotypic (P<0.031) level: rs3766031 (ATPIB1), rs5443 (GNB3), rs5522 (NR3C2), and rs7325635 (TNFSF11). Machine learning algorithms were used for the classification of CRT patients into responder and nonresponder status, including combinations of the identified genetic variants and clinical parameters. Conclusions-We demonstrated that rule induction algorithms can successfully be applied for the classification of heart failure patients in CRT responder and nonresponder status using clinical and genetic parameters. Our analysis included information on alleles and genotypes of 4 genetic loci, rs3766031 (ATPIB1), rs5443 (GNB3), rs5522 (NR3C2), and rs7325635 (TNFSF11), pathophysiologically associated with remodeling of the failing ventricle.

ECOGRAPHY			English	Review							SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION; HABITAT MODELS; GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS; VARIABLE IMPORTANCE; REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; ECOLOGICAL THEORY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BETA-FUNCTION; NULL-MODEL; PREDICTION	Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to explain and predict species ranges and environmental niches. They are most commonly constructed by inferring species' occurrence-environment relationships using statistical and machine-learning methods. The variety of methods that can be used to construct SDMs (e.g. generalized linear/additive models, tree-based models, maximum entropy, etc.), and the variety of ways that such models can be implemented, permits substantial flexibility in SDM complexity. Building models with an appropriate amount of complexity for the study objectives is critical for robust inference. We characterize complexity as the shape of the inferred occurrence-environment relationships and the number of parameters used to describe them, and search for insights into whether additional complexity is informative or superfluous. By building 'under fit' models, having insufficient flexibility to describe observed occurrence-environment relationships, we risk misunderstanding the factors shaping species distributions. By building 'over fit' models, with excessive flexibility, we risk inadvertently ascribing pattern to noise or building opaque models. However, model selection can be challenging, especially when comparing models constructed under different modeling approaches. Here we argue for a more pragmatic approach: researchers should constrain the complexity of their models based on study objective, attributes of the data, and an understanding of how these interact with the underlying biological processes. We discuss guidelines for balancing under fitting with over fitting and consequently how complexity affects decisions made during model building. Although some generalities are possible, our discussion reflects differences in opinions that favor simpler versus more complex models. We conclude that combining insights from both simple and complex SDM building approaches best advances our knowledge of current and future species ranges.

Exploiting sparsity and equation-free architectures in complex systems	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS			English	Review							PROPER ORTHOGONAL DECOMPOSITION; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BALANCED MODEL-REDUCTION; UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLES; FEEDBACK-CONTROL; SIGNAL RECOVERY; FLOWS; POD; REPRESENTATION; FLUIDS	Complex systems exhibit dynamics that typically evolve on low-dimensional attractors and may have sparse representation in some optimal basis. Recently developed compressive sensing techniques exploit this sparsity for state reconstruction and/or categorical identification from limited measurements. We argue that data-driven dimensionality reduction methods integrate naturally with sparse sensing in the context of complex systems. This framework works equally well with a physical model or in an equation-free context, where data is available but the governing equations may be unknown. We demonstrate the advantages of combining these methods on three prototypical examples: classification of dynamical regimes, optimal sensor placement, and equation-free dynamic model reduction. These examples motivate the potentially transformative role that state-of-the-art data methods and machine learning can play in the analysis of complex systems.	[Proctor, J.

In this paper, we present a fully automated system for recognition from ear images based upon sparse representation. In sparse representation, extracted features from the training data is used to develop a dictionary. Classification is achieved by representing the extracted features of the test data as a linear combination of entries in the dictionary. In fact, there are many solutions for this problem and the goal is to find the sparsest solution. We use a relatively new algorithm named smoothed l(0) norm to find the sparsest solution and Gabor wavelet features are used for building the dictionary. Furthermore, we expand the proposed approach for gender classification from ear images. Several researches have addressed this issue based on facial images. We introduce a novel approach based on majority voting for gender classification. Experimental results conducted on the University of Notre Dame (UND) collection J data set, containing large appearance, pose, and lighting variations, resulted in a gender classification rate of 89.49%. Furthermore, the proposed method is evaluated on the WVU data set and classification rates for different view angles are presented. Results show improvement and great robustness in gender classification over existing methods.

Methods and Materials: The proposed method combines the atlas registration method, which captures the global variation of anatomy, with a machine learning technology, which captures the local statistical features, to automatically segment the parotid glands from the MRIs. The segmentation method consists of 3 major steps. First, an atlas (pre-RT MRI and manually contoured parotid gland mask) is built for each patient. A hybrid deformable image registration is used to map the pre-RT MRI to the post-RT MRI, and the transformation is applied to the pre-RT parotid volume. Second, the kernel support vector machine (SVM) is trained with the subject-specific atlas pair consisting of multiple features (intensity, gradient, and others) from the aligned pre-RT MRI and the transformed parotid volume. Third, the well-trained kernel SVM is used to differentiate the parotid from surrounding tissues in the post-RT MRIs by statistically matching multiple texture features. A longitudinal study of 15 patients undergoing head and neck RT was conducted: baseline MRI was acquired prior to RT, and the post-RT MRIs were acquired at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up examinations. The resulting segmentations were compared with the physicians' manual contours. Results: Successful parotid segmentation was achieved for all 15 patients (42 post-RT MRIs). The average percentage of volume differences between the automated segmentations and those of the physicians' manual contours were 7.98% for the left parotid and 8.12% for the right parotid. The average volume overlap was 91.1% +/- 1.6% for the left parotid and 90.5% +/- 2.4% for the right parotid. The parotid gland volume reduction at follow-up was 25% at 3 months, 27% at 6 months, and 16% at 12 months. Conclusions: We have validated our automated parotid segmentation algorithm in a longitudinal study. This segmentation method may be useful in future studies to address radiation-induced xerostomia in head and neck radiation therapy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Numerous efficient algorithms exist that are able to discover various types of patterns in large datasets. Unfortunately, the problem of identifying patterns that are genuinely interesting to a particular user remains challenging. Current approaches generally require considerable data mining expertise or effort from the data analyst, and hence cannot be used by typical domain experts. To address this, we introduce a generic framework for interactive learning of user-specific pattern ranking functions. The user is only asked to rank small sets of patterns, while a ranking function is inferred from this feedback by preference learning techniques. Moreover, we propose a number of active learning heuristics to minimize the effort required from the user, while ensuring that accurate rankings are obtained. We show how the learned ranking functions can be used to mine new, more interesting patterns. We demonstrate two concrete instances of our framework for two different pattern mining tasks, frequent itemset mining and subgroup discovery. We empirically evaluate the capacity of the algorithm to learn pattern rankings by emulating users. Experiments demonstrate that the system is able to learn accurate rankings, and that the active learning heuristics help reduce the required user effort. Furthermore, using the learned ranking functions as search heuristics allows discovering patterns of higher quality than those in the initial set. This shows that machine learning techniques in general, and active preference learning in particular, are promising building blocks for interactive data mining systems.

Automatic Selection of Order Parameters in the Analysis of Large Scale Molecular Dynamics Simulations	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION			English	Article							TRANSITION PATHS; UBIQUITIN; MECHANISM; KINASES; REVEAL; STATES; MODEL	Given the large number of crystal structures and NMR ensembles that have been solved to date, classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become powerful tools in the atomistic study of the kinetics and thermodynamics of biomolecular systems on ever increasing time scales. By virtue of the high-dimensional conformational state space that is explored, the interpretation of large-scale simulations faces difficulties not unlike those in the big data community. We address this challenge by introducing a method called clustering based feature selection (CB-FS) that employs a posterior analysis approach. It combines supervised machine learning (SML) and feature selection with Markov state models to automatically identify the relevant degrees of freedom that separate conformational states. We highlight the utility of the method in the evaluation of large-scale simulations and show that it can be used for the rapid and automated identification of relevant order parameters involved in the functional transitions of two exemplary cell-signaling proteins central to human disease states.

We developed a technique to identify a prey capture signature for little penguins from accelerometry, in order to quantify food intake remotely. We categorised behaviour of captive penguins from HD video and matched this to time-series data from back-mounted accelerometers. We then trained a support vector machine (SVM) to classify the penguins' behaviour at 0.3 s intervals as either 'prey handling' or 'swimming'. We applied this model to accelerometer data collected from foraging wild penguins to identify prey capture events. We compared prey capture and non-prey capture dives to test the model predictions against foraging theory. The SVM had an accuracy of 84.95 +/- 0.26% (mean +/- s.e.) and a false positive rate of 9.82 +/- 0.24% when tested on unseen captive data. For wild data, we defined three independent, consecutive prey handling observations as representing true prey capture, with a false positive rate of 0.09%. Dives with prey captures had longer duration and bottom times, were deeper, had faster ascent rates, and had more 'wiggles' and 'dashes' (proxies for prey encounter used in other studies). The mean (+/- s.e.) number of prey captures per foraging trip was 446.6 +/- 66.28. By recording the behaviour of captive animals on HD video and using a supervised machine learning approach, we show that accelerometry signatures can classify the behaviour of wild animals at unprecedentedly fine scales.

Opinion mining detects whether the emotions of an opinion expressed by a user on Web platforms in natural language are positive or negative. This paper presents extensive experiments to study the effectiveness of the classification of Spanish opinions in five categories: highly positive, highly negative, positive, negative and neutral, using the combination of the psychological and linguistic features of LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count). LIWC is a text analysis software that enables the extraction of different psychological and linguistic features from natural language text. For this study, two corpora have been used, one about movies and one about technological products. Furthermore, we conducted a comparative assessment of the performance of various classification techniques, J48, SMO and BayesNet, using precision, recall and F-measure metrics. The findings revealed that the positive and negative categories provide better results than the other categories. Finally, experiments on both corpora indicated that SMO produces better results than BayesNet and J48 algorithms, obtaining an F-measure of 90.4 and 87.2% in each domain.

A Method for Wind Speed Forecasting in Airports Based on Nonparametric Regression	WEATHER AND FORECASTING			English	Article						Regression analysis; Statistical techniques; Probability forecasts; models; distribution	MODEL; CLIMATE; OUTPUT	Wind is one of the parameters best predicted by numerical weather models, as it can be directly calculated from the physical equations of pressure that govern its movement. However, local winds are considerably affected by topography, which global numerical weather models, due to their limited resolution, are not able to reproduce. To improve the skill of numerical weather models, statistical and data analysis methods can be used. Machine learning techniques can be applied to train a model with data coming from both the model and observations in the area of interest. In this paper, a new method based on nonparametric multivariate locally weighted regression is studied for improving the forecasted wind speed of a numerical weather model. Wind direction data are used to build different regression models, as a way of accounting for the effect of surrounding topography. The use of this technique offers similar levels of accuracy for wind speed forecasts compared with other machine learning algorithms with the advantage of being more intuitive and easy to interpret.

Our approach combines the data, available from prior production runs, with machine learning algorithms that are assisted by a human operator with expert knowledge of the production process. The process parameters encompass those that relate to the attributes of the precursor raw materials and those that relate to the manufacturing process itself. During manufacturing, our method allows production operator to inspect the impacts of various settings of process parameters within their proven acceptable range with the purpose of choosing the most promising values in advance of the actual batch manufacture. The interaction between the human operator and the artificial intelligence system provides improved performance and quality. We successfully implemented the method on data provided by a pharmaceutical company for a particular product, a tablet, under development. We tested the accuracy of the method in comparison with some other machine learning approaches. The method is especially suitable for analyzing manufacturing processes characterized by a limited amount of data.

The proposed Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system classified Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC) and normal Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The classification quality was measured and expressed as accuracy, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), sensitivity and specificity. The ECG records, which were used to establish the CAD system quality, were obtained from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. These signals were analyzed in four stages. The pre-processing stage standardized and improved the ECG signals by subjecting them to Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) based noise reduction. The second stage used Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for dimension reduction. The third stage assessed the extracted features with Student's t-test to determine if the features were discriminative enough to serve as classifier input. At the last stage, two unsupervised classifiers, k-means and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), were used to find clusters. The proposed system achieved: accuracy = 80.94%, sensitivity = 81.10% and specificity = 80.1%.

Previously many machine learning approaches for sentiment analysis such as simple feature-oriented SVM or more complicated probabilistic models have been proposed. Though they have demonstrated capability in polarity detection, there exist one challenge called the curse of dimensionality due to the high dimensional nature of text-based documents. In this research, inspired by the dimensionality reduction and feature extraction capability of auto-encoders, an auto-encoder-based bagging prediction architecture (AEBPA) is proposed. The experimental study on commonly used datasets has shown its potential. It is believed that this method can offer the researchers in the community further insight into bagging oriented solution for sentimental analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Among these, many research efforts are aimed at predicting traffic congestions to alleviate their negative effects on society, mainly by learning recurring mobility patterns. Within this field, in this paper we propose an integrated solution to predict and visualize non-recurring traffic congestion in urban environments caused by Planned Special Events (PSE), such as a soccer game or a concert. Predictions are done by means of two Machine Learning-based techniques. These have been proven to successfully outperform current state of the art predictions by 35% in an empirical assessment we conducted over a time frame of 7 months within the inner city of Cologne, Germany. The predicted congestions are fed into a specifically conceived visualization tool we designed to allow Decision Makers to evaluate the situation and take actions to improve mobility.

J	Doktor, D; Lausch, A; Spengler, D; Thurner, M				Doktor, Daniel; Lausch, Angela; Spengler, Daniel; Thurner, Martin			Extraction of Plant Physiological Status from Hyperspectral Signatures Using Machine Learning Methods	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						hyperspectral data; vegetation status; random forest; PROSAIL; crop	RANDOM FORESTS; CHLOROPHYLL CONTENT; FEATURE REDUCTION; WATER-STRESS; LAND-COVER; CLASSIFICATION; MODEL; REGRESSION; ALGORITHMS; VEGETATION	The machine learning method, random forest (RF), is applied in order to derive biophysical and structural vegetation parameters from hyperspectral signatures. Hyperspectral data are, among other things, characterized by their high dimensionality and autocorrelation. Common multivariate regression approaches, which usually include only a limited number of spectral indices as predictors, do not make full use of the available information. In contrast, machine learning methods, such as RF, are supposed to be better suited to extract information on vegetation status. First, vegetation parameters are extracted from hyperspectral signatures simulated with the radiative transfer model, PROSAIL. Second, the transferability of these results with respect to laboratory and field measurements is investigated. In situ observations of plant physiological parameters and corresponding spectra are gathered in the laboratory for summer barley (Hordeum vulgare). Field in situ measurements focus on winter crops over several growing seasons. Chlorophyll content, Leaf Area Index and phenological growth stages are derived from simulated and measured spectra. RF performs very robustly and with a very high accuracy on PROSAIL simulated data. Furthermore, it is almost unaffected by introduced noise and bias in the data. When applied to laboratory data, the prediction accuracy is still good (C-ab: R-2 = 0.94/ LAI: R-2 = 0.80/BBCH (Growth stages of mono-and dicotyledonous plants) : R-2 = 0.91), but not as high as for simulated spectra. Transferability to field measurements is given with prediction levels as high as for laboratory data (C-ab: R-2 = 0.89/LAI: R-2 = 0.89/BBCH: R-2 = similar to 0.8). Wavelengths for deriving plant physiological status based on simulated and measured hyperspectral signatures are mostly selected from appropriate spectral regions (both field and laboratory): 700-800 nm regressing on C-ab and 800-1300 nm regressing on LAI. Results suggest that the prediction accuracy of vegetation parameters using RF is not hampered by the high dimensionality of hyperspectral signatures (given preceding feature reduction). Wavelengths selected as important for prediction might, however, vary between underlying datasets. The introduction of changing environmental factors (soil, illumination conditions) has some detrimental effect, but more important factors seem to stem from measurement uncertainties and plant geometries.

This results in ionic current fluctuations that correlate with unfolding and passage of intact protein strands through the pore lumen. It is plausible that this technology could be used to identify protein domains and structural modifications at the single-molecule level that arise from subtle changes in primary amino acid sequence (e.g., point mutations). As a test, we engineered proteins bearing well-characterized domains connected in series along an similar to 700 amino acid strand. Point mutations in a titin immunoglobulin domain (titin I27) and point mutations, proteolytic cleavage, and rearrangement of beta-strands in green fluorescent protein (GFP), caused ionic current pattern changes for single strands predicted by bulk phase and force spectroscopy experiments. Among these variants, individual proteins could be classified at 86-99% accuracy using standard machine learning tools. We conclude that a ClpXP-nanopore device can discriminate among distinct protein domains, and that sequence-dependent variations within those domains are detectable.

The aim of the current study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of LUS and an integrative cardiopulmonary ultrasound approach (thoracic ultrasonography [TUS]) in patients with ARF. METHODS: We prospectively recruited patients consecutively admitted for ARF to the ICU of a university teaching hospital over a 12-month period. Inclusion criteria were age >= 18 years and the presence of criteria for severe ARF justifying ICU admission. We compared both LUS and TUS approaches and the final diagnosis determined by a panel of experts using machine learning methods to improve the accuracy of the final diagnostic classifiers. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-six patients were included (age, 68 +/- 15 years; sex ratio, 1). A three-dimensional partial least squares and multinomial logistic regression model was developed and subsequently tested in an independent sample of patients. Overall, the diagnostic accuracy of TUS was significantly greater than LUS (P < .05, learning and test sample). Comparisons between receiver operating characteristic curves showed that TUS significantly improves the diagnosis of cardiogenic edema (P < .001, learning and test samples), pneumonia (P < .001, learning and test samples), and pulmonary embolism (P < .001, learning sample). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated for the first time to our knowledge a significantly better performance of TUS than LUS in the diagnosis of ARF. Th e value of the TUS approach was particularly important to disambiguate cases of hemodynamic pulmonary edema and pneumonia. We suggest that the bedside use of artificial intelligence methods in this setting could pave the way for the development of new clinically relevant integrative diagnostic models.

J	Bauer, J; Nanopoulos, A				Bauer, Josef; Nanopoulos, Alexandros			Recommender systems based on quantitative implicit customer feedback	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Recommender systems; Machine learning; Data mining; Matrix factorization; e-Commerce		Due to the abundant variety of products offered by e-commerce companies and online service providers, recommender systems become an increasingly important decision aid for customers. In this paper we focus on quantitative implicit customer feedback like sales and play records data. We extend the current state-of-the-art method for recommendations based on matrix factorization under a normal distribution assumption by allowing for different distributions which are more suitable to model this kind of data. In particular, we use the Poisson, the inverse Gaussian and the gamma distribution as extensions. The experimental evaluation with three realworld data sets shows the improved performance of our approach and we demonstrate the merit of using various distributions depending on the respective data set.

Previous efforts for creating automatic bug assignment systems use machine learning and information-retrieval techniques. These approaches commonly use tf-idf, a statistical computation technique for weighting terms based on term frequency. However, tf-idf does not consider the metadata, such as the time frame at which a term was used, when calculating the weight of the terms. This study proposes an alternate term-weighting technique to improve the accuracy of automatic bug assignment approaches that use a term-weighting technique. This technique includes the use of metadata in addition to the statistical computation to calculate the term weights. Moreover, it restricts the set of terms used to only nouns. It was found that when using only nouns and the proposed term-weighting technique, the accuracy of an automatic bug assignment approach improves from 12 to 49% over tf-idf for three open-source projects.

Incidence and prevalence of IBD have been increasing dramatically over the past several decades, although the causes for this increase are still unknown. IBD has both a complex genotype and a complex phenotype, and although it has received substantial attention from the medical research community over recent years, much of the etiology remains unexplained. Genome-wide association studies have identified a rich genetic signature of disease risk in patients with IBD, consisting of at least 163 genetic loci. Many of these loci contain genes directly involved in microbial handling, indicating that the genetic architecture of the disease has been driven by host microbe interactions. In addition, systematic shifts in gut microbiome structure (enterotype) and function have been observed in patients with IBD. Furthermore, both the host genotype and enterotype are associated with aspects of the disease phenotype, including location of the disease. This provides strong evidence of interactions between host genotype and enterotype; however, there is a lack of published multi-omics data from IBD patients, and a lack of bioinformatics tools for modeling such systems. In this article we discuss, from a computational biologist's point of view, the potential benefits of and the challenges involved in designing and analyzing such multi-omics studies of IBD.

To compare the visual fields (VFs) of preperimetric open angle glaucoma (OAG) patients (preperimetric glaucoma VFs, PPGVFs) with the VFs of healthy eyes, and to discriminate these two groups by using the Random Forests machine-learning method. METHODS. All VFs before a first diagnosis of manifest glaucoma (Anderson-Patella's criteria) were classified as PPGVFs. Series of VFs were obtained with the Humphrey Field Analyzer 302 program from 171 PPGVFs from 53 eyes in 51 OAG or OAG suspect patients and 108 healthy eyes of 87 normal subjects. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC) in discriminating between PPGVFs and healthy VFs was calculated by using the Random Forests method, with 52 total deviation (TD) values, mean deviation (MD), and pattern standard deviation (PSD) as predictors. RESULTS. There was a significant difference in MD between healthy VFs and PPGVFs (-0.03 +/- 1.11 and -0.91 +/- 1.56 dB [mean +/- standard deviation], respectively; P < 0.001, linear mixed model) and in PSD (1.56 +/- 0.33 and 1.97 +/- 0.43 dB, respectively; P < 0.001). A significant difference was observed in the TD values between healthy VFs and PPGVFs at 25 (P < 0.001) of 52 test points (linear mixed model). The AROC obtained by using the Random Forests method was 79.0% (95% confidence interval, 73.5%-84.5%). CONCLUSIONS. Differences exist between healthy VFs and VFs of preperimetric glaucoma eyes, which go on to develop manifest glaucoma; these two groups of VFs could be well distinguished by using the Random Forests classifier.

We assess their performance in combination with different kernels (i.e. which use distance-based and angle-based metrics). The assessment is done in two experiments, under ideal conditions in the laboratory and, separately, in the field (an operational open pit mine) using natural light. For both experiments independent training and test sets are used. Results show that GPs generally outperform the SVMs, irrespective of the kernel used. Furthermore, angle-based methods, including the Spectral Angle Mapper, outperform GPs and SVMs when using distance-based (i.e. stationary) kernels in the field experiment. A new GP method using an angle-based (i.e. a non-stationary) kernel - the Observation Angle Dependent (OAD) covariance function - outperforms SAM and SVMs in both experiments using only a small number of training spectra. These findings show that distance-based kernels are more affected by changes in illumination between the training and test set than are angular-based methods/kernels. Taken together, this study shows that independent training data can be used for classification of hyperspectral data in the field such as in open pit mines, by using Bayesian machine-learning methods and non-stationary kernels such as GPs and the DAD kernel. This provides a necessary component for automated classifications, such as autonomous mining where many images have to be classified without user interaction. (C) 2014 The Authors.

J	Lv, XB; Guan, Y; Deng, BY				Lv, Xinbo; Guan, Yi; Deng, Benyang			Transfer learning based clinical concept extraction on data from multiple sources	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Clinical concept extraction; Transfer learning; TrAdaBoost; Bagging; Machine learning	INFORMATION EXTRACTION; BIOMEDICAL TEXT; ASSERTIONS; DOCUMENTS	Machine learning methods usually assume that training data and test data are drawn from the same distribution. However, this assumption often cannot be satisfied in the task of clinical concept extraction. The main aim of this paper was to use training data from one institution to build a concept extraction model for data from another institution with a different distribution. An instance-based transfer learning method, TrAdaBoost, was applied in this work. To prevent the occurrence of a negative transfer phenomenon with TrAdaBoost, we integrated it with Bagging, which provides a "softer" weights update mechanism with only a tiny amount of training data from the target domain. Two data sets named BETH and PARTNERS from the 2010 i2b2/VA challenge as well as BETHBIO, a data set we constructed ourselves, were employed to show the effectiveness of our work's transfer ability. Our method outperforms the baseline model by 2.3% and 4.4% when the baseline model is trained by training data that are combined from the source domain and the target domain in two experiments of BETH vs. PARTNERS and BETHBIO vs. PARTNERS, respectively. Additionally, confidence intervals for the performance metrics suggest that our method's results have statistical significance. Moreover, we explore the applicability of our method for further experiments. With our method, only a tiny amount of labeled data from the target domain is required to build a concept extraction model that produces better performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

EHRs are collections of highly inter-dependent records that include biological, anatomical, physiological, and behavioral observations. They comprise a patient's clinical phenome, where each patient has thousands of date-stamped records distributed across many relational tables. Development of EHR computer-based phenotyping algorithms require time and medical insight from clinical experts, who most often can only review a small patient subset representative of the total EHR records, to identify phenotype features. In this research we evaluate whether relational machine learning (ML) using inductive logic programming (ILP) can contribute to addressing these issues as a viable approach for EHR-based phenotyping. Methods: Two relational learning ILP approaches and three well-known WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) implementations of non-relational approaches (PART, J48, and JRIP) were used to develop models for nine phenotypes. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) coded EHR data were used to select training cohorts for the development of each phenotypic model. Accuracy, precision, recall, F-Measure, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve statistics were measured for each phenotypic model based on independent manually verified test cohorts. A two-sided binomial distribution test (sign test) compared the five ML approaches across phenotypes for statistical significance. Results: We developed an approach to automatically label training examples using ICD-9 diagnosis codes for the ML approaches being evaluated. Nine phenotypic models for each ML approach were evaluated, resulting in better overall model performance in AUROC using ILP when compared to PART (p = 0.039), J48 (p = 0.003) and JRIP (p = 0.003). Discussion: ILP has the potential to improve phenotyping by independently delivering clinically expert interpretable rules for phenotype definitions, or intuitive phenotypes to assist experts. Conclusion: Relational learning using ILP offers a viable approach to EHR-driven phenotyping. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Belciug, S; Gorunescu, F				Belciug, Smaranda; Gorunescu, Florin			Error-correction learning for artificial neural networks using the Bayesian paradigm. Application to automated medical diagnosis	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Automated medical diagnosis; Bayesian-trained neural networks; Breast cancer; Lung cancer; Heart attack; Diabetes	BREAST-CANCER DETECTION; PREDICTION; ALGORITHM; ADMISSION; SYSTEM	Automated medical diagnosis models are now ubiquitous, and research for developing new ones is constantly growing. They play an important role in medical decision-making, helping physicians to provide a fast and accurate diagnosis. Due to their adaptive learning and nonlinear mapping properties, the artificial neural networks are widely used to support the human decision capabilities, avoiding variability in practice and errors based on lack of experience. Among the most common learning approaches, one can mention either the classical back-propagation algorithm based on the partial derivatives of the error function with respect to the weights, or the Bayesian learning method based on posterior probability distribution of weights, given training data. This paper proposes a novel training technique gathering together the error-correction learning, the posterior probability distribution of weights given the error function, and the Goodman-Kruskal Gamma rank correlation to assembly them in a Bayesian learning strategy. This study had two main purposes: firstly, to develop a novel learning technique based on both the Bayesian paradigm and the error back-propagation, and secondly, to assess its effectiveness. The proposed model performance is compared with those obtained by traditional machine learning algorithms using real-life breast and lung cancer, diabetes, and heart attack medical databases. Overall, the statistical comparison results indicate that the novel learning approach outperforms the conventional techniques in almost all respects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Text summarization reduces information as an attempt to enable users to find and understand relevant source texts more quickly and effortlessly. In recent years, substantial research has been conducted to develop and evaluate various summarization techniques in the biomedical domain. The goal of this study was to systematically review recent published research on summarization of textual documents in the biomedical domain. Materials and methods: MEDLINE (2000 to October 2013), IEEE Digital Library, and the ACM digital library were searched. Investigators independently screened and abstracted studies that examined text summarization techniques in the biomedical domain. Information is derived from selected articles on five dimensions: input, purpose, output, method and evaluation. Results: Of 10,786 studies retrieved, 34(0.3%) met the inclusion criteria. Natural language processing (17; 50%) and a hybrid technique comprising of statistical, Natural language processing and machine learning (15; 44%) were the most common summarization approaches. Most studies (28; 82%) conducted an intrinsic evaluation. Discussion: This is the first systematic review of text summarization in the biomedical domain. The study identified research gaps and provides recommendations for guiding future research on biomedical text summarization. Conclusion: Recent research has focused on a hybrid technique comprising statistical, language processing and machine learning techniques. Further research is needed on the application and evaluation of text summarization in real research or patient care settings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Previous bioinformatics studies have mainly focused on the classification of membrane proteins and ignored the important role of transmembrane proteins. In this study, we integrated the preceding order of amino acids into a machine learning approach based on a revamped N-gram model to predict transmembrane proteins using only protein sequence information. The framework consists of two steps: The N-gram model revamped for processing protein sequences was used as a feature extraction algorithm; then, we compared the performance of the popular classifiers logistic regression, Random Forests, support vector machine, and K-nearest neighbor using the N-gram model. N-gram combined with the Random Forests classifier obtained the highest accuracy at 95.6%, which is higher than other methods. The finding can help future studies on the structure and function of transmembrane proteins, drug design, and the classification of membrane proteins. In addition, a publicly accessible web server and software was established.

Tumour genomic and microenvironmental heterogeneity for integrated prediction of 5-year biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: a retrospective cohort study	LANCET ONCOLOGY			English	Article							FAILURE FOLLOWING RADIOTHERAPY; MULTIPLE CANCERS; HYPOXIA METAGENE; DNA-REPAIR; RISK; PROGRESSION; MORTALITY; RADIATION; THERAPY; DISEASE	Background Clinical prognostic groupings for localised prostate cancers are imprecise, with 30-50% of patients recurring after image-guided radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy. We aimed to test combined genomic and microenvironmental indices in prostate cancer to improve risk stratification and complement clinical prognostic factors. Methods We used DNA-based indices alone or in combination with intra-prostatic hypoxia measurements to develop four prognostic indices in 126 low-risk to intermediate-risk patients (Toronto cohort) who will receive image-guided radiotherapy. We validated these indices in two independent cohorts of 154 (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center cohort [MSKCC] cohort) and 117 (Cambridge cohort) radical prostatectomy specimens from low-risk to high-risk patients. We applied unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to the copy-number profiles of 126 pre-image-guided radiotherapy diagnostic biopsies to develop prognostic signatures. Our primary endpoint was the development of a set of prognostic measures capable of stratifying patients for risk of biochemical relapse 5 years after primary treatment. Findings Biochemical relapse was associated with indices of tumour hypoxia, genomic instability, and genomic subtypes based on multivariate analyses. We identified four genomic subtypes for prostate cancer, which had different 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival. Genomic instability is prognostic for relapse in both image-guided radiotherapy (multivariate analysis hazard ratio [HR] 4.5 [95% CI 2.1-9.8]; p=0.00013; area under the receiver operator curve [AUC] 0.70 [95% CI 0.65-0.76]) and radical prostatectomy (4.0 [1.6-9.7]; p=0.0024; AUC 0.57 [0.52-0.61]) patients with prostate cancer, and its effect is magnified by intratumoral hypoxia (3.8 [1.2-12]; p=0.019; AUC 0.67 [0.61-0.73]). A novel 100-loci DNA signature accurately classified treatment outcome in the MSKCC low-risk to intermediate-risk cohort (multivariate analysis HR 6.1 [95% CI 2.0-19]; p=0.0015; AUC 0.74 [95% CI 0.65-0.83]). In the independent MSKCC and Cambridge cohorts, this signature identified low-risk to high-risk patients who were most likely to fail treatment within 18 months (combined cohorts multivariate analysis HR 2.9 [95% CI 1.4-6.0]; p=0.0039; AUC 0.68 [95% CI 0.63-0.73]), and was better at predicting biochemical relapse than 23 previously published RNA signatures. Interpretation This is the first study of cancer outcome to integrate DNA-based and microenvironment-based failure indices to predict patient outcome. Patients exhibiting these aggressive features after biopsy should be entered into treatment intensification trials. Copyright (C) Lalonde et al.

Here, we present microTSS, a machine-learning algorithm that provides highly accurate, single-nucleotide resolution predictions for intergenic miRNA transcription start sites (TSSs). MicroTSS integrates high-resolution RNA-sequencing data with active transcription marks derived from chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNase-sequencing to enable the characterization of tissue-specific promoters. MicroTSS is validated with a specifically designed Drosha-null/conditional-null mouse model, generated using the conditional by inversion (COIN) methodology. Analyses of global run-on sequencing data revealed numerous pri-miRNAs in human and mouse either originating from divergent transcription at promoters of active genes or partially overlapping with annotated long non-coding RNAs. MicroTSS is readily applicable to any cell or tissue samples and constitutes the missing part towards integrating the regulation of miRNA transcription into the modelling of tissue-specific regulatory networks.

Deep Neural Networks Rival the Representation of Primate IT Cortex for Core Visual Object Recognition	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							INFERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; INFEROTEMPORAL CORTEX; HIERARCHICAL-MODELS; NEURONS; RESPONSES; MACAQUE; SYSTEM	The primate visual system achieves remarkable visual object recognition performance even in brief presentations, and under changes to object exemplar, geometric transformations, and background variation (a.k.a. core visual object recognition). This remarkable performance is mediated by the representation formed in inferior temporal (IT) cortex. In parallel, recent advances in machine learning have led to ever higher performing models of object recognition using artificial deep neural networks (DNNs). It remains unclear, however, whether the representational performance of DNNs rivals that of the brain. To accurately produce such a comparison, a major difficulty has been a unifying metric that accounts for experimental limitations, such as the amount of noise, the number of neural recording sites, and the number of trials, and computational limitations, such as the complexity of the decoding classifier and the number of classifier training examples. In this work, we perform a direct comparison that corrects for these experimental limitations and computational considerations. As part of our methodology, we propose an extension of "kernel analysis" that measures the generalization accuracy as a function of representational complexity. Our evaluations show that, unlike previous bio-inspired models, the latest DNNs rival the representational performance of IT cortex on this visual object recognition task. Furthermore, we show that models that perform well on measures of representational performance also perform well on measures of representational similarity to IT, and on measures of predicting individual IT multi-unit responses. Whether these DNNs rely on computational mechanisms similar to the primate visual system is yet to be determined, but, unlike all previous bio-inspired models, that possibility cannot be ruled out merely on representational performance grounds.

Historically, easily cultured facultative anaerobes such as fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, or enterococci have been used but these indicators generally provide no information as to their source. More recently, molecular methods have targeted fecal anaerobes, which are much more abundant in humans and other mammals, and some strains appear to be associated with particular host sources. Next-generation sequencing and microbiome studies have created an unprecedented inventory of microbial communities associated with fecal sources, allowing reexamination of which taxonomic groups are best suited as informative indicators. The use of new computational methods, such as oligotyping coupled with well-established machine learning approaches, is providing new insights into patterns of host association. In this review we examine the basis for host-specificity and the rationale for using 16S rRNA gene targets for alternative indicators and highlight two taxonomic groups, Bacteroidales and Lachnospiraceae, which are rich in host-specific bacterial organisms. Finally, we discuss considerations for using alternative indicators for water quality assessments with a particular focus on detecting human sewage sources of contamination.

We formulate a simple genetic algorithm by introducing the "genetic parameter vector" of the unitary transformations to be found. In the genetic algorithm process, all components of the genetic parameter vectors are supposed to evolve to the solution parameters of the unitary transformations. We apply our method to find the optimal unitary transformations and to generalize the corresponding quantum algorithms for a realistic problem, the one-bit oracle decision problem, or the often-called Deutsch problem. By numerical simulations, we can faithfully find the appropriate unitary transformations to solve the problem by using our method. We analyze the quantum algorithms identified by the found unitary transformations and generalize the variant models of the original Deutsch's algorithm.

Its dominant paradigms such as utility theory, prospect theory, and the modern dual-process theories all resort to formal algebraic models or non-mathematical postulates, and remain purely phenomenological. An approach introduced by Grossberg deployed differential equations describing neural networks and bridged the gap between decision science and the psychology of cognitive-emotional interactions. However, the limits within which neural models can explain data from real people's actions are virtually untested and remain unknown. Here we show that a model built around a recurrent gated dipole can successfully forecast individual economic choices in a complex laboratory experiment. Unlike classical statistical and econometric techniques or machine learning algorithms, our method calibrates the equations for each individual separately, and carries out prediction person-by-person. It predicted very well the behaviour of 15%-20% of the participants in the experiment - half of them extremely well - and was overall useful for two thirds of all 211 subjects. The model succeeded with people who were guided by gut feelings and failed with those who had sophisticated strategies. One hypothesis is that this neural network is the biological substrate of the cognitive system for primitive-intuitive thinking, and so we believe that we have a model of how people choose economic options by a simple form of intuition. We anticipate our study to be useful for further studies of human intuitive thinking as well as for analyses of economic systems populated by heterogeneous agents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we propose a new cascading model to investigate the basis for psychrophilicity. In this model, a superior classifier was used to discriminate psychrophilic from mesophilic protein sequences, and then the PART rule generating algorithm was applied on the input instances that are correctly classified by the classifier, to generate human interpretable rules. These derived rules were further validated on a structural dataset and finally analyzed to discover the underlying biological basis about the psychrophilicity. In this study, we have used one of the key features of psychrophilic proteins accountable for remaining functional in extreme cold temperature surroundings i.e., global patterns of amino acid composition as the input features. The rotation forest classifier outperformed all the other classifiers with maximum accuracy of 70.5% and maximum AUC of 0.78. The effect of sequence length on the classification accuracy was also investigated. The analysis of the derived rules and interpretation of the analyzed results had revealed some interesting phenomena such as the amino acids A,D, G, F, and S are over-represented, and T is under-represented in psychrophilic proteins. These findings augment the existing domain knowledge for psychrophilic sequence features. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Three-dimensional protein structure prediction: Methods and computational strategies	COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Review						Three-dimensional protein structure prediction; Structural bioinformatics; Ab initio methods; Knowledge-based methods	MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; UNRES FORCE-FIELD; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; POTENTIAL-ENERGY FUNCTIONS; AB-INITIO PREDICTION; SECONDARY STRUCTURE PREDICTION; HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; INTRINSICALLY UNSTRUCTURED PROTEINS; ACID SUBSTITUTION MATRICES; KNOWLEDGE-BASED POTENTIALS	A long standing problem in structural bioinformatics is to determine the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of a protein when only a sequence of amino acid residues is given. Many computational methodologies and algorithms have been proposed as a solution to the 3-D Protein Structure Prediction (3-D-PSP) problem. These methods can be divided in four main classes: (a) first principle methods without database information; (b) first principle methods with database information; (c) fold recognition and threading methods; and (d) comparative modeling methods and sequence alignment strategies. Deterministic computational techniques, optimization techniques, data mining and machine learning approaches are typically used in the construction of computational solutions for the PSP problem. Our main goal with this work is to review the methods and computational strategies that are currently used in 3-D protein prediction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Pan, XY; Zhu, L; Fan, YX; Yan, JC				Pan, Xiaoyong; Zhu, Lin; Fan, Yong-Xian; Yan, Junchi			Predicting protein-RNA interaction amino acids using random forest based on submodularity subset selection	COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Protein-RNA interaction site; Sample imbalance; Evolution information; Submodularity subset selection; Random forest	BINDING-SITES; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; TARGET RECOGNITION; SEQUENCE; FEATURES; INFORMATION; CLIP; SPECIFICITIES; PROPENSITY; DATABASE	Protein-RNA interaction plays a very crucial role in many biological processes, such as protein synthesis, transcription and post-transcription of gene expression and pathogenesis of disease. Especially RNAs always function through binding to proteins. Identification of binding interface region is especially useful for cellular pathways analysis and drug design. In this study, we proposed a novel approach for binding sites identification in proteins, which not only integrates local features and global features from protein sequence directly, but also constructed a balanced training dataset using sub-sampling based on submodularity subset selection. Firstly we extracted local features and global features from protein sequence, such as evolution information and molecule weight. Secondly, the number of non-interaction sites is much more than interaction sites, which leads to a sample imbalance problem, and hence biased machine learning model with preference to non-interaction sites. To better resolve this problem, instead of previous randomly sub-sampling over-represented non-interaction sites, a novel sampling approach based on submodularity subset selection was employed, which can select more representative data subset. Finally random forest were trained on optimally selected training subsets to predict interaction sites. Our result showed that our proposed method is very promising for predicting protein-RNA interaction residues, it achieved an accuracy of 0.863, which is better than other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, it also indicated the extracted global features have very strong discriminate ability for identifying interaction residues from random forest feature importance analysis.

Validation of a multigenic model to predict seizure control in newly treated epilepsy	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Epilepsy; Antiepileptic drug; Treatment outcome; Genetic association; Machine-learning; k-Nearest neighbour	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; DRUG; PHARMACOGENOMICS; POLYMORPHISM; ASSOCIATION; ABCB1; GENE; LAMOTRIGINE; TOPIRAMATE; STRATEGIES	A multigenic classifier based on five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was previously reported to predict treatment response in an Australian newly-diagnosed epilepsy cohort using a k-nearest neighbour (kNN) algorithm. We assessed the validity of this classifier in predicting response to initial antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment in two UK cohorts of newly-diagnosed epilepsy and investigated the utility of these five SNPs in predicting seizure control in general. The original Australian cohort constituted the training set for the classifier and was used to predict response to the first well-tolerated AED monotherapy in independently recruited UK cohorts (Glasgow, n=281; SANAD, n=491). A "leave-one-out" cross-validation was also employed, with training sets derived internally from the UK datasets. The multigenic classifier using the Australian cohort as the training set was unable to predict treatment response in either UK cohort. In the "leave-one-out" analysis, the five SNPs collectively predicted treatment response in both Glasgow and SANAD patients prescribed either carbamazepine or valproate (Glasgow OR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.4-6.6, p=0018; SANAD OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.3-6.1, p=0.048), but not those receiving lamotrigine (Glasgow OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 0.6-2.8, p=1.0; SANAD OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 0.9-5.4, p=0.36) or other AEDs (Glasgow OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.2-2.0, p=1.0; SANAD OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 0.9-4.2, p=0.36). The Australian-based multigenic kNN model is not predictive of initial treatment response in UK cohorts of newly-diagnosed epilepsy. However, the five SNPs identified in the original Australian study appear to collectively have a predictive influence in UK patients prescribed either carbamazepine or valproate.

It is however problematic, because the vectorized program may actually be slower than the original one. Therefore, it would be useful to predict beforehand whether or not vectorization will actually produce any speedup. This paper proposes to do so by expressing vectorization profitability as a classification problem, and by predicting it using a machine learning technique called support vector machine (SVM). It considers three compilers (icc, gcc and llvm), and a benchmark suite made of 151 loops, unrolled with factors ranging from 1 to 20. The paper further proposes a technique that combines the results of two SVMs to reach 99% of accuracy for all three compilers. Moreover, by correctly predicting unprofitable vectorizations, the technique presented in this paper provides speedups of up to 2.16 times, 2.47 times and 3.83 times for icc, gcc and LLVM, respectively (9%, 18% and 56% on average). It also lowers to less than 1% the probability of the compiler generating a slower program with vectorization turned on (from more than 25% for the compilers alone).

Optimal set of EEG features for emotional state classification and trajectory visualization in Parkinson's disease	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Emotion classification; Feature reduction; Manifold learning; Parkinson's disease	FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; RECOGNITION; SPEECH; MUSIC; STIMULI; VALENCE; SOUND	In addition to classic motor signs and symptoms, individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized by emotional deficits. Ongoing brain activity can be recorded by electroencephalograph (EEG) to discover the links between emotional states and brain activity. This study utilized machine-learning algorithms to categorize emotional states in PD patients compared with healthy controls (HC) using EEG. Twenty non-demented PD patients and 20 healthy age-, gender-, and education level-matched controls viewed happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust emotional stimuli while fourteen-channel EEG was being recorded. Multimodal stimulus (combination of audio and visual) was used to evoke the emotions. To classify the EEG-based emotional states and visualize the changes of emotional states overtime, this paper compares four kinds of EEG features for emotional state classification and proposes an approach to track the trajectory of emotion changes with manifold learning. From the experimental results using our EEG data set, we found that (a) bispectrum feature is superior to other three kinds of features, namely power spectrum, wavelet packet and nonlinear dynamical analysis; (b) higher frequency bands (alpha, beta and gamma) play a more important role in emotion activities than lower frequency bands (delta and theta) in both groups and; (c) the trajectory of emotion changes can be visualized by reducing subject-independent features with manifold learning. This provides a promising way of implementing visualization of patient's emotional state in real time and leads to a practical system for noninvasive assessment of the emotional impairments associated with neurological disorders.

Input dataset includes 3D post-stacked seismic attributes and six well logs acquired from a hydrocarbon field located in the western coast of India. Presence of thin sand and shale layers in the basin area makes the modeling of reservoir characteristic a challenging task. Though seismic data is helpful in extrapolation of reservoir properties away from boreholes; yet, it could be challenging to delineate thin sand and shale reservoirs using seismic data due to its limited resolvability. Therefore, it is important to develop state-of-art intelligent methods for calibrating a nonlinear mapping between seismic data and target reservoir variables. Neural networks have shown its potential to model such nonlinear mappings; however, uncertainties associated with the model and datasets are still a concern. Hence, introduction of Fuzzy Logic (FL) is beneficial for handling these uncertainties. More specifically, hybrid variants of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and fuzzy logic, i.e., NF methods, are capable for the modeling reservoir characteristics by integrating the explicit knowledge representation power of FL with the learning ability of neural networks. In this paper, we opt for ANN and three different categories of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) based on clustering of the available datasets. A comparative analysis of these three different NF models (i.e., Sugeno-type fuzzy inference systems using a grid partition on the data (Model 1), using subtractive clustering (Model 2), and using Fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering (Model 3)) and ANN suggests that Model 3 has outperformed its counterparts in terms of performance evaluators on the present dataset. Performance of the selected algorithms is evaluated in terms of correlation coefficients (CC), root mean square error (RMSE), absolute error mean (AEM) and scatter index (SI) between target and predicted sand fraction values. The achieved estimation accuracy may diverge minutely depending on geological characteristics of a particular study area. The documented results in this study demonstrate acceptable resemblance between target and predicted variables, and hence, encourage the application of integrated machine learning approaches such as Neuro-Fuzzy in reservoir characterization domain. Furthermore, visualization of the variation of sand probability in the study area would assist in identifying placement of potential wells for future drilling operations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Chiang, JH; Ju, JH				Chiang, Jung-Hsien; Ju, Jiun-Huang			Discovering novel protein-protein interactions by measuring the protein semantic similarity from the biomedical literature	JOURNAL OF BIOINFORMATICS AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Classification; machine learning; protein-protein interaction; text mining	INTERACTION EXTRACTION; DATABASE; INFORMATION; DISTANCE	Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are involved in the majority of biological processes. Identification of PPIs is therefore one of the key aims of biological research. Although there are many databases of PPIs, many other unidentified PPIs could be buried in the biomedical literature. Therefore, automated identification of PPIs from biomedical literature repositories could be used to discover otherwise hidden interactions. Search engines, such as Google, have been successfully applied to measure the relatedness among words. Inspired by such approaches, we propose a novel method to identify PPIs through semantic similarity measures among protein mentions. We define six semantic similarity measures as features based on the page counts retrieved from the MEDLINE database. A machine learning classifier, Random Forest, is trained using the above features. The proposed approach achieve an averaged micro-F of 71.28% and an averaged macro-F of 64.03% over five PPI corpora, an improvement over the results of using only the conventional co-occurrence feature (averaged micro-F of 68.79% and an averaged macro-F of 60.49%). A relation-word reinforcement further improves the averaged micro-F to 71.3% and averaged macro-F to 65.12%. Comparing the results of the current work with other studies on the AIMed corpus (ranging from 77.58% to 85.1% in micro-F, 62.18% to 76.27% in macro-F), we show that the proposed approach achieves micro-F of 81.88% and macro-F of 64.01% without the use of sophisticated feature extraction. Finally, we manually examine the newly discovered PPI pairs based on a literature review, and the results suggest that our approach could extract novel protein-protein interactions.

This challenge gave rise to many efforts, e.g., combing multiple tumor markers and employing machine learning algorithms. However, results from different studies are often inconsistent, which are partially attributed to the use of different evaluation criteria. Also, the wide use of model-dependent validation leads to high possibility of data overfitting when complex models are used for diagnosis. We propose two model-independent criteria, namely, area under the curve (AUC) and Relief to evaluate the diagnostic values of individual and multiple tumor markers, respectively. For diagnostic decision support, we propose the use of logistic-tree which combines decision tree and logistic regression. Application on a colorectal cancer dataset shows that the proposed evaluation criteria produce results that are consistent with current knowledge. Furthermore, the simple and highly interpretable logistic-tree has diagnostic performance that is competitive with other complex models.

The benefits and drawbacks of the different methodologies are discussed, and illustrated by an experimental validation on a test bench containing wet-clutches. In general, all strategies yield a good engagement quality once they converge. The model-based strategies seems most suited for an online application, because they are inherently more robust and require a shorter convergence time. The model-free strategies meanwhile seem most suited to offline calibration procedures for complex systems where heuristic tuning rules no longer suffice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rapidly collecting/pooling data can accelerate 'translational research in radiation therapy and oncology. The exchange of study data is one of the fundamental principles behind data aggregation and data mining. The possibilities of reproducing the original study results, performing further analyses on existing research data to generate new hypotheses or developing computational models to support medical decisions (e.g. risk/benefit analysis of treatment options) represent just a fraction of the potential benefits of medical data-pooling. Distributed machine learning and knowledge exchange from federated databases can be considered as one beyond other attractive approaches for knowledge generation within "Big Data". Data interoperability between research institutions should be the major concern behind a wider collaboration. Information captured in electronic patient records (EPRs) and study case report forms (eCRFs), linked together with medical imaging and treatment planning data, are deemed to be fundamental elements for large multi-centre studies in the field of radiation therapy and oncology. To fully utilise the captured medical information, the study data have to be more than just an electronic version of a traditional (un-modifiable) paper CRF. Challenges that have to be addressed are data interoperability, utilisation of standards, data quality and privacy concerns, data ownership, rights to publish, data pooling architecture and storage. This paper discusses a framework for conceptual packages of ideas focused on a strategic development for international research data exchange in the field of radiation therapy and oncology.

Automatic and Portable Mapping of Data Parallel Programs to OpenCL for GPU-Based Heterogeneous Systems	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						Experimentation; Languages; Measurement; Performance; GPU; OpenCL; Machine-learning mapping	OPTIMIZATION; FRAMEWORK; COMPILER; GPGPU	General-purpose GPU-based systems are highly attractive, as they give potentially massive performance at little cost. Realizing such potential is challenging due to the complexity of programming. This article presents a compiler-based approach to automatically generate optimized OpenCL code from data parallel OpenMP programs for GPUs. A key feature of our scheme is that it leverages existing transformations, especially data transformations, to improve performance on GPU architectures and uses automatic machine learning to build a predictive model to determine if it is worthwhile running the OpenCL code on the GPU or OpenMP code on themulticore host. We applied our approach to the entire NAS parallel benchmark suite and evaluated it on distinct GPU-based systems. We achieved average (up to) speedups of 4.51x and 4.20x (143x and 67x) on Core i7/NVIDIA GeForce GTX580 and Core i7/AMD Radeon 7970 platforms, respectively, over a sequential baseline. Our approach achieves, on average, greater than 10x speedups over two state-of-the-art automatic GPU code generators.

This problem has increased the demand for effective maintenance and renewal planning. In order to implement an appropriate management procedure for a structure, a wide array of corrective strategies must be evaluated with respect to not only the condition state of each defect but also safety, economy and sustainability. This paper describes a new performance evaluation system for existing concrete bridges. The system evaluates performance based on load carrying capability and durability from the results of a visual inspection and specification data, and describes the necessity of maintenance. It categorizes all girders and slabs as either unsafe, severe deterioration, moderate deterioration, mild deterioration, or safe. The technique employs an expert system with an appropriate knowledge base in the evaluation. A characteristic feature of the system is the use of neural networks to evaluate the performance and facilitate refinement of the knowledge base. The neural network proposed in the present study has the capability to prevent an inference process and knowledge base from becoming a black box. It is very important that the system is capable of detailing how the performance is calculated since the road network represents a huge investment. The effectiveness of the neural network and machine learning method is verified by comparing diagnostic results by bridge experts.

J	Schneider, B; Pea, R				Schneider, Bertrand; Pea, Roy			Toward collaboration sensing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-SUPPORTED COLLABORATIVE LEARNING			English	Article						Collaborative learning; Dual eye-tracking; Network analysis	PERCEPTION; QUALITY	We describe preliminary applications of network analysis techniques to eye-tracking data collected during a collaborative learning activity. This paper makes three contributions: first, we visualize collaborative eye-tracking data as networks, where the nodes of the graph represent fixations and edges represent saccades. We found that those representations can serve as starting points for formulating research questions and hypotheses about collaborative processes. Second, network metrics can be computed to interpret the properties of the graph and find proxies for the quality of students' collaboration. We found that different characteristics of our graphs correlated with different aspects of students' collaboration (for instance, the extent to which students reached consensus was associated with the average size of the strongly connected components of the graphs). Third, we used those characteristics to predict the quality of students' collaboration by feeding those features into a machine-learning algorithm. We found that among the eight dimensions of collaboration that we considered, we were able to roughly predict (using a median-split) students' quality of collaboration with an accuracy between similar to 85 and 100 %. We conclude by discussing implications for developing "collaboration-sensing" tools, and comment on implementing this approach for formal learning environments.

Logistic regression (LR) is a well-known classification method that has been used widely in many applications of data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. However, its performance is affected by the multi-co-linearity among its predictors, and the features' redundancy. l1-regularizion and features extraction methods are commonly used to enhance the performance of logistic regression under multi-co-linearity and ovefitting problems, and to reduce computational complexity by discarding less relevant or redundant features. These methods include principal component analysis, kernel principal component analysis and independent component analysis. Recently, l1-regularized logistic regression has received much attention as a promising method for features selection in classification tasks. So there is a great need to be compared with these existing methods. In this paper, we assess the performance of the aforementioned feature selection methods on LR and l1-regularized logistic regression using different statistical measures. A variety of performance metrics has been utilized: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve and the receiver operating characteristic analysis. This study is distinct by its inclusion of a comprehensive statistical analysis.

On the other hand, due to the data size requirement, training and publishing overhead, the bottleneck of minute-level incremental model updates has emerged. We propose a novel real-time click through rate (CTR) prediction model based on empirical CTRs with a set of pre-learned priors, upon which a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator is constructed as the CTR prediction. The dimensions of the empirical CTRs are in the sparsest and finest ID levels, which can be strong indicators but are generally unsuited as machine learning features. Experiments on real-life click data show that our prior-based real-time estimator, combined with traditional machine learning model, gains significant improvement in both prediction accuracy and ranking capability, especially with latest data beyond the time-effectiveness of the machine learning model.

Crevasse Detection in Ice Sheets Using Ground Penetrating Radar and Machine Learning	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Geophysical signal processing; ground penetrating radar (GPR); robotic sensing systems	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; LANDMINE DETECTION; SPEECH RECOGNITION; GPR; IMAGES	This paper presents methods to automatically classify ground penetrating radar (GPR) images of crevasses on ice sheets. We use a combination of support vector machines (SVMs) and hidden Markov models (HMMs) with down sampling, a preprocessing step that is unbiased and suitable for real-time analysis and detection. We perform modified cross-validation experiments with 129 examples of Greenland GPR imagery from 2012, collected by a lightweight robot towing a GPR. In order to minimize false positives, an HMM classifier is trained to prescreen the data and mark locations in the GPR files to evaluate with an SVM, and we evaluate the classification results with a similar modified cross-validation technique. The combined HMM-SVM method retains all of the correct classifications by the SVM, and reduces the false positive rate to 0.0007. This method also reduces the computational burden in classifying GPR traces because the SVM is evaluated only on select prescreened traces. Our experiments demonstrate the promise, robustness, and reliability of real-time crevasse detection and classification with robotic GPR surveys.

Until recently, this progress has been fueled mostly by advances in machine learning; however, more and more researchers are realizing the importance of studying users of these systems. In this article we promote this approach and demonstrate how it can result in better user experiences and more effective learning systems. We present a number of case studies that demonstrate how interactivity results in a tight coupling between the system and the user, exemplify ways in which some existing systems fail to account for the user, and explore new ways for learning systems to interact with their users. After giving a glimpse of the progress that has been made thus far, we discuss some of the challenges we face in moving the field forward.

Severity Classification of a Seismic Event based on the Magnitude-Distance Ratio Using Only One Seismological Station	EARTH SCIENCES RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article						Machine learning; seismology; single station; magnitude; distance	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; GENETIC ALGORITHM; TELESEISMIC EVENTS; PHASE PICKING; DISCRIMINATION; RECOGNITION; EARTHQUAKES; INVERSION; SIGNAL; IDENTIFICATION	Seismic event characterization is often accomplished using algorithms based only on information received at seismological stations located closest to the particular event, while ignoring historical data received at those stations. These historical data are stored and unseen at this stage. This characterization process can delay the emergency response, costing valuable time in the mitigation of the adverse effects on the affected population. Seismological stations have recorded data during many events that have been characterized by classical methods, and these data can be used as previous "knowledge" to train such stations to recognize patterns. This knowledge can be used to make faster characterizations using only one three-component broadband station by applying bio-inspired algorithms or recently developed stochastic methods, such as kernel methods. We trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm with seismograph data recorded by INGEOMINAS's National Seismological Network at a three-component station located near Bogota, Colombia. As input model descriptors, we used the following: (1) the integral of the Fourier transform/power spectrum for each component, divided into 7 windows of 2 seconds and beginning at the P onset time, and (2) the ratio between the calculated logarithm of magnitude (Mb) and epicentral distance. We used 986 events with magnitudes greater than 3 recorded from late 2003 to 2008. The algorithm classifies events with magnitude-distance ratios (a measure of the severity of possible damage caused by an earthquake) greater than a background value. This value can be used to estimate the magnitude based on a known epicentral distance, which is calculated from the difference between P and S onset times. This rapid (<20 seconds) magnitude estimate can be used for rapid response strategies. The results obtained in this work confirm that many hypocentral parameters and a rapid location of a seismic event can be obtained using a few seconds of signal registered at a single station. A cascade scheme of SVMs or other appropriate algorithms can be used to completely classify an event in a very short time with acceptable accuracy using data from only one station.									27	0	0	UNIV NACIONAL DE COLOMBIA	BOGOTA	EDIFICIO MANUAL ANCIZAR AA, BOGOTA, 14490, COLOMBIA	1794-6190			EARTH SCI RES J	Earth Sci.

Recently, Edge-over-Erosion error (EoE-error), which originates from overpolishing and could cause yield loss, is observed in various CMP processes, while its mechanism is still unclear. To predict these errors, we propose an EoE-error prediction method that exploits machine learning algorithms. The proposed method consists of (1) error analysis stage, (2) layout parameter extraction stage, (3) model construction stage and (4) prediction stage. In the error analysis and parameter extraction stages, we analyze test chips and identify layout parameters which have an impact on EoE phenomenon. In the model construction stage, we construct a prediction model using the proposed multi-level machine learning method, and do predictions for designed layouts in the prediction stage. Experimental results show that the proposed method attained 2.7 similar to 19.2% accuracy improvement of EoE-error prediction and 0.8 similar to 10.1% improvement of non-EoE-error prediction compared with general machine learning methods. The proposed method makes it possible to prevent unexpected yield loss by recognizing EoE-errors before manufacturing.

However, advanced forgery and spoofing techniques are threatening the reliability of conventional biometric modalities. This has been motivating our investigation of a novel yet promising modality transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE), which is an acoustic response generated from cochlea after a click stimulus. Unlike conventional modalities that are easily accessible or captured, TEOAE is naturally immune to replay and falsification attacks as a physiological outcome from human auditory system. In this paper, we resort to wavelet analysis to derive the time-frequency representation of such nonstationary signal, which reveals individual uniqueness and long-term reproducibility. A machine learning technique linear discriminant analysis is subsequently utilized to reduce intrasubject variability and further capture intersubject differentiation features. Considering practical application, we also introduce a complete framework of the biometric system in both verification and identification modes. Comparative experiments on a TEOAE data set of biometric setting show the merits of the proposed method. Performance is further improved with fusion of information from both ears.

Identifying Autism from Neural Representations of Social Interactions: Neurocognitive Markers of Autism	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HUMAN BRAIN ACTIVITY; PERSPECTIVE-TAKING; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; CLASSIFICATION; SPECTRUM; SELF; INDIVIDUALS; DEACTIVATE; DISORDERS; AGENCY	Autism is a psychiatric/neurological condition in which alterations in social interaction (among other symptoms) are diagnosed by behavioral psychiatric methods. The main goal of this study was to determine how the neural representations and meanings of social concepts (such as to insult) are altered in autism. A second goal was to determine whether these alterations can serve as neurocognitive markers of autism. The approach is based on previous advances in fMRI analysis methods that permit (a) the identification of a concept, such as the thought of a physical object, from its fMRI pattern, and (b) the ability to assess the semantic content of a concept from its fMRI pattern. These factor analysis and machine learning methods were applied to the fMRI activation patterns of 17 adults with high-functioning autism and matched controls, scanned while thinking about 16 social interactions. One prominent neural representation factor that emerged (manifested mainly in posterior midline regions) was related to self-representation, but this factor was present only for the control participants, and was near-absent in the autism group. Moreover, machine learning algorithms classified individuals as autistic or control with 97% accuracy from their fMRI neurocognitive markers. The findings suggest that psychiatric alterations of thought can begin to be biologically understood by assessing the form and content of the altered thought's underlying brain activation patterns.

Most of the state-of-the-art approaches base on de Bruijn graph strategy and overlap-layout strategy. However, these approaches which depend on k-mers or read overlaps do not fully utilize information of paired-end and single-end reads when resolving branches. Since they treat all single-end reads with overlapped length larger than a fix threshold equally, they fail to use the more confident long overlapped reads for assembling and mix up with the relative short overlapped reads. Moreover, these approaches have not been special designed for handling tandem repeats (repeats occur adjacently in the genome) and they usually break down the contigs near the tandem repeats. We present PERGA (Paired-End Reads Guided Assembler), a novel sequence-reads-guided de novo assembly approach, which adopts greedy-like prediction strategy for assembling reads to contigs and scaffolds using paired-end reads and different read overlap size ranging from O-max to O-min to resolve the gaps and branches. By constructing a decision model using machine learning approach based on branch features, PERGA can determine the correct extension in 99.7% of cases. When the correct extension cannot be determined, PERGA will try to extend the contig by all feasible extensions and determine the correct extension by using look-ahead approach. Many difficult-resolved branches are due to tandem repeats which are close in the genome. PERGA detects such different copies of the repeats to resolve the branches to make the extension much longer and more accurate. We evaluated PERGA on both Illumina real and simulated datasets ranging from small bacterial genomes to large human chromosome, and it constructed longer and more accurate contigs and scaffolds than other state-of-the-art assemblers.

Novel classification methods with high efficiency and prediction accuracy are still needed to deal with high dimensionality and small sample size of typical GEP data. Recently the sparse representation (SR) method has been successfully applied to the cancer classification. Nevertheless, its efficiency needs to be improved when analyzing large-scale GEP data. Results: In this paper we present the meta-sample-based regularized robust coding classification (MRRCC), a novel effective cancer classification technique that combines the idea of meta-sample-based cluster method with regularized robust coding (RRC) method. It assumes that the coding residual and the coding coefficient are respectively independent and identically distributed. Similar to meta-sample-based SR classification (MSRC), MRRCC extracts a set of meta-samples from the training samples, and then encodes a testing sample as the sparse linear combination of these meta-samples. The representation fidelity is measured by the l(2)-norm or l(1)-norm of the coding residual. Conclusions: Extensive experiments on publicly available GEP datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is more efficient while its prediction accuracy is equivalent to existing MSRC-based methods and better than other state-of-the-art dimension reduction based methods.

In the cognitive neurosciences, mind wandering has been associated with several distinct neural processes, most notably increased activity in the default mode network (DMN), suppressed activity within the anti-correlated (task-positive) network (ACN), and changes in neuromodulation. By using an integrative multimodal approach combining machine-learning techniques with modeling of latent cognitive processes, we show that mind wandering in humans is characterized by inefficiencies in executive control (task-monitoring) processes. This failure is predicted by a single-trial signature of (co) activations in the DMN, ACN, and neuromodulation, and accompanied by a decreased rate of evidence accumulation and response thresholds in the cognitive model.

J	Li, XJ; Lv, JC; Li, LL				Li, Xiaojie; Lv, Jian Cheng; Li, Lili			Online clustering via energy scoring based on low-rank and sparse representation	ELECTRONICS LETTERS			English	Article								Subspace clustering is very useful in many fields, such as computer vision and machine learning. However, most of the clustering methods cannot deal with out-of-sample data directly. For each new sample, these methods need to relearn the representations of all (new and original) data for clustering. This is unrealistic in many practical applications. A new online clustering method to cluster out-of-sample data in terms of the meaningful energy scores of data is proposed. By interpreting low-rank representation (LRR) as a dynamical system, a computation method for energy scores of data has been developed. The scores can be calculated by integration, independent of the LRR learning procedure. Then, a linear classifier is used to cluster out-of-sample data using their energy scores.

We investigated how classifying behavioral states of grazing livestock using global positioning data alone depends on the classification approach, the preselection of training data, and the number and type of movement metrics. Positions of grazing cows were collected at intervals of 20 seconds in six upland areas in Switzerland along with visual observations of animal behavior for comparison. A total of 87 linear and cumulative distance metrics and 15 turning angle metrics across multiple time steps were used to classify position data into the behavioral states of walking, grazing, and resting. Five random forest classification models, a linear discriminant analysis, a support vector machine, and a state-space model were evaluated. The most accurate classification of the observed behavioral states in an independent validation dataset was 83%, obtained using random forest with all available movement metrics. However, the state-specific accuracy was highly unequal (walking: 36%, grazing: 95%, resting: 58%). Random undersampling led to a prediction accuracy of 77%, with more balanced state-specific accuracies (walking: 68%, grazing: 82%, resting: 68%). The other evaluated machine-learning approaches had lower classification accuracies. The state-space model, based on distance to the preceding position and turning angle, produced a relatively low accuracy of 64%, slightly lower than a random forest model with the same predictor variables. Given the successful classification of behavioral states, our study promotes the more frequent use of global positioning data alone for animal behavior studies under the condition that data is collected at high frequency and complemented by context-specific behavioral observations. Machine-learning algorithms, notably random forest, were found very useful for classification and easy to implement. Moreover, the use of measures across multiple time steps is clearly necessary for a satisfactory classification.

Latent Low Rank Representation (LatLRR) is one of the state-of-the-art methods for subspace clustering. However, its effectiveness is undermined by a recent discovery that the solution to the noiseless LatLRR model is non-unique. To remedy this issue, we propose choosing the sparest solution in the solution set. When there is noise, we further propose preprocessing the data with robust PCA. Experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the advantage of our robust LatLRR over state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pathway activity inference for multiclass disease classification through a mathematical programming optimisation framework	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Disease classification; Microarray; Pathway activity; Mathematical programming; Optimisation	BREAST-CANCER METASTASIS; SET ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS; EXPRESSION PROFILES; PROSTATE-CANCER; MICROARRAY DATA; BIOMARKER IDENTIFICATION; TUMOR CLASSIFICATION; INTEGER OPTIMIZATION; FEATURE-SELECTION; GENE	Background: Applying machine learning methods on microarray gene expression profiles for disease classification problems is a popular method to derive biomarkers, i.e. sets of genes that can predict disease state or outcome. Traditional approaches where expression of genes were treated independently suffer from low prediction accuracy and difficulty of biological interpretation. Current research efforts focus on integrating information on protein interactions through biochemical pathway datasets with expression profiles to propose pathway-based classifiers that can enhance disease diagnosis and prognosis. As most of the pathway activity inference methods in literature are either unsupervised or applied on two-class datasets, there is good scope to address such limitations by proposing novel methodologies. Results: A supervised multiclass pathway activity inference method using optimisation techniques is reported. For each pathway expression dataset, patterns of its constituent genes are summarised into one composite feature, termed pathway activity, and a novel mathematical programming model is proposed to infer this feature as a weighted linear summation of expression of its constituent genes. Gene weights are determined by the optimisation model, in a way that the resulting pathway activity has the optimal discriminative power with regards to disease phenotypes. Classification is then performed on the resulting low-dimensional pathway activity profile. Conclusions: The model was evaluated through a variety of published gene expression profiles that cover different types of disease. We show that not only does it improve classification accuracy, but it can also perform well in multiclass disease datasets, a limitation of other approaches from the literature. Desirable features of the model include the ability to control the maximum number of genes that may participate in determining pathway activity, which may be pre-specified by the user. Overall, this work highlights the potential of building pathway-based multi-phenotype classifiers for accurate disease diagnosis and prognosis problems.

Such categories of objects do not necessarily form disjunct sets of objects, neither semantically nor visually. The relationship between categories can often be described in terms of a hierarchical structure. For instance, tigers and leopards build two separate mammalian categories, both of which are subcategories of the category Felidae. In the last decades, the unsupervised learning of categories of visual input stimuli has been addressed by numerous approaches in machine learning as well as in computational neuroscience. However, the question of what kind of mechanisms might be involved in the process of subcategory learning, or category refinement, remains a topic of active investigation. We propose a recurrent computational network architecture for the unsupervised learning of categorial and subcategorial visual input representations. During learning, the connection strengths of bottom-up weights from input to higher-level category representations are adapted according to the input activity distribution. In a similar manner, top-down weights learn to encode the characteristics of a specific stimulus category. Feedforward and feedback learning in combination realize an associative memory mechanism, enabling the selective top-down propagation of a category's feedback weight distribution. We suggest that the difference between the expected input encoded in the projective field of a category node and the current input pattern controls the amplification of feedforward-driven representations. Large enough differences trigger the recruitment of new representational resources and the establishment of additional (sub-) category representations. We demonstrate the temporal evolution of such learning and show how the proposed combination of an associative memory with a modulatory feedback integration successfully establishes category and subcategory representations.

To improve reproducibility, much emphasis has been placed on the preparation of samples, but less attention has been given to reporting and standardizing the quantification of foci. The current standard to quantitate foci in open-source software is to manually determine a range of parameters based on the outcome of one or a few representative images and then apply the parameter combination to the analysis of a larger dataset. Here, we demonstrate the power and utility of using machine learning to train a new algorithm (FindFoci) to determine optimal parameters. FindFoci closely matches human assignments and allows rapid automated exploration of parameter space. Thus, individuals can train the algorithm to mirror their own assignments and then automate focus counting using the same parameters across a large number of images. Using the training algorithm to match human assignments of foci, we demonstrate that applying an optimal parameter combination from a single image is not broadly applicable to analysis of other images scored by the same experimenter or by other experimenters. Our analysis thus reveals wide variation in human assignment of foci and their quantification. To overcome this, we developed training on multiple images, which reduces the inconsistency of using a single or a few images to set parameters for focus detection. FindFoci is provided as an open-source plugin for ImageJ.

Protein inter-domain linker prediction using Random Forest and amino acid physiochemical properties	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							RELATIVE SOLVENT ACCESSIBILITY; SECONDARY STRUCTURE PREDICTION; RECURSIVE NEURAL-NETWORKS; BOUNDARY PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; SEQUENCES; DATABASE; REGIONS; PROTEOMICS; PROFILES	Background: Protein chains are generally long and consist of multiple domains. Domains are distinct structural units of a protein that can evolve and function independently. The accurate prediction of protein domain linkers and boundaries is often regarded as the initial step of protein tertiary structure and function predictions. Such information not only enhances protein-targeted drug development but also reduces the experimental cost of protein analysis by allowing researchers to work on a set of smaller and independent units. In this study, we propose a novel and accurate domain-linker prediction approach based on protein primary structure information only. We utilize a nature-inspired machine-learning model called Random Forest along with a novel domain-linker profile that contains physiochemical and domain-linker information of amino acid sequences. Results: The proposed approach was tested on two well-known benchmark protein datasets and achieved 68% sensitivity and 99% precision, which is better than any existing protein domain-linker predictor. Without applying any data balancing technique such as class weighting and data re-sampling, the proposed approach is able to accurately classify inter-domain linkers from highly imbalanced datasets. Conclusion: Our experimental results prove that the proposed approach is useful for domain-linker identification in highly imbalanced single-and multi-domain proteins.

Therefore, early, pre-clinical prediction of nephrotoxicity could help to prioritize drug candidates for further evaluations, and increase the success rates of clinical trials. Recently, an in vitro model for predicting renal-proximal-tubular-cell (PTC) toxicity based on the expression levels of two inflammatory markers, interleukin (IL)-6 and -8, has been described. However, this and other existing models usually use linear and manually determined thresholds to predict nephrotoxicity. Automated machine learning algorithms may improve these models, and produce more accurate and unbiased predictions. Results: Here, we report a systematic comparison of the performances of four supervised classifiers, namely random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest-neighbor and naive Bayes classifiers, in predicting PTC toxicity based on IL-6 and -8 expression levels. Using a dataset of human primary PTCs treated with 41 well-characterized compounds that are toxic or not toxic to PTC, we found that random forest classifiers have the highest cross-validated classification performance (mean balanced accuracy = 87.8%, sensitivity = 89.4%, and specificity = 85.9%). Furthermore, we also found that IL-8 is more predictive than IL-6, but a combination of both markers gives higher classification accuracy. Finally, we also show that random forest classifiers trained automatically on the whole dataset have higher mean balanced accuracy than a previous threshold-based classifier constructed for the same dataset (99.3% vs. 80.7%). Conclusions: Our results suggest that a random forest classifier can be used to automatically predict drug-induced PTC toxicity based on the expression levels of IL-6 and -8.

J	Wu, QY; Ye, YM; Ho, SS; Zhou, SG				Wu, Qingyao; Ye, Yunming; Ho, Shen-Shyang; Zhou, Shuigeng			Semi-supervised multi-label collective classification ensemble for functional genomics	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article							PROTEIN-INTERACTION NETWORKS; PREDICTING GENE-FUNCTION; ONTOLOGY	Background: With the rapid accumulation of proteomic and genomic datasets in terms of genome-scale features and interaction networks through high-throughput experimental techniques, the process of manual predicting functional properties of the proteins has become increasingly cumbersome, and computational methods to automate this annotation task are urgently needed. Most of the approaches in predicting functional properties of proteins require to either identify a reliable set of labeled proteins with similar attribute features to unannotated proteins, or to learn from a fully-labeled protein interaction network with a large amount of labeled data. However, acquiring such labels can be very difficult in practice, especially for multi-label protein function prediction problems. Learning with only a few labeled data can lead to poor performance as limited supervision knowledge can be obtained from similar proteins or from connections between them. To effectively annotate proteins even in the paucity of labeled data, it is important to take advantage of all data sources that are available in this problem setting, including interaction networks, attribute feature information, correlations of functional labels, and unlabeled data. Results: In this paper, we show that the underlying nature of predicting functional properties of proteins using various data sources of relational data is a typical collective classification (CC) problem in machine learning. The protein functional prediction task with limited annotation is then cast into a semi-supervised multi-label collective classification (SMCC) framework. As such, we propose a novel generative model based SMCC algorithm, called GM-SMCC, to effectively compute the label probability distributions of unannotated protein instances and predict their functional properties. To further boost the predicting performance, we extend the method in an ensemble manner, called EGM-SMCC, by utilizing multiple heterogeneous networks with various latent linkages constructed to explicitly model the relationships among the nodes for effectively propagate the supervision knowledge from labeled to unlabeled nodes. Conclusion: Experimental results on a yeast gene dataset predicting the functions and localization of proteins demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In the comparison, we find that the performances of the proposed algorithms are better than the other compared algorithms.

Abberations in protein sumoylation has been linked with a variety of disorders and developmental anomalies. Experimental approaches to identification of sumoylation sites may not be effective due to the dynamic nature of sumoylation, labor some experiments and their cost. Therefore, computational approaches may guide experimental identification of sumoylation sites and provide insights for further understanding sumoylation mechanism. Results: In this paper, the effectiveness of using various sequence properties in predicting sumoylation sites was investigated with statistical analyses and machine learning approach employing support vector machines. These sequence properties were derived from windows of size 7 including position-specific amino acid composition, hydrophobicity, estimated sub-window volumes, predicted disorder, and conformational flexibility. 5-fold cross-validation results on experimentally identified sumoylation sites revealed that our method successfully predicts sumoylation sites with a Matthew's correlation coefficient, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy equal to 0.66, 73%, 98%, and 97%, respectively. Additionally, we have showed that our method compares favorably to the existing prediction methods and basic regular expressions scanner. Conclusions: By using support vector machines, a new, robust method for sumoylation site prediction was introduced. Besides, the possible effects of predicted conformational flexibility and disorder on sumoylation site recognition were explored computationally for the first time to our knowledge as an additional parameter that could aid in sumoylation site prediction.

An active experimental design approach	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						tsunamis; machine learning; active optimization	FINITE-VOLUME METHOD; CIRCULAR ISLAND; SOLITARY WAVES; PLANE BEACH; N-WAVES; RUN-UP; EMULATION; SUMATRA; MODEL	Small islands in the vicinity of the mainland are widely believed to offer protection from wind and waves and thus coastal communities have been developed in mainland areas behind small islands. However, whether they offer protection from tsunamis is unclear. Do islands act as natural barriers? Recent post-tsunami survey data, supported by numerical simulations, reveal that the run-up on coastal areas behind small islands was significantly higher than on neighbouring locations not affected by the presence of the islands. To study the conditions of this run-up amplification, we solve numerically the nonlinear shallow water equations. We use the simplified geometry of a conical island sitting on a flat seafloor in front of a uniform sloping beach. By doing so, the experimental set-up is defined by five physical parameters, namely the island slope, the beach slope, the water depth, the distance between the island and the plane beach and the incoming wavelength, while the wave height was kept fixed. The objective is to find the maximum run-up amplification with the least number of simulations. To achieve this goal, we build an emulator based on Gaussian Processes to guide the selection of the query points in the parameter space. We thus reduce substantially the computations required to identify the run-up amplification. Our results show that the island acts as a focusing lens for energy and amplifies the run-up along the coastline behind its lee side, instead of protecting it, as popular beliefs suggest.

Yet when some avian strains do acquire the ability to overcome species barrier, they might become adapted to humans, replicating efficiently and causing diseases, leading to potential pandemic. With the huge influenza A virus reservoir in wild birds, it is a cause for concern when a new influenza strain emerges with the ability to cross host species barrier, as shown in light of the recent H7N9 outbreak in China. Several influenza proteins have been shown to be major determinants in host tropism. Further understanding and determining host tropism would be important in identifying zoonotic influenza virus strains capable of crossing species barrier and infecting humans. Results: In this study, computational models for 11 influenza proteins have been constructed using the machine learning algorithm random forest for prediction of host tropism. The prediction models were trained on influenza protein sequences isolated from both avian and human samples, which were transformed into amino acid physicochemical properties feature vectors. The results were highly accurate prediction models (ACC>96.57; AUC>0.980; MCC>0.916) capable of determining host tropism of individual influenza proteins. In addition, features from all 11 proteins were used to construct a combined model to predict host tropism of influenza virus strains. This would help assess a novel influenza strain's host range capability. Conclusions: From the prediction models constructed, all achieved high prediction performance, indicating clear distinctions in both avian and human proteins. When used together as a host tropism prediction system, zoonotic strains could potentially be identified based on different protein prediction results. Understanding and predicting host tropism of influenza proteins lay an important foundation for future work in constructing computation models capable of directly predicting interspecies transmission of influenza viruses.

The neural mechanism used to recognize objects as prey remains largely unknown. We devised a machine learning behavior classification system to quantify hunting kinematics in semi-restrained animals exposed to a range of virtual stimuli. Two-photon calcium imaging revealed a small visual area, AF7, which was activated specifically by the optimal prey stimulus. This pretectal region is innervated by two types of retinal ganglion cells, which also send collaterals to the optic tectum. Laser ablation of AF7 markedly reduced prey capture behavior. We identified neurons with arbors in AF7 and found that they projected to multiple sensory and premotor areas: the optic tectum, the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (nMLF) and the hindbrain. These findings indicate that computations in the retina give rise to a visual stream which transforms sensory information into a directed prey capture response.

Cognitive state monitoring and the design of adaptive instruction in digital environments: lessons learned from cognitive workload assessment using a passive brain-computer interface approach	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						passive brain-computer interface; EEG; cross-task classification; working-memory load; adaptive learning environments; cognitive load theory	WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LOAD THEORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EXECUTIVE ATTENTION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; FRONTAL LOBES; EEG; TASK	According to Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), one of the crucial factors for successful learning is the type and amount of working-memory load (WML) learners experience while studying instructional materials. Optimal learning conditions are characterized by providing challenges for learners without inducing cognitive over- or underload. Thus, presenting instruction in a way that WML is constantly held within an optimal range with regard to learners' working-memory capacity might be a good method to provide these optimal conditions. The current paper elaborates how digital learning environments, which achieve this goal can be developed by combining approaches from Cognitive Psychology, Neuroscience, and Computer Science. One of the biggest obstacles that needs to be overcome is the lack of an unobtrusive method of continuously assessing learners' WML in real-time. We propose to solve this problem by applying passive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) approaches to realistic learning scenarios in digital environments. In this paper we discuss the methodological and theoretical prospects and pitfalls of this approach based on results from the literature and from our own research. We present a strategy on how several inherent challenges of applying BCIs to WML and learning can be met by refining the psychological constructs behind WML, by exploring their neural signatures, by using these insights for sophisticated task designs, and by optimizing algorithms for analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) data. Based on this strategy we applied machine-learning algorithms for cross-task classifications of different levels of WML to tasks that involve studying realistic instructional materials. We obtained very promising results that yield several recommendations for future work.

The filler provides mechanical reinforcement and additional wear resistance to the rubber, but it in turn introduces non-linear mechanical behaviour to the material which most likely arises from interactions between the filler particles, mediated by the rubber matrix. While various studies have been made on the bulk mechanical properties and of the filler network structure (both imaging and by simulations), there presently does not exist any work directly linking filler particle spacing and mechanical properties. Here we show that using STEM tomography, aided by a machine learning image analysis procedure, to measure silica particle spacings provides a direct link between the inter-particle spacing and the reduction in shear modulus as a function of strain (the Payne effect), measured using dynamic mechanical analysis. Simulations of filler network formation using attractive, repulsive and non-interacting potentials were processed using the same method and compared with the experimental data, with the net result being that an attractive inter-particle potential is the most accurate way of modelling styrene-butadiene rubber-silica composite formation.

Land cover classification in multispectral imagery using clustering of sparse approximations over learned feature dictionaries	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						land cover classification; multispectral learned dictionaries; clustering of sparse approximations; Hebbian learning; spectral-textural features; unsupervised multispectral classification	ARCTIC TUNDRA; VEGETATION; ALASKA; ALGORITHM; PURSUITS; CANADA; AREA	We present results from an ongoing effort to extend neuromimetic machine vision algorithms to multispectral data using adaptive signal processing combined with compressive sensing and machine learning techniques. Our goal is to develop a robust classification methodology that will allow for automated discretization of the landscape into distinct units based on attributes such as vegetation, surface hydrological properties, and topographic/geomorphic characteristics. We use a Hebbian learning rule to build spectral-textural dictionaries that are tailored for classification. We learn our dictionaries from millions of overlapping multispectral image patches and then use a pursuit search to generate classification features. Land cover labels are automatically generated using unsupervised clustering of sparse approximations (CoSA). We demonstrate our method on multispectral WorldView-2 data from a coastal plain ecosystem in Barrow, Alaska. We explore learning from both raw multispectral imagery and normalized band difference indices. We explore a quantitative metric to evaluate the spectral properties of the clusters in order to potentially aid in assigning land cover categories to the cluster labels. Our results suggest CoSA is a promising approach to unsupervised land cover classification in high-resolution satellite imagery. (c) The Authors.

Results: In this paper we address the problem of rapid taxonomic assignment with small and adaptive data models (< 5 MB) and present the accelerated k-mer explorer (AKE). Acceleration in AKE's taxonomic assignments is achieved by a special machine learning architecture, which is well suited to model data collections that are intrinsically hierarchical. We report classification accuracy reasonably well for ranks down to order, observed on a study on real world data (Acid Mine Drainage, Cow Rumen).

J	Montanes, E; Suarez-Vazquez, A; Quevedo, JR				Montanes, Elena; Suarez-Vazquez, Ana; Ramon Quevedo, Jose			Ordinal classification/regression for analyzing the influence of superstars on spectators in cinema marketing	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Ordinal classification; Ordinal regression; Machine learning; Cinema marketing	REGRESSION; BEHAVIOR; INDUSTRY; PRODUCT; CHOICE; STARS	This paper studies the influence of superstars on spectators in cinema marketing. Casting superstars is a common risk-mitigation strategy in the cinema industry. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the presence of superstars is not always a guarantee of success and hence, a deeper study is required to analyze the potential audience of a movie. In this sense, knowledge, attitudes and emotions of spectators towards stars are analyzed as potential factors of influencing the intention of seeing a movie with stars in its cast. This analysis is performed through machine learning techniques. In particular, the problem is stated as an ordinal classification/regression task rather than a traditional classification or regression task, since the intention of watching a movie is measured in a graded scale, hence, its values exhibit an order. Several methods are discussed for this purpose, but Support Vector Ordinal Regression shows its superiority over other ordinal classification/regression techniques. Moreover, exhaustive experiments carried out confirm that the formulation of the problem as an ordinal classification/regression is a success, since powerful traditional classifiers and regressors show worse performance. The study also confirms that talent and popularity expressed by means of knowledge, attitude and emotions satisfactorily explain superstar persuasion. Finally, the impact of these three components is also checked. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The proposed Bayesian model involves several terms, including the pairwise interactions of Potts models, and the average vectors and covariant matrices of Gauss distributions in color image modeling. These terms are often referred to as hyperparameters in statistical machine learning theory. In order to determine these hyperparameters, we propose a new scheme for hyperparameter estimation based on conditional maximization of entropy in the Potts prior. The algorithm is given based on loopy belief propagation. In addition, we compare our conditional maximum entropy framework with the conventional maximum likelihood framework, and also clarify how the first order phase transitions in loopy belief propagations for Potts models influence our hyperparameter estimation procedures.

We present an approach to automatically analyzing this data to enable personalized and scalable energy efficiency programs for private households. In particular, we develop and evaluate a system that uses supervised machine learning techniques to automatically estimate specific "characteristics" of a household from its electricity consumption. The characteristics are related to a household's socio-economic status, its dwelling, or its appliance stock. We evaluate our approach by analyzing smart meter data collected from 4232 households in Ireland at a 30-min granularity over a period of 1.5 years. Our analysis shows that revealing characteristics from smart meter data is feasible, as our method achieves an accuracy of more than 70% over all households for many of the characteristics and even exceeds 80% for some of the characteristics. The findings are applicable to all smart metering systems without making changes to the measurement infrastructure. The inferred knowledge paves the way for targeted energy efficiency programs and other services that benefit from improved customer insights. On the basis of these promising results, the paper discusses the potential for utilities as well as policy and privacy implications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

PC12 Cells that Lack Synaptotagmin I Exhibit Loss of a Subpool of Small Dense Core Vesicles	BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							CHROMAFFIN CELLS; SYNAPTIC VESICLES; NEUROPEPTIDE-Y; REGULATED EXOCYTOSIS; TRANSMITTER RELEASE; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; RNA INTERFERENCE; NERVE-TERMINALS; QUANTAL SIZE; AMPEROMETRY	Neurons communicate by releasing neurotransmitters that are stored in intracellular vesicular compartments. PC12 cells are frequently used as a model secretory cell line that is described to have two subpools of vesicles: small clear vesicles and dense core vesicles. We measured transmitter molecules released from vesicles in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells using carbon-fiber amperometry, and relative diameters of individual vesicles using electron microscopy. Both amperometry and electron micrograph data were analyzed by statistical and machine learning methods for Gaussian mixture models. An electron microscopy size correction algorithm was used to predict and correct for observation bias of vesicle size due to tangential slices through some vesicles. Expectation maximization algorithms were used to perform maximum likelihood estimation for the Gaussian parameters of different populations of vesicles, and were shown to be better than histogram and cumulative distribution function methods for analyzing mixed populations. The Bayesian information criterion was used to determine the most likely number of vesicle subpools observed in the amperometric and electron microscopy data. From this analysis, we show that there are three major subpools, not two, of vesicles stored and released from PC12 cells. The three subpools of vesicles include small clear vesicles and two subpools of dense core vesicles, a small and a large dense core vesicle subpool. Using PC12 cells stably transfected with short-hairpin RNA targeted to synaptotagmin I, an exocytotic Ca2+ sensor, we show that the presence and release of the small dense core vesicle subpool is dependent on synaptotagmin I. Furthermore, synaptotagmin I also plays a role in the formation and/or maintenance of the small dense core vesicle subpool in PC12 cells.

Mexico has the world's fifth largest population of amphibians and the second country with the highest quantity of threatened amphibian species. About 10% of Mexican amphibians lack enough data to be assigned to a risk category by the IUCN, so in this paper we want to test a statistical tool that, in the absence of specific demographic data, can assess a species' risk of extinction, population trend, and to better understand which variables increase their vulnerability. Recent studies have demonstrated that the risk of species decline depends on extrinsic and intrinsic traits, thus including both of them for assessing extinction might render more accurate assessment of threats. Methods. We harvested data from the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) and the published literature for Mexican amphibians, and used these data to assess the population trend of some of the Mexican species that have been assigned to the Data Deficient category of the IUCN using Random Forests, a Machine Learning method that gives a prediction of complex processes and identifies the most important variables that account for the predictions. Results. Our results show that most of the data deficient Mexican amphibians that we used have decreasing population trends. We found that Random Forests is a solid way to identify species with decreasing population trends when no demographic data is available. Moreover, we point to the most important variables that make species more vulnerable for extinction. This exercise is a very valuable first step in assigning conservation priorities for poorly known species.

Nanograined materials can now be synthesized with higher figures of merit (ZT) than the bulk counterparts. This leads to increased conversion efficiencies. Despite considerable effort in optimizing the known and discovering the unknown, technology still relies upon a few limited solutions. Here ab initio modeling of ZT is performed for 75 nanograined compounds-the result of accurate distillation with electronic and thermodynamic filtering techniques from the 79 057 half-Heusler entries available in the AFLOWLIB.org repository. For many of the compounds, the ZTs are markedly above those attainable with nanograined IV and III-V semiconductors. About 15% of them may even outperform ZT approximate to 2 at high temperatures. This analysis elucidates the origin of the advantageous thermoelectric properties found within this broad material class. Machine learning techniques are used to unveil simple rules determining if a nanograined half-Heusler compound is likely to be a good thermoelectric given its chemical composition.

Mechanical Circulatory Support (MCS) therapy is an option for Advanced HF (AdHF) patients. Perioperatively, multiorgan dysfunction (MOD) is linked to the effects of device implantation, augmented by preexisting HF. Early recognition of MOD allows for better diagnosis, treatment, and risk prediction. Gene expression profiling (GEP) was used to evaluate clinical phenotypes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) transcriptomes obtained from patients' blood samples. Whole blood (WB) samples are clinically more feasible, but their performance in comparison to PBMC samples has not been determined. Methods: We collected blood samples from 31 HF patients (57 +/- 15 years old) undergoing cardiothoracic surgery and 7 healthy age-matched controls, between 2010 and 2011, at a single institution. WB and PBMC samples were collected at a single timepoint postoperatively (median day 8 postoperatively) (25-75% IQR 7-14 days) and subjected to Illumina single color Human BeadChip HT12 v4 whole genome expression array analysis. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was used to characterize the severity of MOD into low (<= 4 points), intermediate (5-11), and high (>= 12) risk categories correlating with GEP. Results: Results indicate that the direction of change in GEP of individuals with MOD as compared to controls is similar when determined from PBMC versus WB. The main enriched terms by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis included those involved in the inflammatory response, apoptosis, and other stress response related pathways. The data revealed 35 significant GO categories and 26 pathways overlapping between PBMC and WB. Additionally, class prediction using machine learning tools demonstrated that the subset of significant genes shared by PBMC and WB are sufficient to train as a predictor separating the SOFA groups. Conclusion: GEP analysis of WB has the potential to become a clinical tool for immune-monitoring in patients with MOD.

These images often carry annotations on taxonomy and observable features, such as anatomical structures and phenotype variations often recorded in response to the environmental factors under which the organisms were sampled. At present, most of these annotations are described in free text, may involve limited use of non-standard vocabularies, and rarely specify precise coordinates of features on the image plane such that a computer vision algorithm could identify, extract and annotate them. Therefore, researchers and curators need a tool that can identify and demarcate features in an image plane and allow their annotation with semantically contextual ontology terms. Such a tool would generate data useful for inter and intra-specific comparison and encourage the integration of curation standards. In the future, quality annotated image segments may provide training data sets for developing machine learning applications for automated image annotation. Results: We developed a novel image segmentation and annotation software application, "Annotation of Image Segments with Ontologies" (AISO). The tool enables researchers and curators to delineate portions of an image into multiple highlighted segments and annotate them with an ontology-based controlled vocabulary. AISO is a freely available Java-based desktop application and runs on multiple platforms. It can be downloaded at http://www.plantontology.org/software/AISO. Conclusions: AISO enables curators and researchers to annotate digital images with ontology terms in a manner which ensures the future computational value of the annotated images. We foresee uses for such data-encoded image annotations in biological data mining, machine learning, predictive annotation, semantic inference, and comparative analyses.

This approach however is not well suited to identify interaction between genes whose protein products potentially influence each other, which limits its power to identify molecular wiring of tumour cells dictating response to a drug. Due to the fact that signal transduction pathways are not linear and highly interlinked, the biological response they drive may be better described by the relative amount of their components and their functional relationships than by their individual, absolute expression. Results: Gene expression microarray data for 109 tumor cell lines with known sensitivity to the death ligand cytokine tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) was used to identify genes with potential functional relationships determining responsiveness to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The machine learning technique Random Forest in the statistical environment "R" with backward elimination was used to identify the key predictors of TRAIL sensitivity and differentially expressed genes were identified using the software GeneSpring. Gene co-regulation and statistical interaction was assessed with q-order partial correlation analysis and non-rejection rate. Biological (functional) interactions amongst the co-acting genes were studied with Ingenuity network analysis. Prediction accuracy was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operator curve using an independent dataset. We show that the gene panel identified could predict TRAIL-sensitivity with a very high degree of sensitivity and specificity (AUC = 0.84). The genes in the panel are co-regulated and at least 40% of them functionally interact in signal transduction pathways that regulate cell death and cell survival, cellular differentiation and morphogenesis. Importantly, only 12% of the TRAIL-predictor genes were differentially expressed highlighting the importance of functional interactions in predicting the biological response. Conclusions: The advantage of co-acting gene clusters is that this analysis does not depend on differential expression and is able to incorporate direct-and indirect gene interactions as well as tissue-and cell-specific characteristics. This approach (1) identified a descriptor of TRAIL sensitivity which performs significantly better as a predictor of TRAIL sensitivity than any previously reported gene signatures, (2) identified potential novel regulators of TRAIL-responsiveness and (3) provided a systematic view highlighting fundamental differences between the molecular wiring of sensitive and resistant cell types.

Time-course human urine proteomics in space-flight simulation experiments	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; GENE-EXPRESSION; BLOOD-PRESSURE; PORTRAITS; SELECTION; DATABASE; BALANCE; MAPS; KEGG	Background: Long-term space travel simulation experiments enabled to discover different aspects of human metabolism such as the complexity of NaCl salt balance. Detailed proteomics data were collected during the Mars105 isolation experiment enabling a deeper insight into the molecular processes involved. Results: We studied the abundance of about two thousand proteins extracted from urine samples of six volunteers collected weekly during a 105-day isolation experiment under controlled dietary conditions including progressive reduction of salt consumption. Machine learning using Self Organizing maps (SOM) in combination with different analysis tools was applied to describe the time trajectories of protein abundance in urine. The method enables a personalized and intuitive view on the physiological state of the volunteers. The abundance of more than one half of the proteins measured clearly changes in the course of the experiment. The trajectory splits roughly into three time ranges, an early (week 1-6), an intermediate (week 7-11) and a late one (week 12-15). Regulatory modes associated with distinct biological processes were identified using previous knowledge by applying enrichment and pathway flow analysis. Early protein activation modes can be related to immune response and inflammatory processes, activation at intermediate times to developmental and proliferative processes and late activations to stress and responses to chemicals. Conclusions: The protein abundance profiles support previous results about alternative mechanisms of salt storage in an osmotically inactive form. We hypothesize that reduced NaCl consumption of about 6 g/day presumably will reduce or even prevent the activation of inflammatory processes observed in the early time range of isolation. SOM machine learning in combination with analysis methods of class discovery and functional annotation enable the straightforward analysis of complex proteomics data sets generated by means of mass spectrometry.

J	Czajkowski, M; Kretowski, M				Czajkowski, Marcin; Kretowski, Marek			Evolutionary induction of global model trees with specialized operators and memetic extensions	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Evolutionary algorithm; Model tree; Multiple linear regression; Machine learning	TOP-DOWN INDUCTION; DECISION TREES; REGRESSION TREES; DATA SETS; CLASSIFIERS; ALGORITHMS	Metaheuristics, such as evolutionary algorithms (EAs), have been successfully applied to the problem of decision tree induction. Recently, an EA was proposed to evolve model trees, which are a particular type of decision tree that is employed to solve regression problems. However, there is a need to specialize the EAs in order to exploit the full potential of evolutionary induction. The main contribution of this paper is a set of solutions and techniques that incorporates knowledge about the inducing problem for the global model tree into the evolutionary search. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that specialized EA can find more accurate and less complex solutions to the traditional greedy-induced counterparts and the straightforward application of EA. This paper proposes a novel solution for each step of the evolutionary process and presents a new specialized EA for model tree induction called the Global Model Tree (GMT). An empirical investigation shows that trees induced by the GMT are one order of magnitude less complex than trees induced by popular greedy algorithms, and they are equivalent in terms of predictive accuracy with output models from straightforward implementations of evolutionary induction and state-of-the-art methods.

It is known that a decision-tree model can contain relations that are statistically significant, but, in reality, meaningless to a human. When the task is domain analysis, meaningless relations are problematic, since they can lead to wrong conclusions and can consequently undermine a human's trust in DM programs. To eliminate problematic relations from the conclusions of analysis, we propose an interactive method called Human-Machine Data Mining (HMDM). The method constructs multiple models in a specific way so that a human can reexamine the relations in different contexts and, based on observed evidence, conclude which relations and models are credible that is, both meaningful and of high quality. Based on the extracted credible relations and models, the human can construct correct overall conclusions about the domain. The method is demonstrated in two complex domains, extracting credible relations and models that indicate the segments of the higher education sector and the research and development sector that influence the economic welfare of a country. An experimental evaluation shows that the method is capable of finding important relations and models that are better in both meaning and quality than those constructed solely by the DM programs.

J	Peng, LZ; Zhang, HL; Yang, B; Chen, YH				Peng, Lizhi; Zhang, Hongli; Yang, Bo; Chen, Yuehui			A new approach for imbalanced data classification based on data gravitation	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Data gravitation; Classification; Imbalanced data; Machine learning	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; DATA-SETS; LEARNING ALGORITHMS; SOFTWARE TOOL; PERFORMANCE; ACCURACY; DESIGN; POWER; KEEL	Imbalanced classification is an important machine learning research topic that troubles most general classification models because of the imbalanced class distribution. A newly developed physical-inspired classification method, i.e., the data gravitation-based classification (DGC) model, performs well in many general classification problems. However, like other general classifiers, the performance of DGC suffers in imbalanced tasks. In this study, we develop a specific DGC model namely Imbalanced DGC (IDGC) model for imbalanced problems. The amplified gravitation coefficient (AGC) is introduced for gravitation computing. AGC is a type of coefficient that contains class imbalance information, which can strengthen and weaken the gravitational field of the minority and majority classes. We also design a fitness evaluation function in the weight optimization procedure of the data distribution to ensure that the model parameters adapt to the imbalanced class distributions. A total of 44 binary class data sets and 15 multiclass imbalanced data sets are used to test the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the adapted DGC model is effective for imbalanced problems. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.

First, a spatial filtering method based on the Log-Normal filters is introduced for the holistic processing of the face towards the automatic segmentation of consecutive "emotional segments" in video sequences. Secondly, a filtering-based method based on the Log-Gabor filters is applied as a feature-based processing for the automatic and accurate segmentation of the transient facial features (such as nasal root wrinkles and nasolabial furrows) and a precise estimation of their orientation in a single pass. We compared heuristic and machine learning based methods to evaluate the efficiency of the used descriptors for each task. When tested for automatic detection of "emotional segments" in 137 video sequences from the MMI, the Hammal-Caplier facial expression databases, and 20 recorded video sequences of consecutive appearance of multiple facial expressions, the proposed Log-Normal based descriptors achieved an accuracy of 89% with a mean frame error of 8 frames using a heuristic based processing. Higher performances were obtained using the SVM based method leading to an accuracy of 94% with a mean frame error detection of 3.1 frames. Tested on more than 3280 images from 5 benchmark databases (i.e. the CohnKanade database, the CAFE database, the STOIC database, the MMI database, and the Hammal-Caplier database) the proposed Log-Gabor based descriptors for transient facial features detection achieved a mean performance of 82% using a heuristic based processing and a mean performance of 96% using the SVM based classification. The proposed method for the estimation of the corresponding orientation leads to an error of 2.7 degrees. (C)2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Even viewing pictures of nature vs. pictures of built environments can produce similar effects. A major question is: What is it about natural environments that produces these benefits? Problematically, there are many differing qualities between natural and urban environments, making it difficult to narrow down the dimensions of nature that may lead to these benefits. In this study, we set out to uncover visual features that related to individuals' perceptions of naturalness in images. We quantified naturalness in two ways: first, implicitly using a multidimensional scaling analysis and second, explicitly with direct naturalness ratings. Features that seemed most related to perceptions of naturalness were related to the density of contrast changes in the scene, the density of straight lines in the scene, the average color saturation in the scene and the average hue diversity in the scene. We then trained a machine-learning algorithm to predict whether a scene was perceived as being natural or not based on these low-level visual features and we could do so with 81% accuracy. As such we were able to reliably predict subjective perceptions of naturalness with objective low-level visual features. Our results can be used in future studies to determine if these features, which are related to naturalness, may also lead to the benefits attained from interacting with nature.

They use machine-learning techniques to discover problem's substructures that might be useful to generate new solutions. This idea was grounded on Simon's near-decomposability principle and Holland's Building Block (BB)-hypothesis, and have enabled the development of effective algorithms in some contexts. Although near-decomposability is commonly seen in nature, we cannot assume the same occurs for optimization problems. Therefore, the existence of problems where these algorithms are not effective is also focus of research. Recent studies have argued that Multidimensional Knapsack Problems (MKPs) are examples of such cases. This paper extends these studies with an extensive comparison of various LTGA variants for the MKP. Using a well-known GA as reference, we analyzed the difficulties faced by the LTGA and explained why its linkage-tree model is not of much help to solve the problem. The results have shown that the LTGA was not able to outperform the GA and performed very similarly to a LTGA using random linkage-models. Further analysis of the linkage-trees, grounded on the knapsack-core concept, enabled interesting conclusions about the reason that linkage-learning did not provide useful information to solve MKPs in the settings used for the experiments.

These algorithms elicit preferences from a single or multiple Decision Makers (DMs), a priori or interactively, to guide the search towards the solutions most preferred by the DM(s), as against the whole Pareto-optimal Front (POF). Despite its promise for dealing with MaOPs, the utility of this approach is impaired by the lack of-objectivity; repeatability; consistency; and coherence in DM's preferences. This paper proposes a machine learning based framework to counter the above limitations. Towards it, the preference-structure of the different objectives embedded in the problem model is learnt in terms of: a smallest set of conflicting objectives which can generate the same POF as the original problem; the smallest objective sets corresponding to pre-specified errors; and the objective sets of pre-specified sizes that correspond to minimum error. While the focus is on demonstrating how the proposed framework could serve as a decision support for the DM, its performance is also studied vis-a-vis an alternative approach (based on dominance relation preservation), for a wide range of test problems and a real-world problem. The results mark a new direction for MCDM based MOEAs for MaOPs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It converts a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) into a set of scalar optimization subproblems and then uses the evolutionary algorithm (EA) to optimize these subproblems simultaneously. However, there is a great deal of randomness in MOEA/D. Researchers in the field of evolutionary algorithm, reinforcement learning and neural network have reported that the simultaneous consideration of randomness and opposition has an advantage over pure randomness. A new scheme, called opposition-based learning (OBL), has been proposed in the machine learning field. In this paper, OBL has been integrated into the framework of MOEA/D to accelerate its convergence speed. Hence, our proposed approach is called opposition-based learning MOEA/D (MOEA/D-OBL). Compared with MOEA/D, MOEA/D-OBL uses an opposition-based initial population and opposition-based learning strategy to generate offspring during the evolutionary process. It is compared with its parent algorithm MOEA/D on four representative kinds of MOPs and many-objective optimization problems.

Multi-objective model type selection	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Model type selection; VC dimension; Multi-objective optimization; Ensemble methods	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; HYPER-PARAMETERS; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM; VALUES	Classification is a mainstream within the machine learning community. As a result, a large number of learning algorithms have been proposed. The performance of many of these could highly depend on the chosen values of their hyper-parameters. This paper introduces a novel method for addressing the model selection problem for a given classification task. In our model selection formulation, both the learning algorithm and its hyper-parameters are considered. In our proposed approach, model selection is tackled as a multi-objective optimization problem. The empirical error, or training error, and the model complexity are defined as the objectives. We adopt a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm as the search engine, due to its high performance and its advantages for solving multi-objective problems. The model complexity is estimated experimentally, in a general fashion, for any learning algorithm, through the VC dimension. Strategies for choosing a single model or for constructing an ensemble of models from the resulting non-dominated set are also proposed. Experimental results on benchmark data sets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, a comparative study shows that the obtained models are highly competitive, in terms of generalization performance, with other methods in the state of the art that focus on a single-learning algorithm, or a single-objective approach.

LG-Trader: Stock trading decision support based on feature selection by weighted localized generalization error model	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						LG-Trader; Stock trading decision; MLPNN; L-GEM; Multi-objective; Feature selection	NEURAL-NETWORK; POINTS PREDICTION; SYSTEM; SENSITIVITY; TREND	Stock trading is an important financial activity of human society. Machine learning techniques are adopted to provide trading decision support by predicting the stock price or trading signals of the next day. Decisions are made by analyzing technical indices and fundamental analysis of companies. There are two major machine learning research problems for stock trading decision support: classifier architecture selection and feature selection. In this work, we propose the LG-Trader which will deal with these two problems simultaneously using a genetic algorithm minimizing a new Weighted Localized Generalization Error (wL-GEM). An issue being ignored in current machine learning based stock trading researches is the imbalance among buy, hold and sell decisions. Usually hold decision is the majority in comparison to both buy and sell decisions. So, the wL-GEM is proposed to balance classes by penalizing heavier for generalization error being made in minority classes. The feature selection based on wL-GEM helps to select most useful technical indices among choices for each stock. Experimental results demonstrate that the LG-Trader yields higher profits and rates of return in both stock and index trading. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Ng, Wing W.

Enhancing In Silico Protein-Based Vaccine Discovery for Eukaryotic Pathogens Using Predicted Peptide-MHC Binding and Peptide Conservation Scores	PLOS ONE			English	Article							T-CELL RESPONSES; TOXOPLASMA-GONDII; REVERSE VACCINOLOGY; POSITIVE SELECTION; EPITOPES; MICE; PROTECTION; ANTIGENS; GENE; IDENTIFICATION	Given thousands of proteins constituting a eukaryotic pathogen, the principal objective for a high-throughput in silico vaccine discovery pipeline is to select those proteins worthy of laboratory validation. Accurate prediction of T-cell epitopes on protein antigens is one crucial piece of evidence that would aid in this selection. Prediction of peptides recognised by T-cell receptors have to date proved to be of insufficient accuracy. The in silico approach is consequently reliant on an indirect method, which involves the prediction of peptides binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. There is no guarantee nevertheless that predicted peptide-MHC complexes will be presented by antigen-presenting cells and/or recognised by cognate T-cell receptors. The aim of this study was to determine if predicted peptide-MHC binding scores could provide contributing evidence to establish a protein's potential as a vaccine. Using T-Cell MHC class I binding prediction tools provided by the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource, peptide binding affinity to 76 common MHC I alleles were predicted for 160 Toxoplasma gondii proteins: 75 taken from published studies represented proteins known or expected to induce T-cell immune responses and 85 considered less likely vaccine candidates. The results show there is no universal set of rules that can be applied directly to binding scores to distinguish a vaccine from a non-vaccine candidate. We present, however, two proposed strategies exploiting binding scores that provide supporting evidence that a protein is likely to induce a T-cell immune response-one using random forest (a machine learning algorithm) with a 72% sensitivity and 82.4% specificity and the other, using amino acid conservation scores with a 74.6% sensitivity and 70.5% specificity when applied to the 160 benchmark proteins. More importantly, the binding score strategies are valuable evidence contributors to the overall in silico vaccine discovery pool of evidence.

The compressive strength of high performance concrete (HPC) is a major civil engineering problem. However, the validity of reported relationships between concrete ingredients and mechanical strength is questionable. This paper provides a comprehensive study using advanced ML techniques to predict the compressive strength of HPC. Specifically, individual and ensemble learning classifiers are constructed from four different base learners, including multilayer perceptron (ML!') neural network, support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression tree (CART), and linear regression (LR). For ensemble models that integrate multiple classifiers, the voting, bagging, and stacking combination methods are considered. The behavior simulation capabilities of these techniques are investigated using concrete data from several countries. The comparison results show that ensemble learning techniques are better than learning techniques used individually to predict HPC compressive strength. Although the two single best learning models are SVM and MLP, the stacking-based ensemble model composed of MLP/CART, SVM, and LR in the first level and SVM in the second level often achieves the best performance measures. This study validates the applicability of ML, voting, bagging, and stacking techniques for simple and efficient simulations of concrete compressive strength. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Meng, J; Liu, D; Sun, C; Luan, YS				Meng, Jun; Liu, Dong; Sun, Chao; Luan, Yushi			Prediction of plant pre-microRNAs and their microRNAs in genome-scale sequences using structure-sequence features and support vector machine	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						MiRNA; Pre-miRNA; Prediction; SVM; Feature selection	COMPUTATIONAL IDENTIFICATION; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; CLASSIFICATION; PRECURSORS; DROSOPHILA; MIRNAS; REAL; BIOGENESIS; SELECTION; ALIGNMENT	Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of non-coding RNAs approximately 21 nucleotides in length that play pivotal roles at the post-transcriptional level in animals, plants and viruses. These molecules silence their target genes by degrading transcription or suppressing translation. Studies have shown that miRNAs are involved in biological responses to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses. Identification of these molecules and their targets can aid the understanding of regulatory processes. Recently, prediction methods based on machine learning have been widely used for miRNA prediction. However, most of these methods were designed for mammalian miRNA prediction, and few are available for predicting miRNAs in the pre-miRNAs of specific plant species. Although the complete Solanum lycopersicum genome has been published, only 77 Solanum lycopersicum miRNAs have been identified, far less than the estimated number. Therefore, it is essential to develop a prediction method based on machine learning to identify new plant miRNAs. Results: A novel classification model based on a support vector machine (SVM) was trained to identify real and pseudo plant pre-miRNAs together with their miRNAs. An initial set of 152 novel features related to sequential structures was used to train the model. By applying feature selection, we obtained the best subset of 47 features for use with the Back Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (B-SVM-RFE) method for the classification of plant pre-miRNAs. Using this method, 63 features were obtained for plant miRNA classification. We then developed an integrated classification model, miPlantPreMat, which comprises MiPlantPre and MiPlantMat, to identify plant pre-miRNAs and their miRNAs. This model achieved approximately 90% accuracy using plant datasets from nine plant species, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max, Oryza sativa, Physcomitrella patens, Medicago truncatula, Sorghum bicolor, Arabidopsis lyrata, Zea mays and Solanum lycopersicum. Using miPlantPreMat, 522 Solanum lycopersicum miRNAs were identified in the Solanum lycopersicum genome sequence. Conclusions: We developed an integrated classification model, miPlantPreMat, based on structure-sequence features and SVM. MiPlantPreMat was used to identify both plant pre-miRNAs and the corresponding mature miRNAs. An improved feature selection method was proposed, resulting in high classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

K.; De Moor, Bart			Predicting breast cancer using an expression values weighted clinical classifier	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; MICROARRAY DATA; PROGNOSIS	Background: Clinical data, such as patient history, laboratory analysis, ultrasound parameters-which are the basis of day-to-day clinical decision support-are often used to guide the clinical management of cancer in the presence of microarray data. Several data fusion techniques are available to integrate genomics or proteomics data, but only a few studies have created a single prediction model using both gene expression and clinical data. These studies often remain inconclusive regarding an obtained improvement in prediction performance. To improve clinical management, these data should be fully exploited. This requires efficient algorithms to integrate these data sets and design a final classifier. LS-SVM classifiers and generalized eigenvalue/singular value decompositions are successfully used in many bioinformatics applications for prediction tasks. While bringing up the benefits of these two techniques, we propose a machine learning approach, a weighted LS-SVM classifier to integrate two data sources: microarray and clinical parameters. Results: We compared and evaluated the proposed methods on five breast cancer case studies. Compared to LS-SVM classifier on individual data sets, generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD) and kernel GEVD, the proposed weighted LS-SVM classifier offers good prediction performance, in terms of test area under ROC Curve (AUC), on all breast cancer case studies. Conclusions: Thus a clinical classifier weighted with microarray data set results in significantly improved diagnosis, prognosis and prediction responses to therapy. The proposed model has been shown as a promising mathematical framework in both data fusion and non-linear classification problems.	[Thomas, Minta; Suykens, Johan A.

The study compares four prediction models, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), random forest and naive-Bayes with two approaches for input to these models. The first approach for input data involves computation of ten technical parameters using stock trading data (open, high, low & close prices) while the second approach focuses on representing these technical parameters as trend deterministic data. Accuracy of each of the prediction models for each of the two input approaches is evaluated. Evaluation is carried out on 10 years of historical data from 2003 to 2012 of two stocks namely Reliance Industries and Infosys Ltd. and two stock price indices CNX Nifty and S&P Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex. The experimental results suggest that for the first approach of input data where ten technical parameters are represented as continuous values, random forest outperforms other three prediction models on overall performance. Experimental results also show that the performance of all the prediction models improve when these technical parameters are represented as trend deterministic data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wu, SF; Lee, SJ				Wu, Shin-Fu; Lee, Shie-Jue			Employing local modeling in machine learning based methods for time-series prediction	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Time series prediction; Machine learning; Local modeling; Nearest neighbors; Mutual information	ALGORITHM; SELECTION; NETWORKS; SYSTEM	Time series prediction has been widely used in a variety of applications in science, engineering, finance, etc. There are two different modeling options for constructing forecasting models in time series prediction. Global modeling constructs a model which is independent from user queries. On the contrary, local modeling constructs a local model for each different query from the user. In this paper, we propose a local modeling strategy and investigate the effectiveness of incorporating local modeling with three popular machine learning based forecasting methods, Neural Network (NN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), for time series prediction. Given a series of historical data, a local context of the user query is located and an appropriate number of lags are selected. Then forecasting models are constructed by applying NN, ANFIS, and LS-SVM, respectively. A number of experiments are conducted and the results show that local modeling can enhance the estimation performance of a forecasting method for time series prediction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

There are a number of indicators to measure knowledge advances, however, the benefits for stakeholders and policy makers are limited because of a lack of classification models. This paper introduces an approach to classify 54 countries (in 2007-2009) according to their progress toward a knowledge economy (KE). To achieve this, the aims of this paper are twofold: first, to find clusters of countries at a similar stage of development toward ICE to test if they are meaningful; hence, it will be possible to order the clusters from early KEs (last cluster) to advanced KEs (first cluster). Second, having obtained these clusters, it is possible to build various models to detect the advancement of countries toward ICE from one year to another due to its classification. Then, three ordinal classifiers from the machine-learning field were compared in order to select the classifier that performs the best and to confirm the ordinal description of the clusters. Finally, an ordinal model based on the Support Vector Ordinal Regression with Implicit Constraints was selected because of its ability to classify the patterns into the clusters, confirming the appropriateness of the clusters and their ordinal nature. The proposed ordinal classifier could be used for monitoring the progress or stage of transition to ICE and for analysing whether a country changes clusters, entering one that performs better or worse.

Feature selection and feature extraction are two commonly used techniques for decreasing dimensionality of the data and increasing efficiency of learning algorithms. Specifically, feature selection realized in the absence of class labels, namely unsupervised feature selection, is challenging and interesting. In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised feature selection criterion developed from the viewpoint of subspace learning, which is treated as a matrix factorization problem. The advantages of this work are four-fold. First, dwelling on the technique of matrix factorization, a unified framework is established for feature selection, feature extraction and clustering. Second, an iterative update algorithm is provided via matrix factorization, which is an efficient technique to deal with high-dimensional data. Third, an effective method for feature selection with numeric data is put forward, instead of drawing support from the discretization process. Fourth, this new criterion provides a sound foundation for embedding kernel tricks into feature selection. With this regard, an algorithm based on kernel methods is also proposed. The algorithms are compared with four state-of-the-art feature selection methods using six publicly available datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that in terms of clustering results, the proposed two algorithms come with better performance than the others for almost all datasets we experimented with here.

It consists of dividing the original multi-class problem into easier-to-solve binary subproblems considering each possible pair of classes. Since several classifiers are learned, their combination becomes crucial in order to predict the class of new instances. Due to the division procedure a series of difficulties emerge at this stage, such as the non-competence problem. Each classifier is learned using only the instances of its corresponding pair of classes, and hence, it is not competent to classify instances belonging to the rest of the classes; nevertheless, at classification time all the outputs of the classifiers are taken into account because the competence cannot be known a priori (the classification problem would be solved). On this account, we develop a distance-based combination strategy, which weights the competence of the outputs of the base classifiers depending on the closeness of the query instance to each one of the classes. Our aim is to reduce the effect of the non-competent classifiers, enhancing the results obtained by the state-of-the-art combinations for One-vs-One strategy. We carry out a thorough experimental study, supported by the proper statistical analysis, showing that the results obtained by the proposed method outperform, both in terms of accuracy and kappa measures, the previous combinations for One-vs-One strategy.

In contrast with "traditional" axis-parallel decision trees in which only a single feature (variable) is taken into account at each node, the node of the proposed decision trees involves a fuzzy rule which involves multiple features. Fuzzy rules are employed to produce leaves of high purity. Using multiple features for a node helps us minimize the size of the trees. The growth of the FRDT is realized by expanding an additional node composed of a mixture of data coming from different classes, which is the only non-leaf node of each layer. This gives rise to a new geometric structure endowed with linguistic terms which are quite different from the "traditional" oblique decision trees endowed with hyperplanes as decision functions. A series of numeric studies are reported using data coming from UCI machine learning data sets. The comparison is carried out with regard to "traditional" decision trees such as C4.5, LADtree, BFTree, SimpleCart, and NBTree. The results of statistical tests have shown that the proposed FRDT exhibits the best performance in terms of both accuracy and the size of the produced trees. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Some popular richer representations are Sparse Representation (SR) based on solving an l(1)-regularized least squares formulation, Collaborative Representation (CR) based on l(2)-regularized least squares, and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) based on an l(1)-constrained least squares problem. We propose a novel sparse representation, the Iterative Nearest Neighbors (INN). It combines the power of SR and LLE with the computational simplicity of k NN. We empirically validate our representation in terms of sparse support signal recovery and compare with similar Matching Pursuit (MP) and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), two other iterative methods. We also test our method in terms of dimensionality reduction and classification, using standard benchmarks for faces (AR), traffic signs (GTSRB), and objects (PASCAL VOC 2007). INN compares favorably to NN, MP, and OMP, and on par with CR and SR, while being orders of magnitude faster than the latter. On the downside, INN does not scale well with higher dimensionalities of the data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The generalized low rank approximations of matrices (GLRAM) and the bilinear Lanczos components (BLC) algorithm are two popular algorithms that treat data as the native two-dimensional matrix patterns. However, these two algorithms often require heavy computation time and memory space in practice, especially for large scale problems. In this paper, we propose inexact and incremental bilinear Lanczos components algorithms for high dimensionality reduction and image reconstruction. We first introduce the thick-restarting strategy to the BLC algorithm, and present a thick-restarted Lanczos components (TRBLC) algorithm. In this algorithm, we use the Ritz vectors as approximations to dominant eigenvectors instead of the Lanczos vectors. In our implementation, the iterative matrices are neither formed nor stored explicitly, thanks to the characteristic of the Lanczos procedure. Then, we explore the relationship between the reconstruction error and the accuracy of the Ritz vectors, so that the computational complexities of eigenpairs can be reduced significantly. As a result, we propose an inexact thick-restarted Lanczos components (Inex-TRBLC) algorithm. Moreover, we investigate the problem of incremental generalized low rank approximations of matrices, and propose an incremental and inexact TRBLC (Incr-TRBLC) algorithm. Numerical experiments illustrate the superiority of the new algorithms over the GLRAM algorithm and its variations, as well as the BLC algorithm for some real-world image reconstruction and face recognition problems.

Optimizing area under the ROC curve using semi-supervised learning	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Receiver operating characteristic; AUC; Semi-supervised learning; Transfer learning; Semidefinite programming; RankBoost; SVMROC; SSLROC	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CT COLONOGRAPHY; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; AUC; TESTS	Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is a standard methodology to evaluate the performance of a binary classification system. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a performance metric that summarizes how well a classifier separates two classes. Traditional AUC optimization techniques are supervised learning methods that utilize only labeled data (i.e., the true class is known for all data) to train the classifiers. In this work, inspired by semi-supervised and transductive learning, we propose two new AUC optimization algorithms hereby referred to as semi-supervised learning receiver operating characteristic (SSLROC) algorithms, which utilize unlabeled test samples in classifier training to maximize AUC. Unlabeled samples are incorporated into the AUC optimization process, and their ranking relationships to labeled positive and negative training samples are considered as optimization constraints. The introduced test samples will cause the learned decision boundary in a multidimensional feature space to adapt not only to the distribution of labeled training data, but also to the distribution of unlabeled test data. We formulate the semi-supervised AUC optimization problem as a semi-definite programming problem based on the margin maximization theory. The proposed methods SSLROC1 (1-norm) and SSLROC2 (2-norm) were evaluated using 34 (determined by power analysis) randomly selected datasets from the University of California, Irvine machine learning repository. Wilcoxon signed rank tests showed that the proposed methods achieved significant improvement compared with state-of-the-art methods. The proposed methods were also applied to a CT colonography dataset for colonic polyp classification and showed promising results.(1) Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Wavelet shrinkage using adaptive structured sparsity constraints	SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Structured sparsity; Regularised regression; Denoising; Dual-tree complex wavelet transform	HILBERT TRANSFORM PAIRS; BIVARIATE SHRINKAGE; MODEL SELECTION; DESIGN; LASSO; RECONSTRUCTION; REGRESSION; SIGNALS; OPTIMIZATION; ESTIMATORS	Structured sparsity approaches have recently received much attention in the statistics, machine learning, and signal processing communities. A common strategy is to exploit or assume prior information about structural dependencies inherent in the data; the solution is encouraged to behave as such by the inclusion of an appropriate regularisation term which enforces structured sparsity constraints over sub-groups of data. An important variant of this idea considers the tree-like dependency structures often apparent in wavelet decompositions. However, both the constituent groups and their associated weights in the regularisation term are typically defined a priori. We here introduce an adaptive wavelet denoising framework whereby a sparsity-inducing regulariser is modified based on information extracted from the signal itself. In particular, we use the same wavelet decomposition to detect the location of salient features in the signal, such as jumps or sharp bumps. Given these locations, the weights in the regulariser associated to the groups of coefficients that cover these time locations are modified in order to favour retention of those coefficients. Denoising experiments show that, not only does the adaptive method preserve the salient features better than the non-adaptive constraints, but it also delivers significantly better shrinkage over the signal as a whole.

The definition of normative rules for brain features is a crucial step to establish typical and atypical aging trajectories. Objective: To introduce an unsupervised pattern recognition method; to define multivariate normative rules of neuroanatomical measures; and to propose a brain abnormality index. Methods: This study was based on a machine learning approach (one class classification or novelty detection) to neuroanatomical measures (brain regions, volume, and cortical thickness) extracted from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)'s database. We applied nu-One-Class Support Vector Machine (nu-OC-SVM) trained with data from healthy subjects to build an abnormality index, which was compared with subjects diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and AD. Results: The method was able to classify AD subjects as outliers with an accuracy of 84.3% at a false alarm rate of 32.5%. The proposed brain abnormality index was found to be significantly associated with group diagnosis, clinical data, biomarkers, and future conversion to AD. Conclusion: These results suggest that one-class classification may be a promising approach to help in the detection of disease conditions. Our findings support a framework considering the continuum of brain abnormalities from healthy aging to AD, which is correlated with cognitive impairment and biomarkers measurements.

J	Pohjalainen, J; Rasanen, O; Kadioglu, S				Pohjalainen, Jouni; Rasanen, Okko; Kadioglu, Serdar			Feature selection methods and their combinations in high-dimensional classification of speaker likability, intelligibility and personality traits	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Feature selection; Pattern recognition; Machine learning; Computational paralinguistics	EM ALGORITHM; SEARCH; SPEECH	This study focuses on feature selection in paralinguistic analysis and presents recently developed supervised and unsupervised methods for feature subset selection and feature ranking. Using the standard k-nearest-neighbors (kNN) rule as the classification algorithm, the feature selection methods are evaluated individually and in different combinations in seven paralinguistic speaker trait classification tasks. In each analyzed data set, the overall number of features highly exceeds the number of data points available for training and evaluation, making a well-generalizing feature selection process extremely difficult. The performance of feature sets on the feature selection data is observed to be a poor indicator of their performance on unseen data. The studied feature selection methods clearly outperform a standard greedy hill-climbing selection algorithm by being more robust against overfitting. When the selection methods are suitably combined with each other, the performance in the classification task can be further improved. In general, it is shown that the use of automatic feature selection in paralinguistic analysis can be used to reduce the overall number of features to a fraction of the original feature set size while still achieving a comparable or even better performance than baseline support vector machine or random forest classifiers using the full feature set. The most typically selected features for recognition of speaker likability, intelligibility and five personality traits are also reported. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Most early studies were confined to quantifying a few speech features that were easy to compute. More recent studies have adopted a machine learning approach where a large number of potential features are extracted and the models are learned automatically from the data. In the same vein, here we characterize the disease using a relatively large cohort of 168 subjects, collected from multiple (three) clinics. We elicited speech using three tasks the sustained phonation task, the diadochokinetic task and a reading task, all within a time budget of 4 min, prompted by a portable device. From these recordings, we extracted 1582 features for each subject using openSMILE, a standard feature extraction tool. We compared the effectiveness of three strategies for learning a regularized regression and find that ridge regression performs better than lasso and support vector regression for our task. We refine the feature extraction to capture pitch-related cues, including jitter and shimmer, more accurately using a time-varying harmonic model of speech. Our results show that the severity of the disease can be inferred from speech with a mean absolute error of about 5.5, explaining 61% of the variance and consistently well-above chance across all clinics. Of the three speech elicitation tasks, we find that the reading task is significantly better at capturing cues than diadochokinetic or sustained phonation task. In all, we have demonstrated that the data collection and inference can be fully automated, and the results show that speech-based assessment has promising practical application in PD. The techniques reported here are more widely applicable to other paralinguistic tasks in clinical domain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Exploiting uncertainty measures in compounds activity prediction using support vector machines	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						Uncertainty of in vitro tests; Machine learning; Support Vector Machine; Weighting protocol; ChEMBLdb	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY; RECEPTORS; KINASE; ANTAGONISTS; CHEMISTRY; TARGET	The great majority of molecular modeling tasks require the construction of a model that is then used to evaluate new compounds. Although various types of these models exist, at some stage, they all use knowledge about the activity of a given group of compounds, and the performance of the models is dependent on the quality of these data. Biological experiments verifying the activity of chemical compounds are often not reproducible; hence, databases containing these results often possess various activity records for a given molecule. In this study, we developed a method that incorporates the uncertainty of biological tests in machine-learning-based experiments using the Support Vector Machine as a classification model. We show that the developed methodology improves the classification effectiveness in the tested conditions. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Making this capacity available to robots will make it possible to increase the redundancy of the localization systems available in the robots, and improve semantic localization systems. However, to achieve this capacity it is necessary to build a robust visual signature that could be used by a classifier. This paper presents a new approach to extract a global descriptor from an image that can be used as the visual signature for indoor scenarios. This global descriptor was tested using videos acquired from three robots in three different indoor scenarios. This descriptor has shown good accuracy and computational performance when compared to other local and global descriptors.

However, most of these applications require an efficient approach for detect the ocular region, which should be able to work in real time. In this paper, it is proposed and compare two approaches for online eye detection. The proposed schemes, work under real variant illumination conditions, using the conventional appearance method that is known for its discriminative power especially in texture analysis. In the first stage, the salient eye features are automatically extracted by employing Uniform Local Binary pattern (LBP) operator. Thereafter, supervised machine learning methods are used to classify the presence of an eye in image path, which is described by an LBP histogram. For this stage, two approaches were tested; Support Vector Machine and Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network, both are trained for discriminative binary classification, between two classes namely eye / non eye. The human eyes were successfully localized in real time videos, which were obtained from a laptop with uncalibrated web camera. In these tests, different people were considered and light illumination. The experimental results are reported.

Machine learning models for the differential diagnosis of vascular parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease using [I-123]FP-CIT SPECT	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Vascular parkinsonism; Parkinson's disease; [I-123]FP-CIT SPECT; Statistical parametric mapping; Predictive models	DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER SPECT; I-123-FP-CIT SPECT; CLINICAL-DIAGNOSIS; UPDATE	The study's objective was to develop diagnostic predictive models using data from two commonly used [I-123]FP-CIT SPECT assessment methods: region-of-interest (ROI) analysis and whole-brain voxel-based analysis. We included retrospectively 80 patients with vascular parkinsonism (VP) and 164 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who underwent [I-123]FP-CIT SPECT. Nuclear-medicine specialists evaluated the scans and calculated bilateral caudate and putamen [I-123]FP-CIT uptake and asymmetry indices using BRASS software. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to compare the radioligand uptake between the two diseases at the voxel level. Quantitative data from these two methods, together with potential confounding factors for dopamine transporter availability (sex, age, disease duration and severity), were used to build predictive models following a tenfold cross-validation scheme. The performance of logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms for ROI data, and their penalized versions for SPM data (penalized LR, penalized discriminant analysis and SVM), were assessed. Significant differences were found in the ROI analysis after covariate correction between VP and PD patients in [I-123]FP-CIT uptake in the more affected side of the putamen and the ipsilateral caudate. Age, disease duration and severity were also found to be informative in feeding the statistical model. SPM localized significant reductions in [I-123]FP-CIT uptake in PD with respect to VP in two specular clusters comprising areas corresponding to the left and right striatum. The diagnostic predictive accuracy of the LR model using ROI data was 90.3 % and of the SVM model using SPM data was 90.4 %. The predictive models built with ROI data and SPM data from [I-123]FP-CIT SPECT provide great discrimination accuracy between VP and PD. External validation of these methods is necessary to confirm their applicability across centres.	[Huertas-Fernandez, I.; Benitez-Rivero, S.; Jesus, S.; Caceres-Redondo, M. T.; Martin-Rodriguez, J.

For this reason, the development of effective methods to retrieve these pictures is important, but still a challenging task. Recognizing this importance, and to improve the retrieval effectiveness of tag-based event retrieval systems, we propose a new method to extract a set of geographical tag features from raw geo-spatial profiles of user tags. The main idea is to use these features to select the best expansion terms in a machine learning-based query expansion approach. Specifically, we apply rigorous statistical exploratory analysis of spatial point patterns to extract the geo-spatial features. We use the features both to summarize the spatial characteristics of the spatial distribution of a single term, and to determine the similarity between the spatial profiles of two terms - i.e., term-to-term spatial similarity. To further improve our approach, we investigate the effect of combining our geo-spatial features with temporal features on choosing the expansion terms. To evaluate our method, we perform several experiments, including well-known feature analyzes. Such analyzes show how much our proposed geo-spatial features contribute to improve the overall retrieval performance. The results from our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and viability of our method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Many approaches to multi-document summarization have used probability-based methods and machine learning techniques to simultaneously summarize multiple documents sharing a common topic. However, these techniques fail to semantically analyze proper nouns and newly-coined words because most depend on an out-of-date dictionary or thesaurus. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a novel multi-document summarization system called FoDoSu, or Folksonomy-based Multi-Document Summarization, that employs the tag clusters used by Flickr, a Folksonomy system, for detecting key sentences from multiple documents. We first Create a word frequency table for analyzing the semantics and contributions of words using the HITS algorithm. Then, by exploiting tag clusters, we analyze the semantic relationships between words in the word frequency table. Finally, we create a summary of multiple documents by analyzing the importance of each word and its semantic relatedness to others. Experimental results from the TAC 2008 and 2009 data sets demonstrate the improvement of our proposed framework over existing summarization systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This suggests that a data-driven estimation of this function could lead to more statistical power when modeling BOLD fMRI data. However, unconstrained estimation of the HRF can yield highly unstable results when the number of free parameters is large. We develop a method for the joint estimation of activation and HRF by means of a rank constraint, forcing the estimated HRF to be equal across events or experimental conditions, yet permitting it to differ across voxels. Model estimation leads to an optimization problem that we propose to solve with an efficient quasi-Newton method, exploiting fast gradient computations. This model, called GLM with Rank-1 constraint (R1-GLM), can be extended to the setting of GLM with separate designs which has been shown to improve decoding accuracy in brain activity decoding experiments. We compare 10 different HRF modeling methods in terms of encoding and decoding scores on two different datasets. Our results show that the R1-GLM model outperforms competing methods in both encoding and decoding settings, positioning it as an attractive method both from the points of view of accuracy and computational efficiency.

For the effective treatment of AD, it would be important to identify MCI patients at high risk for conversion to AD. In this study, we present a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based method for predicting the MCI-to-AD conversion from one to three years before the clinical diagnosis. First, we developed a novel MRI biomarker of MCI-to-AD conversion using semi-supervised learning and then integrated it with age and cognitive measures about the subjects using a supervised learning algorithm resulting in what we call the aggregate biomarker. The novel characteristics of the methods for learning the biomarkers are as follows: 1) We used a semi-supervised learning method (low density separation) for the construction of MRI biomarker as opposed to more typical supervised methods; 2) We performed a feature selection on MRI data from AD subjects and normal controls without using data from MCI subjects via regularized logistic regression; 3) We removed the aging effects from the MRI data before the classifier training to prevent possible confounding between AD and age related atrophies; and 4) We constructed the aggregate biomarker by first learning a separate MRI biomarker and then combining it with age and cognitive measures about the MCI subjects at the baseline by applying a random forest classifier. We experimentally demonstrated the added value of these novel characteristics in predicting the MCI-to-AD conversion on data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. With the ADNI data, the MRI biomarker achieved a 10-fold cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7661 in discriminating progressive MCI patients (pMCI) from stable MCI patients (sMCI). Our aggregate biomarker based on MRI data together with baseline cognitive measurements and age achieved a 10-fold cross-validated AUC score of 0.9020 in discriminating pMCI from sMCI. The results presented in this study demonstrate the potential of the suggested approach for early AD diagnosis and an important role of MRI in the MCI-to-AD conversion prediction. However, it is evident based on our results that combining MRI data with cognitive test results improved the accuracy of the MCI-to-AD conversion prediction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Learning fuzzy controllers in mobile robotics with embedded preprocessing	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Mobile robotics; Quantified Fuzzy Rules; Iterative Rule Learning; Genetic fuzzy system	WALL-FOLLOWING CONTROL; ALGORITHMS; DESIGN; EXAMPLES; BEHAVIOR; RULES	The automatic design of controllers for mobile robots usually requires two stages. In the first stage, sensorial data are preprocessed or transformed into high level and meaningful values of variables which are usually defined from expert knowledge. In the second stage, a machine learning technique is applied to obtain a controller that maps these high level variables to the control commands that are actually sent to the robot. This paper describes an algorithm that is able to embed the preprocessing stage into the learning stage in order to get controllers directly starting from sensorial raw data with no expert knowledge involved. Due to the high dimensionality of the sensorial data, this approach uses Quantified Fuzzy Rules (QFRs), that are able to transform low-level input variables into high-level input variables, reducing the dimensionality through summarization. The proposed learning algorithm, called Iterative Quantified Fuzzy Rule Learning (IQFRL), is based on genetic programming. IQFRL is able to learn rules with different structures, and can manage linguistic variables with multiple granularities. The algorithm has been tested with the implementation of the wall-following behavior both in several realistic simulated environments with different complexity and on a Pioneer 3-AT robot in two real environments. Results have been compared with several well-known learning algorithms combined with different data preprocessing techniques, showing that IQFRL exhibits a better and statistically significant performance. Moreover, three real world applications for which IQFRL plays a central role are also presented: path and object tracking with static and moving obstacles avoidance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, one of the challenging issues is conformance checking of source code and design, i.e., design patterns. In addition, after developing a system, usually its documents are not maintained, so, identifying design pattern from source code can help to achieve the design of an existing system as a reverse engineering task. The variant implementations (i.e., different source codes) of a design pattern make hard to detect the design pattern instances from the source code. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a new method which aims to map the design pattern detection problem into a learning problem. The proposed design pattern detector is made by learning from the information extracted from design pattern instances which normally include variant implementations. To evaluate the proposed method, we applied it on open source codes to detect six different design patterns. The experimental results show that the proposed method is promising and effective.

These individual metrics fail to reliably detect paraphrasing or semantic equivalence between sentences, due to the subjectivity and complexity of the task, even for human beings. This paper analyzes a set of five simple but weak lexical metrics for measuring textual similarity and presents a novel paraphrase detector with improved accuracy based on abductive machine learning. The objective here is 2-fold. First, the performance of each individual metric is boosted through the abductive learning paradigm. Second, we investigate the use of decision-level and feature-level information fusion via abductive networks to obtain a more reliable composite metric for additional performance enhancement. Several experiments were conducted using two benchmark corpora and the optimal abductive models were compared with other approaches. Results demonstrate that applying abductive learning has significantly improved the results of individual metrics and further improvement was achieved throughfusion. Moreover, building simple models of polynomial functional elements that identify and integrate the smallest subset of relevant metrics yielded better results than those obtained from the support vector machine classifiers utilizing the same datasets and considered metrics. The results were also comparable to the best result reported in the literature even with larger number of more powerful features and/or using more computationally intensive techniques.

Despite its successful application especially in the Bioinformatics, the petroleum industry has not benefited enough from the promises of this machine learning technology. The petroleum industry, with its persistent quest for high-performance predictive models, is in great need of this new learning methodology. A marginal improvement in the prediction indices of petroleum reservoir properties could have huge positive impact on the success of exploration, drilling and the overall reservoir management portfolio. Support vector machines (SVM) is one of the promising machine learning tools that have performed excellently well in most prediction problems. However, its performance is a function of the prudent choice of its tuning parameters most especially the regularization parameter, C. Reports have shown that this parameter has significant impact on the performance of SVM. Understandably, no specific value has been recommended for it. This paper proposes a stacked generalization ensemble model of SVM that incorporates different expert opinions on the optimal values of this parameter in the prediction of porosity and permeability of petroleum reservoirs using datasets from diverse geological formations. The performance of the proposed SVM ensemble was compared to that of conventional SVM technique, another SVM implemented with the bagging method, and Random Forest technique. The results showed that the proposed ensemble model, in most cases, outperformed the others with the highest correlation coefficient, and the lowest mean and absolute errors. The study indicated that there is a great potential for ensemble learning in petroleum reservoir characterization to improve the accuracy of reservoir properties predictions for more successful explorations and increased production of petroleum resources. The results also confirmed that ensemble models perform better than the conventional SVM implementation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TITS-FM: Transductive incremental Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						TS-fuzzy models; Transductive similarity; Graph transduction; Incremental learning; Online learning	INFERENCE SYSTEM; IDENTIFICATION; CONTROLLER; FRAMEWORK	In this paper we present a novel model originating from Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models. It is based on a concept of transductive similarity, where unlike a simple inductive similarity, it considers also local neighborhood of a given element. Transductive property of a local space is used in an inference process, what allows the technique to be used also in incremental settings. Since incremental model construction brings new challenges, we are unable to use the offline transductive approach as some of the previous works did. The key idea of our model is to adjust activation properties of each rule, based on cross-rule similarities. Our method is capable of using the transductive property for any metric. Besides the final model, we also present several improvements to the transductive similarity technique itself, where we alternate the similarity metric in several ways to better exploit the influence of local neighborhood in the final metric. At the end, we demonstrate a superior performance of our technique over the state-of-the-art techniques build on TS fuzzy models on several machine learning datasets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

P3GA: An Algorithm for Technology Characterization	JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN			English	Article							EVOLUTIONARY MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; PARETO-OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS; GENETIC ALGORITHM; NSGA-II; CONCEPT SELECTION; FRONTIER; DESIGN; SURFACE	It is important for engineers to understand the capabilities and limitations of the technologies they consider for use in their systems. However, communicating this information can be a challenge. Mathematical characterizations of technical capabilities are of interest as a means to reduce ambiguity in communication and to increase opportunities to utilize design automation methods. The parameterized Pareto frontier (PPF) was introduced in prior work as a mathematical basis for modeling technical capabilities. One advantage of PPFs is that, in many cases, engineers can model a system by composing frontiers of its components. This allows for rapid technology evaluation and design space exploration. However, finding the PPF can be difficult. The contribution of this article is a new algorithm for approximating the PPF, called predictive parameterized Pareto genetic algorithm (P3GA). The proposed algorithm uses concepts and methods from multi-objective genetic optimization and machine learning to generate a discrete approximation of the PPF. If needed, designers can generate a continuous approximation of the frontier by generalizing beyond these data. The algorithm is explained, its performance is analyzed on numerical test problems, and its use is demonstrated on an engineering example. The results of the investigation indicate that P3GA may be effective in practice.

J	Morvant, E				Morvant, Emilie			Domain adaptation of weighted majority votes via perturbed variation-based self-labeling	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Machine learning; Classification; Domain adaptation; Majority vote; PAC-Bayes		In machine learning, the domain adaptation problem arrives when the test (target) and the train (source) data are generated from different distributions. A key applied issue is thus the design of algorithms able to generalize on a new distribution, for which we have no label information. We focus on learning classification models defined as a weighted majority vote over a set of real-valued functions. In this context, Germain et al. [1] have shown that a measure of disagreement between these functions is crucial to control. The core of this measure is a theoretical bound the C-bound [21 which involves the disagreement and leads to a well performing majority vote learning algorithm in usual non-adaptative supervised setting: MinCq. In this work, we propose a framework to extend MinCq to a domain adaptation scenario. This procedure takes advantage of the recent perturbed variation divergence between distributions proposed by Harel and Mannor [3]. justified by a theoretical bound on the target risk of the vote, we provide to MinCq a target sample labeled thanks to a perturbed variation-based self-labeling focused on the regions where the source and target marginals appear similar. We also study the influence of our self-labeling, from which we deduce an original process for tuning the hyperparameters. Finally, our framework called PV-MinCq shows very promising results on a rotation and translation synthetic problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Park, Y; Cho, KH; Park, J; Cha, SM; Kim, JH				Park, Yongeun; Cho, Kyung Hwa; Park, Jihwan; Cha, Sung Min; Kim, Joon Ha			Development of early-warning protocol for predicting chlorophyll-a concentration using machine learning models in freshwater and estuarine reservoirs, Korea	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Artificial neural network; Support vector machine; Early warning; Chlorophyll-a; Prediction accuracy; Sensitivity analysis	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; COASTAL ALGAL BLOOMS; NUTRIENT LIMITATION; PHYTOPLANKTON GROWTH; FUNCTION APPROXIMATION; NITROGEN LIMITATION; YEONGSAN RESERVOIR; LIMITING NUTRIENT; PHOSPHORUS	Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is a direct indicator used to evaluate the ecological state of a waterbody, such as algal blooms that degrade the water quality in lakes, reservoirs and estuaries. In this study, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to predict Chl-a concentration for the early warning in the Juam Reservoir and Yeongsan Reservoir, which are located in an upstream region (freshwater reservoir) and downstream region (estuarine reservoir), respectively. Weekly water quality data and meteorological data for a 7-year period were used to train and validate both the ANN and SVM models. The Latin-hypercube onefactor-at-a-time (LH-OAT) method and a pattern search algorithm were applied to perform sensitivity analyses for the input variables and to optimize the parameters of the two models, respectively. Results revealed that the two models well-reproduced the temporal variation of Chl-a based on the weekly input variables. In particular, the SVM model showed better performance than the ANN model, displaying a higher prediction accuracy in the validation step. The Williams-Kloot test and sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the SVM model was superior for predicting Chl-a in terms of prediction accuracy and description of the cause-and-effect relationship between Oil-a concentration and environmental variables in both the Juam Reservoir and Yeongsan Reservoir. Furthermore, a 7-day interval was determined as an efficient early warning interval in the two reservoirs. As such, this study suggested an effective early-warning prediction method for Chl-a concentration and improved the eutrophication management scheme for reservoirs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Detection and classification of surface defects of gun barrels using computer vision and machine learning	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Machine vision; Gun barrel defect detection; Classification; Scale space	INSPECTION; SELECTION; SYSTEM	This work proposes a machine vision based approach for the detection and classification of the surface defects such as normal wear, corrosive pitting, rust and erosion that are usually present in used gun barrels. Surface images containing the defective regions of several used gun barrels were captured in a non-destructive manner using a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera attached with a miniature microscopic probe. Among the captured images, normal wear appeared as bright and the rest of the three defects appeared as dark. Therefore, the classification has been carried out in two stages. Various segmentation methods were tested and extended maxima transform gave the best result. The defective area was calculated in metric units. Multiple textural features based on histogram and gray level co-occurrence matrix were extracted from the segmented images and ranked them automatically using the sequential forward feature selection method in order to select the best minimal features for the classification purpose. Many classifiers based on Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor, Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were tested and the results demonstrated the efficacy of SVM for this application. All these steps were carried out at six different scales of image sizes and the best scale was selected for the entire analysis based on the segmentation and classification accuracy. The introduction of this Gaussian scale spacing concept could reduce the computation without compromising on the accuracy. Overall, the methodology forms a novel framework for surface defect detection and classification that has a potential to automate the inspection process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Even now, multidrug-resistant bacterial infections annually result in millions of hospital days, billions in healthcare costs, and, most importantly, tens of thousands of lives lost. As many pharmaceutical companies have abandoned antibiotic development in search of more lucrative therapeutics, academic researchers are uniquely positioned to fill the pipeline. Traditional high-throughput screens and lead-optimization efforts are expensive and labor intensive. Computer-aided drug-discovery techniques, which are cheaper and faster, can accelerate the identification of novel antibiotics, leading to improved hit rates and faster transitions to preclinical and clinical testing. The current review describes two machine-learning techniques, neural networks and decision trees, that have been used to identify experimentally validated antibiotics. We conclude by describing the future directions of this exciting field.

The analysis is composed of three parts. Firstly, Latin hypercube sampling is adopted to generate samples for constructing the response surface. Then, based on the samples, Gaussian process regression, which is a popular machine learning technique for nonlinear system modeling, is used for establishing the response surface to approximate the limit state function. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation is performed via the GPR response surface to estimate the system failure probability of slopes. Five case examples were examined to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Computer simulation results show that the proposed system reliability analysis method can accurately give the system failure probability with a relatively small number of deterministic slope stability analyses.

J	Parvin, H; MirnabiBaboli, M; Alinejad-Rokny, H				Parvin, Hamid; MirnabiBaboli, Miresmaeil; Alinejad-Rokny, Hamid			Proposing a classifier ensemble framework based on classifier selection and decision tree	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Decision tree; Classifier ensembles; Clustering; Bagging; Learning; Ada Boosting		One of the most important tasks in pattern, machine learning, and data mining is classification problem. Introducing a general classifier is a challenge for pattern recognition communities, which enables one to learn each problem's dataset. Many classifiers have been proposed to learn any problem thus far. However, many of them have their own positive and negative aspects. So they are good only for specific problems. But there is no strong solution to recognize which classifier is better or good for a specific problem. Fortunately, ensemble learning provides a good way to have a near-optimal classifying system for any problem. One of the most challenging problems in classifier ensemble is introducing a suitable ensemble of base classifiers. Every ensemble needs diversity. It means that if a group of classifiers is to be a successful ensemble, they must be diverse enough to cover their errors. Therefore, during ensemble creation, a mechanism is needed to ensure that the ensemble classifiers are diverse. Sometimes this mechanism can select/remove a subset of base classifiers with respect to maintaining the diversity of the ensemble. This paper proposes a novel method, named the Classifier Selection Based on Clustering (CSBS), for ensemble creation. To insure diversity in ensemble classifiers, this method uses the clustering of classifiers technique. Bagging is used to produce base classifiers. During ensemble creation, every type of base classifier is the same as a decision tree classier or a multilayer perceptron classifier. After producing a number of base classifiers, CSBC partitions them by using a clustering algorithm. Then CSBC produces a final ensemble by selecting one classifier from each cluster. Weighted majority vote method is used as an aggregator function. In this paper we investigate the influence of cluster number on the performance of the CSBC method; we also probe how we can select a good approximate value for cluster number in any dataset. We base our study on a large number of real datasets of UCI repository to reach a definite result. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Soares, SG; Araujo, R				Soares, Symone Gomes; Araujo, Rui			An on-line weighted ensemble of regressor models to handle concept drifts	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Concept drift; Ensemble learning; Learning in changing environments; Regression; Ensemble pruning strategies	NEURAL-NETWORK; PREDICTION; ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; MIXTURE; SYSTEM; SENSOR	Many estimation, prediction, and learning applications have a dynamic nature. One of the most important challenges in machine learning is dealing with concept changes. Underlying changes may make the model designed on old data, inconsistent with new data. Also, algorithms usually specialize in one type of change. Other challenge is reusing previously acquired information in scenarios where changes may recur. This strategy improves the learning accuracy and reduces the processing time. Unfortunately, most existing learning algorithms to deal with changes are adapted on a batch basis. This process usually requires a long time, and such data may not reflect the current state of the system. However, even the system is adapted on a sample basis, existing algorithms may adapt slowly to changes and cannot conciliate old and new information. This paper proposes an On-line Weighted Ensemble (OWE) of regressor models which is able to learn incrementally sample by sample in the presence of several types of changes and simultaneously retain old information in recurring scenarios. The key idea is to keep a moving window that slides when a new sample is available. The error of each model on the current window is determined using a boosting strategy that assigns small errors to the models that predict accurately the samples predicted poorly by the ensemble. To handle recurring and non-recurring changes, OWE uses a new assignment of models' weights that takes into account the models' errors on the past and current windows using a discounting factor that decreases or increases the contribution of old windows. In addition, OWE launches new models if the system's accuracy is decreasing, and it can exclude inaccurate models over time. Experiments with artificial and industrial data reveal that in most cases OWE outperforms other state-of-the-art concept drift approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

RACOG and wRACOG: Two Probabilistic Oversampling Techniques	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Imbalanced class distribution; probabilistic oversampling; approximating joint probability distribution; Gibbs sampling	IMBALANCED DATA SETS; INTELLIGENCE; SMOTE	As machine learning techniques mature and are used to tackle complex scientific problems, challenges arise such as the imbalanced class distribution problem, where one of the target class labels is under-represented in comparison with other classes. Existing oversampling approaches for addressing this problem typically do not consider the probability distribution of the minority class while synthetically generating new samples. As a result, the minority class is not represented well which leads to high misclassification error. We introduce two probabilistic oversampling approaches, namely RACOG and wRACOG, to synthetically generating and strategically selecting new minority class samples. The proposed approaches use the joint probability distribution of data attributes and Gibbs sampling to generate new minority class samples. While RACOG selects samples produced by the Gibbs sampler based on a predefined lag, wRACOG selects those samples that have the highest probability of being misclassified by the existing learning model. We validate our approach using nine UCI data sets that were carefully modified to exhibit class imbalance and one new application domain data set with inherent extreme class imbalance. In addition, we compare the classification performance of the proposed methods with three other existing resampling techniques.

J	Rizoiu, MA; Velcin, J; Lallich, S				Rizoiu, Marian-Andrei; Velcin, Julien; Lallich, Stephane			Semantic-enriched visual vocabulary construction in a weakly supervised context	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Bag-of-features representation; visual vocabulary construction; visual features filtering; semantic-enriched representation; image numerical representation; semi-supervised learning	IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES; SCALE; REPRESENTATION; TEXTURE; CATEGORIZATION; LOCATION; OBJECTS; SCENES	One of the prevalent learning tasks involving images is content-based image classification. This is a difficult task especially because the low-level features used to digitally describe images usually capture little information about the semantics of the images. In this paper, we tackle this difficulty by enriching the semantic content of the image representation by using external knowledge. The underlying hypothesis of our work is that creating a more semantically rich representation for images would yield higher machine learning performances, without the need to modify the learning algorithms themselves. The external semantic information is presented under the form of non-positional image labels, therefore positioning our work in a weakly supervised context. Two approaches are proposed: the first one leverages the labels into the visual vocabulary construction algorithm, the result being dedicated visual vocabularies. The second approach adds a filtering phase as a pre-processing of the vocabulary construction. Known positive and known negative sets are constructed and features that are unlikely to be associated with the objects denoted by the labels are filtered. We apply our proposition to the task of content-based image classification and we show that semantically enriching the image representation yields higher classification performances than the baseline representation.

Citations alone were enough to predict favorable conclusions in reviews of neuraminidase inhibitors	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Neuraminidase inhibitors; Bibliometrics; Evidence synthesis; Reviews as a topic; Citation analysis; Supervised machine learning	NETWORK ANALYSIS SEBRINA; STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT; SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS; INFLUENZA; OSELTAMIVIR; BIAS; CLASSIFICATION; METAANALYSIS; SELECTION; ADULTS	Objectives: To examine the use of supervised machine learning to identify biases in evidence selection and determine if citation information can predict favorable conclusions in reviews about neuraminidase inhibitors. Study Design and Setting: Reviews of neuraminidase inhibitors published during January 2005 to May 2013 were identified by searching PubMed. In a blinded evaluation, the reviews were classified as favorable if investigators agreed that they supported the use of neuraminidase inhibitors for prophylaxis or treatment of influenza. Reference lists were used to identify all unique citations to primary articles. Three classification methods were tested for their ability to predict favorable conclusions using only citation information. Results: Citations to 4,574 articles were identified in 152 reviews of neuraminidase inhibitors, and 93 (61%) of these reviews were graded as favorable. Primary articles describing drug resistance were among the citations that were underrepresented in favorable reviews. The most accurate classifier predicted favorable conclusions with 96.2% accuracy, using citations to only 24 of 4,574 articles. Conclusion: Favorable conclusions in reviews about neuraminidase inhibitors can be predicted using only information about the articles they cite. The approach highlights how evidence exclusion shapes conclusions in reviews and provides a method to evaluate citation practices in a corpus of reviews. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Such information directly supports control decision-making and if automated, can significantly impact management of a project. This paper presents a new automated approach for recognition of physical progress based on two emerging sources of information: (1) unordered daily construction photo collections, which are currently collected at almost no cost on all construction sites; and (2) building information models (BIMs), which are increasingly turning into binding components of architecture/engineering/construction contracts. First, given a set of unordered and uncalibrated site photographs, an approach based on structure-from-motion, multiview stereo, and voxel coloring and labeling algorithms is presented that calibrates cameras, photorealistically reconstructs a dense as-built point cloud model in four dimensions (three dimensions + time), and traverses and labels the scene for occupancy. This strategy explicitly accounts for occlusions and allows input images to be taken far apart and widely distributed around the environment. An Industry Foundation Class-based (IFC-based) BIM is subsequently fused into the as-built scene by a robust registration step and is traversed and labeled for expected progress visibility. Next, a machine-learning scheme built upon a Bayesian probabilistic model is proposed that automatically detects physical progress in the presence of occlusions and demonstrates that physical progress monitoring at schedule activity level could be fully automated. Finally, the system enables the expected and reconstructed elements to be explored with an interactive, image-based, three-dimensional (3D) viewer where deviations are automatically color-coded over the IFC-based BIM. To that extent, the underlying hypotheses and algorithms for generating integrated four-dimensional (4D) as-built and as-planned models plus automated progress monitoring are presented. Experimental results are reported for challenging image data sets collected under different lighting conditions and severe occlusions from two ongoing building construction projects. This marks the presented model as being the first probabilistic model for automated progress tracking and visualization of deviations that incorporates both as-planned models and unordered daily photographs in a principled way.

Short communication: Use of genomic and metabolic information as well as milk performance records for prediction of subclinical ketosis risk via artificial neural networks	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						artificial neural network; prediction; ketosis; milk metabolite	TRANSFORM INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; LACTATION DAIRY-COWS; ENERGY-BALANCE; BETA-HYDROXYBUTYRATE; TRANSITION PERIOD; CATTLE; HEALTH; HYPERKETONEMIA; PREVALENCE; TRAITS	Subclinical ketosis is one of the most prevalent metabolic disorders in high-producing dairy cows during early lactation. This renders its early detection and prevention important for both economical and animal-welfare reasons. Construction of reliable predictive models is challenging, because traits like ketosis are commonly affected by multiple factors. In this context, machine learning methods offer great advantages because of their universal learning ability and flexibility in integrating various sorts of data. Here, an artificial-neural-network approach was applied to investigate the utility of metabolic, genetic, and milk performance data for the prediction of milk levels of P-hydroxybutyrate within and across consecutive weeks postpartum. Data were collected from 218 dairy cows during their first 5 wk in milk. All animals were genotyped with a 50,000 SNP panel, and weekly information on the concentrations of the milk metabolites glycerophosphocholine and phosphocholine as well as milk composition data (milk yield, fat and protein percentage) was available. The concentration of p-hydroxybutyric acid in milk was used as target variable in all prediction models. Average correlations between observed and predicted target values up to 0.643 could be obtained, if milk metabolite and routine milk recording data were combined for prediction at the same day within weeks. Predictive performance of metabolic as well as milk performance based models was higher than that of models based on genetic information.

This work, and a suite of papers that followed using similar models, helped integrate network thinking into biology and motivate research focused on the evolution of genetic networks. The Wagner network has its mathematical roots in the Ising model, a statistical physics model describing the activity of atoms on a lattice, and in neural networks. These models have given rise to two branches of applications, one in physics and biology and one in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Here, we review development along these branches, outline similarities and differences between biological models of genetic regulatory circuits and neural circuits models used in machine learning, and identify ways in which these models can provide novel insights into biological systems.

J	Lee, Y; Wang, R				Lee, Yoonkyung; Wang, Rui			Does modeling lead to more accurate classification?: A study of relative efficiency in linear classification	JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Boosting; Classification; Efficiency; Error rate; LDA; Logistic regression; Mislabeling; Robustness; SVM	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; ASYMPTOTICS; CONSISTENCY; ESTIMATORS	Classification arises in a wide range of applications. A variety of statistical tools have been developed for learning classification rules from data. Understanding of their relative merits and comparisons help users to choose a proper method in practice. This paper focuses on theoretical comparison of model-based classification methods in statistics with algorithmic methods in machine learning in terms of the error rate. Extending Efron's comparison of logistic regression with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) under the normal setting, we contrast such algorithmic methods as the support vector machine (SVM) and boosting with the LDA and logistic regression and study their relative efficiencies in reducing the error rate based on the limiting behavior of the classification boundary of each method. We show that algorithmic methods are generally less effective than model-based methods in the normal setting. In particular, loss of efficiency in error rate is typically about 33% to 60% for the SVM and 50% to 80% for boosting when compared to the LDA. However, a smooth variant of the SVM is shown to be even more efficient than logistic regression. In addition to the theoretical study, we present results from numerical experiment S under various settings for comparisons of finite-sample performance and robustness to mislabeling and model misspecification.

For this task, the nearest-neighbor-based scheme works in two phases: first, it finds the most similar neighbors of a new image from the set of labeled images; then, it propagates the keywords associated with the neighbors to the new image. In this article, we propose a novel approach for image annotation, which simultaneously improves both phases of the nearest-neighbor-based scheme. In the phase of neighbor search, different from existing work discovering the nearest neighbors with the predicted distance, we introduce a ranking-oriented neighbor search mechanism (RNSM), where the ordering of labeled images is optimized directly without going through the intermediate step of distance prediction. In the phase of keyword propagation, different from existing work using simple heuristic rules to select the propagated keywords, we present a learning-based keyword propagation strategy (LKPS), where a scoring function is learned to evaluate the relevance of keywords based on their multiple relations with the nearest neighbors. Extensive experiments on the Corel 5K data set and the MIR Flickr data set demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring are two important issues in financial distress prediction where various statistical and machine learning techniques have been employed to develop financial prediction models. Since there are no generally agreed upon financial ratios as input features for model development, many studies consider feature selection as a pre-processing step in data mining before constructing the models. However, most works only focused on applying specific feature selection methods over either bankruptcy prediction or credit scoring problem domains. In this work, a comprehensive study is conducted to examine the effect of performing filter and wrapper based feature selection methods on financial distress prediction. In addition, the effect of feature selection on the prediction models obtained using various classification techniques is also investigated. In the experiments, two bankruptcy and two credit datasets are used. In addition, three filter and two wrapper based feature selection methods combined with six different prediction models are studied. Our experimental results show that there is no the best combination of the feature selection method and the classification technique over the four datasets. Moreover, depending on the chosen techniques, performing feature selection does not always improve the prediction performance. However, on average performing the genetic algorithm and logistic regression for feature selection can provide prediction improvements over the credit and bankruptcy datasets respectively.

Novel methods are proposed for enhanced accurate classification. All the computations are performed considering steep error tolerance rate with statistical significance level of 5% as well as 1% and established the results with corrected t-tests. The kernel density estimator has been implemented to distinguish the affected patients against healthy ones. A new ensemble consisting of Bayesian network optimized by Tabu search algorithm as a classifier and Haar wavelets as the projection filter is used for relevant feature selection and attribute's ranking. The performance analysis of each method along with major findings is discussed using various evaluation metrics and concludes with propitious results. The results are compared to the existing SINPATCO platform that uses MLP, GRNN, and SVM. The optimization of machine learning algorithms is obtained using Design of Experiments scheme to achieve superior prediction accuracy. The highest classification accuracy obtained is 96.55% with sensitivity, specificity of 0.966 and 0.987 respectively. The objective is to enhance the software reliability and quality of spine disorder diagnosis using medical diagnostic system and reinforce the viability of precise treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To analyze the capability of artificial neural network (ANN) techniques to improve the diagnostic precision. Methods: MS patients and controls were enrolled (n = 217). OCT was used to determine the 768 retinal nerve fiber layer thicknesses. Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated to test the ability of OCT to discriminate between MS and healthy eyes, and between MS with and without antecedent ON using ANN. Results: Using ANN technique multilayer perceptrons, OCT could detect MS with a sensitivity of 89.3%, a specificity of 87.6%, and a diagnostic precision of 88.5%. Compared with the OCT-provided parameters, the ANN had a better sensitivity-specificity balance. Conclusions: ANN technique improves the capability of Spectralis OCT to detect MS disease and to distinguish MS eyes with or without antecedent ON.

However, the number of possible combinations increases exponentially with the increase of the number of fungicides combined and their concentrations. It is thus extremely challenging to identify effective fungicide combinations by trial and error from all possible combinations. In this paper, a systematic approach based on a support vector machine, a machine learning algorithm, is proposed to searching for the optimal combinations using only a limited number of measurements. The constructed model also incorporates information related to the inhibition rate (IR) and the cost of each composing fungicide into the optimization process. With this method, we show that only around 130 measurements on a coarse grid of concentrations out of thousands of possible experiments are sufficient to reconstruct the response model and to obtain the optimal fungicide combinations. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized combinations can achieve an IR greater than 90%, while the required concentrations and the cost of individual fungicides are dramatically reduced. We anticipate that this method should be equally effective in the search for optimal combinations of multiple compounds in other diseases.

Stochastic Abstract Policies: Generalizing Knowledge to Improve Reinforcement Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Knowledge transfer; machine learning		Reinforcement learning (RL) enables an agent to learn behavior by acquiring experience through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. However, knowledge is usually built from scratch and learning to behave may take a long time. Here, we improve the learning performance by leveraging prior knowledge; that is, the learner shows proper behavior from the beginning of a target task, using the knowledge from a set of known, previously solved, source tasks. In this paper, we argue that building stochastic abstract policies that generalize over past experiences is an effective way to provide such improvement and this generalization outperforms the current practice of using a library of policies. We achieve that contributing with a new algorithm, AbsProb-PI-multiple and a framework for transferring knowledge represented as a stochastic abstract policy in new RL tasks. Stochastic abstract policies offer an effective way to encode knowledge because the abstraction they provide not only generalizes solutions but also facilitates extracting the similarities among tasks. We perform experiments in a robotic navigation environment and analyze the agent's behavior throughout the learning process and also assess the transfer ratio for different amounts of source tasks. We compare our method with the transfer of a library of policies, and experiments show that the use of a generalized policy produces better results by more effectively guiding the agent when learning a target task.

This paper introduces an innovative approach to perform laser welding process monitoring and welded defect diagnosis. The laboratory-scale sensor can be replaced with industrial-scale sensors after the data-driven model has been established by applying multivariate statistics and machine learning methods. In addition, industrial-scale sensor makes effective diagnosis of welded defect by using pattern recognition. Experimental results show that the feature vector affecting estimation and classification accuracy can be obtained by using wavelet packet decomposition principal component analysis. Image processing technology was applied to quantify geometrical parameters of welding process. The feedforward neural network prediction model and the support vector machine classification model built in this research help to guarantee accurate estimation on welding status and effective identification of welded defect. The method proposed by this paper provides an innovative data-driven-based approach for laser welding process monitoring and defects diagnosis.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the main type of liver cancer. We applied a machine learning approach with maximum-relevance-minimum-redundancy (mRMR) algorithm followed by incremental feature selection (IFS) to a set of microarray data generated from 43 tumor and 52 nontumor samples. With the machine learning approach, we identified 117 gene probes that could optimally separate tumor and nontumor samples. These genes not only include known HCC-relevant genes such as MT1X, BMI1, and CAP2, but also include cancer genes that were not found previously to be closely related to HCC, such as TACSTD2. Then, we constructed a molecular interaction network based on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) data from the STRING database and identified 187 genes on the shortest paths among the genes identified with the machine learning approach. Network analysis reveals new potential roles of ubiquitin C in the pathogenesis of HCC. Based on gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, we showed that the identified subnetwork is significantly enriched in biological processes related to cell death. These results bring new insights of understanding the process of HCC.

The primary cause of the disease has known to be human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1). Recently, peptides are shown to have high potency as drugs in the treatment of AIDS. Therefore, in the present study, we have developed a method to predict anti-HIV-1 peptides using support vector machine (SVM) as a powerful machine learning algorithm. Peptide descriptors were represented based on the concept of Chou's pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAAC). HIV-1 P24-derived peptides were examined to predict anti-HIV-1 activity among them. The efficacy of the prediction was then validated in vitro. The mutagenic effect of validated anti-HIV-1 peptides was further investigated by the Ames test. Computational classification using SVM showed the accuracy and sensitivity of 96.76% and 98.1%, respectively. Based on SVM classification algorithm, 3 out of 22 P24-derived peptides were predicted to be anti-HIV-1, while the rest were estimated to be inactive. HIV-1 replication was inhibited by the three predicted anti-HIV-1 peptides as revealed in vitro, while the results of the same test on two of non-anti-HIV-1 peptides showed complete inactivity. The three anti-HIV-1 peptides were shown to be not mutagenic because of the Ames test results. These data suggest that the proposed computational method is highly efficient for predicting the anti-HIV-1 activity of any unknown peptide having only its amino acid sequence. Moreover, further experimental studies can be performed on the mentioned peptides, which may lead to new anti-HIV-1 peptide therapeutics candidates.

Gene expression profiling (GEP) classifies DLBCL into activated B-cell like (ABC), germinal center B-cell like (GCB), and Type-III subtypes, with ABC-DLBCL characterized by a poor prognosis and constitutive NF-kappa B activation. A major challenge for the application of this cell of origin (COO) classification in routine clinical practice is to establish a robust clinical assay amenable to routine formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) diagnostic biopsies. In this study, we investigated the possibility of COO-classification using FFPE tissue RNA samples by massive parallel quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). We established a protocol for parallel qRT-PCR using FFPE RNA samples with the Fluidigm BioMark HD system, and quantified the expression of the COO classifier genes and the NF-kappa B targeted-genes that characterize ABC-DLBCL in 143 cases of DLBCL. We also trained and validated a series of basic machine-learning classifiers and their derived meta classifiers, and identified SimpleLogistic as the top classifier that gave excellent performance across various GEP data sets derived from fresh-frozen or FFPE tissues by different microarray platforms. Finally, we applied SimpleLogistic to our data set generated by qRT-PCR, and the ABC and GCB-DLBCL assigned showed the respective characteristics in their clinical outcome and NF-kappa B target gene expression. The methodology established in this study provides a robust approach for DLBCL sub-classification using routine FFPE diagnostic biopsies in a routine clinical setting.

We propose an NLP approach that undertakes pre-processing, tokenisation and POS tagging of texts to then obtain the syntactic structure of sentences by means of a dependency parser. This structure is then used to address three of the most significant linguistic constructions for the purpose in question: intensification, subordinate adversative clauses and negation. We also propose a semi-automatic domain adaptation method to improve the accuracy of our system in specific application domains, by enriching semantic dictionaries using machine learning methods in order to adapt the semantic orientation of their words to a particular field. Experimental results are promising in both general and specific domains.

Contour Connection Method for automated identification and classification of landslide deposits	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Landslides; Lidar; Detection; Automation; Algorithm	LIDAR DATA; SUSCEPTIBILITY; WASHINGTON; AIRBORNE; FOREST	Landslides are a common hazard worldwide that result in major economic, environmental and social impacts. Despite their devastating effects, inventorying existing landslides, often the regions at highest risk of reoccurrence, is challenging, time-consuming, and expensive. Current landslide mapping techniques include field inventorying, photogrammetric approaches, and use of bare-earth (BE) lidar digital terrain models (DTMs) to highlight regions of instability. However, many techniques do not have sufficient resolution, detail, and accuracy for mapping across landscape scale with the exception of using BE DTMs, which can reveal the landscape beneath vegetation and other obstructions, highlighting landslide features, including scarps, deposits, fans and more. Current approaches to landslide inventorying with lidar to create BE DTMs include manual digitizing, statistical or machine learning approaches, and use of alternate sensors (e.g., hyperspectral imaging) with lidar. This paper outlines a novel algorithm to automatically and consistently detect landslide deposits on a landscape scale. The proposed method is named as the Contour Connection Method (CCM) and is primarily based on bare earth lidar data requiring minimal user input such as the landslide scarp and deposit gradients. The CCM algorithm functions by applying contours and nodes to a map, and using vectors connecting the nodes to evaluate gradient and associated landslide features based on the user defined input criteria. Furthermore, in addition to the detection capabilities, CCM also provides an opportunity to be potentially used to classify different landscape features. This is possible because each landslide feature has a distinct set of metadata - specifically, density of connection vectors on each contour - that provides a unique signature for each landslide. In this paper, demonstrations of using CCM are presented by applying the algorithm to the region surrounding the Oso landslide in Washington (March 2014), as well as two 14,000 ha DTMs in Oregon, which were used as a comparison of CCM and manually delineated landslide deposits. The results show the capability of the CCM with limited data requirements and the agreement with manual delineation but achieving the results at a much faster time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Random forest predictive modeling of mineral prospectivity with small number of prospects and data with missing values in Abra (Philippines)	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Data-driven modeling; Ensemble of regression trees; Porphyry copper; GIS	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATION; GEOLOGICAL DATA; EXPLORATION; INTEGRATION; DISTRICT; DEPOSITS; PROVINCE; INFORMATION	Machine learning methods that have been used in data-driven predictive modeling of mineral prospectivity (e.g., artificial neural networks) invariably require large number of training prospect/locations and are unable to handle missing values in certain evidential data. The Random Forests (RF) algorithm, which is a machine learning method, has recently been applied to data-driven predictive mapping of mineral prospectivity, and so it is instructive to further study its efficacy in this particular field. This case study, carried out using data from Abra (Philippines), examines (a) if RF modeling can be used for data-driven modeling of mineral prospectivity in areas with a few (i.e., <20) mineral occurrences and (b) if RF modeling can handle evidential data with missing values. We found that RF modeling outperforms weights-of-evidence (WofE) modeling of porphyry-Cu prospectivity in the Abra area, where 12 porphyry-Cu prospects are known to exist. Moreover, just like WofE modeling, RF modeling allows analysis of the spatial associations of known prospects with individual layers of evidential data. Furthermore, RF modeling can handle missing values in evidential data through an RF-based imputation technique whereas in WofE modeling values are simply represented by zero weights. Therefore, the RF algorithm is potentially more useful than existing methods that are currently used for data-driven predictive mapping of mineral prospectivity. In particular, it is not a purely black-box method like artificial neural networks in the context of data-driven predictive modeling of mineral prospectivity. However, further testing of the method in other areas with a few mineral occurrences is needed to fully investigate its usefulness in data-driven predictive modeling of mineral prospectivity.

The characterization of dynamic changes in hemodynamic and metabolic variables is implicit in physiologic signatures. When primary variables are collected with high enough frequency to derive new variables, this data hierarchy can be used to develop physiologic signatures. The creation of physiologic signatures requires no new information; additional knowledge is extracted from data that already exist. It is possible to create physiologic signatures for each stage in the process of clinical decompensation and recovery to improve outcomes.

In this paper, we investigate constructing of RFs with a small size of labeled data and find that the performance bottleneck is located in the node splitting procedures; hence, existing solutions fail to properly partition the feature space if there are insufficient training data. To achieve robust node splitting with insufficient data, we present semisupervised splitting to overcome this limitation by splitting nodes with the guidance of both labeled and abundant unlabeled data. In particular, an accurate quality measure of node splitting is obtained by carrying out the kernel-based density estimation, whereby a multiclass version of asymptotic mean integrated squared error criterion is proposed to adaptively select the optimal bandwidth of the kernel. To avoid the curse of dimensionality, we project the data points from the original high-dimensional feature space onto a low-dimensional subspace before estimation. A unified optimization framework is proposed to select a coupled pair of subspace and separating hyperplane such that the smoothness of the subspace and the quality of the splitting are guaranteed simultaneously. Our algorithm efficiently avoids overfitting caused by bad initialization and local maxima when compared with conventional margin maximization-based semisupervised methods.

In particular, with respect to the authors, the anonymity requirement is heavily disputed and pros and cons are discussed exclusively on a qualitative level. In this paper, we contribute a quantitative argument to this discussion by showing that it is possible for a machine to reveal the identity of authors of scientific publications with high accuracy. We attack the anonymity of authors using statistical analysis of multiple heterogeneous aspects of a paper, such as its citations, its writing style, and its content. We apply several multilabel, multiclass machine learning methods to model the patterns exhibited in each feature category for individual authors and combine them to a single ensemble classifier to deanonymize authors with high accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that exploits multiple categories of discriminative features and uses multiple, partially complementing classifiers in a single, focused attack on the anonymity of the authors of an academic publication. We evaluate our author identification framework, deAnon, based on a real-world data set of 3894 papers. From these papers, we target 1405 productive authors that each have at least three publications in our data set. Our approach returns a ranking of probable authors for anonymous papers, an ordering for guessing the authors of a paper. In our experiments, following this ranking, the first guess corresponds to one of the authors of a paper in 39.7% of the cases, and at least one of the authors is among the top 10 guesses in 65.6% of all cases. Thus, deAnon significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques for automatic deanonymization.

As there is no direct view or access to the affected anatomy, advanced imaging techniques such as 3D C-arm computed tomography (CT) and C-arm fluoroscopy are routinely used in clinical practice for intraoperative guidance. However, due to constraints regarding acquisition time and device configuration, intraoperative modalities have limited soft tissue image quality and reliable assessment of the cardiac anatomy typically requires contrast agent, which is harmful to the patient and requires complex acquisition protocols. We propose a probabilistic sparse matching approach to fuse high-quality preoperative CT images and nongated, noncontrast intraoperative C-arm CT images by utilizing robust machine learning and numerical optimization techniques. Thus, high-quality patient-specific models can be extracted from the preoperative CT and mapped to the intraoperative imaging environment to guide minimally invasive procedures. Extensive quantitative experiments on 95 clinical datasets demonstrate that our model-based fusion approach has an average execution time of 1.56 s, while the accuracy of 5.48 mm between the anchor anatomy in both images lies within expert user confidence intervals. In direct comparison with image-to-image registration based on an open-source state-of-the-art medical imaging library and a recently proposed quasi-global, knowledge-driven multi-modal fusion approach for thoracic-abdominal images, our model-based method exhibits superior performance in terms of registration accuracy and robustness with respect to both target anatomy and anchor anatomy alignment errors.

Prior information can be used to improve image quality. Inspired by the kernel methods in machine learning, this paper proposes a kernel based method that models PET image intensity in each pixel as a function of a set of features obtained from prior information. The kernel-based image model is incorporated into the forward model of PET projection data and the coefficients can be readily estimated by the maximum likelihood (ML) or penalized likelihood image reconstruction. A kernelized expectation-maximization algorithm is presented to obtain the ML estimate. Computer simulations show that the proposed approach can achieve better bias versus variance trade-off and higher contrast recovery for dynamic PET image reconstruction than the conventional maximum likelihood method with and without post-reconstruction denoising. Compared with other regularization-based methods, the kernel method is easier to implement and provides better image quality for low-count data. Application of the proposed kernelmethod to a 4-D dynamic PET patient dataset showed promising results.

Existing approaches learn from multi-label data by manipulating with identical feature set, i.e. the very instance representation of each example is employed in the discrimination processes of all class labels. However, this popular strategy might be suboptimal as each label is supposed to possess specific characteristics of its own. In this paper, another strategy to learn from multi-label data is studied, where label-specific features are exploited to benefit the discrimination of different class labels. Accordingly, an intuitive yet effective algorithm named LIFT, i.e. multi-label learning with Label specIfic FeaTures, is proposed. LIFT firstly constructs features specific to each label by conducting clustering analysis on its positive and negative instances, and then performs training and testing by querying the clustering results. Comprehensive experiments on a total of 17 benchmark data sets clearly validate the superiority of LIFT against other well-established multi-label learning algorithms as well as the effectiveness of label-specific features.

A person with MCI has an increased risk of developing AD or another dementia. Thus, it is of medical interest to develop predictive tools to assess this risk. A growing awareness exists that pro-oxidative state and neuro-inflammation are both involved in AD. However, the extent of this relationship is still a matter of debate. Due to the expected non-linear correlations between oxidative and inflammatory markers, traditional statistics is unsuitable to dissect their relationship with the disease. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by central nervous system networks, capable of machine learning and pattern recognition. The aim of this work was to disclose the relationship between immunological and oxidative stress markers in AD and MCI by the application of ANNs. Through a machine learning approach, we were able to construct an algorithm to classify MCI and AD with high accuracy. Such an instrument, requiring a small amount of immunological and oxidative-stress parameters, would be useful in the clinical practice. Moreover, applying an innovative non-linear mathematical technique, a global immune deficit was shown to be associated with cognitive impairment. Surprisingly, both adaptive and innate immunity were peripherally defective in AD and MCI patients. From this study, new pathogenetic aspects of these diseases could emerge.

Machine-learning generates predictive information that can be used for single subject classification. We applied Gaussian process classifiers to a sample of patients with specific phobia as a model disorder for pathological forms of anxiety to test for classification based on structural MRI data. Gray (GM) and white matter (WM) volumetric data were analyzed in 33 snake phobics (SP; animal subtype), 26 dental phobics (DP; blood-injection-injury subtype) and 37 healthy controls (HC). Results showed good accuracy rates for GM and WM data in predicting phobia subtypes (GM: 62 % phobics vs. HC, 86 % DP vs. HC, 89 % SP vs. HC, 89 % DP vs. SP; WM: 88 % phobics vs. HC, 89 % DP vs. HC, 79 % SP vs. HC, 79 % DP vs. HC). Regarding GM, classification improved when considering the subtype compared to overall phobia status. The discriminatory brain pattern was not solely based on fear circuitry structures but included widespread cortico-subcortical networks. Results demonstrate that multivariate pattern recognition represents a promising approach for the development of neuroimaging-based diagnostic markers that could support clinical decisions. Regarding the increasing number of fMRI studies on anxiety disorders, researchers are encouraged to use functional and structural data not only for studying phenotype characteristics on a group level, but also to evaluate their incremental value for diagnostic or prognostic purposes.

They are difficult to detect on non-contrast CTC images due to low image contrast with surrounding objects. In this paper, we developed a novel computer-aided diagnosis system to detect a subset of renal lesions, exophytic lesions, by (1) exploiting efficient belief propagation to segment kidneys, (2) establishing an intrinsic manifold diffusion on kidney surface, (3) searching for potential lesion-caused protrusions with local maximum diffusion response, and (4) exploring novel shape descriptors, including multi-scale diffusion response, with machine learning to classify exophytic renal lesions. Experimental results on the validation dataset with 167 patients revealed that manifold diffusion significantly outperformed conventional shape features (p < 1e - 3) and resulted in 95% sensitivity with 15 false positives per patient for detecting exophytic renal lesions. Fivefold cross-validation also demonstrated that our method could stably detect exophytic renal lesions. These encouraging results demonstrated that manifold diffusion is a key means to enable accurate computer-aided diagnosis of renal lesions. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we are concerned with the definition of a first-order method for the solution of l(0)-penalized problemswith simple constraints. We use a reduced dimension Frank-Wolfe algorithm Rinaldi (Optim Methods Softw, 26, 2011) and show that the subproblem related to the computation of the Frank-Wolfe direction can be solved analytically at least for some sets of simple constraints. This gives us a very easy to implement and quite general tool for dealing with l(0)-penalized problems. The proposed method is then applied to the numerical solution of two practical optimization problems, namely, the Sparse Principal Component Analysis and the Sparse Reconstruction of Noisy Signals. In both cases, the reported numerical performances and comparisons with state-of-the-art solvers show the efficiency of the proposed method.

Such human-like behavior is not guaranteed with e.g. basic reinforcement learning schemes. Cognitive models can be very useful to establish human-like behavior in an agent. However, they require ample domain knowledge that might be difficult to obtain. In this paper, a cognitive model is taken as a basis, and the addition of scenario specific information is for a large part automated by means of machine learning techniques. The performance of the approach of automatically adding scenario specific information is rigorously evaluated using a case study in the domain of fighter air combat. An evolutionary algorithm is proposed for automatically tailoring a cognitive model for situation awareness of fighter pilots. The standard algorithm and several extensions are evaluated with respect to performance in air combat. The results show that it is possible to apply the algorithm to optimize belief networks for cognitive models of intelligent agents (adversarial fighters) in the aforementioned domain, thereby reducing the effort required to elicit knowledge from experts, while retaining the required 'human-like' behavior.

Since benchmarking all techniques is a tremendous task, literature has been used to limit the available options, selecting the two most promising techniques (AdaBoost and SVM), out of 11 different Machine Learning techniques. Based on a thorough comparison using 2 datasets and simulating noise in the feature set as well as in the labeling, AdaBoost is concluded to be the best machine learning technique for real-time target detection as its performance is comparable to SVM, its detection time is one or multiple orders of magnitude faster, its inherent feature selection eliminates this as a separate task, while it is more straightforward to use (only three coupled parameters to tune) and has a lower training time.

Early-stage detection of malignant vocal fold alterations, including a discrimination of premalignant lesions, represents a major challenge in laryngology as precancerous vocal fold lesions and small carcinomas are difficult to distinguish by means of regular endoscopy only. We report a procedure to discriminate between malignant and precancerous lesions by measuring the characteristics of vocal fold dynamics by means of a computerized analysis of laryngeal high-speed videos. Ten patients with squamous cell T1a carcinoma, ten with precancerous lesions with hyperkeratosis, and ten subjects without laryngeal disease underwent high-speed laryngoscopy yielding 4,000 images per second. By means of wavelet-based phonovibrographic analysis, a set of three clinically meaningful vibratory measures was extracted from the videos comprising a total number of 15,000 video frames. Statistical analysis (ANOVA with post hoc two-sided t tests, P < 0.05) revealed that vocal fold dynamics is significantly affected in the presence of precancerous lesions and T1a carcinoma. On the basis of the three measures, a discriminating pattern was extracted using a support vector machine-learning algorithm performing an individual classification in respect to the different clinical groups. By applying a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy, we could show that the proposed measures discriminate with a very high performance between precancerous lesions and T1a carcinoma (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 100%). Although a large-scale study will be necessary to confirm clinical significance, the set of vibratory measures derived in this study may be applicable to improve the accuracy and reliability of noninvasive diagnostics of vocal fold lesions.

Mixing Layer Manipulation Experiment From Open-Loop Forcing to Closed-Loop Machine Learning Control	FLOW TURBULENCE AND COMBUSTION			English	Article						Shear flow; Turbulence; Active flow control; Extremum seeking; POD; Machine learning; Genetic programming	FLOW-CONTROL; SHEAR FLOWS; ACTUATORS	Open- and closed-loop control of a turbulent mixing layer is experimentally performed in a dedicated large scale, low speed wind-tunnel facility. The flow is manipulated by an array of fluidic micro-valve actuators integrated into the trailing edge of a splitter plate. Sensing is performed using a rake of hot-wire probes downstream of the splitter plate in the mixing layer. The control goal is the manipulation of the local fluctuating energy level. The mixing layer's response to the control is tested with open-loop forcing with a wide range of actuation frequencies. Results are discussed for different closed-loop control approaches, such as: adaptive extremum-seeking and in-time POD mode feedback control. In addition, we propose Machine Learning Control (MLC) as a model-free closed-loop control method. MLC arrives reproducibly at the near-optimal in-time control.

Knowledge of the central transcription factors (TFs), the noncoding gene regulatory regions that they bind to, and the genes whose expression they modulate will be crucial in unlocking the full therapeutic potential of these cells. Here, we use DNase-seq in combination with analysis of histone modifications to identify multiple classes of epigenetically and functionally distinct cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Through motif analysis and ChIP-seq, we identify several of the crucial TF regulators of NS cells. At the core of the network are TFs of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), nuclear factor I (NFI), SOX, and FOX families, with CREs often densely bound by several of these different TFs. We use machine learning to highlight several crucial regulatory features of the network that underpin NS cell self-renewal and multipotency. We validate our predictions by functional analysis of the bHLH TF OLIG2. This TF makes an important contribution to NS cell self-renewal by concurrently activating pro-proliferation genes and preventing the untimely activation of genes promoting neuronal differentiation and stem cell quiescence.

SleepAp: An Automated Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Screening Application for Smartphones	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Actigraphy; audio; mHealth; obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA); PPG; sleep disorders	BODY POSITION; MEN; PREVALENCE; POPULATION; SIGNALS; WOMEN; RISK	Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a sleep disorder with long-term consequences. Long-term effects include sleep-related issues and cardiovascular diseases. OSA is often diagnosed with an overnight sleep test called a polysomnogram. Monitoring can be costly with long wait times for diagnosis. In this paper, a novel OSA screening framework and prototype phone application are introduced. A database of 856 patients that underwent at-home polygraphy was collected. Features were derived from audio, actigraphy, photoplethysmography (PPG), and demographics, and used as the inputs of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The SVM was trained on 735 patients and tested on 121 patients. Classification on the test set had an accuracy of up to 92.2% when classifying subjects as having moderate or severe OSA versus being healthy or a snorer based on the clinicians' diagnoses. The signal processing and machine learning algorithms were ported to Java and integrated into the phone application-SleepAp. SleepAp records the body position, audio, actigraphy and PPG signals, and implements the clinically validated STOP-BANG questionnaire. It derives features from the signals and classifies the user as having OSA or not using the SVM trained on the clinical database. The resulting software could provide a new, easy-to-use, low-cost, and widely available modality for OSA screening.

It features online unsupervised trainability and non-volatile floating-gate analog storage. It utilizes a massively parallel reconfigurable current-mode analog architecture to realize efficient computation, and leverages algorithm-level feedback to provide robustness to circuit imperfections in analog signal processing. A 3-layer, 7-node analog deep machine-learning engine was fabricated in a 0.13 mu m standard CMOS process, occupying 0.36 mm(2) active area. At a processing speed of 8300 input vectors per second, it consumes 11.4 mu W from the 3 V supply, achieving 1x10(12) operation per second per Watt of peak energy efficiency.

Mortality prediction in intensive care units with the Super ICU Learner Algorithm (SICULA): a population-based study	LANCET RESPIRATORY MEDICINE			English	Article							LOGISTIC-REGRESSION MODELS; ACUTE PHYSIOLOGY SCORE; SAPS-II; HOSPITAL MORTALITY; RISK PREDICTION; ROC CURVE; APACHE-II; CLASSIFICATION-SYSTEM; EXTERNAL VALIDATION; PROGNOSTIC MODELS	Background Improved mortality prediction for patients in intensive care units is a big challenge. Many severity scores have been proposed, but findings of validation studies have shown that they are not adequately calibrated. The Super ICU Learner Algorithm (SICULA), an ensemble machine learning technique that uses multiple learning algorithms to obtain better prediction performance, does at least as well as the best member of its library. We aimed to assess whether the Super Learner could provide a new mortality prediction algorithm for patients in intensive care units, and to assess its performance compared with other scoring systems. Methods From January, 2001, to December, 2008, we used the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC-II) database (version 26) induding all patients admitted to an intensive care unit at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre, Boston, MA, USA. We assessed the calibration, discrimination, and risk classification of predicted hospital mortality based on Super Learner compared with SAPS-II, APACHE-II, and SOFA. We calculated performance measures with cross-validation to avoid making biased assessments. Our proposed score was then externally validated on a dataset of 200 randomly selected patients admitted at the intensive care unit of Hopital Europeen Georges-Pompidou, Paris, France, between Sept 1, 2013, and June, 30, 2014. The primary outcome was hospital mortality The explanatory variables were the same as those induded in the SAPS II score. Findings 24508 patients were included, with median SAPS-II of 38 (IQR 27-51) and median SOFA of 5 (IQR 2-8). 3002 of 24508 (12%) patients died in the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre. We produced two sets of predictions based on the Super Learner; the first based on the 17 variables as they appear in the SAPS-II score (SL1), and the second, on the original, untransformed variables (SL2). The two versions yielded average predicted probabilities of death of 0.12 (IQR 0-02-0-16) and 0-13 (0-01-0.19), whereas the corresponding value for SOFA was 0-12 (0-05-0.15) and for SAPS-II 0-30 (0.08-0.48). The cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for SAPS-II was 0-78 (95% CI 0-77-0-78) and 0-71 (0-70-0.72) for SOFA. Super Learner had an AUROC of 0.85 (0-84-0.85) when the explanatory variables were categorised as in SAPS-II, and of 0.88 (0.87-0.89) when the same explanatory variables were included without any transformation. Additionally, Super Learner showed better calibration properties than previous score systems. On the external validation dataset, the AUROC was 0.94(0.90-0.98) and calibration properties were good. Interpretation Compared with conventional severity scores, Super Learner offers improved performance for predicting hospital mortality in patients in intensive care units. A user-friendly implementation is available online and should be useful for clinicians seeking to validate our score.

Therefore, this paper proposes the ConfAdaBoost.M1 algorithm. This algorithm is a variant of the AdaBoost.M1 that incorporates well-established ideas for confidence-based boosting. ConfAdaBoost.M1 is compared to the most commonly used boosting methods using benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. Moreover, it is evaluated on an activity recognition and an intensity estimation problem, including a large number of physical activities from the recently released PAMAP2 dataset. The presented results indicate that the proposed ConfAdaBoost.M1 algorithm significantly improves the classification performance on most of the evaluated datasets, especially for larger and more complex classification tasks. Finally, two empirical studies are designed and carried out to investigate the feasibility of ConfAdaBoost.M1 for physical activity monitoring applications in mobile systems.

Several methods were proposed to estimate the robot-terrain interaction: machine learning methods, iterative geometric methods, quasi-static and fully dynamic physics simulations. However, to the best of our knowledge there has been no systematic evaluation comparing those methods. In this paper, we present a newly developed iterative contact point estimation method for static stability estimation of actively reconfigurable robots. This new method is systematically compared to a physics simulation in a comprehensive evaluation. Both interaction models determine the contact points between robot and terrain and facilitate a subsequent static stability prediction. Hence, they can be used in our state space global planner for rough terrain to evaluate the robot's pose and stability. The analysis also compares deterministic versions of both methods to stochastic versions which account for uncertainty in the robot configuration and the terrain model. The results of this analysis show that the new iterative method is a valid and fast approximate method. It is significantly faster compared to a physics simulation while providing good results in realistic robotic scenarios. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Less computationally intensive fuzzy logic (type-1)-based controller for humanoid push recovery	ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Crisp set; Defuzzification; Fuzzification; Fuzzy logic; Humanoid push recovery; Machine learning; Robot dynamics and kinematics	PASSIVE DYNAMIC WALKING; MULTIROBOT CONTROL; CONTROL-SYSTEMS; ROBOTS; DESIGN; SETS	In this study, we present a new type-1 fuzzy logic-based controller for push recovery by humanoids. The objective of this study is to develop an intelligent controller and to implement biologically inspired push recovery for humanoid robots. The fuzzy inference system takes two crisp values as inputs, which are fuzzified, before a number of rules are applied, and finally the output is defuzzified to convert it into a crisp value. We apply fuzzy rules to our model, which we simulate in an unstructured environment. The objective is to reduce the fuzzy rules and make the fuzzy inference set less computationally intensive and fast, as well as exploiting the advantages of easy trainability and high generalizability. The fuzzy logic-based controller can predict the requisite push recovery strategy and whether the robot will be able to recover or fall. The architecture has a hierarchical design. The first fuzzy inference system (FIS1) is based on two input variables: the force and the direction of motion, where the result depends on the magnitude of the force applied to the body and direction in which the body moves after being pushed. FIS1 can determine small, medium, and large forces in term of roll and pitch effects on the body. These outputs are the input variables employed by FIS2 to predict the push recovery strategy that will be applied, and eventually the robot will be able to recover from a push or fall. The term "auto-leaning" from human autonomy is introduced in the context of push recovery. We extend the Gordon model for balancing humanoids using fuzzy logic by considering the effects of roll, pitch, and yaw. This extends earlier research in the field of humanoid push recovery, where the force was only applied in one direction, to studies of pushing in different directions. In a cluttered environment, pushing is a very common experience, from which humans can readily recover whereas humanoid robots cannot. Humanoid robots have more degrees of freedom, thus finding solutions using alternative methods is not a simple task. The novel feature of this study is the introduction of an intuitive fuzzy logic-based learning approach and we show that it is fast and effective. This exhaustive fuzzy logic-based design is the main focus of this study. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Semwal, Vijay Bhaskar; Chakraborty, Pavan; Nandi, G.

A tensor-based approach to touch modality classification by using machine learning	ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS			English	Article						PVDF tactile sensors; Array signal processing; Touch modality; Machine learning; Kernel machines	SINGULAR-VALUE DECOMPOSITION; TACTILE SENSOR; IMPLEMENTATION; RECOGNITION; SKIN	The use of piezoelectric sensor arrays to measure contact forces has been extensively studied in connection to robotics. In this research, Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) has been used for direct measurement of the mechanical stress and large bandwidth electromechanical transduction. Additionally, a machine learning algorithm has been specifically designed to deal with the inherent tensor morphology of raw tactile data. An experiment involving 70 participants has been organized to collect the output signals under different modalities of touch. The proposed pattern-recognition system showed good accuracy in performing touch classification in a three-class classification experiment, opening interesting scenarios for the application of tensor-based models to support human robot interactions.

Robotic learning of haptic adjectives through physical interaction	ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS			English	Article						Robotic perception; Haptics; Tactile sensing; Time-series classification; Machine learning	OBJECT MANIPULATION; TACTILE TEXTURES; RECOGNITION; TOUCH; DISCRIMINATION; EXPLORATION; PERCEPTION; TUTORIAL; SURFACES; SYSTEM	To perform useful tasks in everyday human environments, robots must be able to both understand and communicate the sensations they experience during haptic interactions with objects. Toward this goal, we augmented the Willow Garage PR2 robot with a pair of SynTouch BioTac sensors to capture rich tactile signals during the execution of four exploratory procedures on 60 household objects. In a parallel experiment, human subjects blindly touched the same objects and selected binary haptic adjectives from a predetermined set of 25 labels. We developed several machine-learning algorithms to discover the meaning of each adjective from the robot's sensory data. The most successful algorithms were those that intelligently combine static and dynamic components of the data recorded during all four exploratory procedures. The best of our approaches produced an average adjective classification F-1 score of 0.77, a score higher than that of an average human subject. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The review processes of major conferences is rigorous and the work presented in those venues have more visibility and more citations than many journals, with the advantage of a faster dissemination of ideas. We consider that any evaluation system in the Computer Science domain must take into account conferences as having the same importance as journals. This makes the evaluation of venues an important issue. While journals are usually evaluated through their Impact Factor, there is no widely accepted method for evaluating conferences. In our work we analyzed the possibility of using Machine learning techniques to extend an existing ranking to new conferences, based on a set of measurements that are available for the majority of venues. Our proposal consists on the application of a Machine learning technique-self-organizing maps-with some extensions in order to classify new conferences based on an existing ranking. We also try to estimate the theoretical maximal accuracy that can be obtained using statistical learning techniques.

Therefore, researchers were encouraged to explore and develop new machine learning ideas and methods. Mixture models are one of the machine learning techniques receiving considerable attention due to their ability to handle efficiently and effectively multidimensional data. In this paper, we represent a solution for two challenging issues: modeling non-Gaussian data and determining the set of relevant features in the data. The problem of modeling non-Gaussian data largely present in several computer vision, image processing, medical, and Bioinformatics applications is accomplished by the development of a generative infinite Gamma mixture model. The Gamma is chosen for its ability to handle long-tailed distributions, which allows it to have a good approximation to data with outliers. The proposed model, which can be viewed as a Dirichlet process mixture of Gamma distributions, takes into account the feature selection problem by determining a set of relevant features for each data cluster which provides better interpretability and generalization capabilities. We propose then an efficient algorithm to learn this infinite model's parameters by estimating all its posterior quantities of interest using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Thus, our algorithm is able to perform model selection, parameter learning, and feature selection simultaneously in a single step for the Gamma Mixture model. Furthermore, we show how the model can be used, while comparing it with other popular models in the literature, in two challenging applications namely medical images and gene expressions classification.

In this paper, a new method is proposed to increase the accuracy of fault prediction based on fuzzy clustering and majority ranking. In the proposed method, the effect of irrelevant and inconsistent modules on fault prediction is decreased by designing a new framework, in which the entire project's modules are clustered. The obtained results showed that fuzzy clustering could decrease the negative effect of irrelevant modules on accuracy of estimations. We used eight data sets from NASA and Turkish white-goods software to evaluate our results. Performance evaluation in terms of false positive rate, false negative rate, and overall error showed the superiority of our model compared to other predicting strategies. Our proposed majority ranking fuzzy clustering approach showed between 3% to 18% and 1% to 4% improvement in false negative rate and overall error respectively compared to other available proposed models (ACF and ACN) in at least half of the testing cases. The results show that our systems can be used to guide testing effort by prioritizing the module's faults in order to improve the quality of software development and software testing in a limited time and budget.

It helps policy makers in developing efficient water utilization strategies to maximize the utility of scarce water resource. Time series analysis has been used extensively for modeling river flow data. The use of machine learning techniques such as support-vector regression and neural network models is gaining increasing popularity. In this paper we compare the performance of these techniques by applying it to a long-term time-series data of the inflows into the Krishnaraja Sagar reservoir (KRS) from three tributaries of the river Cauvery. In this study flow data over a period of 30 years from three different observation points established in upper Cauvery river sub-basin is analyzed to estimate their contribution to KRS. Specifically, ANN model uses a multi-layer feed forward network trained with a back-propagation algorithm and support vector regression with epsilon intensive-loss function is used. Auto-regressive moving average models are also applied to the same data. The performance of different techniques is compared using performance metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE), correlation, normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE).

Annual sums of carbon dioxide exchange over a heterogeneous urban landscape through machine learning based gap-filling	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Carbon dioxide; Eddy covariance; Gap-filling; Urban ecosystem; Machine learning; Uncertainty; Spatial heterogeneity	NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE; EDDY-COVARIANCE MEASUREMENTS; CITIES METROPOLITAN-AREA; QUALITY ASSESSMENT; FLUX MEASUREMENTS; ENERGY FLUXES; CO2; UNCERTAINTY; TEMPERATURE; EMISSIONS	A small, but growing, number of flux towers in urban environments measure surface-atmospheric exchanges of carbon dioxide by the eddy covariance method. As in all eddy covariance studies, obtaining annual sums of urban CO2 exchange requires imputation of data gaps due to low turbulence and non-stationary conditions, adverse weather, and instrument failures. Gap-filling approaches that are widely used for measurements from towers in natural vegetation are based on light and temperature response models. However, they do not account for key features of the urban environment including tower footprint heterogeneity and localized CO2 sources. Here, we present a novel gap-filling modeling framework that uses machine learning to select explanatory variables, such as continuous traffic counts and temporal variables, and then constrains models separately for spatially classified subsets of the data. We applied the modeling framework to a three year time series of measurements from a tall broadcast tower in a suburban neighborhood of Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA. The gap-filling performance was similar to that reported for natural measurement sites, explaining 64% to 88% of the variability in the fluxes. Simulated carbon budgets were in good agreement with an ecophysiological bottom-up study at the same site. Total annual carbon dioxide flux sums for the tower site ranged from 1064 to 1382 g C m(-2) yr(-1), across different years and different gap-filling methods. Bias errors of annual sums resulting from gap-filling did not exceed 18 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and random uncertainties did not exceed +/- 44 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (or +/- 3.8% of the annual flux). Regardless of the gap-filling method used, the year-to-year differences in carbon exchange at this site were small. In contrast, the modeled annual sums of CO2 exchange differed by a factor of two depending on wind direction. This indicated that the modeled time series captured the spatial variability in both the biogenic and anthropogenic CO2 sources and sinks in a reproducible way. The gap-filling approach developed here may also be useful for inhomogeneous sites other than urban areas, such as logged forests or ecosystems under disturbance from fire or pests.

This paper presents an agent-design that is able to negotiate proficiently with people in settings in which agents can choose to truthfully reveal their private information before engaging in multiple rounds of negotiation. Such settings are analogous to real-world situations in which people need to decide whether to disclose information such as when negotiating over health plans and business transactions. The agent combined a decision-theoretic approach with traditional machine-learning techniques to reason about the social factors that affect the players' revelation decisions on people's negotiation behavior. It was shown to outperform people as well as agents playing the equilibrium strategy of the game in empirical studies spanning hundreds of subjects. It was also more likely to reach agreement than people or agents playing equilibrium strategies. In addition, it had a positive effect on people's play, allowing them to reach significantly better performance when compared to people's play with other people. These results are shown to generalize for two different settings that varied how players depend on each other in the negotiation.

This paper presents a new approach, from the viewpoint of correcting the mislabeled instances, to find deceptive opinion spam. Partition a dataset into several subsets, construct a classifier set for each subset and select the best one to evaluate the whole dataset. Error variables are defined to compute the probability that the instances have been mislabeled. The mislabeled instances are corrected based on two threshold schemes, majority and non-objection.

J	Qian, WB; Shu, WH; Yang, BR; Zhang, CS				Qian Wenbin; Shu Wenhao; Yang Bingru; Zhang Changsheng			An Incremental Algorithm to Feature Selection in Decision Systems with the Variation of Feature	CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Rough sets; Feature selection; Attribute reduction; Incremental algorithm; Dynamic data set	ATTRIBUTE REDUCTION; SETS	Feature selection is a challenging problem in pattern recognition and machine learning. In real-life applications, feature set in the decision systems may vary over time. There are few studies on feature selection with the variation of feature set. This paper focuses on this issue, an incremental feature selection algorithm in dynamic decision systems is developed based on dependency function. The incremental algorithm avoids some recomputations, rather than retrain the dynamic decision system as new one to compute the feature subset from scratch. We firstly employ an incremental manner to update the new dependency function, then we incorporate the calculated dependency function into the incremental feature selection algorithm. Compared with the direct (non-incremental) algorithm, the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm is improved. The experimental results on different data sets from UCI show that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient.

Robust model-based fault diagnosis for air handling units	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						Fault detection and diagnosis; Air handling units; ARX model; Machine learning techniques; Parameter estimation; Recursive least squares	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; COMPONENT ANALYSIS METHOD; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; PART I; QUANTITATIVE MODEL; SYSTEMS; ARX; IDENTIFICATION; METHODOLOGY; VALIDATION	Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment significantly impact energy consumption in both residential and commercial buildings. In most modern building management systems (BMS), HVAC historical data logs in large quantity and high resolution are recorded and available for further online or offline analysis, including automated FDD. In this paper, a model-based fault diagnosis method is developed by applying support vector machine (SVM) techniques to model parameters recursively calculated by an online estimator. The estimator presumes an autoregressive time series model with exogenous variables (ARX). A real-world air handling unit (AHU) dataset containing process variables measured at regular intervals is pre-processed by the online estimation algorithm. Each data vector in the original dataset (measured), together with a small number of appropriately selected lags, is converted to a parameter vector representing the state at the same instant. The set of parameter vectors is sub-divided into classes by SVM, enabling fault classification. Validation via experimental data demonstrates that the proposed hybrid approach produce superior performance measured by F-measure scores compared to alternative methods. Robustness to model uncertainty is also established. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	O'Flaherty, R; Egerstedt, M				O'Flaherty, Rowland; Egerstedt, Magnus			Low-Dimensional Learning for Complex Robots	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Decision boundaries; hybrid systems; learning control; reinforcement learning; robot motion	TRAJECTORY TRACKING; MOTOR-PRIMITIVES; CURSE	This paper presents an algorithm for learning the switching policy and the boundaries conditions between primitive controllers that maximize the translational movements of a complex locomoting system. The algorithm learns an optimal action for each boundary condition instead of one for each discretized state-action pair of the system, as is typically done in machine learning. The system is modeled as a hybrid system because it contains both discrete and continuous dynamics. With this hybridification of the system and with this abstraction of learning boundary-action pairs, the "curse of dimensionality" is mitigated. The effectiveness of this learning algorithm is demonstrated on both a simulated system and on a physical robotic system. In both cases, the algorithm is able to learn the hybrid control strategy that maximizes the forward translational movement of the system without the need for human involvement. Note to Practitioners-As technological innovation in the field of robotics continues to advance forward at a steady rate, so does the complexity of the robotic systems that are the product of this innovation. Utilizing these robotic systems for a number of automated tasks in diverse situations requires an increased level of deep understanding of the inner workings of the system, which is a burden to the human operator and programmer. To attenuate this burden, the task of programming itself must move towards automation. This type of automation is the motivation for work presented here. This paper outlines an algorithm for which a complex robotic system can learn the task of locomoting all on its own. The practical application of this research is that more complex robotic systems can be incorporated into industry with less effort. This automation is accomplished with an innovative approach on what the robot needs to learn to achieve its goal. This paper focuses on robot locomotion but future work will focus on the high degree of freedom stationary robotic arms that are increasingly seen on factory floors.

The key issue is how to analyse, predict and control cascading failures in advance and prevent system against emerging blackouts. This paper proposes a model which analyse power flow of the grid and predict cascade failure in advance with the integration of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) machine learning tool. The Key contribution of this paper is to introduce machine learning concept in early warning system for cascade failure analysis and prediction. Integration of power flow analysis with ANN machine learning tool has a potential to make present system more reliable which can prevent the grid against blackouts. An IEEE 30 bus test bed system has been modeled in powerworld and used in this paper for preparation of historical blackout data and validation of proposed model. The proposed model is a step towards realizing smart grid via intelligent ANN prediction technique.

Data analysis using machine learning allows discovery of knowledge for predictive purposes. In this paper, we analyze a dataset collected on a pilot intelligent lighting application (the breakout dataset) using a supervised machine learning based approach. The performance of the learning algorithms is evaluated using two metrics: Classification Accuracy (CA) and Relevance Score (RS). We find that the breakout dataset has a predominant one-to-many relationship, i.e. a given input may have more than one possible output and that RS is an appropriate metric as opposed to the commonly used CA.

In this paper, we examine the exploitation of machine learning techniques in user modelling technology for cloud services as a way to inform service providers on how to target service configurations at specific market segments, as well as to advice consumers on their service requests. More specifically, we examine the organisation of consumers into meaningful subsets (communities) and the extraction of meaningful service configurations for each subset (stereotypes).

Most recent works concerning unsupervised learning have been focused on clustering, where ACO-based techniques have showed a great potential. At the same time, new clustering techniques that seek the continuity of data, specially focused on spectral-based approaches in opposition to classical centroid-based approaches, have attracted an increasing research interest-an area still under study by ACO clustering techniques. This work presents a hybrid spectral-based ACO clustering algorithm inspired by the ACO Clustering (ACOC) algorithm. The proposed approach combines ACOC with the spectral Laplacian to generate a new search space for the algorithm in order to obtain more promising solutions. The new algorithm, called SACOC, has been compared against well-known algorithms (K-means and Spectral Clustering) and with ACOC. The experiments measure the accuracy of the algorithm for both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets extracted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Defining normality requires an intelligent approach. Machine learning algorithms have been widely applied to build classifiers that distinguish normal from anomalous activity. These algorithms construct vectors of features extracted from raw payloads of a given dataset and train the classifier with them. The success of the detection highly depends on the potential of the training dataset to properly represent network traffic. In this paper we show that an adversary knowing the distribution of the dataset and the specific feature construction method may generate attack vectors evading the classifier. Particularly, in the case the classifier uses a simple feature construction method based on 1-grams, getting real-world payloads to evade the classifier is feasible. We present experimental results regarding four well-known classification algorithms, namely, C4.5, CART, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP).

Despite most of them being exclusively driven by economic interests, the so-called impersonation, masquerading attack or identity fraud hinges on stealing the credentials of the victim and assuming his/her identity to get access to resources (e.g. relationships or confidential information), credit and other benefits in that person's name. While this problem is getting particularly frequent within the teenage community, the reality is that very scarce technological approaches have been proposed in the literature to address this issue which, if not detected in time, may catastrophically unchain other fatal consequences to the impersonated person such as bullying and intimidation. In this context, this paper delves into a machine learning approach that permits to efficiently detect this kind of attacks by solely relying on connection time information of the potential victim. The manuscript will demonstrate how these learning algorithms - in particular, support vector classifiers - can be of great help to understand and detect impersonation attacks without compromising the user privacy of social networks.

Also, solar energy forecasting can be derived from numerical weather prediction models (NWP). Our interest is focused on the latter approach. We focus on the problem of predicting solar energy from NWP computed from GEFS, the Global Ensemble Forecast System, which predicts meteorological variables for points in a grid. In this context, it can be useful to know how prediction accuracy improves depending on the number of grid nodes used as input for the machine learning techniques. However, using the variables from a large number of grid nodes can result in many attributes which might degrade the generalization performance of the learning algorithms. In this paper both issues are studied using data supplied by Kaggle for the State of Oklahoma comparing Support Vector Machines and Gradient Boosted Regression. Also, three different feature selection methods have been tested: Linear Correlation, the ReliefF algorithm and, a new method based on local information analysis.

Social Networks have become an important environment where users provide information of their preferences and relationships. This information can be used to measure the influence of ideas and the society opinions in real time, being very useful on several fields and research areas such as marketing campaigns, financial prediction or public healthcare among others. Recently, the research on artificial intelligence techniques applied to develop technologies allowing monitoring web data sources for detecting public health events has emerged as a new relevant discipline called Epidemic Intelligence. Epidemic Intelligence Systems are nowadays widely used by public health organizations like monitoring mechanisms for early detection of disease outbreaks to reduce the impact of epidemics. This paper presents a survey on current data mining applications and web systems based on web data for public healthcare over the last years.

This paper describes the definition of a resilient middleware for sensor network management in dynamic environments for supporting Situation Awareness processes in security scenarios. The proposed approach is based on Quality of Service of sensors for identifying faults, disturbances, incompleteness and uncertainty in raw data. Moreover, Dempster-Shafer Theory is employed to aggregate sensor data and abstract them to obtain coherent observations about the monitored environment. Lastly, machine learning techniques are used to discover association rules in order to handle the absence of relevant observations.

Army STARRS Collaborators	Predicting Suicides After Psychiatric Hospitalization in US Army Soldiers The Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS)	JAMA PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEMS; INPATIENT CARE; PREVENTION; DISCHARGE; METAANALYSIS; REGRESSION; DEPRESSION; ATTEMPTORS; BEHAVIOR; PERIODS	IMPORTANCE The US Army experienced a sharp increase in soldier suicides beginning in 2004. Administrative data reveal that among those at highest risk are soldiers in the 12 months after inpatient treatment of a psychiatric disorder. OBJECTIVE To develop an actuarial risk algorithm predicting suicide in the 12 months after US Army soldier inpatient treatment of a psychiatric disorder to target expanded posthospitalization care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS There were 53 769 hospitalizations of active duty soldiers from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2009, with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification psychiatric admission diagnoses. Administrative data available before hospital discharge abstracted from a wide range of data systems (sociodemographic, US Army career, criminal justice, and medical or pharmacy) were used to predict suicides in the subsequent 12 months using machine learning methods (regression trees and penalized regressions) designed to evaluate cross-validated linear, nonlinear, and interactive predictive associations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suicides of soldiers hospitalized with psychiatric disorders in the 12 months after hospital discharge. RESULTS Sixty-eight soldiers died by suicide within 12 months of hospital discharge (12.0% of all US Army suicides), equivalent to 263.9 suicides per 100 000 person-years compared with 18.5 suicides per 100 000 person-years in the total US Army. The strongest predictors included sociodemographics (male sex [odds ratio (OR), 7.9; 95% CI, 1.9-32.6] and late age of enlistment [OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.5]), criminal offenses (verbal violence [OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.0] and weapons possession [OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.7-18.3]), prior suicidality [OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.7-4.9], aspects of prior psychiatric inpatient and outpatient treatment (eg, number of antidepressant prescriptions filled in the past 12 months [OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7]), and disorders diagnosed during the focal hospitalizations (eg, nonaffective psychosis [OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-7.0]). A total of 52.9% of posthospitalization suicides occurred after the 5% of hospitalizations with highest predicted suicide risk (3824.1 suicides per 100 000 person-years). These highest-risk hospitalizations also accounted for significantly elevated proportions of several other adverse posthospitalization outcomes (unintentional injury deaths, suicide attempts, and subsequent hospitalizations). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The high concentration of risk of suicide and other adverse outcomes might justify targeting expanded posthospitalization interventions to soldiers classified as having highest posthospitalization suicide risk, although final determination requires careful consideration of intervention costs, comparative effectiveness, and possible adverse effects.

Machine-learning approaches have predictive potential for individual-patient prognostic purposes and might thus aid translational efforts in psychiatric research. OBJECTIVE To predict treatment response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on an individual-patient level based on functional magnetic resonance imaging data in patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/AG). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We included 49 patients free of medication for at least 4 weeks and with a primary diagnosis of PD/AG in a longitudinal study performed at 8 clinical research institutes and outpatient centers across Germany. The functional magnetic resonance imaging study was conducted between July 2007 and March 2010. INTERVENTIONS Twelve CBT sessions conducted 2 times a week focusing on behavioral exposure. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Treatment response was defined as exceeding a 50% reduction in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores. Blood oxygenation level-dependent signal was measured during a differential fear-conditioning task. Regional and whole-brain gaussian process classifiers using a nested leave-one-out cross-validation were used to predict the treatment response from data acquired before CBT. RESULTS Although no single brain region was predictive of treatment response, integrating regional classifiers based on data from the acquisition and the extinction phases of the fear-conditioning task for the whole brain yielded good predictive performance (accuracy, 82%; sensitivity, 92%; specificity, 72%; P < .001). Data from the acquisition phase enabled 73% correct individual-patient classifications (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 67%; P < .001), whereas data from the extinction phase led to an accuracy of 74%(sensitivity, 64%; specificity, 83%; P < .001). Conservative reanalyses under consideration of potential confounders yielded nominally lower but comparable accuracy rates (acquisition phase, 70%; extinction phase, 71%; combined, 79%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Predicting treatment response to CBT based on functional neuroimaging data in PD/AG is possible with high accuracy on an individual-patient level. This novel machine-learning approach brings personalized medicine within reach, directly supporting clinical decisions for the selection of treatment options, thus helping to improve response rates.

In order to provide the user with information about confidential data, many prevalent data leakage prevention (DLP) solutions rely on scanning the content of the relevant files. This approach requires the capability to parse various file formats. However, risks of data breach persist for unsupported file formats. To address this issue, we propose in this paper an active behavior-based DLP model that hooks the keyboard and mouse application programming interfaces (APIs) to track and profile user behavior. This model has two major advantages: (1) it can help discover sensitive data without parsing file formats, and (2) a data creator can be identified according to his/her keystroke and mouse movement behavior. Since this model is based on profiling user behavior, it eliminates the risk of data leakage from unsupported file formats and can identify the creator of a file. The experiments showcase the effectiveness of the proposed model with data creator identification method yields an accuracy rate of 92.64%, which is promising considering that the features of keystroke and mouse movement behavior are dealing together.

Such a platform enables algorithms well suited for analyzing complex sensor signals under strict energy constraints. However, the benefits go further, enabling the effects of errors to be overcome in the presence of hardware faults within the platform. Although errors can result in substantial bit-level perturbations, the approach described views these an alteration on the way that information is encoded within the embedded data. The new information encoding can thus be learned in the form of an error-aware model. The energy implications of hardware-specialized machine-learning kernels are analyzed using a fabricated custom IC, and the hardware-resilience implications are analyzed using an FPGA platform, which permits controllable and randomized injection of logical hardwarefaults.

We propose a new method called Random Cluster Ensemble (RCE for short), that estimates the out-of-bag feature importance from an ensemble of partitions. Each partition is constructed using a different bootstrap sample and a random subset of the features. We provide empirical results on nineteen benchmark data sets indicating that RCE, boosted with a recursive feature elimination scheme (RFE) (Guyon and Elisseeff, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3:1157-1182, 2003), can lead to significant improvement in terms of clustering accuracy, over several state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised algorithms, with a very limited subset of features.

Currently, the machine learning methods achieve the-state-of-the-art performance with different features. A key step to improve the performance of these methods is to find a suitable representation of proteins. In this study, we proposed a feature vector composed of three kinds of sequence-based features, including overall amino acid composition, pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) proposed by Chou and physicochemical distance transformation. These features not only consider the sequence composition of proteins, but also incorporate the sequence-order information of amino acids in proteins. The feature vectors were fed into Support Vector Machine (SVM) for DNA-binding protein identification. The proposed method is called PseDNA-Pro. Experiments on stringent benchmark datasets and independent test datasets by using the Jackknife test showed that PseDNA-Pro can achieve an accuracy of higher than 80%, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods, including DNAbinder, DNA-Prot, and iDNA-Prot. These results indicate that the combination of various features for DNA-binding protein prediction is a suitable approach, and the sequence-order information among residues in proteins is relative for discrimination.

J	Freyhult, E; Gustafsson, MG; Strombergsson, H				Freyhult, Eva; Gustafsson, Mats G.; Strombergsson, Helena			A Machine Learning Approach to Explain Drug Selectivity to Soluble and Membrane Protein Targets	MOLECULAR INFORMATICS			English	Article						Drugs; Machine learning; Drug selectivity; Targetome; Protein-ligand recognition	DATABASE; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION	Improved understanding of the forces that determine drug specificity to their targets is important for drug design and discovery, as well as for gaining knowledge about molecular recognition. Here, we present a machine learning approach that includes all approved drugs with a known protein target. The drugs were characterized using easily interpretable physico-chemical descriptors. Employing the Random Forest method, we were able to predict whether a drug binds to a soluble or membrane protein with an average accuracy of 84% and an average area under curve of 0.91. The high average performance suggests that there exist some general physico-chemical differences between drugs that bind to membrane and soluble protein targets. Variable importance measures in combination with permutation tests were used to find the most influential descriptors. This resulted in six outstanding descriptors, that all involve drug flexibility and lipophilicity, suggesting that drugs binding to membrane protein targets are in general more flexible and lipophilic, and conversely, drugs binding to soluble protein targets are more rigid and hydrophilic. With the notion that ligands in general are blueprints of their protein pockets, we may also draw general conclusions about the protein-pocket properties which may add to the understanding of molecular recognition.

Second virial coefficient is the property derived from the virial equation of state, and is of particular interest as it describes pair intermolecular interactions. The two-layer QSPR models were developed, which exploited the well-known physical equations and allowed us to include this information into traditional QSPR methodology. This shows some new perspectives for work with temperature-dependent properties. It was shown that 2D descriptors can be successfully used for modeling of complex thermodynamic properties like virial coefficients.	[Mokshyna, E.; Polishchuk, P. G.; Nedostup, V. I.; Kuzmin, V.

Experimental design and machine learning strategies for parameters screening and optimization of Hantzsch condensation reaction for the assay of sodium alendronate in oral solution	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							RESPONSE-SURFACE METHODOLOGY; SOLID-PHASE EXTRACTION; SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC DETERMINATION; PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS; WATER SAMPLES; TABLETS; FORMALDEHYDE; PLASMA; CHROMATOGRAPHY; URINE	An experimental design was adopted to attain the optimum reaction parameters of chemical derivatization of anhydrous sodium alendronate in an oral solution formula via Hantzsch condensation reaction. All reaction controlling variables, namely, time of reaction, temperature, reagent ratio and volume and buffer type, pH and volume were studied using the Plackett-Burman screening design to determine significant variables. Reaction temperature and pH of the buffer solution were found to be significant variables. Optimization was performed using the central composite design to get the optimum levels of these variables. Moreover, a comparison was made with artificial neural networks and support vector machines. The same results were obtained with low percentage relative error. After carrying out the spectrophotometric analysis, interferences from oral solution excipients were eliminated with a simple extraction procedure before measuring the absorbance at 340 nm. Satisfactory results of sample analysis were obtained and they were in good agreement with the label claim. A linear calibration graph of absorbance versus concentration was obtained with very low value of intercept and high value of correlation coefficient (0.9999) in the range of 2.44-34.10 mg mL(-1). The proposed spectrophotometric method was fully validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. Statistical comparison with a reported reference method showed similar results with respect to accuracy and precision.	[Korany, Mohamed A.; Ragab, Marwa A.

Analysis of Underlying Causes of Inter-expert Disagreement in Retinopathy of Prematurity Diagnosis Application of Machine Learning Principles	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Inter-expert disagreement; feature selection; retinopathy of prematurity; kernel density estimation	PLUS DISEASE DIAGNOSIS; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; AGREEMENT; CRYOTHERAPY; TORTUOSITY	Objective: Inter-expert variability in image-based clinical diagnosis has been demonstrated in many diseases including retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), which is a disease affecting low birth weight infants and is a major cause of childhood blindness. In order to better understand the underlying causes of variability among experts, we propose a method to quantify the variability of expert decisions and analyze the relationship between expert diagnoses and features computed from the images. Identification of these features is relevant for development of computer-based decision support systems and educational systems in ROP, and these methods may be applicable to other diseases where inter-expert variability is observed. Methods: The experiments were carried out on a dataset of 34 retinal images, each with diagnoses provided independently by 22 experts. Analysis was performed using concepts of Mutual Information (MI) and Kernel Density Estimation. A large set of structural features (a total of 66) were extracted from retinal images. Feature selection was utilized to identify the most important features that correlated to actual clinical decisions by the 22 study experts. The best three features for each observer were selected by an exhaustive search on all possible feature subsets and considering joint MI as a relevance criterion. We also compared our results with the results of Cohen's Kappa [36] as an inter-rater reliability measure. Results: The results demonstrate that a group of observers (17 among 22) decide consistently with each other. Mean and second central moment of arteriolar tortuosity is among the reasons of disagreement between this group and the rest of the observers, meaning that the group of experts consider amount of tortuosity as well as the variation of tortuosity in the image. Conclusion: Given a set of image-based features, the proposed analysis method can identify critical image-based features that lead to expert agreement and disagreement in diagnosis of ROP. Although tree-based features and various statistics such as central moment are not popular in the literature, our results suggest that they are important for diagnosis.

The objective of this work is to measure and classify psychophysiological reactivity in response to cultural heritage material presented as visual and audio. We present a data processing and classification framework for the classification of interest. Two studies are reported, adopting a subject-dependent approach to classify psychophysiological signals using mobile physiological sensors and the support vector machine learning algorithm. The results show that it is possible to reliably infer a state of interest from cultural heritage material using psychophysiological feature data and a machine learning approach, informing future work for the development of a real-time physiological computing system for use within an adaptive cultural heritage experience designed to adapt the provision of information to sustain the interest of the visitor.

Under this framework, decision making is measured using physiological sensors such as Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and eye-tracking while users are subjected to varying decision quality and difficulty levels. Following this quantifiable decision making, users are allowed to refine several decision factors in order to make decisions of high quality and with low difficulty levels. A case study of driving route selection is used to set up an experiment to test our hypotheses. In this study, GSR features exhibit the best performance in indexing decision quality. These results can be used to guide the design of intelligent user interfaces for decision-related applications in HCI that can adapt to user behavior and decision-making performance.

The sample of standard microlensing events comprises 3718 unique events from 2001-2009 with 1409 events that had not been detected before in real-time by the Early Warning System of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. The search pipeline uses machine learning algorithms to help find rare phenomena among 150 million objects and to derive the detection efficiency. Applications of the catalog can be numerous, from analyzing individual events to large statistical studies of the Galactic mass, kinematics distributions, and planetary abundances. We derive maps of the mean Einstein ring crossing time of events spanning 31 deg(2) toward the Galactic center and compare the observed distributions with the most recent models. We find good agreement within the observed region and we see the signature of the tilt of the bar in the microlensing data. However, the asymmetry of the mean timescales seems to rise more steeply than predicted, indicating either a somewhat different orientation of the bar or a larger bar width. The map of events with sources in the Galactic bulge shows a dependence of the mean timescale on the Galactic latitude, signaling an increasing contribution from disk lenses closer to the plane relative to the height of the disk. Our data present a perfect set for comparing and enhancing new models of the central parts of the Milky Way and creating a three-dimensional picture of the Galaxy.

Most of the existing perceptual full-reference image quality assessment (IQA) metrics cannot deal with both these two different impacts well. Singular value decomposition (SVD) as a useful mathematical tool that has been used in various image processing applications (e.g., feature extraction). In this paper, SVD is employed to decompose the images into the structural (content-dependent) and the content-independent components. For each portion, a specific assessment model is designed to tailor for its corresponding distortion properties. All the proposed models are then fused to obtain a final quality score by extreme learning machine (ELM), a machine learning technique. Extensive experimental results on six publicly available databases demonstrate that the proposed metric achieves better performance in comparison with the relevant state-of-the-art quality metrics.

A discriminative method for protein remote homology detection based on N-Gram	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Protein remote homology; N-Gram; Machine learning; Random forest	LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS; IDENTIFICATION	Protein remote homology detection refers to detecting structural homology in proteins with an extremely low rate of sequence similarity. Such detection is primarily conducted using 3 methods: pairwise sequence comparisons, generative models for protein families, and discriminative classifiers. In this study, a discriminative classification method involving N-Grams was adopted to extract features using a random forest algorithm to classify data sets. Experiments in the SCOP 1.53 data set showed that our approach improved the receiver operating characteristic by 6% compared with well-known methods. To determine a score threshold that could be used to divide the data set, we also used a heuristic method through which the precision of positive examples and recall rate reached 0.5647 and 0.8647, respectively. Few other studies have investigated the recall and precision of such examples.

A drawback of traditional machine learning methods is the relatively little attention given to small sample classification. Thus, we developed imDC, which uses an ensemble learning concept in combination with weights and sample misclassification information to effectively classify imbalanced data. Our method showed better results when compared to other algorithms with UCI machine learning datasets and microRNA data.	[Wang, C. Y.; Guo, M. Z.; Liu, X.

In practice, subject matter experts tediously analyze images searching for MLOs. In the literature, there are many attempts at automated target recognition (ATR) to detect the MLOs. This paper focuses on the classifiers that use computer vision and machine learning approaches. These techniques require large amounts of data, which is often prohibitive. For this reason, the use of synthetic and semisynthetic data sets for training and testing is commonplace. This paper shows how a simple semisynthetic data creation scheme can be used to pretest these data-hungry training algorithms to determine what features are of value. The paper provides real-world testing and training data sets in addition to the semisynthetic training and testing data sets. The paper considers the Haar-like and local binary pattern (LBP) features with boosting, showing improvements in performance with real classifiers over semisynthetic classifiers and improvements in performance as semisynthetic data set size increases.

The complexity of the problem is increased due to the large set of tunable parameters exposed by the "new wave" of HLS tools that include not only architectural alternatives but also compiler transformations. In this paper, we developed a novel exploration approach, called spectral-aware Pareto iterative refinement, that exploits response surface models (RSMs) and spectral analysis for predicting the quality of the design points without resorting to costly architectural synthesis procedures. We show that the target solution space can be accurately modeled through RSMs, thus enabling a speedup of the overall exploration without compromising the quality of results. Furthermore, we introduce the usage of spectral techniques to find high variance regions of the design space that require analysis for improving the RSMs prediction accuracy.

For nearly a decade, content based filtering using text classification or machine learning has been a major trend of anti-spam filtering system. Recently, spammers try to defeat anti-spam filter by many techniques. Text embedding into attached image is one of them. We proposed an ontology spam filters. However, the proposed system handles only text e-mail and the percentage of attached images is increasing sharply. The contribution of the paper is that we add image e-mail handling capability into the anti-spam filtering system keeping the advantages of the previous text based spam e-mail filtering system. Also, the proposed system gives a low false negative value, which means that user's valuable e-mail is rarely regarded as a spam e-mail.

Systematic Proteomic Approach to Characterize the Impacts of Chemical Interactions on Protein and Cytotoxicity Responses to Metal Mixture Exposures	JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH			English	Article						chemical interactions; dose response; mixture toxicity; chemical mixtures; risk assessment; proteomics; cytotoxicity; metals; systems biology	TOXICITY; CELLS; NICKEL	Chemical interactions have posed a big challenge in toxicity characterization and human health risk assessment of environmental mixtures. To characterize the impacts of chemical interactions on protein and cytotoxicity responses to environmental mixtures, we established a systems biology approach integrating proteomics, bioinformatics, statistics, and computational toxicology to measure expression or phosphorylation levels of 21 critical toxicity pathway regulators and 445 downstream proteins in human BEAS-2B cells treated with 4 concentrations of nickel, 2 concentrations each of cadmium and chromium, as well as 12 defined binary and 8 defined ternary mixtures of these metals in vitro. Multivariate statistical analysis and mathematical modeling of the metal-mediated proteomic response patterns showed a high correlation between changes in protein expression or phosphorylation and cellular toxic responses to both individual metals and metal mixtures. Of the identified correlated proteins, only a small set of proteins including HIF-1 alpha is likely to be responsible for selective cytotoxic responses to different metals and metals mixtures. Furthermore, support vector machine learning was utilized to computationally predict protein responses to uncharacterized metal mixtures using experimentally generated protein response profiles corresponding to known metal mixtures. This study provides a novel proteomic approach for characterization and prediction of toxicities of metal and other chemical mixtures.

The coiled-coil is known for its straightforward heptad repeat pattern and can be readily recognized based on protein primary sequences, exhibiting a variety of oligomer states and topologies. Due to the stable interaction formed between their alpha-helices, coiled-coils have been under close scrutiny to design novel protein structures for potential applications in the fields of material science, synthetic biology and medicine. However, their broader application requires an in-depth and systematic analysis of the sequence-to-structure relationship of coiled-coil folding and oligomeric formation. In this article, we propose a new oligomerization state predictor, termed as RFCoil, which exploits the most useful and non-redundant amino acid indices combined with the machine learning algorithm - random forest (RF) - to predict the oligomeric states of coiled-coil regions. Benchmarking experiments show that RFCoil achieves an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 0.849 on the 10-fold cross-validation test using the training dataset and 0.855 on the independent test using the validation dataset, respectively. Performance comparison results indicate that RFCoil outperforms the four existing predictors LOGICOIL, PrOCoil, SCORER 2.0 and Multicoil2. Furthermore, we extract a number of predominant rules from the trained RF model that underlie the oligomeric formation. We also present two case studies to illustrate the applicability of the extracted rules to the prediction of coiled-coil oligomerization state.

The goal is to automatically optimize replica placement in a way that leverages locality patterns in data accesses, such that internode communication is minimized. To do this efficiently is extremely challenging, as one needs not only to find lightweight and scalable ways to identify the right assignment of data replicas to nodes but also to preserve fast data lookup. The article introduces new techniques that address these challenges. The first challenge is addressed by optimizing, in a decentralized way, the placement of the objects generating the largest number of remote operations for each node. The second challenge is addressed by combining the usage of consistent hashing with a novel data structure, which provides efficient probabilistic data placement. These techniques have been integrated in a popular open-source key-value store. The performance results show that the throughput of the optimized system can be six times better than a baseline system employing the widely used static placement based on consistent hashing.

The central idea is to create a complex classifier from a population of weak or simple classifiers. We create a master population of cells with randomized synthetic biosensor circuits that have a broad range of sensitivities toward chemical signals of interest that form the input vectors subject to classification. The randomized sensitivities are achieved by constructing a library of synthetic gene circuits with randomized control sequences (e.g., ribosome-binding sites) in the front element. The training procedure consists in reshaping of the master population in such a way that it collectively responds to the positive patterns of input signals by producing above-threshold output (e.g., fluorescent signal), and below-threshold output in case of the negative patterns. The population reshaping is achieved by presenting sequential examples and pruning the population using either graded selection/counterselection or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We demonstrate the feasibility of experimental implementation of such system computationally using a realistic model of the synthetic sensing gene circuits	[Didovyk, Andriy; Hasty, Jeff; Huerta, Ramon; Tsimring, Lev] Univ Calif San Diego, BioCircuits Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Bioengn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Hasty, Jeff] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci, Mol Biol Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Kanakov, Oleg I.] Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhniy Novgorod, Dept Radiophys, Nizhnii Novgorod, Russia; [Ivanchenko, Mikhail V.] Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhniy Novgorod, Dept Bioinformat, Nizhnii Novgorod, Russia	Huerta, R (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, BioCircuits Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.	rhuerta@ucsd.edu; ltsimring@ucsd.edu	Ivanchenko, Mikhail/J-7045-2013; Huerta, Ramon/J-4316-2012	Huerta, Ramon/0000-0003-3925-5169	National Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1121748]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [RO1-GM069811]; San Diego Center for Systems Biology, NIH Grant [P50 GM085764]; Russian Foundation for Basic Research grant [RFBR 13-02-00918]; DARPA [W911NF-14-2-0032]	The authors thank K Kotelnikov and A.

J	Esmaeilzadeh, H; Sampson, A; Ceze, L; Burger, D				Esmaeilzadeh, Hadi; Sampson, Adrian; Ceze, Luis; Burger, Doug			Neural Acceleration for General-Purpose Approximate Programs	COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM			English	Article								As improvements in per-transistor speed and energy efficiency diminish, radical departures from conventional approaches are needed to continue improvements in the performance and energy efficiency of general-purpose processors. One such departure is approximate computing, where error in computation is acceptable and the traditional robust digital abstraction of near-perfect accuracy is relaxed. Conventional techniques in energy-efficient computing navigate a design space defined by the two dimensions of performance and energy, and traditionally trade one for the other. General-purpose approximate computing explores a third dimension-error-and trades the accuracy of computation for gains in both energy and performance. Techniques to harvest large savings from small errors have proven elusive. This paper describes a new approach that uses machine learning-based transformations to accelerate approximation-tolerant programs. The core idea is to train a learning model how an approximable region of code-code that can produce imprecise but acceptable results-behaves and replace the original code region with an efficient computation of the learned model. We use neural networks to learn code behavior and approximate it. We describe the Parrot algorithmic transformation, which leverages a simple programmer annotation ("approximable") to transform a code region from a von Neumann model to a neural model. After the learning phase, the compiler replaces the original code with an invocation of a low-power accelerator called a neural processing unit (NPU). The NPU is tightly coupled to the processor pipeline to permit profitable acceleration even when small regions of code are transformed. Offloading approximable code regions to NPUs is faster and more energy efficient than executing the original code. For a set of diverse applications, NPU acceleration provides whole-application speedup of 2.3x and energy savings of 3.0x on average with average quality loss of at most 9.6%. NPUs form a new class of accelerators and show that significant gains in both performance and efficiency are achievable when the traditional abstraction of near-perfect accuracy is relaxed in general-purpose computing.

Successful identification of candidate drug targets in entire genomes is very useful, and computational prediction methods can speed up this process. In the current work we have developed a sequence-based prediction method for the successful identification and discrimination of human drug target proteins, from human non-drug target proteins. The training features include sequence-based features, such as amino acid composition, amino acid property group composition, and dipeptide composition for generating predictive models. The classification of human drug target proteins presents a classic example of class imbalance. We have addressed this issue by using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) as a preprocessing step, for balancing the training data with a ratio of 1:1 between drug targets (minority samples) and non-drug targets (majority samples). Using ensemble classification learning method-Rotation Forest and ReliefF feature-selection technique for selecting the optimal subset of salient features, the best model with selected features can achieve 87.1% sensitivity, 83.6% specificity, and 853% accuracy, with 0.71 Matthews correlation coefficient (mcc) on a tenfold stratified cross-validation test. The subset of identified optimal features may help in assessing the compositional patterns in human drug targets. For further validation, using a rigorous leave-one-out cross-validation test, the model achieved 88.1% sensitivity, 83.0% specificity, 85.5% accuracy, and 0.712 mcc. The proposed method was tested on a second dataset, for which the current pipeline gave promising results. We suggest that the present approach can be applied successfully as a complementary tool to existing methods for novel drug target prediction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Iglesias, F; Zseby, T				Iglesias, Felix; Zseby, Tanja			Entropy-Based Characterization of Internet Background Radiation	ENTROPY			English	Article						network security; information entropy; time series analysis; supervised classification; signal modeling		Network security requires real-time monitoring of network traffic in order to detect new and unexpected attacks. Attack detection methods based on deep packet inspection are time consuming and costly, due to their high computational demands. This paper proposes a fast, lightweight method to distinguish different attack types observed in an IP darkspace monitor. The method is based on entropy measures of traffic-flow features and machine learning techniques. The explored data belongs to a portion of the Internet background radiation from a large IP darkspace, i.e., real traffic captures that exclusively contain unsolicited traffic, ongoing attacks, attack preparation activities and attack aftermaths. Results from an in-depth traffic analysis based on packet headers and content are used as a reference to label data and to evaluate the quality of the entropy-based classification. Full IP darkspace traffic captures from a three-week observation period in April, 2012, are used to compare the entropy-based classification with the in-depth traffic analysis. Results show that several traffic types present a high correlation to the respective traffic-flow entropy signals and can even fit polynomial regression models. Therefore, sudden changes in traffic types caused by new attacks or attack preparation activities can be identified based on entropy variations.

J	Shoaib, M; Jha, NK; Verma, N				Shoaib, Mohammed; Jha, Niraj K.; Verma, Naveen			Signal Processing With Direct Computations on Compressively Sensed Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VERY LARGE SCALE INTEGRATION (VLSI) SYSTEMS			English	Article						Compressed sensing; digital signal processing; linear systems; machine learning; spike sorting; seizure detection	SPARSE REPRESENTATION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; SPIKE DETECTION; DIMENSIONALITY; DICTIONARIES; PROJECTION; ALGORITHM; WAVELETS; DESIGN; SYSTEM	Sparsity is characteristic of a signal that potentially allows us to represent information efficiently. We present an approach that enables efficient representations based on sparsity to be utilized throughout a signal processing system, with the aim of reducing the energy and/or resources required for computation, communication, and storage. The representation we focus on is compressive sensing. Its benefit is that compression is achieved with minimal computational cost through the use of random projections; however, a key drawback is that reconstruction is expensive. We focus on inference frameworks for signal analysis. We show that reconstruction can be avoided entirely by transforming signal processing operations (e.g., wavelet transforms, finite impulse response filters, etc.) such that they can be applied directly to the compressed representations. We present a methodology and a mathematical framework that achieve this goal and also enable significant computational-energy savings through operations over fewer input samples. This enables explicit energy-versus-accuracy tradeoffs that are under the control of the designer. We demonstrate the approach through two case studies. First, we consider a system for neural prosthesis that extracts wavelet features directly from compressively sensed spikes. Through simulations, we show that spike sorting can be achieved with 54x fewer samples, providing an accuracy of 98.63% in spike count, 98.56% in firing-rate estimation, and 96.51% in determining the coefficient of variation; this compares with a baseline Nyquist-domain detector with corresponding performance of 98.97%, 99.69%, and 97.09%, respectively. Second, we consider a system for detecting epileptic seizures by extracting spectral-energy features directly from compressively sensed electroencephalogram. Through simulations of the end-to-end algorithm, we show that detection can be achieved with 21x fewer samples, providing a sensitivity of 94.43%, false alarm rate of 0.1543/h, and latency of 4.70 s; this compares with a baseline Nyquist-domain detector with corresponding performance of 96.03%, 0.1471/h, and 4.59 s, respectively.

Our ability to relate what we see in an image to a large collection of 3D models allows us to transfer information from these models, creating a rich understanding of the scene. We develop a framework for auto-calibrating a camera, rendering 3D models from the viewpoint an image was taken, and computing a similarity measure between each 3D model and an input image. We demonstrate this data-driven approach in the context of geometry estimation and show the ability to find the identities, poses and styles of objects in a scene. The true benefit of 3DNN compared to a traditional 2D nearest-neighbor approach is that by generalizing across viewpoints, we free ourselves from the need to have training examples captured from all possible viewpoints. Thus, we are able to achieve comparable results using orders of magnitude less data, and recognize objects from never-before-seen viewpoints. In this work, we describe the 3DNN algorithm and rigorously evaluate its performance for the tasks of geometry estimation and object detection/segmentation, as well as two novel applications: affordance estimation and photorealistic object insertion.

They require human experts to post-process the discovered patterns manually. Therefore a significant need exists for techniques and tools with the ability to assist users in analyzing a large number of patterns to find usable knowledge. Action mining is one of these techniques which intelligently and automatically suggests some changes in the state of an object with the aim of gaining some profit in the corresponding domain. Up to now little research has been done in this field; in all cases continuous-valued data is handled by discretizing the associated attributes in advance or during the learning process. One inherent disadvantage in these methods is that using this sharp behavior can result in missing the optimal action. To overcome this problem this paper presents a method based on fuzzy set theory. In this paper, we concentrate on the fuzzy set based approach for the enhancement of Yang's method and present an algorithm that suggests actions which will decrease the degree to which a certain object belongs to an undesired status and increase the degree to which it belongs to a desired one. Our algorithm takes into account the fuzzy cost of actions, and further, it attempts to maximize the fuzzy net profit. The contribution of the work is in taking the output from fuzzy decision trees, and producing novel, actionable knowledge through automatic fuzzy post-processing. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with Yang's method using several real-life datasets taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms Yang's method not only in finding more actions but also in finding actions with more fuzzy net profit.

Lots of image processing techniques have been used for its detection but still there is room for improvement. In this paper a novel region based ACM with Otsu preprocessing technique is proposed for the segmentation phase of the lung nodule detection. From segmented images features are extracted and for classification SVM classifier is used. We have used the dataset of 12 images taken from LIDC. The proposed technique provides very proficient results. For comparative analysis we have also tested it with other different segmentation techniques. It is evaluated that proposed techniques has several advantages over the others. It can efficiently detect the boundaries of lung part from images, irrespective of contour initial position. It takes less computation time and no of iterations than others. Moreover it can also detect weak and blur boundary in images. Experimental analysis on the lung images reveals the advantages of the proposed technique over geodesic active contours (GAC), Chan-Vese (C-V) active contours, simple ACM and DRLSE in terms of both effectiveness and accuracy. With this view, the present study will facilitate the radiologist as well as the physicians.
