The algorithm run-times are below 1 s for typical applications despite the exponential worst-case time complexity. The user chooses the model with the best comprehensibility-accuracy trade-off from the Pareto front which enables a well informed decision or repeats finding new Pareto fronts with modified seeds. For a classification trees as the comprehensible seed, the hybrids include single black-box model, invoked in hybrid leaves. The comprehensibility of such hybrid classifiers is measured with the proportion of examples classified by the regular leaves. We propose one simple and one computationally efficient algorithm for finding the Pareto optimal hybrid trees, starting from an initial classification tree and a black-box classifier. We evaluate the proposed algorithms empirically, comparing them to the baseline solution set, showing that they often provide valuable improvements. Furthermore, we show that the efficient algorithm outperforms the NSGA-II algorithm in terms of quality of the result set and efficiency (for this optimisation problem). Finally we show that the algorithm returns hybrid classifiers that reflect the expert's knowledge on activity recognition problem well.

We propose a novel approach based on the Multiple Contexts Ensemble (MCE) algorithm which classifies the activity with an ensemble of classifiers, each of which considers the problem in the context of a single feature. The improvement stems from using multiple viewpoints, based on accelerometer data only, designed specifically to distinguish standing from sitting. This approach improves the accuracy on the two activities by 24 percentage points compared to regular machine learning.

Online LDA uses stochastic gradient optimization technology to speed the convergence; however the large noise of stochastic gradients leads to slower convergence and worse performance. In this paper, we employ the momentum term to smooth out the noise of stochastic gradients, and propose an extension of Online LDA, namely Momentum Online LDA (MOLDA). We collect a large-scale corpus consisting of 2M documents to evaluate our model. Experimental results indicate that MOLDA achieves faster convergence and better performance than the state-of-the-art.

It follows a chronic course and persists up to 15 years after onset. Early detection of an exacerbation followed by the application of specific drugs for a few days can considerably reduce disease activity and avoid temporary disability. However, dermatitis patients usually rely on their own perception in assessing their skin condition and therefore often miss the time point for effective treatment. In this paper we present a prototype-based feasibility study of automated detection and quantification of hand eczema using texton-based imaging and machine-learning techniques.

It is based on pressing a stylus (reed) on clay tablets, resulting in wedge marks (cuneiforms) which, when combined, provide meaningful symbols. Applying modern machine learning methods to the study of ancient cuneiform tablets is a fascinating task. In the present paper we describe a method for extracting geometrical features of the wedges imprinted by the stylus that is used for writing. We introduce two independent feature extraction methods to describe the wedges. The data for this study come from precise optical scans of three tablets, originating from different historical periods. We use these tablets to demonstrate the validity of our extracted features, and to demonstrate the accuracy of classifying the different tablets.

The selection and use of sampling strategy is core of active learning. Most active learning methods select those uncertain or representative unlabeled samples to query their labels. And some of the active learning methods consider both in the query selection. However, the uncertainty sampling methods rely on the relative correctness or confidence of the current model and suffer from a lack of the feature space. The representative sampling methods avoid the drawbacks associated with uncertainty sampling, but tend not to improve the learning model very efficiently. The combining methods are lack of the consideration of sample redundancy. This paper proposes a multicriterion active learning technique for solving multiclass problems. First, use the Best-versus-Second-Best (BvSB) method to calculate the sample's uncertainty and then select the most valuable component to constitute the uncertain set; further, use the kernel k-means clustering algorithm and the resulting sample set is divided into h different clusters; finally, use Gaussian process to select the most informative sample in each cluster and submit to human experts for annotation. The results show that the labeling cost can be reduced without degrading the performance.

The research of recognition technology of CAPTCHA has a great benefit for increasing the machine learning ability and aiding to designing high security code. The work in this paper focuses on the most difficult adhesion code in picture. At present, the traditional methods which depend heavily on segmentation will become invalid for most adhesion picture code. To resolve the problem, an integrated recognition algorithm based on mask matching is presented in this paper. The recognition of picture code is completed regardless of segmentation and noise removal beforehand. Especially, the matching degree is controlled by a fuzzy factor which can be adjusted automatically to meet with the picture code. During mask creation, two kinds of methods are provided. Finally, a series of experiments from different websites demonstrate that the algorithm can crack all kinds of picture codes and has a satisfied performance in time and popularity.

However, the performance of classifier depends largely on training dataset we have at the very beginning. When an imbalanced sentiment appears (different classes have different numbers of labeled data in training dataset), the trained traditional semi-supervised classifiers tend to show poor performance in low-frequency classes. In this paper, we propose an effective method, called normalized label propagation algorithm (NLP), to solve the imbalance problem. With an independent assumption, NLP can balance the initial label information of different classes. Experimental results on different datasets show the better adaptability and higher classification accuracy of our proposed method.

The goal of image quality assessment (IQA) algorithms is to automatically assess the quality of images/videos in agreement with human quality judgments. Up to now, two kinds of models have been used for IQA, namely full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR) models. For FR models, IQA algorithms interpret image quality as fidelity or similarity with a perfect image in some perceptual space. However, the reference image is not available in many practical applications, and a NR IQA approach is desired. Considering natural vision as optimized by the millions of years of evolutionary pressure, many methods attempt to achieve consistency in quality prediction by modeling salient physiological and psychological features of the human visual system (HVS). To reach this goal, researchers try to simulate HVS with image sparsity coding and supervised machine learning, which are two main features of HVS. A typical HVS captures the scenes by sparsity coding, and uses experienced knowledge to apperceive objects. In this paper, we propose a novel IQA approach based on visual perception. Firstly, a standard model of HVS is studied and analyzed, and the sparse representation of image is accomplished with the model; and then, the mapping correlation between sparse codes and subjective quality scores is trained with the regression technique of least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM), which gains the regressor that can predict the image quality; the visual metric of image is predicted with the trained regressor at last. We validate the performance of proposed approach on Laboratory for Image & Video Engineering (LIVE) database, the specific contents of the type of distortions present in the database are: 227 images of JPEG2000, 233 images of JPEG, 174 images of White Noise, 174 images of Gaussian Blur, 174 images of Fast Fading. The database includes subjective differential mean opinion score (DMOS) for each image. The experimental results show that the proposed approach not only can assess many kinds of distorted images quality, but also exhibits a superior accuracy and monotonicity.

It is a critical and challenging task in image processing. Classical restorations require explicit knowledge of the point spread function and a description of the noise as priors. However, it is not practical for many real image processing. The recovery processing needs to be a blind image restoration scenario. Since blind deconvolution is an ill-posed problem, many blind restoration methods need to make additional assumptions to construct restrictions. Due to the differences of PSF and noise energy, blurring images can be quite different. It is difficult to achieve a good balance between proper assumption and high restoration quality in blind deconvolution. Recently, machine learning techniques have been applied to blind image restoration. The least square support vector regression (LSSVR) has been proven to offer strong potential in estimating and forecasting issues. Therefore, this paper proposes a LSSVR-based image restoration method. However, selecting the optimal parameters for support vector machine is essential to the training result. As a novel meta-heuristic algorithm, the fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) can be used to handle optimization problems, and has the advantages of fast convergence to the global optimal solution. In the proposed method, the training samples are created from a neighborhood in the degraded image to the central pixel in the original image. The mapping between the degraded image and the original image is learned by training LSSVR. The two parameters of LSSVR are optimized though FOA. The fitness function of FOA is calculated by the restoration error function. With the acquired mapping, the degraded image can be recovered. Experimental results show the proposed method can obtain satisfactory restoration effect. Compared with BP neural network regression, SVR method and Lucy-Richardson algorithm, it speeds up the restoration rate and performs better. Both objective and subjective restoration performances are studied in the comparison experiments.

It is important to change the current situation and control the electronic devices intelligently according to the number and the distribution of the students in the classroom, so as to reduce the considerable waste of electronic resources. This paper studies the problem of people counting in classroom based on video surveillance. As the camera in the classroom can not get the full shape contour information of bodies and the clear features information of faces, most of the classical algorithms such as the pedestrian detection method based on HOG (histograms of oriented gradient) feature and the face detection method based on machine learning are unable to obtain a satisfied result. A new kind of dual background updating model based on sparse and low-rank matrix decomposition is proposed in this paper, according to the fact that most of the students in the classroom are almost in stationary state and there are body movement occasionally. Firstly, combining the frame difference with the sparse and low-rank matrix decomposition to predict the moving areas, and updating the background model with different parameters according to the positional relationship between the pixels of current video frame and the predicted motion regions. Secondly, the regions of moving objects are determined based on the updated background using the background subtraction method. Finally, some operations including binarization, median filtering and morphology processing, connected component detection, etc. are performed on the regions acquired by the background subtraction, in order to induce the effects of the noise and obtain the number of people in the classroom. The experiment results show the validity of the algorithm of people counting.

Continuous virtual views can be generated by using depth image based rendering (DIBR) technique. DIBR process includes geometric mapping, hole filling and merging. Unique weights, inversely proportional to the distance between the virtual and real cameras, are used to merge the virtual views. However, the weights might not the optimal ones in terms of virtual view quality. In this paper, a novel virtual view merging algorithm is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, machine learning method is utilized to establish an optimal weight model. In the model, color, depth, color gradient and sequence parameters are taken into consideration. Firstly, we render the same virtual view from left and right views, and select the training samples by using a threshold. Then, the eigenvalues of the samples are extracted and the optimal merging weights are calculated as training labels. Finally, support vector classifier (SVC) is adopted to establish the model which is used for guiding virtual views rendering. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the quality of virtual views for most sequences. Especially, it is effective in the case of large distance between the virtual and real cameras. And compared to the original method of virtual view synthesis, the proposed method can obtain more than 0.1dB gain for some sequences.

To reduce the risks associated with Trojans, researchers have proposed different approaches to detect them. Among these approaches, test-time detection approaches have drawn the greatest attention and most approaches assume the existence of a "golden model". Prior works suggest using reverse-engineering to identify such Trojan-free ICs for the golden model but they did not state how to do this efficiently. In this paper, we propose an innovative and robust reverse-engineering approach to identify the Trojan-free ICs. We adapt a well-studied machine learning method, one-class support vector machine, to solve our problem. Simulation results using state-of-the-art tools on several publicly available circuits show that our approach can detect hardware Trojans with high accuracy rate across different modeling and algorithm parameters.

This paper establishes a machine learning based model to improve and automate the procedure in silicon data analysis for HVM test content development. Our experiment shows that the supervised learning model has good accuracy on VMIN estimation across various kinds of Shmoo issues (crack/sprinkle/ceiling). The accuracy attained is greatly improved over previous tools. The framework can be easily integrated into any automated tester software and would save time to market during first silicon characterization.

Estimation of surface soil moisture in alpine areas based on medium spatial resolution SAR time-series and upscaled in-situ measurements	SAR IMAGE ANALYSIS, MODELING, AND TECHNIQUES XIV	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on SAR Image Analysis, Modeling, and Techniques XIV	SEP 24-25, 2014	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	SPIE			SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; RADARSAT2 IMAGES; RETRIEVAL; WATER	The goal of this study was to assess the applicability of medium resolution SAR time-series, in combination with in-situ point measurements and machine learning, for the estimation of soil moisture content (SMC). One of the main challenges was the combination of SMC point measurements and satellite data. Due to the high spatial variability of soil moisture a direct linkage can be inappropriate. Data used in this study were a combination of in-situ data, satellite data and modelled SMC from the hydrological model GEOtop. To relate the point measurements with the satellite pixel footprint resolution, a spatial upscaling method was developed. It was found that both temporal and spatial SMC patterns obtained from various data sources (ASAR WS, GEOtop and meteorological stations) show similar behaviors. Furthermore, it was possible to increase the absolute accuracy of the estimated SMC through spatial upscaling of the obtained in-situ data. Introducing information on the temporal behavior of the SAR signal proves to be a promising method to increase the confidence and accuracy of SMC estimations. Following steps were identified as critical for the retrieval process: the topographic correction and geocoding of SAR data, the calibration of the meteorological stations and the spatial upscaling.

Text features specialized for Chinese are developed, which include the surface, part of speech, parse tree and entropy features. The experimental results demonstrate that both linear and log-linear regression models are worthy of confidence for readability assessment, and can achieve competitive performance to other machine learning methods, such as SVR (Support Vector Machine for Regression). Also the designed features are valuable, and feature ranking is essential to build useful linear functions.

It is imperative that cyber security go beyond password based systems to avoid criminal activities. A human biometric and emotion based recognition framework implemented in parallel can enable applications to access personal or public information securely. The focus of this paper is on the study of speech based emotion recognition using a pattern recognition paradigm with spectral feature extraction and an ensemble of k nearest neighbor (kNN) classifiers. The five spectral features are the linear predictive cepstrum (CEP), mel frequency cepstrum (MFCC), line spectral frequencies (LSF), adaptive component weighted cepstrum (ACW) and the post-filter cepstrum (PFL). The bagging algorithm is used to train the ensemble of kNNs. Fusion is implicitly accomplished by ensemble classification. The LDC emotional prosody speech database is used in all the experiments. Results show that the maximum gain in performance is achieved by using two kNNs as opposed to using a single kNN.

Therefore, machine learning techniques like Neural Network or Genetic Programming (GP) are used by practitioners for modeling nonlinear and irregular time series. GP is preferred over other techniques because it does not presume model structure a priori. This paper introduces the use of Postfix-GP, a postfix notation based GP, for real-world nonlinear time series modeling problems. The Postfix-GP uses linear genome representation and stack based evaluation to reduce space-time complexity of GP. The Postfix-GP is applied on two real time series modeling problems: sunspots and river flow series. Performance of evolved Postfix-GP models on training data and out-of-sample data are compared with those obtained by others using EGIPSYS. The obtained results indicate that Postfix-GP offers a new possibility for solving time series modeling and prediction problems.

Although a text document expresses a wide range of information, but it lacks the imposed structure of tradition database. Thus, unstructured data, particularly free running text data has to be transferred into a structured data. Hence, in this paper we represent the text document unconventionally by making use of symbolic data analysis concepts. We propose a new method of representing documents based on clustering of term frequency vectors. Term frequency vectors of each cluster are used to form a symbolic representation by the use of Mean and Standard Deviation. Further, term frequency vectors are used in the form a interval valued features. To cluster the term frequency vectors, we make use of Single Linkage, Complete Linkage, Average Linkage, K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithms. To corroborate the efficacy of the proposed model we conducted extensive experimentations on standard datasets like 20 Newsgroup Large, 20 Mini Newsgroup, Vehicles Wikipedia datasets and our own created datasets like Google Newsgroup and Research Article Abstracts. Experimental results reveal that the proposed model gives better results when compared to the state of the art techniques. In addition, as the method is based on a simple matching scheme, it requires a negligible time.	[Harish, B. S.; Kumar, S. V.

In recent years, because the traditional classifier algorithms are designed only for balanced cases, these classifiers always achieved poor performance in imbalanced data classification issues, especially for the imbalanced data with a really high density. This paper introduces the importance of imbalanced data classification in various fields first; then, contends existing methods of solving the imbalanced data classification problem; finally, proposes two new sampling methods, which are based on borderline-SMOTE, for the imbalanced data with high density, especially for big data with this kind of distribution feature. These two new algorithms are not only over-sampling the minority samples near the borderline, but also creating appropriate synthetic samples in the majority class samples side and under-sampling some particular majority class samples. Experiments show that these two algorithms could achieve a better performance than random over sampling, SMOTE (Synthetic minority over-sampling technique) and Borderline-SMOTE in AUC (Area under Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve) metric evaluate method, when the sampling rate makes the majority class and minority class samples approximate equilibrium.

Sparse coding provides a class of unsupervised algorithms for learning a set of over-complete basis functions, allowing to reconstruct the original signal by linearly combining a small subset of the bases. A shortcoming of most existing sparse coding algorithms is that they need to do some sort of iterative minimization to inference the sparse representations for test points, which means that it's not convenient for these algorithms to perform out-of-sample extension. By additionally training a non-linear regressor that maps input to sparse representation during the training procedure, predictive sparse decomposition (PSD) can naturally be used for out-of-sample extension. Hence, PSD has recently become one of the most famous learning algorithms for sparse coding. However, when the training set is not large enough to capture the variations of the sample, PSD may not achieve satisfactory performance in real applications. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called denoising PSD (DPSD), for robust sparse coding. Experiments on real visual object recognition tasks show that DPSD can dramatically outperform PSD in real applications.

Several learning approaches have been proposed to help developers during the maintenance process. Most of the proposed approaches do not process the curse of dimensionality and the semantic contained in the information structure. A novel semantic-based method for ontology learning, which can provide improvement in both alignment and learning, is described. Good comparisons with the experimental studies demonstrate the multidisciplinary applications of our approach. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Enhancing Rule-Based Event Coder with Semantic Vectors	COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS	Procedia Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Conquering Complexity - Challenges and Opportunities	NOV 03-05, 2014	Philadelphia, PA	Missouri Univ Sci & Technol		NLP; semantic vectors; Random Indexing; event coding; rule-based system; machine learning	CONFLICT	Rule based systems have achieved success in applications such as information retrieval and Natural Language Processing. However, due to the rigidity of pattern matching, these systems typically require a large number of rules to adequately cover the variations of expression in unstructured text. Consequently, knowledge engineering for a new domain and knowledge maintenance for a fielded system are labor intensive and expensive. In this paper, we present our research on enhancing a rule-based event coding system by relaxing the rigidity of pattern matching with a technique that formulates and matches patterns of the semantics of words instead of literal words. Our technique pairs literal words with semantic vectors that accumulate word meaning from the context of use of the word found in dictionaries, ontologies, and domain corpora. Our method improves the speed, accuracy, and coverage of the event coding algorithm without additional knowledge engineering effort. Operating on semantics instead of syntax, the improved system eases the workload of human analysts who screen input text for critical events. Our algorithms are based on high-dimensional distributed representations, and their effectiveness and versatility derive from the unintuitive properties of such representations-from the mathematical properties of high-dimensional spaces. Our current implementation encodes words, phrases, and rule patterns as semantic vectors using WordNet, We have started experimental evaluation using a large newswire dataset.

In such settings, due to excessive noise, original data suffers loss of statistical significance despite the strong levels of confidentiality assured by differential privacy. This in turn makes the privatized data practically-valueless to the consumer of the published data. Additionally, researchers have noted that finding equilibrium between data privacy and utility requirements remains intractable, necessitating tradeoffs. Therefore, as a contribution, we propose using the moving average filtering model for non-interactive differential privacy settings. In this model, various levels of differential privacy (DP) are applied to a data set, generating a variety of privatized data sets. The privatized data is passed through a moving average filter and the new filtered privatized data sets that meet a set utility threshold are finally published. Preliminary results from this study show that adjustment of e epsilon parameter in the differential privacy process, and the application of the moving average filter might generate better data utility output while conserving privacy in non-interactive differential privacy settings.

Microarray data generated from oncological studies typically contain thousands of expression values with few cases. Traditional regression and classification methods require first reducing the number of dimensions via statistical or heuristic methods. Partial Least Squares (PLS) is a dimensionality reduction method that builds a least squares regression model in a reduced dimensional space. It is well known that Support Vector Machines (SVM) outperform least squares regression models. In this study, we replace the PLS least squares model with a SVM model in the PLS reduced dimensional space. To verify our method, we build upon our previous work with a publicly available data set from the Gene Expression Omnibus database containing gene expression levels, clinical data, and survival times for patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. Using 5-fold cross validation, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, we show a comparison of classifier performance between the traditional PLS model and the PLS/SVM hybrid. Our results show that replacing least squares regression with SVM, we increase the quality of the model as measured by the area under the ROC curve. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This associative memorization architecture is constructed by using deep learning architecture. Challenging purpose of our research is the development of the new composition system that automatically creates a new music based on some existing music. How does a human composer make musical compositions or pieces? Generally speaking, music piece is generated by the cyclic analysis process and re-synthesis process of musical features in music creation procedures. This process can be simulated by learning models using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture. The first and critical problem is how to describe the music data, because, in those models, description format for this data has a great influence on learning performance and function. Almost of related works adopt symbolic representation methods of music data. However, we believe human composers never treat a music piece as a symbol. Therefore raw music audio signals are input to our system. The constructed associative model memorizes musical features of music audio signals, and regenerates sequential data of that music. Based on experimental results of memorizing music audio data, we verify the performances and effectiveness of our system. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, wind forecasts, and in particular daily peak wind gust forecasts, provide the public with a general sense of the risks associated with wind on a given day and are useful in decision making Additionally, such knowledge is critical for wind energy production. Currently, no operational daily peak wind gust product exists. As such, this project will seek to develop a peak wind gust prediction scheme based on output from an operational numerical weather prediction model. Output from the North American Mesoscale (NAM) model will be used in a support vector regression (SVR) algorithm trained to predict daily peak wind gusts for ten cities commonly impacted by hazardous wind gusts (cities in the Midwest and central Plains) and with interests in wind energy. Output from a kernel principal component analysis of the fully three-dimensional atmosphere as characterized by the NAM forecasts will be used to predict peak wind gusts for each location at 36 hours lead time. Ultimately, this initial product will lead to the development of a more robust prediction scheme that could one day transition into an operational forecast model. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

While dynamic pricing is not new & used by many to increase sales and margins, its benefit to online retailers is immense. The proposed study is a result of ongoing project that aims to develop a generic framework and applicable techniques by applying sound machine learning algorithms to enhance right price purchase (not cheapest price) by customers on e-commerce platform. This study focuses more on inventory led e-commerce companies, however the model can be extended to online marketplaces without inventories. Facilitated by statistical and machine learning models the study seeks to predict the purchase decisions based on adaptive or dynamic pricing of a product. Different data sources which capture visit attributes, visitor attributes, purchase history, web data, and context understanding, lays a strong foundation to this framework. The study focuses on customer segments for predicting purchase rather than on individual buyers. Personalization of adaptive pricing and purchase prediction will be the next logical extension of the study once the results for this are presented. Web mining and use of big data technologies along with machine learning algorithms make up the solution landscape for the study. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A number of existing models includes Weight of Evidence, Knowledge-driven Fuzzy, Data-driven Fuzzy, Neural-Network, Bayesian Classifier and Geostatistical Kriging. We offer classification models developed in our laboratory, where point pattern analysis was used to identify presence or absence of a known secondary alluvial (cassiterite) deposits in the Nigerian Younger Granite Region (NYGR) and the model performance assessed. We focused on the training and testing data split using longitudinal spatial data splitting (strips and halves) to ensure predictive attribute's independence. The spatial data split runs counter to the traditional random sample data selection as a procedure for checking overfitting of models mainly due to spatial data autocorrelation. Specifically, we used classification algorithms such as; Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree Bagging and Discriminant Analysis algorithms for training and testing. We analysed the model's performance results using model predictive accuracy and ROC curve values in two different approaches that improve spatial data independence among predictive attributes to give a meaningful model performance.

During the past decade or over, the concepts and techniques on data mining have been presented, and some of them have been discussed in higher levels for the last few years. Data mining involves an integration of techniques from database, artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, knowledge engineering, object-oriented method, information retrieval, high-performance computing and visualization.

In this paper, we propose a spheriform quantization method based on sub-region inherent dimension, which induces the quantified interval number and size in data-driven way. The method assumes that a quantified cluster of points can be contained in a lower intrinsic m-dimensional spheriform space of expected radius. These sample points in the spheriform can be obtained by adaptively selecting the neighborhood at initial observation based on sub-region inherent dimension. Experimental results and analysis on UCI real data sets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the accuracy of classification than traditional quantization methods by implementing C4.5 decision tree.

In computer science and related fields, artificial neural networks are computational models inspired by animals' central nervous systems (in particular the brain) that are capable of machine learning and pattern recognition. They are usually presented as systems of interconnected "neurons" that can compute values from inputs by feeding information through the network. Like other machine learning methods, neural networks have been used to solve a wide variety of tasks that are hard to solve using ordinary rule-based programming, including computer vision and speech recognition.

An important task is to summarize a set of relevant features of the views of Beijing in order to obtain the feature vectors of the sample news. Based on these features, the random sample contents of a great deal of latest news are clustered, which investigates whether the news is a hot topic. On the basis of the selected robust and accurate classification algorithm, the support vector machine is used to map the vectors into a higher dimensional space to establish a hyperplane with the maximum margin, and then two parallel hyperplanes are established respectively on each side of the hyperplane which separates the data and maximizes the distance between the two parallel hyperplanes for the purpose of data classification. In the process of machine learning, the composition, the measurement and the weight of the feature vectors are modified and improve through trials and errors, thus to realize the accurate forecasting of international views of Beijing.

Previous approaches can be grouped into three categories: supervised, unsupervised and knowledge-based. The accuracy of supervised methods is the highest, but they suffer from knowledge acquisition bottleneck. Unsupervised method can avoid knowledge acquisition bottleneck, but its effect is not satisfactory. With the built-up of large-scale knowledge, knowledge-based approach has attracted more and more attention. This paper introduces a new context weighting method, and based on which proposes a novel semi-supervised approach for word sense disambiguation. The significant contribution of our method is that thesaurus and machine learning techniques are integrated in word sense disambiguation. Compared with the state of the art on the test data of the English all words disambiguation task in Sensaval-3, our method yields obvious improvements over existing methods in nouns, adjectives and verbs disambiguation.

Alzheimers Dis Neuroimaging Initia	ApoE4 effects on automated diagnostic classifiers for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; Abeta; Tau; Hippocampus atrophy; ADNI; Diagnosis	CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID TAU; NEUROIMAGING INITIATIVE ADNI; CSF BIOMARKERS; HIPPOCAMPAL ATROPHY; MRI BIOMARKERS; MCI SUBJECTS; BRAIN; DEMENTIA; MARKERS; MEMORY	Biomarkers are the only feasible way to detect and monitor presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD). No single biomarker can predict future cognitive decline with an acceptable level of accuracy. In addition to designing powerful multimodal diagnostic platforms, a careful investigation of the major sources of disease heterogeneity and their influence on biomarker changes is needed. Here we investigated the accuracy of a novel multimodal biomarker classifier for differentiating cognitively normal (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD subjects with and without stratification by ApoE4 genotype. 111 NC, 182 MCI and 95 AD ADNI participants provided both structural MRI and CSF data at baseline. We used an automated machine-learning classifier to test the ability of hippocampal volume and CSF A beta, t-tau and p-tau levels, both separately and in combination, to differentiate NC, MCI and AD subjects, and predict conversion. We hypothesized that the combined hippocampal/CSF biomarker classifier model would achieve the highest accuracy in differentiating between the three diagnostic groups and that ApoE4 genotype will affect both diagnostic accuracy and biomarker selection. The combined hippocampal/CSF classifier performed better than hippocampus-only classifier in differentiating NC from MCI and NC from AD. It also outperformed the CSF-only classifier in differentiating NC vs. AD. Our amyloid marker played a role in discriminating NC from MCI or AD but not for MCI vs. AD. Neurodegenerative markers contributed to accurate discrimination of AD from NC and MCI but not NC from MCI. Classifiers predicting MCI conversion performed well only after ApoE4 stratification. Hippocampal volume and sex achieved AUC = 0.68 for predicting conversion in the ApoE4-positive MCI, while CSF p-tau, education and sex achieved AUC = 0.89 for predicting conversion in ApoE4-negative MCI. These observations support the proposed biomarker trajectory in AD, which postulates that amyloid markers become abnormal early in the disease course while markers of neurodegeneration become abnormal later in the disease course and suggests that ApoE4 could be at least partially responsible for some of the observed disease heterogeneity.

Certain imaging features based upon early computerized tomography (CT), in combination with clinical variables, have been found to predict SICH, albeit with modest accuracy. In this proof-of-concept study, we determine whether machine learning of CT images can predict which patients receiving tPA will develop SICH as opposed to showing clinical improvement with no haemorrhage. Clinical records and CT brains of 116 acute ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis were collected retrospectively (including 16 who developed SICH). The sample was split into training (n = 106) and test sets (n = 10), repeatedly for 1760 different combinations. CT brain images acted as inputs into a support vector machine (SVM), along with clinical severity. Performance of the SVM was compared with established prognostication tools (SEDAN and HAT scores; original, or after adaptation to our cohort). Predictive performance, assessed as area under receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), of the SVM (0.744) compared favourably with that of prognostic scores (original and adapted versions: 0.626-0.720; p < 0.01). The SVM also identified 9 out of 16 SICHs, as opposed to 1-5 using prognostic scores, assuming a 10% SICH frequency (p < 0.001). In summary, machine learning methods applied to acute stroke CT images offer automation, and potentially improved performance, for prediction of SICH following thrombolysis. Larger-scale cohorts, and incorporation of advanced imaging, should be tested with such methods. (C) 2014 The Authors. The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abnormal brain structure in youth who commit homicide	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Voxel-based morphometry (VBM); Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Incarcerated adolescents; Pattern classifier; Support vector machine (SVM); Gray matter volume	ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY-DISORDER; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; GRAY-MATTER; ADOLESCENT OFFENDERS; PSYCHOPATHY FEATURES; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; CONDUCT DISORDER; SCHIZOPHRENIA; BEHAVIOR	Background: Violence that leads to homicide results in an extreme financial and emotional burden on society. Juveniles who commit homicide are often tried in adult court and typically spend the majority of their lives in prison. Despite the enormous costs associated with homicidal behavior, there have been no serious neuroscientific studies examining youth who commit homicide. Methods: Here we use neuroimaging and voxel-based morphometry to examine brain gray matter in incarcerated male adolescents who committed homicide (n = 20) compared with incarcerated offenders who did not commit homicide (n = 135). Two additional control groups were used to understand further the nature of gray matter differences: incarcerated offenders who did not commit homicide matched on important demographic and psychometric variables (n = 20) and healthy participants from the community (n = 21). Results: Compared with incarcerated adolescents who did not commit homicide (n = 135), incarcerated homicide offenders had reduced gray matter volumes in the medial and lateral temporal lobes, including the hippocampus and posterior insula. Feature selection and support vector machine learning classified offenders into the homicide and non-homicide groups with 81% overall accuracy. Conclusions: Our results indicate that brain structural differences may help identify those at the highest risk for committing serious violent offenses. (C) 2014 The Authors.

These systems are composed by several phases, being one of the most important ones the phase for the prediction of the plant situation in a given time. In a previous work, we presented a machine-learning approach for this prediction phase that replaced the need of developing a single mathematical function with a more generic classification approach. However, standalone classifiers had some drawbacks like to select the most adequate classification models for the learning data and task. In this paper we extend our previous work with a general method to foresee Dross defects building a meta-classification system through the combination of different methods and removing the need of selecting the best algorithm for each objective or dataset.

In a smart grid, Distributed Generation (DG) has gained much attention due to numerous advantages. However, inappropriate selection of DG allocation nodes may increase the total power loss of the distribution system. Therefore, it is important to identify similar type of nodes where energy efficient DG allocation is possible. In this paper, Constriction Factor Particle Swarm Optimization (CF-PSO), which is a major variant of Swarm Intelligence (SI), has been used with traditional well studied k-means algorithm to enhance the clustering performance. Experiments are performed considering test data from UCI repository of machine learning databases which shows that the CF-PSO based hybrid clustering outperforms the traditional k-means algorithm. This improved clustering algorithm is then employed to identify the potential nodes for DG allocation using loss sensitivity indices. Extensive experiments have been carried out considering IEEE benchmark 123 node test distribution system to justify the clustering output. Results show that the clustering algorithm provides an insight to select the appropriate DG integration nodes for power loss reduction.

Generating blast furnace gas changes non-linearly, so the traditional prediction method is difficult to deal with it. Least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), which is a machine learning method based on statistical learning theory, can be good to solve non-linear problems. It will be established a LSSVM model to predict the number of blast furnace gas in this article. However, LSSVM forecasting precision for the model parameters are very sensitive. In order to achieve more ideal effect, this paper is introduced a kind of improved genetic algorithm to optimize the parameters of LSSVM model. Instruct a short-term forecasting model of blast furnace gas based on genetic algorithm and LSSVM so as to improve the prediction accuracy of forecasting model.

Gaussian Process for Learning Solar Panel Maximum Power Point Characteristics as Functions of Environmental Conditions	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2014 9TH IEEE CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS AND APPLICATIONS (ICIEA)	IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications		English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA)	JUN 09-11, 2014	Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, Zhengjiang Univ Technol, IEEE Ind Elect Chapter Singapore Sect, Zhejiang Key Lab Signal Proc, Zhejiang Inst Signal Proc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Hangzhou Tourism Promot Ctr, Hangzhou Tourism Commiss, Hangzhou M I C E Assoc, Tourist Board of Zhejiang Prov		Gaussian Process; Machine Learning; MPPT; Solar panel simulation		This paper proposes a method to learn the variation of solar panel Maximum Power Point (MPP) parameters as functions of environmental conditions using Gaussian Process (GP) based machine learning. As a result of using GP, functions are learned along with the additional information of their uncertainty margins. The paper discusses about learning three functions specifically, where each of them take the two environmental variables 'solar irradiance' and 'cell temperature' as arguments and map these environmental variables to the corresponding MPP parameters, namely, the maximum power, the MPP voltage and the MPP current. Learned functions presented in the paper have been trained for a commercially available solar panel using MPP data generated using a previously published solar panel simulator. The learned function for maximum power has been validated by comparing the function outputs (GP results) against the manufacturer specified power values. A discussion about how learning such functions can help in advancing MPP Tracking (MPPT) is also provoked while highlighting the impact machine learning can make to the field of photovoltaics.

The method utilizes time domain signals produced by a commercially available pulsed Eddy current sensor. Data produced by the sensor are used to train a Gaussian Process model and perform inference of the remaining metal volume. The Gaussian Process model was learned using sensor data obtained from cast iron calibration plates of various thicknesses. Results produced by the Gaussian Process model were validated against the remaining wall thickness acquired using a high resolution laser scanner after the pipes were sandblasted to remove corrosion. The evaluation shows agreement between model outputs and ground truth. The paper concludes by discussing the implications or results and how the proposed method can potentially advance the current technological setup by facilitating real time pipe profiling.

We do meticulous division, scaling transformation and principal component analysis on the optic disc and optic cup boundary lines to extract features. The extracted features correspond well with doctors' knowledge. Therefore, we can make an intuitive explanation for the diagnosis results to doctors, rather than just as a black-box prediction.

This means that it provides machine learning techniques for clustering of multiple user characteristics. Multifactorial classification is conducted by the k-means clustering algorithm which takes as input seven important users' characteristics in order to initialize the process. The clustering is conducted by k-means clustering algorithm, which takes as input multiple user characteristics, in order to initialize the process. The aforementioned characteristics tend to influence the educational procedure. K-means algorithm creates clusters based on data from empirical studies. After determining in which cluster each new student belongs, the system can reason about this specific student, adapting its behavior to the user's needs. The resulting adaptation emerges from the analysis of each cluster's characteristics that derive from each cluster as a superset of already existing user models. The communication between the system and its potential users as students is accomplished through the use of web services.

The K-means algorithm is one which is widely used algorithm for clustering of data sets and is easy to understand and simulate on different datasets. In our paper work we have used K-means algorithm for clustering of yeast dataset and iris datasets, in which clustering resulted in less accuracy with more number of iterations. We are simulating an improved version in K-means algorithm for clustering of these datasets, the Improved K-means algorithm use the technique of minimum spanning tree. An undirected graph is generated for all the input data points and then shortest distance is calculated which intern results in better accuracy and also with less number of iterations. Both algorithms have been simulated using java programming language; the results obtained from both algorithms are been compared and analyzed. Algorithms have been run for several times under different clustering groups and the analysis results showed that the Improved K- means algorithm has provided a better performance as compared to K-means algorithm; also Improved K-means algorithm showed that, as the number of cluster values increases the accuracy of the algorithm also increases. Also we have inferred from the results that at a particular value of K (cluster groups) the accuracy of Improved K-means algorithm is optimal.	[Abhilash, C.

Text line segmentation in such documents remains an open document analysis problem. Detection and correction of skew angle of the segmented text lines become another important step in document analysis. Most of the segmentation algorithms, for skewed text lines, present in the literature today are sensitive to the degree of skew, direction of skew, and spacing between adjacent lines. In this paper, proposed method for the text line extraction and skew correction of the extracted text lines uses a new cost function, which considers the spacing between text lines and the skew of each text line is used. Precisely, the problem is formulated as an energy minimization problem so that the minimization of the cost function yields a set of text lines. Further it is required to efficiently correct baseline skew and fluctuations of these text lines. This proposed method also uses an efficient algorithm for baseline correction. It consists of normalizing the lower baseline to a horizontal line using a skating window approaches, thus, avoiding the segmentation of text lines into subparts. This approach copes with baselines which arc skewed, fluctuating, or both. It differs from machine learning approaches which need manual pixel assignments to baselines. Experimental results show that this baseline correction approach highly improves performance.

This form of data mining has to be distinguished from market basket analysis where the data comes from a single relational table. Although ILP addresses the problem of dealing with data from multiple relational tables, the fact remains that the efficiency of inferring rules in first order logic is significantly less than that of many-sorted logic. Further, many sorted logic is a closer reflection of the real world of objects that belong to sorts, in the presence of a sort hierarchy. We propose a new approach to ILP using many-sorted logic that is more computationally efficient than the approach based on unsorted first order logic.

The problem of feature selection is multi-objective in nature and hence optimizing feature subsets with respect to any single evaluation criteria is not sufficient [1]. Moreover, discovering a single best subset of features is not of much interest. In fact, finding several feature subsets reflecting a trade off among several objective criteria is more beneficial as it provides the users a broad choice for feature subset selection. Thus, in order to combine several feature selection criteria, we propose multi-objective optimization of feature subsets using Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm. This work is an attempt to discover non-dominated feature subsets of smaller cardinality with high predictive power and least redundancy. To meet this purpose we have used NSGA II, a well known Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), for discovering non-dominated feature subsets for the task of classification. The main contribution of this paper is the design of a novel multi-objective fitness function consisting of information gain, mutual correlation and size of the feature subset as the multi-optimization criteria. The suggested approach is validated on seven datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. Support Vector Machine, a well tested classification algorithm is used to measure the classification accuracy. The results confirm that the proposed system is able to discover diverse optimal feature subsets that are well spread in the overall feature space and the classification accuracy of the resulting feature subsets is reasonably high.

Hard disk and server failures are not frequent but are often very costly. Such failures can have a very adverse effect on the business of an organization. The ability to accurately predict an impending disk or server failure can add an essential functionality for designing a reliable, fault tolerant and continuously available storage system. This paper explains a novel approach to predict hardware failures using spectrum-kernel Parallel Support Vector Machine (Parallel SVM) method by analyzing the system events logged in the system log files. These log files not only records the events processed by the system but it also holds the messages as the system state changes. A single message in the system log file is insufficient for any prediction and such prediction is bound to be less accurate. The approach introduced in the paper uses a sequence or pattern of messages from the system log file using a Sliding Window of messages with window size of 5 message sequence to predict the likelihood of a failure. These Sliding Windows of message sequences acts as inputs to the Parallel SVM. The Parallel SVM further tags the messages to a failure or non-failure system. Data Mining techniques are used in extracting useful information from the raw dataset. A solutioning model is developed using the structured dataset and Machine Learning algorithms. This environment when implemented using actual system logs from Linux-based storage system have shown to predict a hardware failure with accuracy of 90-92 percent.

This makes sample classification and identification process more challenging over time in olfactory machines. The generation of uncertain chemical sensor drift is long term degradation of the sensor properties and no matter what they are made of, how expensive they are, or how accurate. To deal with this problem a multiple classifier approach using artificial neural network (ANN) and k nearest neighbour (KNN) is proposed here and tested with the gas sensor array drift dataset which is retrieved from UCI machine learning repository. At first the extensive dataset is processed using principal component analysis (PCA) for visualization of underlying clusters. Then in order to supervise the problem and counteract its effect, drift compensation techniques using multiple classifiers using ANN (BP-MLP)& KNN have been formulated. Finally, a comparative study on the efficiency of ensemble of classifier for the single standalone classifier in terms of average classification accuracy is evaluated. The results clearly indicate the superiority of multiple classifier approach which not only improves the classifier performance but also compensate with sensor drift concept without replacing the physical sensor for long term use.

This paper proposes the implementation of a robotic system which can distinguish objects of different softness using machine learning approach, based on different parameters. Two piezoresistive flexible tactile sensors are mounted on a two fingered robotic gripper, as robotic arm can perform repetitive tasks under a controlled environment. A PIC32 microcontroller is used to control the gripping action and to acquire pressure data. Decision Tree and Na ve Bayes methods arc used as intelligent classifiers using feature vectors, obtained from the time series response of tactile sensors during grasping action for grading the objects. From the analytical point of view it is observed that Decision Tree based approach is better than the Bayesian approach.

However, in case of fMRI data analysis the large number of attributes may leads to a serious problem of classifying cognitive states. It significantly increases the computational cost and memory usage of a classifier. Hence to address this problem, we use GAs for selecting optimal set of attributes and then GNB classifier in a pipeline to classify different cognitive states. The experimental outcomes prove its worthiness in successfully classifying different cognitive states. The detailed comparison study with popular machine learning classifiers illustrates the importance of such GA-Bayesian approach applied in pipeline for fMRI data analysis.

The decoding of brain activities required fast, accurate, and reliable classifiers. In classification scenario, although machine learning classifiers have shown promising result, but the individual classifiers have their limitations. This paper proposes a method based on the ensemble of Neural Networks applying on fMRI data for cognitive state classification. The Neural Networks (NNs) classifier has been selected for ensembling. The Fuzzy Integral (FI) approach is used as an efficient tool for combining different classifiers. The classifiers ensemble technique performs better than the single base learner by reducing misclassification as well as both bias and variance. The proposed technique successfully classifies different cognitive states with high classification accuracy. The performance improvement while applying the ensemble technique as compared with the individual neural network strongly recommends the usefulness of the proposed approach.

However, the task is challenging as business rules are often not explicitly stated in the requirements documents. In case business rules are explicit, they may not be atomic in nature or, may be vague. In this paper, we present an approach for identifying business rules in the available requirements documentation. We first identify various business rules categories and, then examine requirements documentation (including requirements specifications, domain knowledge documents, change request, request for proposal) for the presence of these rules. Our study aims at finding how effectively business rules can be identified and classified into one of the categories of business rules using machine learning algorithms. We report on the results of the experiments performed. Our observations indicate that in terms of overall result, support vector machine algorithm performed better than other classifiers. Random Forest algorithm had a higher precision than support vector machine algorithm but relatively low recall. Naive Bayes algorithm had a higher recall than support vector machine. We also report on evaluation study of our requirements corpus using stop-words and stemming the requirements statements.

Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are temporal probabilistic graphical models that model temporal processes, temporal relationships between events and state changes through time. In this paper, we propose the integration of TA methods with DBNs in the context of medical decision-support systems, by presenting an extended DBN model. More specifically, we demonstrate the derivation of temporal abstractions which are used for building the network structure. We also apply machine learning algorithms to learn the parameters of the model through data. The model is applied for diagnosis of coronary heart disease using as testbed a longitudinal dataset.

Typically the games are for free and companies generate their revenue by selling in-game goods. We show creation of a users behaviour model, which are then used in a recommendation system increasing in-game goods purchases. We focus on learning techniques in a novel way, predicting the time of purchases rather than the most likely product to be purchased. The player model is based on in-game signals, such as players success, curiosity, social interactions etc. We had access to a Pool Live Tour game dataset made by Geewa. We report promising results in predicting the purchase events.

The dynamics of the activities are modeled using sparse Gaussian processes and their causal relations using a causal Bayesian graph. This allows the model to be efficient through compactness and sparsity in the causal graph, and to provide probabilities at any level of abstraction for activities or chains of activities. Methods and ideas from a wide range of previous work are combined and interact to provide a uniform way to tackle a variety of common problems related to learning, classifying and predicting activities. We discuss how to use this framework to perform prediction of future activities and to generate events.

In our approach we extend the notion of influence from users to networks and consider personality as a key characteristic for identifying influential networks. We describe the Twitter Personality based Influential Communities Extraction (T-PICE) system that creates the best influential communities in a Twitter network graph considering users' personality. We then expand existing approaches in users' personality extraction by aggregating data that represent several aspects of user behavior using machine learning techniques. We use an existing modularity based community detection algorithm and we extend it by inserting a pre-processing step that eliminates graph edges based on users' personality. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by sampling the twitter graph and comparing the influence of the created communities with and without considering the personality factor. We define several metrics to count the influence of communities. Our results show that the T-PICE system creates the most influential communities.

Existing data analysis environments, such as R, are constrained by the size of the main memory and cannot scale in many applications. This paper introduces Big R, a new platform which enables accessing, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data residing on a Hadoop cluster from the R user interface. Big R is inspired by R semantics and overloads a number of R primitives to support big data. Hence, users will be able to quickly prototype big data analytics routines without the need of learning a new programming paradigm. The current Big R implementation works on two main fronts: (1) data exploration, which enables R as a query language for Hadoop and (2) partitioned execution, allowing the execution of any R function on smaller pieces of a large dataset across the nodes in the cluster.

This is one of the new challenges of machine learning data mining. Choosing a suitable metric that addresses the properties and domain characteristics of learning real-world data is critical for achieving a good result in most of machine learning and data mining algorithms. When the dataset is big and imbalanced, even with an accurate metric, it is extremely difficult to achieve good learning performance. This paper proposes an integrated method for learning large imbalanced datasets. In particular, a combination of metric learning algorithms and balancing techniques are experimented. Their performances are compared based on a set of evaluation metrics running on bootstrap datasets of different sizes. The best combination is then selected for learning the full imbalanced datasets. Experiments using the water pipeline datasets collected from various Australia regions in the past two decades show that our proposed method is both practical and effective.

The emergence of big data gave professional traders the new territory, leverage and evidence and renewed opportunities of their profitable exploitation by Machine Learning (ML) models, increasingly taking over the trading floor by 24/7 automated trading in response to the continuously fed data streams. Rapidly increasing data sizes and strictly real-time requirements of the trading models render large subset of ML methods intractable, overcomplex and impossible to apply in practise. In this work we demonstrate how to efficiently approach the problem of automated trading with large portfolio strategy that continuously consumes streams of data across multiple diverse markets. We demonstrate a simple scalable trading model that learns to generate profit from multiple inter-market price predictions and markets' correlation structure. We also introduce the stochastic trade diffusion technique to maximise trading turnover while reducing strategy's exposure to market impact and construct the efficient risk-mitigating portfolio that backtests with the strong positive return.

The algorithm processes the training set by selecting only input vectors at the boundary between consecutive classes of data to be included in the reduced training set. The algorithm finds an input vector of any other class that has minimum distance to each original input vector. This input vector, called paired vector, is one of the representatives of the boundary of its class that constitutes the shape or distribution model of the problem. The algorithm is applied to all input vectors. Only the unique paired vectors are included the reduced training set. No feature or dimension of the training set is sacrificed in the reduction process. The experiments are conducted on a four-class synthetic problem and the six real-world datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The experimental results present that the algorithm can significantly reduce the size of a training set while obtaining similar levels of accuracy of classification as when the whole training set is used.

Bio-signals reflect sequences of neural activity, which result in changes in autonomic and neuroendocrine systems induced by emotional events. Therefore in human-computer interaction researches, one of the most current interesting topics in emotion recognition is to recognize human's feeling using bio-signals. The aim of this study is to classify emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and neutral) that human have often experienced in real life from multichannel bio-signals using machine learning algorithms. We have measured physiological responses of three-hundred participants for acquisition of bio-signals such as electrodermal activity, electrocardiograph, skin temperature, and photoplethysmograph during six emotions induction. Also, for emotion classification, we have extracted eighteen features from the signals and performed emotion classification using four algorithms, linear discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes, classification and regression tree and support vector machine. The used algorithms were evaluated by only training, 10-fold cross-validation and repeated random sub-sampling validation. We have obtained recognition accuracy from 56.4 to 100% for only training and 39.2 to 53.9% for testing. Also, the result for testing showed that an accuracy of emotion recognition by Naive Bayes was highest (53.9%) and lowest by support vector machine (39.2%). This means that Naive Bayes is the best emotion recognition algorithm for basic emotions. This result can be helpful to provide the basis for the emotion recognition technique in human-computer interaction.

This work aims to design an objective spatial climate regionalization method for assessing health risks in response to extreme weather. Specific climate regions for the conterminous United States of America (USA) were defined using satellite remote sensing (RS) data and compared with the conventional Koppen-Geiger (KG) divisions. Using the nationwide database of hospitalisations among the elderly (>= 65 year olds), we examined the utility of a RS-based climate regionalization to assess public health risk due to extreme weather, by comparing the rate of hospitalisations in response to thermal extremes across climatic regions. Satellite image composites from 2002-2012 were aggregated, masked and compiled into a multi-dimensional dataset. The conterminous USA was classified into 8 distinct regions using a stepwise regionalization approach to limit noise and collinearity (LKN), which exhibited a high degree of consistency with the KG regions and a well-defined regional delineation by annual and seasonal temperature and precipitation values. The most populous was a temperate wet region (10.9 million), while the highest rate of hospitalisations due to exposure to heat and cold (9.6 and 17.7 cases per 100,000 persons at risk, respectively) was observed in the relatively warm and humid south-eastern region. RS-based regionalization demonstrates strong potential for assessing the adverse effects of severe weather on human health and for decision support. Its utility in forecasting and mitigating these effects has to be further explored.

J	Ozyirmidokuz, EK; Kaya, Y		Uslu, F		Ozyirmidokuz, Esra Kahya; Kaya, Yasemin			Decision Tree Induction of Emotional Violence against Women	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND SOCIAL SCIENCES (INTCESS14), VOLS I AND II			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Education and Social Sciences (INTCESS)	FEB 03-05, 2014	Istanbul, TURKEY	Int Org Ctr Acad Res		Information management; Data mining; Decision trees; Emotional violence	SERVICE; SCIENCE; MODEL	Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) is an interdisciplinary area focusing upon methodologies for extracting useful and hidden knowledge from data. KDD is the process of analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing them into new information. It uses various types of algorithms, including statistical and machine learning. KDD starts with understanding data. Then data preprocessing techniques are used because quality decisions must be based on quality data. The data mining modeling phase is used to extract more meaningful knowledge from a given data set. Decision trees (DTs) are one of the most powerful and popular approaches in data mining. Their effective structure helps us to make the best decisions on the basis of existing information. DTs also predict future and possible decisions. Analyzing data on violence against women is a very important subject. There are still a lot of women who are subjected to violence, even in this, the 21st century. Violence against women is not only hysical; emotional violence also negatively affects health. Emotional violence inflected by a partner includes the following: being insulted or made to feel bad about oneself; being humiliated in front of others; being intimidated or frightened on purpose; being threatened directly, or indirectly through a threat to someone the respondent cares about. Although violence against women, especially by men, is an important issue, presently there are too few original studies on this topic. Women who experience emotional violence are at increased risk of injury and death, as well as a range of physical, emotional, and social problems. As women play an important role in bringing up healthy individuals to be part of a healty community, violence against women is also a problem for society. This research aims to extract meaningful knowledge from the emotional violence against women data set. The data cover 12795 women in the 15-59 age group of in Turkey. The data were obtained from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT)' s Web site. As a result of the data obtained from the analysis suggestions can be submitted for women exposed to emotional violence. The paper explores the use of different preprocessing and data mining techniques (anomaly detection analysis, data reduction, data cleaning, DT etc.). In order to support the prevention of violence against women, a DT model is generated. Modeling is performed with C4.5, which is one of the popular DT modeling algorithms and an extension of the earlier well known ID3 algorithm to find useful patterns. The cross-validation method involves partitioning the examples randomly into n folds. Ten fold normal cross-validation accuracy evaluation is used. Consequently, a DT is generated. The resulting DT model can be used for future decisions. The relationships of the input variables with target variables are found. The results show that the proposed method has a substantially good performance.

Multivariate neuroanatomical classification of cognitive subtypes in schizophrenia: A support vector machine learning approach	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Cognition; Cognitive deficit; Subtypes; Voxel based morphometry; Magnetic resonance imaging; Sex differences	RISK MENTAL STATES; SEX-DIFFERENCES; BIPOLAR DISORDER; BRAIN STRUCTURE; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; GRAY-MATTER; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CORTICAL THICKNESS; AMYGDALA VOLUME; STRUCTURAL MRI	Heterogeneity in the structural brain abnormalities associated with schizophrenia has made identification of reliable neuroanatomical markers of the disease difficult. The use of more homogenous clinical phenotypes may improve the accuracy of predicting psychotic disorder/s on the basis of observable brain disturbances. Here we investigate the utility of cognitive subtypes of schizophrenia - 'cognitive deficit' and 'cognitively spared' - in determining whether multivariate patterns of volumetric brain differences can accurately discriminate these clinical subtypes from healthy controls, and from each other. We applied support vector machine classification to grey-and white-matter volume data from 126 schizophrenia patients previously allocated to the cognitive spared subtype, 74 cognitive deficit schizophrenia patients, and 134 healthy controls. Using this method, cognitive subtypes were distinguished from healthy controls with up to 72% accuracy. Cross-validation analyses between subtypes achieved an accuracy of 71%, suggesting that some common neuroanatomical patterns distinguish both subtypes from healthy controls. Notably, cognitive subtypes were best distinguished from one another when the sample was stratified by sex prior to classification analysis: cognitive subtype classification accuracy was relatively low (<60%) without stratification, and increased to 83% for females with sex stratification. Distinct neuroanatomical patterns predicted cognitive subtype status in each sex: sex-specific multivariate patterns did not predict cognitive subtype status in the other sex above chance, and weight map analyses demonstrated negative correlations between the spatial patterns of weights underlying classification for each sex. These results suggest that in typical mixed-sex samples of schizophrenia patients, the volumetric brain differences between cognitive subtypes are relatively minor in contrast to the large common disease-associated changes. Volumetric differences that distinguish between cognitive subtypes on a case-by-case basis appear to occur in a sex-specific manner that is consistent with previous evidence of disrupted relationships between brain structure and cognition inmale, but not female, schizophrenia patients. Consideration of sex-specific differences in brain organization is thus likely to assist future attempts to distinguish subgroups of schizophrenia patients on the basis of neuroanatomical features.

J	Paldino, MJ; Hedges, K; Zhang, W				Paldino, Michael J.; Hedges, Kara; Zhang, Wei			Independent contribution of individual white matter pathways to language function in pediatric epilepsy patients	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Epilepsy; Malformations of cortical development; Language; Tractography; Connectivity; Uncinate fasciculus; Arcuate fasciculus; Inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; BILATERAL PERISYLVIAN SYNDROME; IMAGING QUANTIFICATION METHOD; DIFFUSION-TENSOR; FRACTIONAL ANISOTROPY; ARCUATE FASCICULUS; MEAN DIFFUSIVITY; LONGITUDINAL FASCICULUS; DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY; IN-VIVO	Background and purpose: Patients with epilepsy and malformations of cortical development (MCDs) are at high risk for language and other cognitive impairment. Specific impairments, however, are not well correlated with the extent and locale of dysplastic cortex; such findings highlight the relevance of aberrant cortico-cortical interactions, or connectivity, to the clinical phenotype. The goal of this study was to determine the independent contribution of well-described white matter pathways to language function in a cohort of pediatric patients with epilepsy. Materials and methods: Patients were retrospectively identified from an existing database of pediatric epilepsy patients with the following inclusion criteria: 1. diagnosis of MCDs, 2. DTI performed at 3 T, and 3. language characterized by a pediatric neurologist. Diffusion Toolkit and Trackvis (http://www.trackvis.org) were used for segmentation and analysis of the following tracts: corpus callosum, corticospinal tracts, inferior longitudinal fasciculi (ILFs), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi (IFOFs), uncinate fasciculi (UFs), and arcuate fasciculi (AFs). Mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were calculated for each tract. Wilcoxon rank sum test (corrected for multiple comparisons) was used to assess potential differences in tract parameters between language-impaired and language-intact patients. In a separate analysis, a machine learning algorithm (random forest approach) was applied to measure the independent contribution of the measured diffusion parameters for each tract to the clinical phenotype (language impairment). In other words, the importance of each tract parameter was measured after adjusting for the contribution of all other tracts. Results: Thirty-three MCD patients were included (age range: 3-18 years). Twenty-one patients had intact language, twelve had language impairment. All tracts were identified bilaterally in all patients except for the AF, which was not identified on the right in 10 subjects and not identified on the left in 11 subjects. MD and/or FA within the left AF, UF, ILF, and IFOF differed between language-intact and language-impaired groups. However, only parameters related to the left uncinate, inferior fronto-occipital, and arcuate fasciculi were independently associated with the clinical phenotype. Conclusions: Scalar metrics derived from the left uncinate, inferior fronto-occipital, and arcuate fasciculi were independently associated with language function. These results support the importance of these pathways in human language function in patients with MCDs. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In order to classify selected song with certain mood or emotion, the algorithms of the machine learning must be intelligence enough to learn the data features as to match the features accordingly to the accurate emotion. Until now, there were only few studies on MEC that exploit timbre features from vocal part of the song incorporated with the instrumental part of a song. Most of existing works in MEC done by looking at audio, lyrics, social tags or combination of two or more classes. The question is does exploitation of both timbre features from both vocal and instrumental sound features helped in producing positive result in MEC? Thus, this research present works on detecting emotion features in Malay popular music using artificial neural network by extracting timbre features from both vocal and instrumental sound clips. The findings of this research will collectively improve MEC based on the manipulation of vocal and instrumental sound timbre features, as well as contributing towards the literature of music information retrieval, affective computing and psychology.

Several approaches are introduced ranging from traditional information extraction techniques, incorporation of machine learning and utilization of lexicons. However, existing works mainly introduced lexicon as the pair of certain dataset which resulted to limited analytical coverage when used in unseen dataset. Therefore, this research aims to investigate the performance of a composite lexicon in terms of accuracy. A new method called Adverb Effect on Adjective (AEA) is also introduced to calculate the intensity of the sentiment. An application called SentiMiner is developed based on these methods and implemented to analyze Facebook posts. It is observed that the combination of the AEA method with the composite lexicon has achieved the highest accuracy when compared against benchmarking algorithms when tested on the Amazon product review dataset. The theme extraction experiment has also shown that the SentiMiner's approach has defeated the AlchemyAPI algorithm when used on the Stanford Sentiment dataset. Therefore, it is concluded that wide coverage of lexicon and sentiment polarity strength as the content-based analysis method can significantly improve the accuracy of sentiment scoring in microblogging mining.

One of the most popular techniques in data clustering is K-means, which is a simple, fast and efficient method that has been applied successfully in many fields. However, K-means has its own drawbacks like highly dependence on the initial solution and can easily trapped into local optima. In this paper, we investigate the behaviour of the newly created meta-heuristic optimisation algorithm called Biogeography-Based Optimisation (BBO) for data clustering with different initial solution generation mechanisms (random initial solution, sequential diversification initial solution, heuristic initial solution) that is based on the idea of migration of species between different habitats. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, six UCI Machine Learning Repository data sets were used. The performance of the BBO algorithm was compared with well-known data-clustering algorithms that available in the literature, the experimental results showed that the BBO algorithm was able to obtain comparable results.

While cross-document structural theory (CST) concerns about links in documents, this work examines the use of CST in summarizing threaded document since no one use it in this domain before. To do so, this work has two phases: first, we identify and extract four CST relations by using supervised machine learning. Second, we develop a new sentence weighting method based on model selection technique over the identified cross-document relations. The experiments show that using of CST in the thread summarization gives promised results. The performances of all methods were evaluated using ROUGE-a standard evaluation metric used in text summarization.

This is particularly true if measurements from a physical system are used to update and solve a sequence of mathematical optimization problems in real-time, such as in control, automation, signal processing and machine learning. In these real-time optimization applications the designer has to trade off computing time, space and energy against each other, while satisfying constraints on the performance and robustness of the resulting cyber-physical system. This paper is an informal introduction to the issues involved when designing the computing hardware and a real-time optimization algorithm at the same time, which can result in systems with efficiencies and performances that are unachievable when designing the sub-systems independently. The co-design process can, in principle, be formulated as a sequence of uncertain and non-smooth optimization problems. In other words, optimizers might be used to design optimizers. Before this can become a reality, new systems theory and numerical methods will have to be developed to solve these co-design problems effectively and reliably.

Unstable slope conditions can lead to small landslides which weaken the levees and increase the likelihood of failure during floods. This paper analyzes the ability of detecting the landslides on the levee with different frequency bands of synthetic aperture radar data using supervised machine learning algorithms. The two SAR datasets used in this study are: (1) the X-band satellite-based radar data from DLR's TerraSAR-X (TSX), and (2) the L-band airborne radar data from NASA JPL's Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR). The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm was implemented to detect the landslides on the levee. The results showed that higher accuracies have been attained using L-band radar data compared to the X-band data, likely due to the longer wavelength and deeper penetration capability of L-band data.

The initial solution is computed by means of two machine learning and pattern recognition state-of-the-art methods (namely, Random Forest classification and Marked Point Process) that allow to process very large areas in little time with very satisfactory results.

The method aims at classifying an image where ground truth is not available exploiting the reference data acquired on a different but related image. This is done by taking advantage from a sensor-driven strategy that exploits the invariance of the measurements of some sensors on some classes for adaptation. This invariant property allows us to infer labels on a subset of unlabeled samples of the image that should be classified, thus introducing constrains on the adaptation process. The proposed method is based on two main steps: i) adaptation based on a sensor-driven label inference method for a subset of classes characterized by spatial invariant behaviour; and ii) adaptation based on machine learning for the remaining classes. The proposed method has been validated on 2 different datasets, where LiDAR data, hyperspectral images and high resolution optical images have been considered.

In order to have a more concrete understanding of this term we refer to its refinement as smart data analytics in order to examine large quantities of scientific data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations, or to extract information in cases where there is no exact formula (e.g. known physical laws). Our concrete big data problem is the classification of classes of land cover types in image-based datasets that have been created using remote sensing technologies, because the resolution can be high (i.e. large volumes) and there are various types such as panchromatic or different used bands like red, green, blue, and nearly infrared (i.e. large variety). We investigate various smart data analytics methods that take advantage of machine learning algorithms (i.e. support vector machines) and state-of-the-art parallelization approaches in order to overcome limitations of big data processing using non-scalable serial approaches.

Some projection methods have been used in remote sensing for dimension reduction, especially for hyperspectral data due to high dimensionality. Projection methods can improve the performance of classifiers susceptible to the Hughes phenomenon. However, the effect of feature projection for more advanced classifiers has not been well-studied, and there are few studies comparing projection methods for hyperspectral image classification. A comprehensive study has been performed on the effect of feature projection for classification using both reduced and full dimensions. The performance of six feature projection methods (PCA, LLE, LDA, LFDA, LMNN, and SPCA) using three classifiers has been explored on three hyperspectral data sets. Results show that the performance of feature projection methods on different classifiers are mainly consistent for different data sets. LFDA achieves the best overall performance considering all data sets and all classifiers.

Intensive grass based systems demand high levels of intervention by the farmer, with estimation of pasture cover (biomass) being the most important variable in land use management decisions, as well as playing a vital role in paddock and herd management. Many studies have been undertaken to estimate grassland biomass using satellite remote sensing data, but rarely in systems like Irelands intensively managed, small scale pastures, where grass is grazed as well as harvested for winter fodder. The objective of this study is to estimate grassland yield (kgDM/ha) from MODIS derived vegetation indices on a near weekly basis across the entire 300+ day growing season using three different methods (Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS)).

For this purpose, we train a conditional random field to integrate features that reflect low-level visual saliency, the likelihood of salient objects, the probability that a given pixel is pointed at, and - if available - spoken information about the target object's visual appearance. As such, this work integrates several of our ideas and approaches, ranging from multi-scale spectral saliency detection, spatially debiased salient object detection, computational attention in human-robot interaction to learning robust color term models. We demonstrate that this machine learning driven integration outperforms the previously reported results on two datasets, one dataset without and one with spoken object references. In summary, for automatically detected pointing gestures and automatically extracted object references, our approach improves the rate at which the correct object is included in the initial focus of attention by 10.37% in the absence and 25.21% in the presence of spoken target object information.

The complexity of the problem prevents most of the existing optimization algorithms from giving satisfactory results. While model-based algorithms like iterative linear-quadratic-Gaussian (iLQG) can be used to design a suitable controller for the motion control, their performance is strongly limited by the model accuracy. An inaccurate model may lead to degraded performance of the controller on the physical system. Although using machine learning approaches to learn the motion control on real systems have been proven to be effective, their performance depends on good initialization. To address these issues, this paper introduces a two-step algorithm which combines the proven performance of a model-based controller with a model-free method for compensating for model inaccuracy. The first step optimizes the problem using iLQG. Then, in the second step this controller is used to initialize the policy for our PI 2 -01 reinforcement learning algorithm. This algorithm is a derivation of the PI 2 algorithm enabling more stable and faster convergence. The performance of this method is demonstrated both in simulation and experimental results.

Direct approaches to assess reachability involve the solution to a two-point boundary value problem (2PBVP) between a pair of states. Alternative, indirect approaches involve the characterization of reachable sets as level sets of the value function of an appropriate optimal control problem. Both methods solve the problem accurately, but are computationally intensive and do no appear amenable to real-time implementation for all but the simplest cases. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to devise query-based algorithms for the approximate, yet real-time solution of the reachability problem. Specifically, we show that with a training set of pre-solved 2PBVP problems, one can accurately classify the cost-reachable sets of a differentially-constrained system using either (1) locally-weighted linear regression or (2) support vector machines. This novel, query-based approach is demonstrated on two systems: the Dubins car and a deep-space spacecraft. Classification errors on the order of 10 % (and often significantly less) are achieved with average execution times on the order of milliseconds, representing 4 orders-of-magnitude improvement over exact methods. The proposed algorithms could find application in a variety of time-critical robotic applications, where the driving factor is computation time rather than optimality.

Due to many unknown and hard to model nonlinearities, analytical models of such robots are often only very rough approximations. However, modern optimization controllers frequently depend on reasonably accurate models, and degrade greatly in robustness and performance if model errors are too large. For a long time, machine learning has been expected to provide automatic empirical model synthesis, yet so far, research has only generated feasibility studies but no learning algorithms that run reliably on complex robots. In this paper, we combine two promising worlds of regression techniques to generate a more powerful regression learning system. On the one hand, locally weighted regression techniques are computationally efficient, but hard to tune due to a variety of data dependent meta-parameters. On the other hand, Bayesian regression has rather automatic and robust methods to set learning parameters, but becomes quickly computationally infeasible for big and high-dimensional data sets. By reducing the complexity of Bayesian regression in the spirit of local model learning through variational approximations, we arrive at a novel algorithm that is computationally efficient and easy to initialize for robust learning. Evaluations on several datasets demonstrate very good learning performance and the potential for a general regression learning tool for robotics.

After collecting a large grasp sample set (522 grasps), we first conduct a thorough statistical analysis of the ability of grasp metrics that are commonly used in the robotics literature to discriminate between good and bad grasps. We then apply Principal Component Analysis and Gaussian Process algorithms on the discriminative grasp metrics to build a classifier that predicts grasp quality. The key findings are as follows: (i) several of the grasp metrics in the literature are weak predictors of grasp quality when implemented on a physical robotic platform; (ii) the Gaussian Process- based classifier significantly improves grasp prediction techniques by providing an absolute grasp quality prediction score from combining multiple grasp metrics. Specifically, the GP classifier showed a 66% percent improvement in the True Positive classification rate at a low False Positive rate of 5% when compared with classification based on thresholding of individual grasp metrics.

State-of-the-art approaches use machine learning techniques that require extensive and often time consuming training. This work proposes a novel formulation by posing place categorization as an efficient l(1)-minimization problem, leading to both a faster training phase and to performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. The formulation allows online robot operation particularly in the case when the training phase has to be learned on-the-fly and in an active manner. To validate the performance of the proposed method, extensive experimental results carried out on real data under different lighting conditions as well as structural changes in the environment are provided.

So far, there exists a little investigation on FCM algorithm for clustering intuitionistic fuzzy data. This paper focuses mainly on two aspects. Firstly, it proposes an intuitionistic fuzzy representation (IFR) scheme for numerical dataset and applies the modified FCM clustering for clustering intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) data and comparing results with that of crisp and fuzzy data. Secondly, in clustering of IF data, different IF similarity measures are studied and a comparative analysis is carried out on the results. The experiments are conducted for numerical datasets of UCI machine learning data repository.	[Visalakshi, N.

The problem of data correction in the presence of simultaneous sources of drift, other than sensor drift, should also be investigated, since it is often the case in practical situations. ELM is a competitive machine learning technique, which has been applied in different domains for classification. In this paper, ELM with different activation functions has been implemented for gas sensor array drift dataset. The experimental results show that the ELM with bipolar function classifies the drift dataset with an average accuracy of 96 % than the other function. The proposed method is compared with SVM.

This question has been a driver of much of the research involving RNA biogenesis. The variability of splicing outcome across developmental stages and between tissues coupled with association of splicing defects with numerous diseases highlights the importance of such a code. However, the sheer number of elements involved in splicing regulation and the context-specific manner of their operation have made the derivation of such a code challenging. Recently, machine learning-based methods have been developed to infer computational models for a splicing code. These methods use high-throughput experiments measuring mRNA expression at exonic resolution and binding locations of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to infer what the regulatory elements that control the inclusion of a given pre-mRNA segment are. The inferred regulatory models can then be applied to genomic sequences or experimental conditions that have not been measured to predict splicing outcome. Moreover, the models themselves can be interrogated to identify new regulatory mechanisms, which can be subsequently tested experimentally. In this chapter, we survey the current state of this technology, and illustrate how it can be applied by non-computational or RNA splicing experts to study regulation of specific exons by using the AVISPA web tool.

Our previous method [16] uses a decision tree based approach for mining assertions and does not have design coverage related feedback. The assertions are unaware of the design, over-constrained and have low expressiveness. We introduce a coverage guided mining approach for mining assertions from simulation traces. Our approach combines association rule learning, greedy set covering and formal verification. It circumvents the exhaustive rule generation of association mining using coverage feedback. The algorithm has been implemented as one part of GoldMine1. Experiments using a variety of designs, including USB, PCI and OpenRisc, show that the assertions generated by coverage guided association mining cover an average of 6.14 times input space than those generated by decision tree based mining algorithms. We also show that the coverage guided association mining produces an average of 2.75 times fewer propositions per assertion than decision tree based mining. All these mean the assertions generated by coverage guided association mining are more succinct, and of higher value for hardware design verification.

Among popular social networking portals, Twitter has been the point of attraction to several researchers in important areas like prediction of democratic electoral events, consumer brands, movie box office, stock market, popularity of celebrities etc. Sentiment analysis over Twitter offers a fast and efficient way of monitoring the public sentiment. In this paper, we introduce the novel approach of exploiting the user influence factor in order to predict the outcome of an election result. We also propose a hybrid approach of extracting opinion using direct and indirect features of Twitter data based on Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy and Artificial Neural Networks based supervised classifiers. We combined Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with SVM in an attempt to perform dimensionality reduction. This paper shows two different case studies of entirely different social scenarios, US Presidential Elections 2012 and Karnataka Assembly Elections 2013. We conclude the conditions under which Twitter may fail or succeed in predicting the outcome of elections. Experimental results demonstrate that Support Vector Machines outperform all other classifiers with maximum successful prediction accuracy of 88% in case of US Presidential Elections held in November 2012 and maximum prediction accuracy of 58% in case of Karnataka State Assembly Elections held in May 2013.

Biologically inspired approaches to security in networks are interesting to evaluate because of the analogies between network security and survival of human body under pathogenic attacks. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a network based on multiple low-cost communication and computing devices connected to sensor nodes which sense physical parameters. While the spread of viruses in wired systems has been studied in-depth, applying trust in WSN is an emerging research area. Security threats can be introduced in WSN through various means, such as a benevolent sensor node turning fraudulent after a certain period of time. The proposed research work uses biological inspirations and machine learning techniques for adding security against such threats. While it uses machine learning techniques to identify the fraudulent nodes, consecutively by deriving inspiration from human immune system it effectively nullify the impact of the fraudulent ones on the network. Proposed work has been implemented in Lab VIEW platform and obtained results that demonstrate the accuracy, robustness of the proposed model.

This paper explores a new countermeasure approach for anomaly-based intrusion detection using a multicriterion fuzzy classification method combined with a greedy attribute selection. The proposed approach has the advantage of dealing with various types of attributes including network traffic basic TCP/IP packet headers, as well as contentbased, time-based and host-based attributes. At the same time, to reduce the dimensionality and increase the computational efficiency, the greedy attribute selection algorithm enables it to choose an optimal subset of attributes that is most relevant for detecting intrusive events. The simplicity of the constructed model allows it to be replicated at various network components in emerging open system infrastructures such as sensor networks, wireless ad hoc networks, cloud computing, and smart grids. The proposed approach is evaluated and compared on a commonly-used intrusion detection benchmark dataset. The results show more than 99.9% overall accuracy with high detection rates for various types of intrusions can be achieved with about 26% only of the available attributes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In fact, with the exponential growth of mobile computing, interruptions are permeating the user experience. Systems must be developed to manage interruptions by reasoning about ideal timings of interactions and determining appropriate notification formats. In this work, an architecture for a cloud-based interruption management system for mobile device users is presented. The system draws from rich contextual information from the mobile device (i.e., user, task and environment dimensions) and real-time observations of the user's activities and then reasons about ideal times to interact with the user. The reasoning component (interruption algorithm) is situated in the cloud and implemented using a novel machine learning technique (an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System). This research addresses the complex problem of determining the precise time to interact with a mobile device user and in so doing aims to reduce the negative aspects of interruptions. This paper also presents a new interruption taxonomy built on an existing framework, and a report on the current prototype developed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Machine learning techniques can allow such complex, spatially varying interactions to be recovered from collected field data. In this study, we apply structure learning techniques to identify functional relationships between trophic groups of species that vary across space and time. Specifically, Bayesian networks are created on a window of data for each of the 20 geographically different and temporally varied sub-regions within an oceanic area. In addition, we explored the spatial and temporal variation of pre-defined functions (like predation, competition) that are generalisable by experts' knowledge. We were able to discover meaningful ecological networks that were more precisely spatially-specific rather than temporally, as previously suggested for this region. To validate the discovered networks, we predict the biomass of the trophic groups by using dynamic Bayesian networks, and correcting for spatial autocorrelation by including a spatial node in our models.

However, previous methods fail to make full use of contextual information and rely heavily on the probability distribution of the input data. To avoid those pitfalls, the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model is introduced in this paper for DDoS attacks detection. Firstly, the CRF is trained to build the classification model for DDoS attacks based on three groups of statistical features including conditional entropy, flag ratios and protocol ratios. Then, the trained CRF models are used to identify the attacks with model inference. Experimental results demonstrate that, the proposed approach can accurately distinguish between attacks and normal network traffic, and is more robust to resist disturbance of background traffic than its counterparts.

Previous studies on class-imbalance learning mainly focused on relatively small or moderate class-imbalance. In this paper we conduct an empirical study to explore the difference between learning with small or moderate class-imbalance and learning with severe class-imbalance. The experimental results show that: (1) Traditional methods cannot handle severe class-imbalance effectively. (2) AUC, G-mean and F-measure can be very inconsistent for severe class-imbalance, which seldom appears when class-imbalance is moderate. And G-mean is not appropriate for severe class-imbalance learning because it is not sensitive to the change of imbalance ratio. (3) When AUC and G-mean are evaluation metrics, EasyEnsemble is the best method, followed by BalanceCascade and under-sampling. (4) A little under-full balance is better for under-sampling to handle severe class-imbalance. And it is important to handle false positives when design methods for severe class-imbalance.

In this work, we study how the JND is affected over the rate of change of the stimulus. This study has a possible application in better design of a haptic data compression algorithm. We design an experimental set up where users are subjected to a continuous haptic force which starts increasing or decreasing from a fixed reference force value, and record the haptic responses. A machine learning classifier- SVM is trained using the recorded haptic responses to estimate the best fit linear decision boundary between the JND and the rate of change of the stimulus. Our results show that the JND decreases for faster change in the stimulus. We also demonstrate an asymmetric behavior of perception between increasing and decreasing cases.

The aim of this work was to investigate the ability of machine learning to disentangle concurrent stimulus parameters, such as normal force ramp rate, texture and friction, from the responses of tactile afferents at the point of initial contact with the human finger pad. Three textured stimulation surfaces were tested under two frictional conditions each, with a 4 N normal force applied at three ramp rates. During stimulation, the responses of fourteen afferents (5 SA-I, 2 SA-II, 5 FA-I, 2 FA-II) were recorded. A Parzen window classifier was used to classify ramp rate, texture and frictional condition using spike count, first spike latency or peak frequency from each afferent. This is the first study to show that ramp rate, texture and frictional condition could be classified concurrently with over 90 % accuracy using a small number of tactile sensory units.

At the same time, the high dimensionality of the data and the complex nature of biological interaction networks present significant analytical challenges in identifying causal variations and modeling the underlying systems biology. In addition to identifying significantly disregulated genes and proteins, integrative analysis approaches that allow the investigation of these single genes within a functional context are required. This chapter presents a survey of current computational approaches for the statistical analysis of high-dimensional data and the development of systems-level models of cellular signaling and regulation. Specifically, we focus on multi-gene analysis methods and the integration of expression data with domain knowledge (such as biological pathways) and other gene-wise information (e.g., sequence or methylation data) to identify novel functional modules in the complex cellular interaction network.

The motivation scenario includes incremental unsupervised learning which is mainly based on discrete spatial structure changes recognized by the robot vision system. The learning policy problem is presented as a classification problem for which the adaptive resonance theory (ART) concept is implemented. The methodology and architecture of the autonomous robot learning model with preliminary results are presented. A computer simulation was performed with four input sets containing 22, 45, 73, and 111 random spatial structures. The ARTgrid shows a fairly high (>85%) match score when applied with already learned patterns after the first learning cycle, and a score of >95% after the second cycle. Regarding the category proliferation, the results are compared with a more predictive modified cluster centre seeking algorithm.

J	Hernandez, T				Hernandez, Troy			Flex Scheduling for Bus Arrival Time Prediction	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								The prediction of bus arrival times is an important element for travel planning. This study used three weeks of Chicago, Illinois, Transit Authority bus route GPS data to compare the performance of several commonly used methods and algorithms. The use of implicit schedules in previous papers was inadequate. The use of additional information, such as recent travel times along the route, is unnecessary. In addition, the use of computationally intensive machine learning algorithms, such as support vector regression, k nearest neighbor regression, and neural networks, is unnecessary. The study used basis expansion functions at various resolutions with linear models and cross-validated the models to determine explicitly the approximate historical interstop travel times for any time of the day and any day of the week. Combining the estimated interstop travel times with the real-time GPS location of a bus resulted in a flex schedule that was independent of scheduled departure or arrival times. Using a flex schedule makes the use of additional GPS information or the use of the machine learning algorithms unnecessary.

In this work, we propose Chip-level Design Rule Evaluator (ChipDRE), the first framework for systematic evaluation of design rules and their interaction with layouts, performance, margins and yield at the chip scale (as opposed to standard cell-level). A "good chips per wafer" metric is used to unify area, performance, variability and yield. The framework uses a generated virtual standard-cell library coupled with a mix of physical design, semi-empirical, and machine-learning-based models to estimate area and delay at the chip level. The result is a unified design-quality estimate that can be computed fast enough to allow using ChipDRE to optimize a large number of complex design rules. For instance, a study of well-to-active spacing rule reveals a non-monotone dependence of rule value to chip area (although the dependence to cell area is monotone) due to delay changes coming from well-proximity effect.

Driven by the principle of trading tolerable amounts of application accuracy in return for significant resource savings-the energy consumed, the (critical path) delay and the (silicon) area being the resources-this approach has been limited to certain application domains. In this paper, we propose to expand the application scope, error tolerance as well as the energy savings of inexact computing systems through neural network architectures. Such neural networks are fast emerging as popular candidate accelerators for future heterogeneous multi-core platforms, and have flexible error tolerance limits owing to their ability to be trained. Our results based on simulated 65nm technology designs demonstrate that the proposed inexact neural network accelerator could achieve 43.91%-62.49% savings in energy consumption (with corresponding delay and area savings being 18.79% and 31.44% respectively) when compared to existing baseline neural network implementation, at the cost of an accuracy loss (quantified as the Mean Square Error (MSE) which increases from 0.14 to 0.20 on average).

Meta-cognitive learning is a breakthrough in the machine learning where the learning process is not only directed to craft learning strategies to exacerbate the classification rates, i.e., how-to-learn aspect, but also is focused to accommodate the emotional reasoning and commonsense of human being in terms of what-to-learn and when-to-learn facets. The crux of gClass is to synergize the scaffolding learning concept, which constitutes a well-known tutoring theory in the psychological literatures, in the how-to-learn context of meta-cognitive learning, in order to boost the learner's performance in dealing with complex data. A comprehensive empirical studies in time-varying datasets is carried out, where gClass numerical results are benchmarked with other state-of-the-art classifiers. gClass is, generally speaking, capable of delivering the most encouraging numerical results where a trade-off between predictive accuracy and classifier's complexity can be achieved.

Fuzzy datasets or datasets whose observations are fuzzy sets, are examples of non-vectorial data and, several fuzzy pattern recognition algorithms analyze them in the space formed by the set of fuzzy sets. However, the analysis of fuzzy data in such space has the limitation of not being a vector space. To overcome such limitation, we propose the embedding of fuzzy data into a proper Hilbert space of functions called the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). This embedding is possible by using a positive definite kernel function on fuzzy sets. We present a formulation of a real-valued kernels on fuzzy sets, in particular, we define the intersection kernel and the cross product kernel on fuzzy sets giving some examples of them using T-norm operators. Also, we analyze the nonsingleton TSK fuzzy kernel and, finally, we give some examples of kernels on fuzzy sets that can be easily constructed from the previous ones.

In this work, we present a framework to model a specific IADL - "making the bed". For this activity recognition, the need for a three level Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) model is shown. Simple features such as bounding box parameters were extracted from the foreground images and combined with 3D features extracted from the Kinect depth data. This was then fed as input to the three layered FIS for further analysis. Data collected from several participants were tested and evaluated. Such a framework can be used to model several other IADLS as well as basic activities of daily living (ADLs). Analysis of ADLs can be used to compare daily patterns in older adults to measure changes in behavior. This can then be used to predict health changes to assist older adults in leading independent lifestyles for longer time periods.

The magnitude of the problem has increased dramatically during the last three decades and, despite some indications of a plateau in this growth, the numbers remain stubbornly high. The nature of child obesity data is very complicated with different factors dependent on each other directly or indirectly affecting obesity as a whole. Traditional statistical analysis and machine learning approaches alone are not sufficient to model early childhood obesity risk and its impact on children's motor development. In this paper, we propose a computational model using Fuzzy Signature to understand and handle the intricacies of child obesity data and propose a solution that could be used to handle the risk associated with early childhood obesity and young children's motor development.

In the machine learning community, continuous attributes are discretized into intervals. An entropy measure is often used to determine the cutting points for interval discretization. In the fuzzy system community, continuous attributes are usually discretized into overlapping fuzzy sets. Learning and optimization techniques are used to adjust the membership function of each fuzzy set. One interesting research issue is a comparison between interval partitions and fuzzy partitions. We address this issue by using an entropy-based interval discretization method in hybrid fuzzy genetics-based machine learning (GBML). Our hybrid fuzzy GBML algorithm is applied to a number of data sets where interval discretization is fuzzified with different fuzzification grades from zero (i.e., interval partitions) to one (i.e., completely fuzzified partitions). Experimental results from various fuzzification grades are compared with each other.

Essentially the dynamic texture recognition is a multi-class classification problem that has become a real challenge for computer vision and machine learning techniques. In this paper, we propose a new approach to tackle the dynamic texture recognition problem. First, we utilize the fuzzy clustering technology to design a fuzzy codebook, and then construct a soft assigned local fuzzy coding feature to represent the whole dynamic texture sequence. This new coding strategy preserves spatial and temporal characteristics of dynamic texture. Finally, by evaluating the proposed approach using with the DynTex dataset, we show the effectiveness of the proposed local fuzzy coding strategy.

Wavelet transformation is used to reduce the dimension of high-dimensional datasets. This helps to improve the convergence speed of supervised learning process of the fuzzy SAM, which has a heavy computational burden in high-dimensional data. Fuzzy SAM becomes highly capable when deployed with wavelet features. This combination remarkably reduces its computational training burden. The performance of the proposed methodology is examined for two frequently used medical datasets: the lump breast cancer and heart disease. Experiments are deployed with a five-fold cross validation. Results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to other machine learning methods including probabilistic neural network, support vector machine, fuzzy ARTMAP, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. Faster convergence but higher accuracy shows a win-win solution of the proposed approach.

Depending on the network state, the algorithms vary in their ability to alleviate overloads and the amount of curtailment they apply. A performance benefit is demonstrated from appropriately selecting which algorithm to use based on network state, rather than always using the same algorithm for all network states.

This paper introduces a method that incorporates machine learning techniques to learn domain knowledge by transforming the input features. Our approach divides the inputs into subsets and then searches for the best machine learning technique for transforming each subset of inputs. Preprocessing of the inputs is not required in our approach because the machine learning techniques appropriately transform the inputs. Hence, this technique is capable of learning where nonlinear transformations of the inputs are needed. We show that the learned data transformations correspond to energy forecasting domain knowledge. Transformed subsets of the inputs are combined using ensemble regression, and the final forecasted value is obtained. Our approach is tested with natural gas and electricity demand signals. Experimental results show how this method can learn domain knowledge, which yields improved forecasts.

The prediction of miRNA genes is a challenging problem towards the understanding of post transcriptional gene regulation. The present paper focuses on developing a computational method for the identification of miRNA precursors. We propose a machine learning algorithm based on Random Forests (RF) for miRNA prediction. The prediction algorithm relies on a set of features; compiled from known features as well as others introduced for the first time; that results in a performance that is better than most well known miRNA classifiers. The method achieves 91.3% accuracy, 86% fmeasure, 97.2% specificity, 93.4% precision and 79.6% sensitivity, when tested on real data.

A considerable amount of literature provides relevant descriptions of proteins involved in this complex process. These proteins are often key to understand cellular alterations encountered in pathological conditions such as abnormal cell growth. The authors explored the use of text mining strategies to improve the retrieval of relevant articles and individual sentences for this topic. Moreover information extraction and text mining was used to detect and rank automatically Arabidopsis proteins important for the cell cycle. The obtained results were evaluated using independent data collections and compared to keyword-based strategies. The obtained results indicate that the use of machine learning methods can improve the sensitivity compared to term-co-occurrence, although with considerable differences when using abstracts and full text articles as input. At the level of document triage the recall ranges for abstracts from around 16% for keyword indexing, 37% for a sentence SVM classifier to 57% for SVM abstract classifier. In case of full text data, keyword and cell cycle phrase indexing obtained a recall of 42% and 55% respectively compared to 94% reached by a sentence classifier. In case of the cell cycle protein detection, the cell cycle keyword-protein co-occurrence strategy had a recall of 52% for abstracts and 70% for full text while a protein mentioning sentence classifier obtained a recall of over 83% for abstracts and 79% for full text. The generated cell cycle term co-occurrence statistics and SVM confidence scores for each protein were explored to rank proteins and filter a protein network in order to derive a topic specific subnetwork.

In this research, we identify the pattern of the simulated earthquake signal from the mobile phone accelerometer via machine learning. Before the data is processed into the classifier, static windowing and denoising was done to boost up the accuracy. Another fractal features are extracted from the pre-denoised data, which are the box counting dimension feature and the Hurst coefficient. The purpose of doing static windowing is to obtain more features so that we can have many potential useful attribute candidates as possible. Denoising with symlet wavelet is done to remove the noises which can worsen the classification accuracy. The classification is done using support vector machine and multilayer perceptron classifier with the accuracy of 81% and 82.15%, respectively.	[Antaresti, Tieta; Nugraha, Anggha Satya; Putra, I.

Exudate detection is an important problem in automatic screening systems for detection of diabetic retinopathy using color fundus photographs. In this paper, we present a method for detection of exudates in color fundus photographs, which combines several preprocessing and candidate extraction algorithms to increase the exudate detection accuracy. The first stage of the method consists of an ensemble of several exudate candidate extraction algorithms. In the learning phase, simulated annealing is used to determine weights for combining the results of the ensemble candidate extraction algorithms. The second stage of the method uses a machine learning-based classification for detection of exudate regions. The experimental validation was performed using the DRiDB color fundus image set. The validation has demonstrated that the proposed method achieved higher accuracy in comparison to state-of-the art methods.

These infections are difficult to treat due to a growing prevalence of resistance to many antibiotics. Among these hospital acquired infections, bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas are among the most common opportunistic pathogens. Computational methods for predicting potential novel antimicrobial therapies for hospital acquired Pseudomonad infections, as well as other hospital acquired infectious pathogens, are desperately needed. Using data generated from sequenced Pseudomonad genomes and metabolomic and transportomic computational approaches developed in our laboratory, we present a support vector machine learning method for identifying the most predictive molecular mechanisms that distinguish pathogenic from nonpathogenic Pseudomonads. Predictions were highly accurate, yielding F-scores between 0.84 and 0.98 in leave one out cross validations.

Strategies such as improved classification rules based on decision trees have been proposed. Other techniques such as Fuzzy Expert Systems (FES) and Neuro-Fuzzy Systems (NFS) have recently been applied. However, these methods lack the ability to detect temporal relationships among biomarker genes that will aid better understanding of the mechanism of hypertension disease. In this paper we apply a proposed two-stage bio-network construction approach that combines the power and computational efficiency of classification methods with the well-established predictive ability of Dynamic Bayesian Network. We demonstrate our method using the analysis of male young-onset hypertension microarray dataset. Four key genes were identified by the Least Angle Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and three Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) methods. Results show that cell regulation FOXQ1 may inhibit the expression of focusyltransferase-6 (FUT6) and that ABCG1 ATP-binding cassette sub-family G may also play inhibitory role against NR2E3 nuclear receptor sub-family 2 and CGB2 Chromatin Gonadotrophin.

This study uses machine learning techniques to analyze neural spiking activities within a population of neurons with the aim of finding spiking patterns associated with different stages of movement. Neural data was recorded during many experimental trials of a cat performing a skilled reach and withdrawal task. Using Weka and the LibSVM classifier, movement stages of the skilled task were identified with a high degree of certainty achieving an area-under-curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic of between 0.900 and 0.997 for the combined data set. Through feature selection, the identification of significant neurons has been made easier. Given this encouraging classification performance, the extension to automatic classification and updating of control models for use with neural prostheses will enable regular adjustments capable of compensating for neural changes.

We constructed a signal analysis procedure to detect peaks representing calcium cycling in signals and another procedure to classify them into either normal or abnormal peaks. Using machine learning methods we classified signals into normal or abnormal signals on the basis of peak findings in them. We compared classification results obtained to those made visually by an expert biotechnologist who assessed the signals independent of the computer method.

Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has been vastly explored to find consistent abnormality patterns of gray matter concentration (GMC) in schizophrenia, yet we are far from having reached conclusive evidence. This paper presents a machine learning approach based on resampling techniques to find brain regions with consistent patterns of GMC differences between healthy controls and schizophrenia patients, these regions being detected by means of source-based morphometry. This work uses multi-site data from the Mind Clinical Imaging Consortium, which is composed of sMRI data from 124 controls and 110 patients. Our method achieves a better classification rate than other algorithms and detects regions with GMC differences between both groups that are consistent with several findings on the literature. In addition, the results obtained on data from multiple sites suggest that it may be possible to replicate these results on other datasets.

To assess the activity and mobility level, wheelchair maneuvering data must be captured and analyzed. Recently, the inertial sensors, such as accelerometers, have been used to collect wheelchair maneuvering data. However, these sensors are sensitive to noises, which can lead to inaccurate analysis results. In this study, we analyzed the characteristics of wheelchair maneuvering data and developed a novel machine- learning algorithm, which could classify wheelchair maneuvering data into a series of wheelchair maneuvers. The use of machinelearning techniques empowers our approach to tolerate noises by capturing the patterns of wheelchair maneuvers. Experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm could accurately classify wheelchair maneuvers into eight classes, i. e., stationary, linear acceleration/deceleration, linear constant speed, left/right turns, and left/right spot turns. The fine- grained analysis on wheelchair maneuvering data can depict a more comprehensive picture of wheelchair users' activity and mobility levels, and enable the quantitative analysis of their quality of life and health status.

There are several patient characteristics that could be determining factors for a patient's RHM outcome success, but these characteristics have been largely unidentified. In this paper, we analyze results from an RHM system deployed in a six month Women's Heart Health study of 90 patients, and apply advanced feature selection and machine learning algorithms to identify patients' key baseline contextual features and build effective prediction models that help determine RHM outcome success. We introduce Wanda-CVD, a smartphone-based RHM system designed to help participants with cardiovascular disease risk factors by motivating participants through wireless coaching using feedback and prompts as social support. We analyze key contextual features that secure positive patient outcomes in both physiological parameters and lipid profiles. Results from the Women's Heart Health study show that health threat of heart disease, quality of life, family history, stress factors, social support, and anxiety at baseline all help predict patient RHM outcome success.

The aim of this paper is to find optimal signal processing methods and machine learning algorithms to achieve online sleep staging on the basis of a single EEG signal. The classification performance obtained using six different EEG signals and various signal processing feature sets is compared using the kappa statistic which has very recently become popular in sleep staging research. A variable duration of the EEG segment (or epoch) to decide on the sleep stage is also analyzed. Spectral-domain, time-domain, linear, and nonlinear features are compared in terms of performance and two types of machine learning approaches (random forests and support vector machines) are assessed. We have determined that frontal EEG signals, with spectral linear features, epoch durations between 18 and 30 seconds, and a random forest classifier lead to optimal classification performance while ensuring real-time online operation.

This study presents an algorithm that automatically estimates the AHI value using a disposable HealthPatch (TM) sensor. Volunteers (n=53, AHI: 0.1-85.8) participated in an overnight PSG study with patch sensors attached to their chest at three specified locations and data were wirelessly acquired. Features were computed for 150-second epochs of patch sensor data using analyses of heart rate variability, respiratory signals, posture and movements. Linear Support Vector Machine classifier was trained to detect the presence/absence of apnea/hypopnea events for each epoch. The number of epochs identified with events was subsequently mapped to AHI values using quadratic regression analysis. The classifier and regression models were optimized to minimize the mean-square error of AHI based on leave-one-out cross-validation. Comparison of predicted and reference AHI values resulted in linear correlation coefficients of 0.87, 0.88 and 0.92 for the three locations, respectively. The predicted AHI values were subsequently used to classify the control-to-mild apnea group (AHI < 15) and moderate-to-severe apnea (AHI >= 15) with an accuracy (95% confidence intervals) of 89.4% (77.4-95.4%), 85.0% (70.9-92.9%), and 82.9% (67.3-91.9%) for the three locations, respectively. Overnight physiological monitoring using a wireless patch sensor provides an accurate estimate of AHI.

Evaluation of Performance Metrics for Histopathological Image Classifier Optimization	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc				Clinical decision support systems use image processing and machine learning methods to objectively predict cancer in histopathological images. Integral to the development of machine learning classifiers is the ability to generalize from training data to unseen future data. A classification model's ability to accurately predict class label for new unseen data is measured by performance metrics, which also informs the classifier model selection process. Based on our research, commonly used metrics in literature (such as accuracy, ROC curve) do not accurately reflect the trained model's robustness. To the best of our knowledge, no research has been conducted to quantitatively compare performance metrics in the context of cancer prediction in histopathological images. In this paper, we evaluate various performance metrics and show that the Lift metric has the highest correlation between internal and external validation sets of a nested cross validation pipeline (R-2 = 0.57). Thus, we demonstrate that the Lift metric best generalizes classifier performance among the 23 metrics that were evaluated. Using the lift metric, we develop a classifier with a misclassification rate of 0.25 (4-class classifier) for data that the model was not trained on (external validation).

Machine learning techniques have been applied to ambulatory recordings of wrist actigraphy, light exposure, electrocardiograms (ECG), and distal and proximal skin temperature to develop ARMAX models capturing the main signal dependencies on circadian phase and evaluating them versus melatonin onset times. The most accurate models extracted heart rate variability features from an ECG coupled with wrist activity information to produce phase estimations with prediction errors of similar to 30 minutes. Replacing the ECG features with skin temperature from the upper leg led to a slight degradation, while less accurate results, in the order of 1 hour, were obtained from wrist activity and light measurements. The trade-off between highest precision and least obtrusive configuration is discussed for applications to sleep and mood disorders caused by a misalignment of the internal phase with the external solar and social times.

Serous borderline ovarian tumors (SBOTs) are considered to be earlier or less malignant forms of serous ovarian carcinomas (SOCs). SBOTs are asymptomatic and progression to advanced stages is common. Using DNA microarray technology, we designed multicategory classification models to discriminate ovarian cancer subclasses. To develop multicategory classification models with optimal parameters and features, we systematically evaluated three machine learning algorithms and three feature selection methods using five-fold cross validation and a grid search. The study included 22 subjects with normal ovarian surface epithelial cells, 12 with SBOTs, and 79 with SOCs according to microarray data with 54,675 probe sets obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information gene expression omnibus repository. Application of the optimal model of support vector machines one-versus-rest with signal-to-noise as a feature selection method gave an accuracy of 97.3%, relative classifier information of 0.916, and a kappa index of 0.941. In addition, 5 features, including the expression of putative biomarkers SNTN and AOX1, were selected to differentiate between normal, SBOT, and SOC groups. An accurate diagnosis of ovarian tumor subclasses by application of multicategory machine learning would be cost-effective and simple to perform, and would ensure more effective subclass-targeted therapy.

To develop multicategory classification models with optimal parameters and features, we performed a systematic evaluation of three machine learning algorithms and four feature selection methods using three-fold cross validation and a grid search. This study included 114 subjects of 11 neuromuscular diseases and 31 subjects of a control group using microarray data with 22,283 probe sets from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). We obtained an accuracy of 100%, relative classifier information (RCI) of 1.0, and a kappa index of 1.0 by applying the models of support vector machines one-versus-one (SVM-OVO), SVM one-versus-rest (OVR), and directed acyclic graph SVM (DAGSVM), using the ratio of genes between categories to within-category sums of squares (BW) feature selection method. Each of these three models selected only four features to categorize the 12 groups, resulting in a time-saving and cost-effective strategy for diagnosing neuromuscular diseases. In addition, a gene symbol, SPP1 was selected as the top-ranked gene by the BW method. We confirmed relationships between the gene (SPP1) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) from a previous study. With our models as clinically helpful tools, neuromuscular diseases could be classified quickly using a computer, thereby giving a time-saving, cost-effective, and accurate diagnosis.

This paper presents a method for automatic analysis and classification of human gait in the Get-Up-and-Go Test using a Microsoft Kinect sensor. Two types of features are automatically extracted from the human skeleton data provided by the Kinect sensor. The first type of feature is related to the human gait (e.g., number of steps, step duration, and turning duration); whereas the other one describes the anatomical configuration (e.g., knee angles, leg angle, and distance between elbows). These features characterize the degree of human physical mobility. State-of-the- art machine learning algorithms (i.e. Bag of Words and Support Vector Machines) are used to classify the severity of gaits in 12 subjects with ages ranging between 65 and 90 enrolled in a pilot study. Our experimental results show that these features can discriminate between patients who have a high risk for falling and patients with a lower fall risk.	[Kargar, Amir H.

However, the majority of these studies is characterized by two problems that could be easily fulfilled with recent resources supplied by the scientific literature. First, the majority of these studies use only intact subjects, with the unproved assumption that the results apply equally to amputees. Second, usually only electromyography data are used, despite other sensors (e.g., accelerometers) being easy to include into a real life prosthesis control system. In this paper we analyze the mentioned problems by the classification of 40 hand movements in 5 amputated and 40 intact subjects, using both sEMG and accelerometry data and applying several different state of the art methods. The datasets come from the NinaPro database, which supplies publicly available sEMG data to develop and test machine learning algorithms for prosthetics. The number of subjects can seem small at first sight, but it is not considering the literature of the field (which has to face the difficulty of recruiting trans-radial hand amputated subjects). Our results indicate that the maximum average classification accuracy for amputated subjects is 61.14%, which is just 15.86% less than intact subjects, and they show that intact subjects results can be used as proxy measure for amputated subjects. Finally, our comparison shows that accelerometry as a modality is less affected by amputation than electromyography, suggesting that real life prosthetics performance may easily be improved by inclusion of accelerometers.

Our model is comprised on embedded triaxial accelerometer of the smartphone to sense the body movements and a cloud server to store and process the sensory data for numerous kind of services. We compute the time and frequency domain features over the raw signals and evaluate different machine learning algorithms to identify an accurate activity recognition model for four kinds of physical activities (i.e., walking, running, cycling and hopping).

Improving single-trial detection of event-related potentials through artificial deformed signals	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc			BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; P300; SPELLER; BCI	To propose a reliable and robust Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), efficient machine learning and signal processing methods have to be used. However, it is often necessary to have a sufficient number of labeled brain responses to create a model. A large database that would represent all of the possible variabilities of the signal is not always possible to obtain, because calibration sessions have to be short. In the case of BCIs based on the detection of event-related potentials (ERPs), we propose to tackle this problem by including additional deformed patterns in the training database to increase the number of labeled brain responses. The creation of the additional deformed patterns is based on two approaches: (i) smooth deformation fields, and (ii) right and left shifted signals. The evaluation is performed with data from 10 healthy subjects participating in a P300 speller experiment. The results show that small shifts of the signal allow a better estimation of both spatial filters, and a linear classifier. The best performance, AUC=0.828 +/- 0.061, is obtained by combining the smooth deformation fields and the shifts, after spatial filtering, compared to AUC=0.543 +/- 0.025, without additional deformed patterns. The results support the conclusion that adding signals with small deformations can significantly improve the performance of single-trial detection when the amount of training data is limited.

However, the control systems are still limited and not natural. The Ninapro project is aiming at helping the scientific community to overcome these limits through the creation of publicly available electromyography data sources to develop and test machine learning algorithms. In this paper we describe the movement classification results gained from three subjects with an homogeneous level of amputation, and we compare them with the results of 40 intact subjects. The number of considered subjects can seem small at first sight, but it is not considering the literature of the field (which has to face the difficulty of recruiting trans-radial hand amputated subjects). The classification is performed with four different classifiers and the obtained balanced classification rates are up to 58.6% on 50 movements, which is an excellent result compared to the current literature. Successively, for each subject we find a subset of up to 9 highly independent movements, (defined as movements that can be distinguished with more than 90% accuracy), which is a deeply innovative step in literature. The natural control of a robotic hand in so many movements could lead to an immediate progress in robotic hand prosthetics and it could deeply change the quality of life of amputated subjects.

Because interpretation of clinical EEG data is time-intensive and reliant on experts who are in short supply, there is a great need for automated spike detectors. However, attempts to develop general-purpose spike detectors have so far been severely limited by a lack of expert-annotated data. Huge databases of interictal discharges are therefore in great demand for the development of general-purpose detectors. Detailed manual annotation of interictal discharges is time consuming, which severely limits the willingness of experts to participate. To address such problems, a graphical user interface "SpikeGUI" was developed in our work for the purposes of EEG viewing and rapid interictal discharge annotation. "SpikeGUI" substantially speeds up the task of annotating interictal discharges using a custom-built algorithm based on a combination of template matching and online machine learning techniques. While the algorithm is currently tailored to annotation of interictal epileptiform discharges, it can easily be generalized to other waveforms and signal types.

The AVF sound signals are recorded by electronic stethoscopes at pre-defined positions before and after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) treatment. Several new signal features of stenosis are identified and quantified, and the physiological explanations for these features are provided. Utilizing support vector machine method, an average of 90% two-fold cross-validation hit-rate can be obtained, with angiography as the gold standard. This offers a non-invasive easy-to-use diagnostic method for medical staff or even patients themselves for early detection of AVF stenosis.

A group of features, including matching values and positions, appearance of black pixels within predefined windows along the midline, are extracted from the ultrasound images using template matching and midline detection. Support vector machine (SVM) with Gaussian kernel is utilized to classify the bone images and interspinous images with optimal separation hyperplane. The SVM is trained with 800 images from 20 pregnant subjects and tested with 640 images from a separate set of 16 pregnant patients. A high success rate (97.25% on training set and 95.00% on test set) is achieved with the proposed method. The trained SVM model is further tested on 36 videos collected from 36 pregnant subjects and successfully identified the proper needle insertion site (interspinous region) on all of the cases. Therefore, the proposed method is able to identify the ultrasound images of lumbar spine in an automatic manner, so as to facilitate the anesthetists' work to identify the needle insertion point precisely and effectively.

Pressure ulcers are painful for patients and costly for healthcare systems. Accurate in-bed posture analysis can significantly help in preventing pressure ulcers. Specifically, bed inclination (back angle) is a factor contributing to pressure ulcer development. In this paper, an efficient methodology is proposed to classify bed inclination. Our approach uses pressure values collected from a commercial pressure mat system. Then, by applying a number of image processing and machine learning techniques, the approximate degree of bed is estimated and classified. The proposed algorithm was tested on 15 subjects with various sizes and weights. The experimental results indicate that our method predicts bed inclination in three classes with 80.3% average accuracy.	[Pouyan, M.

To reduce user inconvenience, we measured the activity using a mobile device which is not put on fixed position. Recognized results were verified with various machine learning algorithms, such as neural network (multilayer perceptron), decision tree (J48), SVM (support vector machine) and naive bayes classifier. All algorithms have shown over 97% accuracy including decision tree (J48), which recognized the activity with 98.35% accuracy. As a result, physical activity assessment method based on rotated acceleration using quaternion can classify sedentary behavior with more accuracy without considering devices' position and orientation.

Assigning an accurate diagnosis is critical to guide treatment. Currently, the diagnosis of BPD is made exclusively through the use of clinical assessment; no objective test is available to assist with its diagnosis. Thus, it is highly desirable to explore quantitative biomarkers to better characterize this illness. In this study, we extract spectral power features from the power spectral density and cross spectral density of resting-state fMRI data, covering 20 brain regions and 5 frequency bands. Machine learning approaches are employed to select the most discriminating features to identify BPD. Following a leave-one-out cross validation procedure, the proposed approach achieves 93.55% accuracy (100% specificity and 90.48% sensitivity) in classifying 21 BPD patients from 10 healthy controls based on the top ranked features. The most discriminating features are selected from the 0.1 similar to 0.15Hz frequency band, and are located at the left medial orbitofrontal cortex, the left thalamus, and the right rostral anterior cingulate cortex. The high classification accuracy indicates the discriminating power of the spectral power features in BPD identification. The proposed machine learning approach may be used as an objective test to assist clinical diagnosis of BPD.

In this cross domain priming paradigm, the participants are asked to rate how much they like the stimulus images, on a 7-point Likert scale, after being subliminally exposed to masked lexical prime words, with EEG recorded simultaneously. Statistical analysis tools are used to analyze the effect of priming on behavior, and machine learning techniques to infer the primes from EEGs. The experiment reveals strong effects of subliminal priming on the participants' explicit rating of images. The subjective judgment affected by the priming makes visible change in event-related potentials (ERPs); results show larger ERP amplitude for the negative primes compared with positive and neutral primes. In addition, Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifiers are proposed to infer the prime types from the average ERPs, which yields a classification rate of 70%.

Most existing fMRI data analysis techniques rely on fixed thresholds to identify active voxels under a task condition or functionally connected voxels in the resting state. Due to fMRI non-stationarity, a fixed threshold cannot adapt to intra-and inter-subject variation and provide a reliable mapping of brain function. In this work, a machine learning method is proposed for a unified analysis of both task-related and resting state fMRI data. Specifically, the mapping of brain function in a task condition or resting state is formulated as an outlier detection process. Support vector machines are used to provide an initial mapping and refine mapping results. The method does not require a fixed threshold for the final decision, and can adapt to fMRI non-stationarity. The proposed method was evaluated using experimental data acquired from multiple human subjects. The results indicate that the proposed method can provide reliable mapping of brain function, and is applicable to various quantitative fMRI studies.

Rather than reliance on heuristics, human oversight and expert training from images is incorporated into logistic regression models. The latter serve to estimate the probability of tissue class assignment for each voxel as well as the probability of tissue boundary occurring between neighboring voxels given the multi-modal image intensities. The regression models provide parameters for a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework that defines an energy function with the regional and boundary probabilistic terms. Using this CRF, a max-flow/min-cut algorithm is used to segment other slices in the 3D image set automatically with options of addition user input. We apply this approach to segment visible tumors in multi-modal medical volumetric images.

This work therefore proposes novel low-cost skin aging assessment apparatus by using light back-scatter intensity level of Red, Blue, Green and Infrared bands. This is further enhanced by using a machine learning method to accurately predict actual skin age. The proposed method appears to be highly capable of capturing multi-layer cellular changes exhibited by the biological skin aging process and predicting skin ages with a root-mean-square error of as low as 0.160 by using only four features based on the four multi-spectral light sources. This assessment kit seems to be the first of its kind, which is expected to bring great benefit to both personalized skin healthcare and cosmetic sectors.	[Seker, H.; Uslan, V.; Orun, A.

Although the European Commission has proposed a new generation of competitiveness-driven bilateral free trade agreements with emerging and developing countries, some EU member countries are skeptical of China's trade practices which have halted Brussels and Beijing negotiations. However, some EU officials have suggested that this agreement will be a stepping stone for future liberalization of the EU economy and that a free trade agreement with China is only a matter of time. The purpose of this study is to investigate the comparative advantage of EU members and China, how complementary trade is between the EU and China and how similar are the exports of these prospective FTA partners. This is a research paper based on secondary data analysis; data is obtained from various official entities. This study uses statistical and machine learning techniques in order to detect meaningful trade relationships between the EU and China.

The proposed method allows us to detect voltage sags and locate sag source from inside or outside when measurement transients are present in the recorded data from DG installations. S-transform is applied to transients signal processing first. Then, features for voltage sag source classification are exacted in reference to criteria of the some existed methods. Support vector machine is applied to establish the optimal hyper-plan for classifying sag source from upstream or downstream inside by machine learning. Last, the established binary classifier is used to classify upstream or downstream, and then determine the sag source from DG system or outside. Simulation in wind farms is presented according to the proposed method.

A fully automatic system to recognize signs that starts with breaking up signs into manageable subunits is proposed. A framework for segmenting and tracking skin objects from signing videos is described. A boosting algorithm to learn a subset of weak classifiers for extracted features to combine them into a strong classifier for each sign is then applied. A joint learning strategy to share subunits across sign classes is adopted, which leads to a more efficient classification of sign gestures. Experimental results shown by the system demonstrate that the proposed approach is promising to build an effective and scalable system on real-world hand gesture recognition from continuous video sequences.

Classifying the images through machine learning algorithms is getting wide range of acceptability nowadays. Being a branch of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning implies the study of systems which has the capability to learn from data. Machine learning involves two parts representation and generalization. Representation implies labeling seen data instances and generalization determines whether the system can perform well on unlabelled data instances. In this article, we focused on the performance of machine learning algorithms [1). A CBIR (Content Based Image Retrieval) frame work has been developed and obtained a reduced texture feature data set using CaltechIOI image database [2). We highlight the top five algorithms such as Logistic, Bagging, LMT, Multiclass classifier and Attribute selection classifier which can be used for image classification. In introduction, an overview of the selected techniques is presented. We have extracted 2037 feature vectors from CaltechlOI image database. These data are used to distinguish the performance of machine learning algorithms. Having checked all machine learning algorithms supported, we identified top five algorithms that have a better performance compared to other machine learning algorithms. The software used for testing is WEKA [3), which is an open source software developed by University of Waikato, New Zealand.	[Ajeesh, S. S.] MS Univ, Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, India; [Indu, M.

The empirical efficiency of these methods is backed with strong theoretical guarantees, providing sharp bounds on their convergence rates. These convergence rates are known to depend on the structure of the underlying objective function, with faster rates being possible for objective functions that are smooth and/or (strongly) convex, or optima that have desirable features such as sparsity. More precisely, for an objective function that is strongly convex, stochastic gradient descent enjoys a convergence rate ranging from O (1/T), when features vectors are extremely sparse, to O (d/T) when feature vectors are dense [10], [6].

The objective of this paper is to find out the best description of the learning curves produced by a Naive Bayes classification. The performance of Naive Bayes was measured on 121 datasets using k-fold cross-validation. Power, linear, logarithmic and exponential functions were fit to the data. The exponential function was a better descriptor of the error rate in 44 of 60 useful cases. Average mean squared error is significantly different at P=0,000 from power and linear and at P=0,001 from logarithmic function. The exponential function's rank is significantly different from the ranks of other models (P=0,000). The results can be used to forecast the future performance of the learner, or to check where on the learning curve the current measurement lies.

Supervised feature selection aims to overcome this problem by selecting features that are highly related to the class labels, yet unrelated to each other. One proposed technique to select good features with few inter-dependencies is minimal Redundancy Maximal Relevance (mRMR) [12], but this can be impractical with large feature sets. In many situations, features are extracted from signal data such as vehicle telemetry, medical sensors, or financial time-series, and it is possible for feature redundancies to exist both between features extracted from the same signal (intra-signal), and between features extracted from different signals (inter-signal). We propose a two stage selection process to take advantage of these different types of redundancy, considering intra-signal and inter-signal redundancies separately. We illustrate the process on vehicle telemetry signal data collected in a driver distraction monitoring project. We evaluate it using several machine learning algorithms: Random Forest; Naive Bayes; and C4.5 Decision Tree. Our results show that this two stage process significantly reduces the computation required because of inter-dependency calculations, while having minimal detrimental effect on the performance of the feature sets produced.

Moreover there are many websites whose task is to extract the news headlines from online newspapers and display those headlines on their websites for information to their users. One other important application of headlines extraction is in text summarization where headline-sentences are given more importance than other sentences for including in final summary. This paper concentrates on automatic headlines extraction from Punjabi newspapers. Punjabi is the official language for state of Punjab. But Punjabi is under resource language. There are very less number of computational-linguistic resources available for Punjabi. But a lot of research is going on for developing NLP applications in Punjabi language. It is first time that automatic headlines extraction from Punjabi newspapers has been developed with four features of headlines: 1) Punctuation mark feature 2) Font feature 3) Number of words feature and 4) Title keywords feature. Weights of these four features are calculated by applying mathematical regression as machine learning approach. For extracting headlines, final scores of sentences are obtained using feature weight equation as: w(1)f(1) + w(2)f(2) + w(3)f(3) + w(4)f(4) where f(1), f(2), f(3) and f(4) are feature-scores of four features and w(1), w(2), w(3) and w(4) are learned weights of these features. The accuracy of Punjabi headline extraction system is 98.39% which is tested over fifty Punjabi single/multi news documents. A part of Punjabi headlines extraction system with Punctuation mark feature has been integrated with Punjabi Text Summarization system which is available online.

They have to be computationally efficient. In this paper, we present a novel list-based approach to compute efficiently the string subsequence kernel (SSK). Our main idea is that our list-based SSK reduces to range query problem. We started by the construction of a match list L(s, t) = {(i, j) : si = t(j)} where s and t are the strings to be compared; such match list contains only the required data that contribute to the result. To do some intermediate processing efficiently, we constructed a layered range tree and applied the corresponding computational geometry algorithms. Moreover, we extended our match list to be a list of lists in order to improve the computation efficiency of the SSK. The whole process takes O(broken vertical bar L broken vertical bar log broken vertical bar L broken vertical bar+ pK) time and O(broken vertical bar L broken vertical bar log broken vertical bar L broken vertical bar+ K) space, where broken vertical bar L broken vertical bar is the size of the match list, p is the length of the SSK and K is the total reported points by range queries over all the entries of the list.

Most theories regarding structural modal analysis are centred on the linear modal analysis which has proved to now to be the method of choice for the analysis of linear dynamic structures. However, for the majority of other structures, where the effect of nonlinearity becomes significant, then nonlinear modal analysis is a necessity. The objective of the current paper is to demonstrate a machine learning approach to output-only nonlinear modal decomposition using kernel independent component analysis and locally linear embedding analysis. The key element is to demonstrate a pattern recognition approach which exploits the idea of independence of principal components by learning the nonlinear manifold between the variables.

The experimental methods are both expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, many machine learning based computational approaches were proposed in the last two decades. Recently, it is proved that the number of proteins with multiple sites is rising. To determinate the subcellular localizations of this kind of proteins is a more difficult problem. Generally, dataset construction, feature representation, algorithm design and validation test are the four main aspects need to be considered in developing the predicting algorithms. This paper reviewed these four topics in detail. Although a great success has been got by many researchers, there are still a lot of problems need to study deeply.

The popularization of real-time depth sensors brings such applications to the public at large. However, familiar gestures are culture-specific, and their automatic recognition must therefore result from a machine learning process. In particular this requires either teaching the user how to communicate with the machine, such as for popular mobile devices or gaming consoles, or tailoring the application to a specific public. The latter option serves a large number of applications such as sport monitoring, virtual reality or surveillance - although it requires a usually tedious training. This work intends to simplify the training required by gesture recognition methods. While the traditional procedure uses a set of key poses, which must be defined and trained, prior to a set of gestures that must also be defined and trained, we propose to automatically deduce the set of key poses from the gesture training. We represent a record of gestures as a curve in high dimension and robustly segment it according to the curvature of that curve. Then we use an asymmetric Hausdorff distance between gestures to define a discriminant key pose as the most distant pose between gestures. This further allows to dynamically group gestures by similarity. The training only requires the user to perform the gestures and eventually refine the gesture labeling. The generated set of key poses and gestures then fits in previous human action recognition algorithms. Furthermore, this semi-supervised learning allows re-using a previous training to extend the set of gestures the computer should be able to recognize. Experimental results show that the automatically generated discriminant key poses lead to similar recognition accuracy as previous work.

Competence function (measure) of base classifier can be determined using validation set in the two step procedure. The first step consists in creating competence set, i.e. the set of classifier competences for all validation objects. To this end a hypothetical classifier called randomized reference classifier (RRC) is constructed. Since RRC - on average - acts like the evaluated classifier, the competence of the classifier at validation point is calculated as the probability of correct classification at this point of the respective RRC. In the second step, the competences calculated for a validation set are generalised to an entire feature space by constructing a competence function based on a supervised learning procedure. In this study, the second step of the above procedure is addressed by developing the fuzzy inference methods of learning competence functions. Two fuzzy inference systems are developed and applied to the supervised learning competence function of base classifiers in a MCS system with dynamic classifier selection (DCS) and dynamic ensemble selection (DES) scheme: Mamdani fuzzy inference system and Sugeno fuzzy inference system. Both fuzzy inference systems were experimentally tested and compared against 4 literature methods of learning classifier competence (potential function, regression model, multilayer perceptron, k-nearest neighbor scheme) using 9 databases taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The experimental results clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed supervised learning competence function using fuzzy inference systems regardless of the ensemble type used (homogeneous or heterogeneous).

The SVM input data is transformed into a high dimensional space using some kernel functions where linear separation is more likely. However, there are some computational drawbacks associated to SVM. One of them is the computational burden required to find out the more adequate parameters for the kernel mapping considering each non-linearly separable input data space, which reflects the performance of SVM. This paper introduces the Polynomial Powers of Sigmoid for SVM kernel mapping, and it shows their advantages over well-known kernel functions using real and synthetic datasets.	[Fernandes, Silas E.

Learning to Annotate Clothes in Everyday Photos: Multi-Modal, Multi-Label, Multi-Instance Approach	2014 27TH SIBGRAPI CONFERENCE ON GRAPHICS, PATTERNS AND IMAGES (SIBGRAPI)			English	Proceedings Paper	27th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI)	AUG 27-30, 2014	Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho Amparo Pesquisa Estado Rio de Janerio, CAPES, Conshello Nacl Desenvolvimento Cientifico Tecnologico, Samsung	Sch Appl Math Getulio Vargas Fdn	Automatic annotation; multi-label classification; machine learning	IMAGE RETRIEVAL; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; SETS	In this paper, we present an effective algorithm to automatically annotate clothes in everyday photos posted in online social networks, such as Facebook and Instagram. Specifically, clothing annotation can be informally stated as predicting, as accurately as possible, the garment items appearing in the target photo. This task not only poses interesting challenges for existing vision and recognition algorithms, but also brings huge opportunities for recommender and e-commerce systems. We formulate the annotation task as a multi-modal, multi-label and multi-instance classification problem: (i) both image and textual content (i.e., comments about the image) are available for learning classifiers, (ii) the classifiers must predict a set of labels (i.e., a set of garment items), and (iii) the decision on which labels to predict comes from a bag of instances that are used to build a function, which separates labels that should be predicted from those that should not be. Under this setting, we propose a classification algorithm which employs association rules in order to build a prediction model that combines image and textual information, and adopts an entropy-minimization strategy in order to the find the best set of labels to predict. We conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed algorithm using everyday photos collected from two major fashion-related social networks, namely pose. com and chictopia. com. Our results show that the proposed algorithm provides improvements when compared to popular first choice multi-label algorithms that range from 2% to 40% in terms of accuracy.

Current methods for predicting preterm births at an early stage are inadequate. Yet, there has been increasing evidence that the analysis of uterine electrical signals, from the abdominal surface, could provide an independent and easy way to diagnose true labour and predict preterm delivery. This analysis provides a heavy focus on the use of advanced machine learning techniques and Electrohysterography (EHG) signal processing. Most EHG studies have focused on true labour detection, in the window of around seven days before labour. However, this paper focuses on using such EHG signals to detect preterm births. In achieving this, the study uses an open dataset containing 262 records for women who delivered at term and 38 who delivered prematurely. The synthetic minority oversampling technique is utilized to overcome the issue with imbalanced datasets to produce a dataset containing 262 term records and 262 preterm records. Six different artificial neural networks were used to detect term and preterm records. The results show that the best performing classifier was the LMNC with 96% sensitivity, 92% specificity, 95% AUC and 6% mean error.

This paper presents the classification of multi-class datasets which present more challenges when compare to binary class datasets in machine learning. Furthermore, it argues that the performance evaluation of a classification model for multi-class imbalanced datasets in terms of simple "accuracy rate" can possibly provide misleading results. Other parameters such as failure avoidance, true identification of positive and negative instances of a class and class discrimination are also very important. We, in this paper, hypothesize that "misclassification of true positive patterns should not necessarily be categorized as false negative while evaluating a classifier for multi-class datasets", a common practice that has been observed in the existing literature. In order to address these hidden challenges for the generalization of a particular classifier, several evaluation metrics are compared for a multi-class dataset with four classes; three of them belong to different neurodegenerative diseases and one to control subjects. Three classifiers, linear discriminant, quadratic discriminant and Parzen are selected to demonstrate the results with examples.

In addition, cars become bigger and often use more than one parking space. As a result neighboring parking spaces can be affected by a parked car. So, a basically free parking space might be too narrow for an arriving car depending on the arriving car's size. Therefore, means to detect car positions on parking spaces in a fine granular way are required to detect such situations and avoid inefficient parking space searches. Wireless sensor networks provide the possibility to sense the exact occupation of a parking space and potential influences on neighboring parking spaces. However, current solutions focus only on the detection if a parking space is occupied or not. In our work, we present a sensor deployment and a machine learning-based approach able to provide the mentioned more fine-granular detection level.

Building your own infrastructure based 802.11 fingerprinting service	2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ENVIRONMENTS (IE)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Intelligent Environments (IE)	JUN 30-JUL 04, 2014	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Soc Tech Comm, Taylor & Francis Grp, IOS Press, Intel, FortiTo, China ComService, IEEE Comp Soc		WiFi fingerprinting indoor positioning; machine learning; indoor location for intelligent environments		Indoor positioning is a basic requirement of Intelligent Environments. It is a building block for providing context-aware computing. Infrastructure based WiFi fingerprinting positioning technology (IBWFP) is one way of satisfying such requirement. In IBWFP, the basic landmarks for positioning are fixed 802.11 access points with a well known location. And it is infrastructure based because it refers to the fact that access points devote some computing capacity to collect 802.11 packets from other 802.11 mobile devices. Such information enables positioning a 802.11 mobile device indoors. This paper is a proposal for an inexpensive IBWFP. Its main contributions are a detailed accounting on how to build the physical system (business logic within the routers, configuration of the network in terms of number and location) and how to deploy and maintain the service on top of the physical system (i.e. site survey, location engine creation, validation and management) with enough accuracy to exploit it. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to give a guideline to build your own inexpensive IBWFP technology covering all these practical aspects. Our intent is to push forward this technology by sharing our experience using it.

This system is also capable of predicting subsequent activities for individual users. Force Sensing Resistors are mounted on the seat and back of a chair to gather the haptic (i.e., touch-based) posture information. Subsequently, posture information is fed into two classifiers, one for back posture and the other one for leg posture. A hidden Markov model approach is used to establish the activity model from sitting posture sequences. Furthermore, by implementing a context awareness prediction algorithm (e.g. Active-Lezi), the system discovers patterns and predicts subsequent activities. The system will lead to many potential applications such as the analysis of sitting or lying subjects, motion tracking for rehabilitation, interaction assistance, and the detection of anomalous activities.

However, processing the event data usually cross-cuts the business logic of IoT applications and offering such reusable functionality as a service towards a variety of customers with different needs is often faced with scalability concerns. We present SAMURAI, a multi-tenant streaming context architecture that integrates and exposes well-known components for complex event processing, machine learning, knowledge representation, NoSQL persistence and in-memory data grids. SAMURAI pursues a twofold approach to achieve scalability: (1) distributed deployment with horizontal scalability, (2) shared resources through multitenancy. For the scenario used in the experimental evaluation of our architecture, the results show little overhead to support multi-tenancy, with near-linear scalability and flexible elasticity for deployment schemes with data partitioning per tenant.

Many algorithms have been developed that are now commonly used in various fields ranging from natural language processing to computational finance and has been brought to use commercially as well. Recently, there has been an increase in research on machine learning application in the area of automated video surveillance systems. Most of these algorithms assume that both the training data and test data belong to same feature space with same distribution which might not always be true. This constraint gave rise to the concept of transfer learning which uses the knowledge from the preoccupied knowledge from other related task. This paper aims at improving the efficiency of a transfer learning based machine learning technique for object classification, MKTL framework. It can be brought to use for multiclass object classification in automated video surveillance systems.

The fail safe operation of a safety critical system like battery operated car or any other lifesaving systems are heavily depend upon earlier prediction of battery life. SOC or State-of-Charge estimation is one of the well-known method to predict the runtime of a battery. Various approaches are adapted by automotive society to correctly predict the runtime or the SOC of a battery like Kalman filter, UKF and many others. This paper proposes a new approach, the method of regression to predict the future power demand of a car while running on the road. The aim is to identify that, the battery will support the run of the car in next 10 seconds or not. The runtime prediction of a battery, not only depends upon the starting SOC but also depends upon other factors like battery health and road profile imposed. To overcome this type of difficulties the self-corrective regression model is proposed and implemented. Experiments performed on different road profiles, validate demanded power by the car in up-coming 10 seconds of its run. The major problem of SoC estimation is to determine initial SoC of a battery. Extensive experiments needed to calculate the initial SoC and which may also vary with the life of the battery. The novelty of this work shows, the method to predict the future power demand by updating its model parameters and without any initial SoC calculation. Model parameters are updated by the introducing new current and voltage sample in the model.

Linear quadratic methods offer global optimal control solutions for LTI systems. Such methods offer optimal solutions only locally for systems which become LTV due to parametric uncertainties. We propose that such an LTV system can be divided into two or more LTI systems in terms of the operating conditions ranging from nominal to most uncertain. In our proposed approach, two linear quadratic regulators would each be separately designed for nominal operating conditions and the uncertain conditions in a system. It is shown that the switchings between the two regulators depend upon the size of the uncertainty. A machine learning algorithm such as the support vector machine has been used to design a switching surface as a function of only the parametric uncertainties of the system. Extended high gain observers are used to estimate the parametric uncertainties needed for switching between the two regulators. Simulation results are included to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.

The proposed methodology corrects the error by taking into account morphosyntactic information regarding the context of the orthographically ambiguous word. Our methodology is knowledge-poor because the information used is only the endings of the words in the context of the ambiguous word; as such it can be adapted even by simple editors for real-time spelling correction. We tested our method using Id3, C4.5, Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes and Random Forest as machine learning algorithms for correct spelling prediction. Experimental results show that the success rate of the above method is usually between 90% and 95% and sometimes approaching 97%.

The transformation of the initial dataset into a smaller one with the same genetic information is a crucial task and it is performed through feature selection. Biologists evaluate features using methods originating from the field of population genetics. Although several studies have been performed in order to compare the existing biological methods, there is a lack of comparison between methods originating from the biology field with others originating from the machine learning.

The system encompasses a rich ontology of activities, categorized across dimensions such as activity type, historical era, user profile and age group. Each activity is characterized by attributes describing its location, cost, availability and duration range. The system makes activity recommendations based on user-selected criteria, such as visit duration and timing, geographical areas of interest and visit profiling. The user edits the proposed list and the system creates a plan, taking into account temporal and geographical constraints imposed by the selected activities, as well as by other events in the user's calendar. The user may edit the proposed plan or request alternative plans. A recommendation engine employs non-intrusive machine learning techniques to dynamically infer and update the user's profile, concerning his preferences for both activities and resulting plans, while taking privacy concerns into account. The system is coupled with a module to semiautomatically feed its database with new activities in the area.

This problem has many applications in quantum physics, machine learning, and pattern matching. Two metrics are commonly used for evaluating the estimators: i) variance; ii) a high probability multiplicative-approximation guarantee. Almost all the known estimators are of the form 1/k Sigma(k)(i=1) x(i)(T) Lambda x(i) is an element of R-n being i.i.d for some special distribution. Our main results are summarized as follows: 1. We give an exact characterization of the minimum variance unbiased estimator in the broad class of linear nonadaptive estimators (which subsumes all the existing known estimators). 2. We also consider the query complexity lower bounds for any (possibly nonlinear and adaptive) estimators: (a) We show that any estimator requires Omega(1/is an element of) queries to have a guarantee of variance at most is an element of. (b) We show that any estimator requires Omega(1/is an element of(2) log 1/delta) to achieve a (1 +/-is an element of)-multiplicative approximation guarantee with probability at least 1 - delta. Both above lower bounds are asymptotically tight. As a corollary, we also resolve a conjecture in the seminal work of Avron and Toledo (Journal of the ACM 2011) regarding the sample complexity of the Gaussian Estimator.

The purpose of this study is twofold. We classify the customers of one cloud-based software company by using two classifications methods: C4.5 and a support vector machine (SVM). We use machine learning primarily to estimate the frequency distribution of the customer defection possibility. The result shows that both the C4.5 and SVM classifications perform well, and by obtaining frequency distributions of the defection possibility, we can predict the number of customers defecting and the number of customers retained.

Creating Multiple Classifier Systems for this task has proven itself as a promising research direction. Here arises a problem on how to select valuable members to the committee - so far a largely unexplored area in one-class classification. Recently, a novel scheme utilizing a multi-objective ensemble pruning was proposed. It combines selecting best individual classifiers with maintaining the diversity of the committee pool. As it relies strongly on the search algorithm applied, we investigate here the performance of different methods. Five algorithms are examined - genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, tabu search and hybrid methods, combining the mentioned approaches in the form of memetic algorithms. Using compound optimization methods leads to a significant improvement over standard search methods. Experimental results carried on a number of benchmark datasets proves that careful examination of the search algorithms for one-class ensemble pruning may greatly contribute to the quality of the committee being formed.

Each data chunk consists of prototypes including also information as to whether the class prediction of these instances was correct or not. When a new data chunk is formed, classifier ensembles formed at an earlier stage are updated. Three online learning algorithms for performing machine learning on data streams based on three different prototype selection approaches to forming data chunks are considered.

A psychological wellness index integrates the survey results that measure stress, depression, anger, and fatigue. The current model is based on a multiple regression method and manually constructs a cause and effect model of the psychological wellness. However, this constructed model depends upon the survey responses. The relationship between these survey responses and psychological wellness indices are not linear due to data imbalance. When any data inconsistency exists, the reliability of the model decreases and eventually cost of maintenance on model revision increases. Also, when new variables or data entries are considered, the entire model should be constructed again. This paper examines the feasibility of machine learning algorithms to predict the psychological wellness indices based on the reconstructed responses. In this paper, four machine learning algorithms including multi-layer perceptron, support vector regression, generalized regression neural network, and k nearest neighbor regression, are compared and the experiment results are presented.

Although elasticity is beneficiary in terms of cost, obligation of maintaining Service Level Agreements leads to necessity in dealing with the cost-performance trade-off. Proactive auto-scaling is an efficient approach to overcome this problem. In this approach scaling actions are generated based on prediction results. Recently, several research studies have been focusing on improving prediction accuracy in order to improve the efficiency of autoscaling mechanisms. However, the sensitivity of auto-scaling mechanisms to the prediction results is neglected in the domain. In this work we have investigated the sensitivity of auto-scaling mechanisms to the prediction results by evaluating the influence of performance predictions accuracy on the auto-scaling actions. Specifically, we have compared actions of threshold based scaling techniques which are generated based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN) predictions. Our experimental results show that although SVM is more accurate than NN, scaling decisions made by the two algorithms are identical in 91.5% of the time. Furthermore, we have shown that the optimal training duration for SVM and NN is about 60% of experiment duration.

The resonant frequency of the CMUT changes as mass is added due to chemicals absorbing into a chemical-sensitive layer on the top of the plate. However, these sensors suffer from the problem that they are not selective to a single chemical. As a solution, we present a system of four CMUT chemical sensors with different functionalization layers. Neural networks are used to do pattern recognition on the sensor outputs in order to distinguish different chemicals.

Several schemes have been studied in this paper to overcome the drawbacks produced by missing values in data mining tasks, one of the most well known is based on preprocessing, formerly known as imputation. In this work, we propose a new multiple imputation approach based on sampling techniques to handle missing values problems, in order to improve the quality and efficiency of data mining process. The proposed method is favorably compared with some imputation techniques and outperforms the existing approaches using an experimental benchmark on a large scale, waveform dataset taken from machine learning repository and different rate of missing values (till 95%).

While there exists multiple studies that analyze the factors that can help diagnose or predict AD, this is the first study that considers only non-image data, while using a multitude of techniques from machine learning and data mining. The applied methods include classification tree analysis, cluster analysis, data visualization, and classification analysis. All the analysis, except classification analysis, resulted in insights that eventually lead to the construction of a risk table for AD. The study contributes to the literature not only with new insights, but also by demonstrating a framework for analysis of such data. The insights obtained in this study can be used by individuals and health professionals to assess possible risks, and take preventive measures.

In the standard setting, the agent learns from stochastic feedback in the form of real-valued rewards. In many applications, however, numerical reward signals are not readily available-instead, only weaker information is provided, in particular relative preferences in the form of qualitative comparisons between pairs of alternatives. This observation has motivated the study of variants of the multi-armed bandit problem, in which more general representations are used both for the type of feedback to learn from and the target of prediction. The aim of this paper is to provide a survey of the state-of-the-art in this field, that we refer to as preference-based multi-armed bandits. To this end, we provide an overview of problems that have been considered in the literature as well as methods for tackling them. Our systematization is mainly based on the assumptions made by these methods about the data-generating process and, related to this, the properties of the preference-based feedback.

A current development to increase connectivity between participants and to be resilient against service degradation attempts is to support different communication protocols, and to switch between these protocols in case degradation or censorship are detected. Supporting multiple protocols with different properties and having to share resources for communication with multiple partners creates new challenges with respect to protocol selection and resource allocation to optimally satisfy the applications' requirements for communication. This paper presents a novel approach for automatic transport selection and resource allocation with a focus on decentralised networks. Our goal is to evaluate the communication mechanisms available for each communication partner and then allocate resources in line with the requirements of the applications. We begin by detailing the overall requirements for an algorithm for transport selection and resource allocation, and then compare three different solutions using (1) a heuristic, (2) linear optimisation, and (3) machine learning. To show the suitability and the specific benefits of each approach, we evaluate their performance with respect to usability, scalability and quality of the solution found in relation to application requirements.

User generated content from social media platforms can provide early clues about product allergies, adverse events and product counterfeiting. This paper reports a work in progress with contributions including: the development of a framework for gathering and analyzing the views and experiences of users of drug and cosmetic products using machine learning, text mining and sentiment analysis; the application of the proposed framework on Facebook comments and data from Twitter for brand analysis, and the description of how to develop a product safety lexicon and training data for modeling a machine learning classifier for drug and cosmetic product sentiment prediction. The initial brand and product comparison results signify the usefulness of text mining and sentiment analysis on social media data while the use of machine learning classifier for predicting the sentiment orientation provides a useful tool for users, product manufacturers, regulatory and enforcement agencies to monitor brand or product sentiment trends in order to act in the event of sudden or significant rise in negative sentiment.

These methods are established in vector spaces, which are undefined for categorical data. In this paper, we propose a new kind of kernel trick, showing that mapping of categorical samples into kernel spaces can be alternatively described as assigning a kernel-based weight to each categorical attribute of the input space, so that common distance measures can be employed. A data-driven approach is then proposed to kernel bandwidth selection by optimizing feature weights. We also make use of the kernel-based distance measure to effectively extend nearest-neighbor classification to classify categorical data. Experimental results on real-world data sets show the outstanding performance of this approach compared to that obtained in the original input space.

It also proposes using the document centroid as a threshold for normalizing documents in a document collection. Document centroid normalization helps to achieve more effective information retrieval as it enables good discrimination between documents. In the context of a machine learning application, namely unsupervised document indexing and retrieval, we compared the effectiveness of the proposed weighting scheme to the 'Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency' or TF-IDF, which is commonly used and considered as one of the best existing weighting schemes. The paper shows how the document centroid is used to remove less significant weights from documents and how this helps to achieve better retrieval effectiveness. Most of the existing weighting schemes in information retrieval research assume that the whole document collection is static. The results presented in this paper show that the proposed weighting scheme can produce higher retrieval effectiveness compared with the TF-IDF weighting scheme, in both static and dynamic document collections. The results also show the variation in information retrieval effectiveness that is achieved for static and dynamic document collections by using a specific weighting scheme. This type of comparison has not been presented in the literature before.	[Ibrahim, Osman A.

It is applied in many fields: machine learning, pattern recognition, data mining, compression,...,etc. In this paper, we introduce this technique into approximation reasoning. Before the introduction, we construct a theoretical framework of such approximation first. This approximation is based on reasoning of incomplete information in which there exists no algorithm such that the intersection between arbitrary target sets and partitioned clusters is decidable, while there exist some algorithms for the decidability of the subset operation between them. Then, under this framework, we utilize PCA to implement such approximation reasoning. PCA is mainly applied to partitioning a universe repeatedly until all the partitioned sets are singular or indecomposable. Then we collect all the partitioned clusters as the granular knowledge and then use this knowledge to approximate the target set.

Activity recognition allows applications to construct activity profiles for each subject which could be used effectively for healthcare and safety applications. Automated human activity recognition systems face several challenges such as number of sensors, sensor precision, gait style differences, and others. This work proposes a machine learning system to automatically recognise human activities based on a single body-worn accelerometer. The in-house collected dataset contains 3 D acceleration of 5 0 subjects performing 1 0 different activities. The dataset was produced to ensure robustness and prevent subject-biased results. The feature vector is derived from simple statistical features. The proposed method benefits from RGB-to-YIQ colour space transform as kernel to transform the feature vector into more discriminable features. The classification technique is based on an adaptive boosting ensemble classifier. The proposed system shows consistent classification performance up to 9 5 % accuracy among the 50 subjects.

It is urgently needed for identifying novel biomarkers with increased sensitivity and specificity for early detection and personalised therapeutic intervention. Microarray profiling offered significant advances in molecular classification but sample scarcity and cohort heterogeneity remains challenging areas. Here, we investigated diagnostics signatures derived from human triplenegative tissue. We applied REMARK criteria for the selection of relevant studies and compared the signatures gene lists directly as well as assessed their classification performance in predicting diagnosis using leave-one-out cross-validation. The crossvalidation results shows excellent classification accuracy ratios using all data sets. A subset signature (17-gene) extracted from the convergence of eligible signatures have also achieved excellent classification accuracy of 89.37% across all data sets. We also applied gene ontology functional enrichment analysis to extract potentially biological process, pathways and network involved in TNBC disease progression. Through functional analysis, we recognized that these independent signatures have displayed commonalities in functional pathways of cell signaling, which play important role in the development and progression of TNBC. We have also identified five unique TNBC pathways genes (SYNCRIP, NFIB, RGS4, UGCG, LOX and NNMT), which could be important for therapeutic interventions as indicated by their close association with known drivers of TNBC and previously published experimental studies.

The success of e-Discovery depends on how well the litigant and lawyer search relevant evidence, and it is closely associated with making fine queries based on their analysis of complaint and data set. Therefore, this paper proposes a Query Recommending Scheme called QRS for an efficient evidence search in e-Discovery procedure. This scheme is composed with four different phases and various techniques are applied such as document parsing, machine learning and scoring. We describe how QRS works using the flow chart and introduce further researches for the improvement of QRS.

In such a context, in-memory transactional data grids have demonstrated to be particularly suited for exploiting advantages provided by elastic computing platforms, mainly thanks to their ability to be dynamically (re-) sized and tuned. Anyway, when specific QoS requirements have to be met, this kind of architectures have revealed to be complex to be managed by humans. Particularly, their management is a very complex task without the stand of mechanisms supporting run-time automatic sizing/tuning of the data platform and the underlying (virtual) hardware resources provided by the cloud. In this paper, we present a neural network-based architecture where the system is constantly and automatically re-configured, particularly in terms of computing resources, in order to achieve transaction class-based QoS while minimizing costs of the infrastructure. We also present some results showing the effectiveness of our architecture, which has been evaluated on top of Future Grid IaaS Cloud using Red Hat Infinispan in-memory data grid and the TPC-C benchmark.

Cloud-TM takes a holistic approach to self-tuning and elastic scaling, treating them as strongly intertwined problems with the ultimate goals of i) achieving optimal efficiency at any scale of the platform, and ii) minimizing resource consumption in presence of varying workloads. From a methodological perspective, this is achieved by relying on the innovative idea of exploiting the diversity of different modelling approaches, including analytical models, machine-learning and simulations. By employing these modelling techniques in synergy, the Cloud-TM platform can dynamically optimize the underlying distributed data store over a number of dimensions, including its scale, the strategy it adopts to distribute and replicate data among the platforms' nodes, as well as its replication protocol.

Physicians subjectively classify the erythema parameter into several grades of severity. To support the decision and the evaluation of the psoriasis lesions' evolution in time, this study proposes an approach for the objective assessment of erythema degree. There were processed seventeen images depicting psoriasis lesions from mild to severe and the erythema parameter was classified into three categories using machine learning algorithms. The classification was based on color and texture features extracted from the digital images. Three classifiers were trained and tested with these features: Naive Bayes, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. A comparative analysis on the classification accuracy and computation time was made to the classification algorithms. The best classification accuracy (92%) was obtained when using a two-layer feed-forward Neural Network. The proposed method can be used to objectively assess the psoriasis lesion's erythema. The major interest of this approach is to be cheap, fast, robust and easy to use in a dermatological context, with very few constraints on the acquisition protocol.

However, as the Internet backbone bandwidth continuously grows, traditional flow-based traffic identification methods gradually become impractical. In order to improve the performance of traffic identification, this paper proposes an ingenious and practical flow dispatching mechanism named Emilie, which intelligently predicts the elephant flows using only the first three packets of each flow. By discriminating mouse flows against elephant flows, methods with various complexity are utilized to identify the application-level protocol type of elephant and mouse flows separately. Emilie utilizes Machine Learning techniques to achieve high accuracy as well as keep fast speed in predicting elephant flows. Experimental results on real network traffic traces illustrate that around 88% precision, 85% recall and over 85% accuracy are gained on average, which is much better than existing solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical and efficient work that supports inline elephant flow prediction. Flow dispatching based on Emilie empowers traffic identification systems to achieve both high accuracy and fast speed.

The framework enables application administrators to train a network of deployed sensors, instructs the nodes to extract online statistical features, and allows every node in the network to carry out the anomaly detection. Through simulation and a real-world in-door experimental deployment, our detection framework is shown to be able to identify data-centric anomalies with a very high accuracy (98% to 100%) while at the same time incurring much less memory, computation, and communication overhead compared to the state-of-the-art.

This paper explores how accurate and timely detection can be achieved by using supervised machine learning as the tool of inferring about malicious botnet traffic. In order to do so, the paper introduces a novel flow-based detection system that relies on supervised machine learning for identifying botnet network traffic. For use in the system we consider eight highly regarded machine learning algorithms, indicating the best performing one. Furthermore, the paper evaluates how much traffic needs to be observed per flow in order to capture the patterns of malicious traffic. The proposed system has been tested through the series of experiments using traffic traces originating from two well-known P2P botnets and diverse non-malicious applications. The results of experiments indicate that the system is able to accurately and timely detect botnet traffic using purely flow-based traffic analysis and supervised machine learning. Additionally, the results show that in order to achieve accurate detection traffic flows need to be monitored for only a limited time period and number of packets per flow. This indicates a strong potential of using the proposed approach within a future on-line detection framework.

Still, majority of people make this luxury investment through vehicle finance services. The people from this segment tend to have a good credit record and thus are granted credit by vehicle finance service providers. Despite the good credit record and high purchasing power, a certain amount of risk is associated with these credit portfolios. This study deals with the analysis of a data set comprising of opulent vehicle credit portfolios characterized by relevant variables. It aims at assessing the risk associated with these portfolios and finally presents a predictive model which highlights the important variables and depicts the combination of those variables that classify a client under defaulter or non-defaulter.

One of the reasons is the lack of thoroughly studies of the market abuse strategies and the corresponding effective market abuse approaches. In this paper, the strategies of reported price manipulation cases are analysed as well as the related empirical studies. A transformation is then defined to convert the time-varying financial trading data into pseudo-stationary time series, where machine learning algorithms can be easily applied to the detection of the price manipulation. The evaluation experiments conducted on four stocks from NASDAQ show a promising improved performance for effectively detecting such manipulation cases.

In the literature, regime-switching recurrent reinforcement learning (RS-RRL), a combined technique of statistical modeling and machine learning, has been proposed to build financial trading platforms and enhance trading profits by modeling the nonlinear dynamics of stock returns with smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) models. In this paper, we address the transition variable selection issue in the RS-RRL trading system. Four indicators, namely volume, relative strength index, implied volatility and conditional volatility are considered as possible options for transition variable selection in RS-RRL. Of the four indicators, it is found that the RS-RRL trading system with the volume indicator produces a better Sharpe ratio than others.

Given a volume-to-trade, fixed time horizon and discrete trading periods, the aim is to adapt a given volume trajectory such that it is dynamic with respect to favourable/unfavourable conditions during realtime execution, thereby improving overall cost of trading. We consider the standard Almgren-Chriss model with linear price impact as a candidate base model. This model is popular amongst sell-side institutions as a basis for arrival price benchmark execution algorithms. By training a learning agent to modify a volume trajectory based on the market's prevailing spread and volume dynamics, we are able to improve post-trade implementation shortfall by up to 10.3% on average compared to the base model, based on a sample of stocks and trade sizes in the South African equity market.

Being a natural way of human interaction, it is an area where many researchers are working on, with the goal of making human computer interaction (HCI) easier and natural, without the need for any extra devices. So, the primary goal of gesture recognition research is to create systems, which can identify specific human gestures and use them, for example, to convey information. For that, vision-based hand gesture interfaces require fast and extremely robust hand detection, and gesture recognition in real time. Hand gestures are a powerful human communication modality with lots of potential applications and in this context we have sign language recognition, the communication method of deaf people. Sign languages are not standard and universal and the grammars differ from country to country. In this paper, a real-time system able to interpret the Portuguese Sign Language is presented and described. Experiments showed that the system was able to reliably recognize the vowels in real-time, with an accuracy of 99.4% with one dataset of features and an accuracy of 99.6% with a second dataset of features. Although the implemented solution was only trained to recognize the vowels, it is easily extended to recognize the rest of the alphabet, being a solid foundation for the development of any vision-based sign language recognition user interface system.

Specifically, we present a solution that dynamically shrinks or enlarges the set of input features to be exploited by the machine-learner. This allows for tuning the concurrency level while also minimizing the overhead for input-features sampling, given that the cardinality of the input-feature set is always tuned to the minimum value that still guarantees reliability of workload characterization. We also present a fully fledged implementation of our proposal within the TinySTM open source framework, and provide the results of an experimental study relying on the STAMP benchmark suite, which show significant reduction of the response time with respect to proposals based on static feature selection.

In this paper, we aim to analyze common user behavior when accessing RDC services. We first identify different behavioral categories, and conduct traffic analysis to determine a feature set to be used for classification purposes. We then propose a machine learning approach to be used for classifying behavior, and use this approach to classify a large number of real-world RDCs.

In addition, the diagnosis is subject to inter/intra-observer variability. Thus to increase productivity and repeatability, a new field known as Computational Pathology has emerged which combines the field of pathology with computer vision, pattern recognition and machine learning. This research develops a new computational pathology framework specifically to aid with detecting a condition known as spongiosis caused by Newcastle Disease Virus infection in poultry. It combines the use of multispectral imaging with feature extraction and classification to detect areas of spongiosis in tissue of infected poultry. The success of this framework is the first step towards a completely automated diagnosis tool for histopathology.

The overall strategy is aimed to deal against parameters tuning and new requirements drift problem in the sequential learning process that commonly happened in human action recognition. Our proposed method has an automatic and systematic approach for determining input weight and bias value when the hidden nodes need to be increased to handle a larger training data size and to adjust the output weight when the new target class label is presented during sequential learning. We demonstrated the capability using 2013 Challenge on Multi modal Gesture Recognition open dataset (Chalearn 2013) with uni modal features (skeleton data) only. Our experiments using skeletons of upper body joints features with normalized euclidean distance and projection angle position coordinates to shoulder center and hip center, clustering analysis with k-means for pose based generation and Bag of Pose (BoP) for temporal sequential information. We developed the training sequence scenario to introduce the partial action classes in the initial training and the rest of training data with all classes in the next sequences to simulate the condition when the OS-ELM received new target class requirement drift. Our proposed method gives better accuracy plus adaptive capability compared with SUMO method which is the best uni modal method for chalearn data and still maintain a reasonably small computation time.

POS tagging is the process of assigning the words in input sentences with their categories according to their contextual and grammatical properties. In addition to the general POS tagging difficulties such as the disambiguation of multi-category words and unknown words, the Persian language, unlike the English language, is a free order language and it has its own characteristics. These challenges can greatly affect the quality of the part-of-speech tagging process. An efficient POS tagging process has been developed for some languages, especially for the English language, but just a few researches have been done on the Persian language. To address these issues and achieve high POS tagging accuracy, we chose features which can show the important characteristics of words in a sentence, as well as maximum entropy as a machine learning classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed Persian POS tagging system outperforms the other state-of-the-art Persian taggers.

Therefore, the early detection of breast cancer will increase the patients' chances of survival. The main tendency in feature extraction has been illustrating the data in a lower dimensional and different feature space, for instance, using principal component analysis (PCA). In this paper, we argue that feature selection depend on top of eigenvalue certainly is not proper because they may not encode useful information for classi1cation purposes, features should be selected form all the components by feature selection methods. So, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used in the most favorable selection of principal components instead of using classical method. We have applied PCA for dimension reduction, genetic algorithms for feature selection and support vector machines for classification. The estimate of this Algorithm has been done based on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD) which is commonly used among researchers who use machine learning methods for breast cancer diagnosis. The performance of this approach is given. In addition, the methods used in the past have been compared to the performance of the chosen approach. This approach affords optimal classification which is capable to minimize amount of features and maximize the accuracy sensitivity, specificity and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. 10-fold cross-validation has been used on the classification phase. The average classification accuracy of the developed PCA+GA+SVM system is obtained 100% for a subset that contained two features. This is very favorable compared to the previously reported results.

Discretization is a technique which enables algorithms like decision trees to deal with continuous attributes as well as discrete attributes. We present an algorithm that combines the process of multi-interval discretization with tree induction, and introduce especially designed genetic programming operators for this task.

The use of machine learning and data mining techniques has revolutionized the whole process of breast cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis. Breast tumors are divided in to two types; malignant and benign. In this paper we propose how to distinguish the type of breast cancer by creating a Fuzzy system (FS). To detect the type of breast censer we use a chaotic hierarchical cluster-based multispecies particle swarm optimization (CHCMSPSO) to optimization a FS indeed. The objective of this paper is to learn Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) type fuzzy rules with high accuracy. In addition to this, we will introduce chaos into the HCMSPSO in order to further enhance its global search ability. In the paper, eleven chaotic maps are used in the intelligent diagnosis system. The accuracy rate of distinguishing between benign and malignant censer is above 90 percent. However, among the chaotic maps, the Sinusoidal chaotic map provides us with the accuracy rate 99 percent because it coordinates with the problems conditions.

Scenario discovery relies on the use of statistical machine-learning algorithms. The most frequently used algorithm is the Patient Rule Induction Method. This algorithm identifies regions in the uncertain model input space that are highly predictive of producing model outcomes that are of interest. To identify these regions, PRIM in essence uses a hill climbing optimization procedure. This suggests that PRIM can suffer from the usual defects of hill climbing optimization algorithms, including local optima, plateaus, and ridges and alleys. In case of PRIM, these problems are even more pronounced when dealing with heterogeneously typed data. Drawing inspiration from machine learning research on random forests, we present an improved version of PRIM. This improved version is based on the idea of performing multiple PRIM analyses based on randomly selected features and combining these results using a bagging technique. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through a case study of scenario discovery for the transition of the European energy system towards more sustainable functioning, focusing on identifying scenarios where the transition fails.

However, identifying likely buyers of organic products proves challenging due to their relatively small fraction in the overall population. Our study explores applications of machine learning algorithms for effective management of organic food marketing campaigns in China. Based on the data we collected through an online choice-experiment type questionnaire of Chinese consumers, a purchase likelihood estimation framework has been developed that utilizes customer profile traits such as age group, family status, education level, and geographic location. In addition, we apply clustering techniques to perform data-driven organic market segmentation and identify consumer profiles ready to pay more for high quality, certified organic products. The resulting market segments are compared to various types of organic consumers discussed in the literature. Our algorithms provide a useful framework for online retailers who are seeking lean strategies of market entry in China with their health food brands.

A Semi-automated Toolkit for Analysis of Liver Cancer Treatment Response Using Perfusion CT	ABDOMINAL IMAGING: COMPUTATIONAL AND CLINICAL APPLICATIONS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Workshop on Abdominal Imaging (ABDI) - Computational and Clinical Applications	SEP 14, 2014	Cambridge, MA			Perfusion CT; Hepatic tumor; Registration; Motion; Tissue classification	DYNAMIC CT; REPRODUCIBILITY; THERAPY; MODEL	Delineation of hepatic tumours is challenging in CT due to limited inherent tissue contrast, leading to significant intra-/inter-observer variability. Perfusion CT (pCT) allows quantitative assessment of enhancement patterns in normal and abnormal liver. This study aims to develop a semi-automated perfusion analysis toolkit that classifies hepatic tissue based on perfusion-derived parameters. pCT data from patients with hepatic metastases were used in this study. Tumour motion was minimized through image registration; perfusion parameters were derived and then employed in the training of a machine learning algorithm used to classify hepatic tissue. This method was found to deliver promising results for 10 data sets, with recorded sensitivity and specificity of the tissue classification in the ranges of 0.92-0.99 and 0.98-0.99 respectively. This semi-automated method could be used to analyze response over the treatment course, as it is not based on intensity values.

However accurate segmentation remains challenging due to tissue inhomogeneity and high variability in tumor appearance. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic liver tumor segmentation method that combines a deformable model with a machine learning mechanism. More precisely, segmentation is performed by an MRF-based omni-directional deformable surface model that uses image information together with a two-class (tumor, non-tumor) voxel classification map. The classification map is produced by a kernel SVM classifier trained on texture features, as well as intensity mean and variance. The segmentation method is validated on a metastatic tumor dataset consisting of 27 tumors across a set of abdominal CT images, using leave-one-out validation. Compared to pure voxel and gradient approaches, our method achieves better performance in terms of mean distance and Dice scores on the group of 27 liver tumors and can deal with highly pathological cases.

The problem considered in this paper is the misrecognition of named entities in Spanish voice queries introducing a proof-of-concept for named entity correction that provides alternative entities to the ones incorrectly recognized or misrecognized by retrieving entities phonetically similar from a dictionary. This system is domain-dependent, using sports news, especially football news, regardless of the automatic speech recognition system used. The correction process exploits the query structure and its semantic information to detect where a named entity appears. The system finds the most suitable alternative entity from a dictionary previously generated with the existing named entities.

In many user-based collaborative filtering applications based on KNN(K nearest neighbor algorithm), they only use similarity information(cosine similarity) between users, in some case, they have not use the difference information, so the precision and recall is not well. To address these problem, we propose a Difference Factor' K-NN collaborative filtering method, called DF-KNN. DF-KNN is an instance-based learning method and the key step in algorithms is how to use the difference factor and how to compute, the second step is mix similarity together. Our experimental evaluation on the MovieLens datasets show that the proposed DF-KNN and NDF-KNN(Normal Different Factor's KNN) are much efficient than the traditional user-neighborhood based KNN and provide recommendations whose quality is up to 13% better.

In this paper, we propose a new technique that randomly determines the size of the attribute subset between a dynamically determined range based on the relative size of current data segment to the bootstrap samples at each node splitting event. We present elaborate experimental results involving five widely used data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

It aims to obtain a high performance classifier by labeling as little data as possible from large amount of unlabeled samples, which means sampling strategy is the core issue. Existing approaches either tend to ignore information in unlabeled data and are prone to querying outliers or noise samples, or calculate large amounts of non-informative samples leading to significant computation cost. In order to solve above problems, this paper proposed a serial active learning framework. It first measures uncertainty of unlabeled samples and selects the most uncertain sample set. From which, it further generates the most representative sample set based on the mutual information criterion. Finally, the framework selects the most informative sample from the most representative sample set based on expected error reduction strategy. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that our approach outperforms Random Sampling and the state of the art adaptive active learning method.

It involves the techniques of statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition etc. In the age of big data, a huge amount of text data has been accumulated. At present, the most effective text processing way is classifying them before mining. Therefore, it has attracted great interests of scholars and researchers, and many constructive results have been achieved. But along with the increasing of training samples, the shortages of techniques and limits of their application have appeared gradually. In this paper, we propose a new strategy for classifying documents based on Huffman tree. Firstly, we find out all the candidate classifications by generating a Huffman tree, and then we design a quality measure to select the final classification. Our experiment results show that the proposed algorithm is effective and feasible.

As other machine learning tasks, multi-label learning also suffers from the curse of dimensionality, which can be mitigated by feature selection. This work experimentally evaluates four multi-label feature selection algorithms that use the filter approach. Three of them are based on the ReliefF algorithm, which takes into account interacting features. The quality of the selected features is assessed by three different learning algorithms. Evaluating multi-label learning algorithms is a complicated task, as multiple evaluation measures, which might optimize different loss functions, should be considered. To this end, General(B), a baseline algorithm which learns by only looking at the multi-labels of the dataset, is used as a reference. Results show that feature selection contributed to improve the performance of classifiers initially worse than General(B) and highlight ReliefF-based algorithms in some experimental settings.

They were conceived to help answer questions such as given a new classification dataset, which of the solutions already proposed in the literature is the most appropriate to solve this new problem? In this direction, we propose a HHEA to automatically build Bayesian Network Classifier (BNC) tailored to a specific dataset. BNCs are powerful classification models that can deal with missing data, uncertainty and generate interpretable models. The method receives an input a set of components already present in current BNC algorithms and a specific dataset. The HHEA then searches for the best combination of components according to the input dataset. Results show the customized algorithms generated obtain results of F-measure equivalent or better than other state of the art BNC algorithms.	[de Sa, Alex G.

Outliers are the data points that differ greatly from the pattern set by the bulk of the data. Inspired by this, Hsieh et al introduced the Wilcoxon approach into the area of machine learning. They investigated four new learning machines, such as Wilcoxon neural network (WNN) etc., and developed four descent gradient based backpropagation algorithms to train these learning machines. The performances of these machines are better than the ordinary nonrobust neural networks. However, it is hard to balance the learning speed and the stability of these algorithms which is inherently the drawback of gradient descent based algorithms. In this paper, a new algorithm is used to train the output weights of single-layer feedforward neural networks (SLFN) with its input weights and biases being randomly chosen. This algorithm is called Wilcoxon-norm based robust extreme learning machine or WRELM for short.

It is shown that the GP model itself has the inherent capability of being trained through divide-and-conquer. Given a large GP learning problem, it can be divided into smaller problems. By solving the smaller problems and merging the solutions, it is guaranteed to reach the solution to the original problem.

The most popular approaches work on the basis of voting aggregation, where the final decision of a compound classifier is a combination of discrete individual classifiers' outputs, i.e., class labels. At the same time, some of the classifiers in the committee do not contribute much to the collective decision and should be discarded. This paper discusses how to design an effective ensemble pruning and combination rule, based on continuous classifier outputs, i.e., support functions. As in many real-life problems we do not have an abundance of training objects, therefore we express our interest in aggregation methods which do not required training. We concentrate on the field of weighted aggregation, with weights depending on classifier and class label. We propose a new untrained method for simultaneous ensemble pruning and weighted combination of support functions with the use of a Gaussian function to assign mentioned above weights. The experimental analysis carried out on the set of benchmark datasets and backed up with a statistical analysis, prove the usefulness of the proposed method, especially when the number of class labels is high.

Conventionally edge detection is performed as the first step followed by dynamic programming to find the shortest path which conforms to the detected horizon line. Recent work has proposed the use of machine learning to reduce the number of non-horizon edges to accurately detect the horizon line. In this paper, we investigate the suitablity of various local texture features and their combinations to reduce the number of false classifications for a recently proposed horizon detection approach. Specifically, we explore SIFT, LBP, HOG and their combinations SIFT-LBP, SIFTHOG, LBP-HOG and SIFT-LBP-HOG as features to train the SVM classifier. We further show that using only edge information as the nodal costs is not enough and propose various nodal costs which can result in enhanced accuracy of the detected horizon line as evidenced by the conducted experiments and results. We compare our proposed formulations with an earlier approach relying only on edges and suffers due to faulty assumptions. We report our comparative results for an image set comprising of mountainous images captured during an outdoor robot exploration of Basalt Hills.

Risk assessment of skins lesions is usually done through the ABCD rule (asymmetry, border, color and differential structures) that classifies the lesion as benign, suspicious or highly suspicious of Malignant Melanoma. A methodology to assess the asymmetry of a skin lesion image in relation to each axis of inertia, for both dermoscopic and mobile acquired images, is presented. It starts by extracting a set of 310 of asymmetry features, followed by testing several feature selection and machine learning classification methods in order to minimize the classification error. For dermoscopic images, the developed methodology achieves an accuracy of 87% regarding asymmetry classification while, for mobile acquired images the accuracy reaches 73.1%.

To this end, we extract volumes of multiple brain structures from preoperative images of a retrospective cohort of seventy-five TLE patients with surgical outcome of Engel class I. Then, we apply data mining techniques such as feature extraction, feature selection, and machine learning classifiers. Exploiting volumes of various structures and two machine learning classifiers, we examine contributions of brain structures and classifiers to the lateralization of TLE patients. Our experiments, using volumes of hippocampus and amygdala, show correct lateralization rates of 86.7% to 93.3% for decision tree and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. This reflects 6.7% to 10.6% improvement in accuracy relative to using hippocampus volume alone. Also, using volumes of hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus, we reach correct lateralization rate of 96.0% for SVM. Rules extracted from decision tree indicate that for intermediate hippocampus volumes, amygdala enlargement may determine side of epileptogenic focus. In conclusion, classification of the selected brain structures using the proposed classifiers improve decision-making of surgical resection in TLE and may reduce the need for implantation of intracranial monitoring electrodes.

The base image was blended with sinusoidal noise masks to create the stimulus. Observers were required to view each image and categorized it as happy or sad. Analysis of responses using superimposed classification images revealed both locations and identity of information required to represent each certain expression. To further investigate the results, a neural network based classifier was developed to identify the expression of the superimposed images from the machine learning perspective, which reveals that the pattern which humans perceive the expression is acknowledged by machines.

Moreover, multi-agent frameworks have also been proposed with the goal of improving the reliability and trust in the agent policy identified. Such advances need weighing against the computational overhead of assuming such flexibility. In this work a framework for evolutionary multi-agent trading is introduced and systematically benchmarked for FX currency trading; including the impact of FX trading spread. It is demonstrated that simplifications can be made to the 'base' trading agent that do not impact on the quality of solutions, but provide considerable computational speedups. The resulting evolutionary multi-agent architecture is demonstrated to provide significant benefits to the profitability and improve the reliability with which profitable policies are returned.

Ensuring high quality samples for both probe and reference can substantially improve the system's performance by lowering false non-matches, thus allowing finer adjustment of the decision threshold of the biometric system. Furthermore, the increasing usage of biometrics in mobile contexts demands development of lightweight methods for operational environment. A novel two-tier computationally efficient approach was recently proposed based on modelling block-wise fingerprint image data using Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to extract specific ridge pattern features, which are then used as an input to a Random Forests (RF) classifier trained to predict the quality score of a propagated sample.

The utterance is mapped to a vector in the total variability space, which is called i-vector. The total variability space provides a basis to obtain a low dimensional fixed-length representation of a speech utterance. But, the processing is complicated for the interweaving of the statistics and machine learning method. So, we considered separating them and proposed a simple way to extract i-vector by classical principal component analysis, factor analysis and independent component analysis from normalized statistics. The results on NIST 2008 telephone data show that the performance is very close to the traditional method and they can be improved obviously after score fusion.

They can be found in various written records in different periods and have great historical significance. This paper introduces a machine learning system to recognize the honorifics in diachronic corpora. A tagged corpus of four classic novels written in the Ming and Qing dynasties is used to train the system. The system is then used to automatically recognize and extract the honorifics in pre-Qin classics, Tang-dynasty poems, and modern Chinese news. Experimental results show that the system can achieve relatively good results in recognizing the honorifics in the pre-Qin classics and Tang-dynasty poems. This work is an attempt to improve the performance of automatic recognition of honorifics in diachronic corpora. The system can be a helpful tool in the studies on the evolution of honorifics throughout Chinese history.

One of its complexity measures is the width which has been investigated in several areas in computer science like machine learning, property testing, and the design and analysis of implicit graph algorithms. Maybe the most important issue of OBDDs is the possibility to choose the variable ordering and for a given function the width of an OBDD is very sensitive to this choice. The main result of the paper is the proof that the width minimization problem is NP-hard. Furthermore, two basic problems in the design and analysis of implicit graph algorithms are reinvestigated and known upper bounds on their complexity that depend on the width of the input OBDDs are improved.

Instead of taking the traditional complex physical model based approach, this paper proposes a data-driven method, leading to an effective early event detection approach for the smart grid. Our contributions are: (1) introducing the early event detection problem, (2) providing a novel method for power systems data analysis (PowerScope), i.e. finding hidden power flow features which are mutually independent, (3) proposing a learning approach for early event detection and identification based on PowerScope. Although a machine learning approach is adopted, our approach does account for physical constraints to enhance performance. By using the proposed early event detection method, we are able to obtain an event detector with high accuracy but much smaller detection time when comparing to physical model based approach. Such result shows the potential for sustainable grid services through real-time data analysis and control.

The current pace of technological development makes it commercially viable to harness energy from sun, wind, geothermal and many other renewable sources. Because of the negative effects on the environment and the economy, conventional energy sources like natural gas, crude oil and coal are coming under political and economic pressure. Thus, they require a better mix of energy sources with a higher percentage of renewable energy sources. Harnessing energy from renewable sources range from small scale (e.g., a single household) to large scale (e.g., power plants producing several MWs to a few GWs providing energy to an entire city). An inherent characteristic common to all renewable power plants is that power generation is dependent on environmental parameters and thus cannot be fully controlled or planned for in advance. In a power grid, it is necessary to predict the amount of power that will be generated in the future, including those from the renewable sources, as fluctuations in capacity and/or quality can have negative impacts on the physical health of the entire grid as well as the quality of life of its users. As renewable power plants continue to expand, it will also be necessary to determine their optimal sizes, locations and configurations. In addition, management of the smart grid, in which the renewable energy plants are integrated, is also a challenging problem. In this paper we provide a survey on different machine learning techniques used to address the above issues related to renewable energy generation and integration.

The fast growing infrastructure of wind turbines can be seen as large sensor system that screens the wind energy at a high temporal and spatial resolution. The resulting data-bases consist of huge amounts of wind energy time series data that can be used for prediction, controlling, and planning purposes. In this work, we describe WindML, a Python-based framework for wind energy related machine learning approaches. The main objective of WindML is the continuous development of tools that address important challenges induced by the growing wind energy information infrastructures. Various examples that demonstrate typical use cases are introduced and related research questions are discussed. The different modules of WindML reach from standard machine learning algorithms to advanced techniques for handling missing data and monitoring high-dimensional time series.

The rooftops of buildings can be utilized for solar power generation using this technology, and are considered to be highly promising sites for urban PV installations due to land space limitations. However, to properly plan such installations decision makers would need to have detailed information about the amount of rooftop area that is available, as well as the distribution of individual rooftop sizes. In this paper a machine learning based approach for detecting rooftops is proposed and its utility for planning rooftop PV installations is demonstrated via a simple pilot study on two different residential areas in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The proposed method uses a two-stage classification model to estimate the rooftop area that is available for solar panel installation. Next, a comparative study of three different types of PV technologies is conducted in terms of energy generation and economic viability. The results obtained from these experiments suggest that thin-film panels may have a distinct advantage over other PV technologies. Even though the cost of PV panels is still quite high, this could be balanced by the potential benefits to the environment. If reasonable subsidies and feed-in tariffs are implemented, PV technology can become a cost effective option for the UAE.

In contrast, many real-world applications do not lend themselves to a single technology, but require multiple tools. In an applied AI company, each tool often has its own advocate, whose specialized knowledge may lead her to overestimate her tool's contribution and diminish that of other tools. To form an effective team, the various members must have a shared understanding of how their tools complement one another. This paper describes CaFe ("Cases-Features"), a group process that we have prototyped for building a consensus mapping between tools and real-world problems. The five AI technologies encompassed in our prototype are cognitive architectures, intelligent user interfaces, classic multi-agent system paradigms, statistics and machine learning, and swarming. Structured group discussion identifies the dimensions of a feature space in which the technologies are distinct. The scheme that emerged from our exercise does not pretend to be an exhaustive characterization of the techniques, but it is a jointly owned map of our technology capabilities that has proven useful in design of new use cases.

PRAM mode is mainly suitable for applications with high amount of thread level parallelism (TLP) while NUMA mode is mainly for accelerating execution of sequential programs or programs with low TLP. Also, some types of regular data parallel algorithms execute faster in NUMA mode. It is not obvious in which mode a given program region shows the best performance. In this study we focus on generic stencil-like computations exhibiting regular control flow and memory access pattern. We use two state-of-the art machine-learning methods, C5.0 (decision trees) and Eureqa Pro (symbolic regression) to select which mode to use. We use these methods to derive different predictors based on the same training data and compare their results. The accuracy of the best derived predictors are 95% and are generated by both C5.0 and Eureqa Pro, although the latter can in some cases be more sensitive to the training data. The average speedup gained due to mode switching ranges between 1.92 to 2.23 for all generated predictors on the evaluation test cases, and using a majority voting algorithm, based on the three best predictors, we can eliminate all misclassifications.

Particularly, the identification of deception based on demographic data such as gender, age, and religion, has become of importance due to ethical and security concerns. Previous work on deception detection has studied the role of gender using statistical approaches and domain-specific data. This work explores gender detection in open domain truths and lies using a machine learning approach. First, we collect a deception dataset consisting of truths and lies from male and female participants. Second, we extract a large feature set consisting of n-grams, shallow and deep syntactic features, semantic features derived from a psycholinguistics lexicon, and features derived from readability metrics. Third, we build deception classifiers able to predict participant's gender with classification accuracies ranging from 60-70%. In addition, we present an analysis of differences in the linguistic style used by deceivers given their reported gender.

Verbal phraseological units are phrases made up of two or more words characterized for presenting certain degree of fixation or idiomaticity (at least one of these words is a verb that plays the role of the predicate). Phraseological units do not appear so frequently in manually constructed lexical resources as they do in real-word text, and this problem of coverage may impact the performance of many natural language processing tasks. Therefore, the construction of automatic understanding systems for these types of linguistic structures is very important, since they are a standard way of expressing a concept or idea. In this paper we present a set of experiments towards the automatic identification of the polarity of verbal phraseological units. We obtained a maximum performance of 80% for this particular task when the contextual information of a phraseological unit is considered, in comparison with a 62% when the VPU alone is only used. These results highlight the importance of analyzing automatically this type of linguistic structures. It should be stressed at the outset that these experiments are intended as a preliminary study rather than as a comprehensive analysis or solution of the aforementioned problem.

We aim at the development of an information extraction (IE) system which is intended to be a module of the recommendation system. The IE system is to gather information about different aspects of restaurants from online reviews, structure it and feed the recommendation module with the obtained data. The analyzed frames include service and food quality, cuisine, price level, noise level, etc. In this paper service quality, cuisine type and food quality are considered. As part of corpus preprocessing phase, a method for Russian reviews corpus analysis (as part of information extraction) is proposed. Its importance is shown at the experimental phase, when the application of machine learning techniques to aspects extraction is analyzed.

Therefore, businesses companies are very interested in finding influential users and encouraging them to create positive influence. Influential users represent users with the ability to influence individual's attitudes in a desired way with relative frequency. We present an empirical analysis on influential users identification problem in Twitter. Our proposed approach considers that the influential level of users can be detected by considering its communication patterns, by means of particular writing style features as well as behavioral features.

With the increasing volume of crime information available on the web, a means to retrieve and exploit them and provide insight into the criminal behavior and networks must be determined to fight crime more efficiently and effectively. We believe that an electronic system must be designed for crime named entity recognition from the newspaper articles. Thus, this study designs and develops a crime named entity recognition based on machine learning approaches that extract nationalities, weapons, and crime locations in online crime documents. This study also collected a new corpus of crime and manually labeled them. A machine learning classification framework is proposed based on Naive Bayes and SVM model in extracting nationalities, weapons, and crime location from online crime documents. To evaluate our model, a manually annotated data set was used, which was then validated by experiments. The results of the experiments showed that the developed techniques are promising.

Sentiment analysis of Web data is becoming a fast and effective way of evaluating public opinion and sentiment for use in marketing and social behavioral studies. This research investigates the enhancement techniques in machine-learning methods for sentiment classification of Web data. Feature selection, negation dealing, and emoticon handling are studied in this paper for their ability to improve the performance of machine-learning methods. The range of enhancement techniques is tested using different text data sets, such as tweets and movie reviews.

Sentiment analysis in the Arabic language is a more challenging task than in other languages due to the morphological complexity of the Arabic and the large variation of its dialects. This paper presents an empirical comparison of seven feature selection methods (Information Gain, Principal Components Analysis, Relief-F, Gini Index, Uncertainty, Chi-squared, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs)), and three machine learning classifiers (SVM, Naive Bayes, and K-nearest neighbor) for Arabic sentiment classification. A wide range of comparative experiments are conducted on an opinion corpus for Arabic (OCA). This paper demonstrates that feature selection does improve the performance of Arabic sentiment-based classification, but the result depends on the method used and the number of features selected. The experimental results demonstrate that feature reduction methods are found to improve the classifier performance. Moreover, the experimental results indicate that SVM-based feature selection yields the best performance for feature selection and that the SVM classifier outperforms the other techniques for Arabic sentiment-based classification. Finally, the experiments indicate that the SVM classifier with the SVM-based feature selection method yields the best classification method, with an accuracy of 92.4%.

Mobile malware specifically targeting Android has surged and grown in tandem with the rising popularity of the platform [3, 5, 4, 6]. In response, the honus is on defenders to increase the difficulty of malware development to curb its rampant growth, and to devise effective detection mechanisms specifically targeting Android malware in order to better protect the end-users. In this paper, we address the following question: do malicious applications on Android request predictably different permissions than legitimate applications? Based on analysis of 2950 samples of benign and malicious Android applications, we propose a novel Android malware detection technique called Permission-based Malware Detection Systems (PMDS). In PMDS, we view requested permissions as behavioral markers and build a machine learning classifier on those markers to automatically identify for unseen applications potentially harmful behavior based on the combination of permissions they require. By design, PMDS has the potential to detect previously unknown, and zero-day or next-generation malware. If attackers adapt and request for fewer permissions, PMDS will have impeded the simple strategies by which malware developers currently abuse their victims. Experimental results show that PMDS detects more than 92-94% of previously unseen malware with a false positives rate of 1.52-3.93%.

Statistical regularities can be efficiently exploited to overcome the limitations of the inherently incomplete knowledge bases distributed across the Web. This paper focuses on the problem of predicting missing class-memberships and property values of individual resources in Web ontologies. We propose a transductive inference method for inferring missing properties about individuals: given a class-membership/property value learning problem, we address the task of identifying relations which are likely to link similar individuals, and efficiently propagating knowledge across such (possibly diverse) relations. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

There are however some issues associated with the ontologies adopted by these approaches, such as: 1) their crafting is not a cheap process, being time consuming and calling for specialist expertise; 2) they may not represent accurately the viewpoint of the targeted user community; 3) they tend to provide rather static models, which fail to keep track of evolving user perspectives. To address these issues, we propose Klink UM, an approach for extracting emergent semantics from user feedbacks, with the aim of tailoring the ontology to the users and improving the recommendations accuracy. Klink UM uses statistical and machine learning techniques for finding hierarchical and similarity relationships between keywords associated with rated items and can be used for: 1) building a conceptual taxonomy from scratch, 2) enriching and correcting an existing ontology, 3) providing a numerical estimate of the intensity of semantic relationships according to the users. The evaluation shows that Klink UM performs well with respect to handcrafted ontologies and can significantly increase the accuracy of suggestions in content-based recommender systems.

However, frequent cases of incompleteness/inconsistency due to distributed, heterogeneous nature and the Web-scale dimension of the knowledge bases. It has been shown that resorting to models induced from the data may offer comparably effective and efficient solutions for these cases, although skewness in the instance distribution may affect the quality of such models. This is known as class-imbalance problem. We propose a machine learning approach, based on the induction of Terminological Random Forests, that is an extension of the notion of Random Forest to cope with this problem in case of knowledge bases expressed through the standard Web ontology languages. Experimentally we show the feasibility of our approach and its effectiveness w.r.t. related methods, especially with imbalanced datasets.

Schema mapping can be conducted by machine learning or by knowledge engineering approach. Machine learning approach needs training data set for building models, but usually it is very difficult to obtain training datasets for large datasets. In addition, it is very difficult to change the model by human knowledge. Knowledge engineering approach encodes human knowledge directly, such that the knowledge base can be constructed with limited data, but it needs time consuming knowledge acquisition. This research proposes an incremental schema mapping method that employs Ripple-Down Rules (RDR) with the censored production rules (CPR). Our experimental results show that RDR approach shows comparable performance with the machine learning approaches and RDR knowledge base can be expanded incrementally as the cases classified increase.

Since the labeled data should be representative of the range of unlabeled data available, the aim of this research is to identify which data should be labeled. An approach has been developed where a domain expert starts to label unlabeled data and also writes rules to classify such data. The labeled data are also used as machine learning training data. If the expert rules and the rules developed by machine learning agree on a label for an unseen datum, the label is accepted and the case automatically added to the training data for learning, otherwise the case is checked by the expert and if the label from the rules is wrong, the expert provides the correct label and a rule to correctly classify the case. Further data is then processed in the same way. Results from a number of datasets using a simulated expert as the domain expert suggest that this method produces more accurate knowledge bases than other semi-supervised methods using similar amounts of labeled data and the resultant knowledge bases are as accurate as having all the data labeled.

Using the original unstructured data of a company, we propose a procedure to identify the actual defection condition (i.e., whether the customer is defecting from the company or merely stopped using a current product to up/downgrade it) and to produce a measure of customer loyalty by compiling the number of customers' purchases and renewals. Based on the results, we investigated important variables for classifying defecting customers using a random forest and built a prediction model using a decision tree. The final results indicate that defecting customers are mainly characterized by their loyalty and their number of total payments.

The experimented unsupervised methods employ individual statistical measures and graph-based measures while the supervised methods apply machine learning models that include combinations of these statistical and graph-based measures. Graph-based measures are applied on a graph that connects terms and compound expressions through conceptual relations and represents a whole corpus about a domain, rather than a single document. Using three datasets from different domains, we observed that supervised methods over-perform unsupervised ones. We also found that the graph-based measures Degree and Reachability generally over-perform (in the majority of the cases) the standard baseline TF-IDF and other graph-based measures while the co-occurrences based measure Pointwise Mutual Information over-performs all the other metrics, including the graph-based measures, when taken individually.

However one of the limiting factors which has affected wide adoption of this cost-effective technology is requiring highly skilled sonographers and operators. We consider this problem in this paper which is motivated by advancements within the computer vision community. Our approach combines simple and standardized clinical ultrasound procedures with machine learning driven imaging solutions to provide users who have limited clinical experience, to perform simple diagnostic decisions (such as detection of a fetal breech presentation). We introduce LP-SIFT features constructed using the well-known SIFT features, utilizing a set of feature symmetry filters. We also illustrate how such features can be used in a bag of visual words representation on ultrasound images for classification of anatomical structures that have significant clinical implications in fetal health such as the fetal head, heart and abdomen, despite the high presence of speckle, shadows and other imaging artifacts in ultrasound images.

This work aims to identify local image characteristics capable of predicting the presence of local abnormal ventricular activities (LAVA). This can allow, pre-operatively and non-invasively, to improve and accelerate the procedure. To achieve this, intensity and texture-based local image features are computed and random forests are used for classification. However using machine-learning approaches on such complex multimodal data can prove difficult due to the inherent errors in the training set. In this manuscript we present a detailed analysis of these error sources due in particular to catheter motion and the data fusion process. We derived a principled analysis of confidence impact on classification. Moreover, we demonstrate how formal integration of these uncertainties in the training process improves the algorithm's performance, opening up possibilities for non-invasive image-based prediction of RFA targets.

Our goal here is to develop a QA approach to answer yes/no questions relevant to civil laws in legal bar exams. A bar examination is intended to determine whether a candidate is qualified to practice law in a given jurisdiction. We have found that the development of a QA system for this task provides insight into the challenges of formalizing reasoning about legal text, and about how to exploit advances in computational linguistics. We separate our QA approach into two steps. The first step is to identify legal documents relevant to the exam questions; the second step is to answer the questions by analyzing the relevant documents. In our initial approach described here, the first step has been already solved for us: the appropriate articles for each question have been identified by legal experts. So here, we focus on the second task, which can be considered as a form of Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE), where input to the system is a question sentence and its corresponding civil law article(s), and the output is a binary answer: whether the question sentence is entailed from the article(s). We propose a hybrid method, which combines simple rules and an unsupervised learning model using deep linguistic features. We first construct a knowledge base for negation and antonym words for the legal domain. We then identify potential premise and conclusion components of input questions and documents, based on text patterns and separating commas. We further classify the questions into easy and difficult ones, and develop a two-phase method for answering yes/no questions. We answer easy questions by negation/antonym detection. For more difficult questions, we adapt an unsupervised machine learning method based on morphological, syntactic, and lexical semantic analysis on identified premises and conclusions. This provides the basis to compare the semantic correlation between a question and a legal article. Our experimental results show reasonable performance, which improves the baseline system, and outperforms an SVM-based supervised machine learning model.

This chapter focuses on one of these challenges which is the temporal asynchrony between different physiological signals within one recognition model. The chapter proposes a flexible and suitable method for feature extraction based on empirical optimisation of windows' latency and duration. The approach is described within the theoretical framework of the psychophysiological inference and its common implementation using machine learning. The method has been experimentally validated (46 subjects) and results are presented. Empirically optimised values for the extraction windows are provided.

However, brain computer interfaces use methods that need to be trained on subject-specific data before they can be used. This problem must be solved for real-world applications in which humans are multi tasking and hence are to some degree are less predictable in their behavior compared to classical set ups for brain computer interfacing. In this paper, we show the detection and passive usage of the P300 related brain activity in a highly uncontrolled and noisy application scenario. The subjects are multi tasking, i.e., they perform a demanding senso-motor task, i.e., the telemanipulate a real robotic arm while responding to important messages. For telemanipulation, the subject wears an active exoskeleton to control a robotic arm, which is presented to him in a virtual scenario. By online analysis of the subject's electroencephalogram we detect P300 related target recognition processes to infer on upcoming response behavior on presented task-relevant messages (Targets) or missing of response behavior in case a Target was not recognized. We show that a classifier that is trained to distinguish between brain activity evoked by recognized task-relevant stimuli (recognized Targets) and ignored frequent task-irrelevant stimuli (Standards) can be applied to classify between brain activity evoked by recognized targets and brain activity that is evoked in case that task-relevant stimuli are not recognized (Missed Targets). The applied transfer of classifier results in reduced performance. We show that this draw back of the approach can strongly be improved by using online machine learning tools to adapt the pre-trained classifier to the new class, i. e., to the Missed Target class, that was not used during training of the classifier.

With progress of machine learning techniques in recent years, much attention has been paid on this field. However, many NLP tasks such as text summary and sentence matching treat sentences as atomic units. In this paper, we introduce a new model called DRWS which can learn distributed representations for words and variable-length sentences. Feature vectors for words and sentences are learned based on their probability of co-occurrence between words and sentences using a neural network. To evaluate feature vectors learned by our model, we applied our model on the tasks of detecting word similarity and text summarization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in learning vector representations for words and sentences.

A growing number of contributions try to use this advantage in order to improve or extend classical machine learning algorithms by methods of quantum information theory. This paper gives a brief introduction into quantum machine learning using the example of pattern classification. We introduce a quantum pattern classification algorithm that draws on Trugenberger's proposal for measuring the Hamming distance on a quantum computer [CA Trugenberger, Phys Rev Let 87, 2001] and discuss its advantages using handwritten digit recognition as from the MNIST database.

The point cloud is segmented into primitive regions, followed by labelling subsets of regions representing an object. Predicates describing those regions and their relationships are constructed and used for learning. Using planar regions as the only primitive shape was examined in previous work. We extend this by adding two more primitives: cylinders and spheres. We compare the performance of learning with the planar-only method using some common household objects. The results show that the additional primitives reduce the number of features required to describe an instance and also significantly reduce the learning time without loss in accuracy.

In this paper we investigate the feasibility of this framework by evaluating the performance of one component, the spatial pooler. Using a recently developed implementation, the augmented spatial pooler (ASP), as a single layer feature detector, we test its performance using a standard image classification pipeline. The main contributions of the paper are the implementation and evaluation of modifications to ASP that enable it to form overcomplete representations of the input and to form connections with multiple data channels. Our results show that these modifications significantly improve the utility of ASP, making its performance competitive with more traditional feature detectors such as sparse restricted Boltzmann machines and sparse auto-encoders.

In order to assist their decisions in a timely manner, many studies have been conducted to automatically analyze those information sources in the last decades. However, the majority of the efforts was made for utilizing numerical information, partly due to the difficulty to process natural language texts and to make sense of their temporal properties. This study sheds light on this problem by using deep learning, which has been attracting much attention in various areas of research including pattern mining and machine learning for its ability to automatically construct useful features from a large amount of data. Specifically, this study proposes an approach to market trend prediction based on a recurrent deep neural network to model temporal effects of past events.

Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) is a clinical strategy for prescribing treatment based on current best evidence for individual patients. Clinicians need to query publication repositories in order to find the best evidence to support their decision-making processes. This sophisticated information is materialised in the form of scientific artefacts in scholarly publications and the automatic extraction of these artefacts is a technical challenge for current generic search engines. Many classification approaches have been proposed for identifying key scientific artefacts in EBM, however their performance is affected by the imbalanced characteristic of data in this domain. In this paper, we present four data balancing approaches applied in a binary ensemble classifier framework for classifying scientific artefacts in the EBM domain. Our balancing approaches improve the ensemble classifier's F-score by up to 15% for classes of scientific artefacts with extremely low coverage in the domain. In addition, we propose a classifier selection method for choosing the best classifier based on the distributional feature of classes. The resulting classifiers show improved classification performances when compared to state of the art approaches.

The inherent complexity of surgery duration estimation contributes significantly to increased procedure cancellations and reduced utilisation of already encumbered resources. In this study we employ administrative and perioperative data from a large metropolitan hospital to investigate the performance of different machine learning approaches for improving procedure duration estimation. The predictive modelling approaches applied include linear regression (LR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and random forests (RF).

It is said that code clones decrease maintainability of software. On the other hand, all the code clones are not necessarily harmful to software. In this study, we propose a method to identify risky code clones out of all the code clones in source code by using machine learning techniques. Our proposed method learns information about features of code clones which existed in the past and whether they were risky or not. Then, based on these information, we identify risky code clones. As a result of a pilot study, we confirmed that the proposed method was able to predict risky code clones with high accuracy.

However, if the data sets contain several noise points, or if the data sets are very high dimensional, the iteration process of optimization the FCM model often falls into local optima solution. To avoid this problem, this paper proposes a new hybrid fuzzy clustering algorithm that incorporates the Fitness Predator Optimizer (FPO) into the FCM model. FPO is a new bionic-inspired algorithm to avoid premature convergence for the multimodal optimization problem. The excellent probability of finding the global optimum of FPO enhances the quality of fuzzy clustering. Five benchmark data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository are used to compare the performances of proposed FPO-FCM with FCM and a hybrid swarm algorithm based on Quantum-behaved PSO. Experimental results show that the proposed approach could demonstrate the desirable performance and avoid the minimum local value of objective function for multivariate data type clustering problems.

A set of features, including matching values and positions, appearance of black pixels within predefined windows along the midline, are extracted from the ultrasound images using template matching and midline detection. Artificial neural network is utilized to classify the bone images and interspinous images. The neural network is trained with 1000 images from 25 pregnant subjects and tested on 720 images from a separate set of 18 pregnant patients. A high success rate (96.95% on training set, 95.75% on validation set and 94.12% on test set) is achieved with the proposed method. The trained neural network further tested on 43 videos collected from 43 pregnant subjects and successfully identified the proper needle insertion site (interspinous region) in all of the cases. Therefore, the proposed method is able to identify the ultrasound images of lumbar spine in an automatic manner, so as to facilitate the anesthetists' work to identify the needle insertion point precisely and effectively.

Schemata bandits are influenced by two different areas in machine learning, evolutionary computation and multi-armed bandits. The schemata from the schema theorem for genetic algorithms are structured as hierarchical multi-armed bandits in order to focus the optimisation in promising areas of the search space. The proposed algorithm is not a standard genetic algorithm because there are no genetic operators involved. The schemata bandits are non standard schemata nets because one node can contain one or more schemata and the value of a node is computed using information from the schemata contained in that node. We show the efficiency of the designed algorithms for two binary encoded combinatorial optimisation problems.

Increasingly, the GP community is identifying the need to measure the generalisation performance of the models evolved in symbolic regression, and consequently the need to design operators and methods that promote generalisation. In this paper, we explore the use of bloat control methods as a means of promoting generalisation. The results suggest that bloat control methods effectively reduce the computational requirements of symbolic regression, but do not significantly improve generalisation performance. Additionally, we compare the symbolic regression models traditional machine learning techniques, and find that the traditional methods produce models that generalise more effectively than their GP counterparts, while also using fewer computational resources. The results highlight the importance of contextualising GP performance with methods outside of evolutionary computation.

In this paper, we propose a meta-heuristic approach called a Variable Neighbourhood Iterated Improvement Search (VNS-IIS) algorithm for attribute reduction. It is a combination of the variable neighbourhood search with the iterated search algorithm where two local search algorithms i.e. a random iterated local search and a sequential iterated local search algorithm are employed in a parallel strategy. In VNS-IIS, an improved solution will always be accepted. The proposed method has been tested on the 13 well-known datasets that are available in the UCI machine learning repository.

A possible solution to this problem is to use machine learning to automatically evaluate the credibility of a tweet, i.e. whether a person would deem the tweet believable or trustworthy. This has been often framed and studied as a supervised classification problem in an off-line (post-hoc) setting. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised ranking model for scoring tweets according to their credibility. This model is used in TweetCred, a real-time system that assigns a credibility score to tweets in a user's timeline. TweetCred, available as a browser plug-in, was installed and used by 1,127 Twitter users within a span of three months. During this period, the credibility score for about 5.4 million tweets was computed, allowing us to evaluate TweetCred in terms of response time, effectiveness and usability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work to develop a real-time system for credibility on Twitter, and to evaluate it on a user base of this size.

Combining techniques from the fields of natural language processing and network analysis, we are able to identify technological fields as overlapping communities of knowledge fragments. Over time persistence of these fragments allows to observe how these fields evolve into trajectories, which may change, split, merge and finally disappear. As empirical example we use the broad area of Technological Singularity, an umbrella term for different technologies ranging from neuroscience to machine learning and bioengineering, which are seen as main contributors to the development of artificial intelligence and human enhancement technologies. Using a socially enhanced search routine, we extract 1,398 documents for the years 2011-2013. Our analysis highlights the importance of generic interface that ease the recombination of technology to increase the pace of technological progress. While we can identify consistent technology fields in static document collections, more advanced ontology reconciliation is needed to be able to track a larger number of communities over time.

One common form of online child exploitation is child grooming, where adults and minors exchange sexual text and media via social media platforms. Such behaviour involves a number of stages performed by a predator (adult) with the final goal of approaching a victim (minor) in person. This paper presents a study of such online grooming stages from a machine learning perspective. We propose to characterise such stages by a series of features covering sentiment polarity, content, and psycho-linguistic and discourse patterns. Our experiments with online chatroom conversations show good results in automatically classifying chatlines into various grooming stages. Such a deeper understanding and tracking of predatory behaviour is vital for building robust systems for detecting grooming conversations and potential predators on social media.

This paper, investigates techniques that are widely accepted in literature and measures their effect on gender classification task. There is no special reason on selecting gender classification task, any other task could have been chosen. In audience measurement systems, many important demographics, i.e. gender, age, facial expression, can be measured by using machine learning algorithms. Moreover; in such a system, these demographics are so substantial since their discriminative features on customers' habits. Due to this importance, any performance enhancement on any machine learning algorithm becomes important. A carefully chosen alignment method can boost performance of machine learning algorithms used within system.

The collected audience measurement data can be used as a unique basis for statistical analysis of viewing patterns, interactive display applications and also for further research and observer modelling. Here, we use machine learning methods on real-world digital signage viewership data to predict consumer behaviour in a retail environment, especially oriented towards the purchase decision process and the roles in purchasing situations. A case study is performed on data from a small retail shop where demographic and audience data of 1294 store customers were collected, manually verified and analysed. Among all customers, 246 store customers were involved in a buying process that resulted in an actual purchase. Comparison of different machine learning methods shows that by using support vector machines we can predict with 88.6% classification accuracy whether a customer will actually make a purchase, which outperforms classification accuracy of a baseline (majority) classifier by 7.5 %. A similar approach can also be used to predict the roles of an individual in the purchase decision process. We show that by extending the audience measurement dataset with additional heuristic features, the support vector machines classifier on average improves the classification accuracy of a baseline classifier by 15%.

Security of cloud is the top challenge among all challenges that cloud computing deals with. Indeed, security issues of cloud have a reverse relation with cloud users' desires to move their assets to cloud environment. Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack is one of the most popular attacks for security experts, which is easy to be carried out; however, it has some catastrophic effects. On the other hand, if a kind of attack like DDOS happens in cloud environment, cloud providers are not eager to share this information with their users due to loss of reputation. However, cloud users demand a mechanism to find out whether their assets are secure or not. To address the aforementioned problem, in this paper a new framework for classification of DDOS attack by utilization of machine learning techniques has been proposed. For this purpose, we will collect a dataset from the resources that are dedicated to user's virtual machine. This file will be delivered to a machine learning tool for future activities.

This paper proposes a novel approach to utilize consumer's water consumption data to predict possibilities of water leakage occurrence at residential premises. Simulation datasets containing attributes related to consumer's water usage were created based on primary data collected from consumers. The generated simulation datasets were analyzed using selected classification methods available in WEKA Machine Learning Software. The result showed that 16 out of the 33 selected methods produced classification accuracy greater than 90 percent. Analysis conducted on the best eight methods showed that most of the methods produced very consistent results. Further analysis based on standard error rate also showed similar outcomes. The findings clearly suggest that consumer's water consumption data has the greatest potential to be used for remote prediction of domestic water leakage cases.

Understanding the types of defects could help developers to adopt measures in current and future software releases. In practice, developers often categorize defects into various types. One common categorization is based on fault triggers of defects. Fault trigger is a set of conditions which activate a defect (i. e., fault) and propagate the defect into a failure. In general, there are two types of defect based fault triggering conditions, Bohrbug and Mandelbug. Bohrbug refers to a bug which can be easily isolated, and its activation and error propagation is simple. Mandelbug refers to a bug whose activation and/or error propagation is complex (e. g., a time lag between the fault activation and the failure occurrence). With these category labels, developers can better perform post-mortem analysis to identify common characteristic of the defects, and design specific fault-tolerance mechanisms. However, in most software systems, these category labels are often unavailable. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a text mining solution which categorize defects into fault trigger categories by analyzing the natural-language description of bug reports. A previous study shows that Mandelbug is more complex and needs more time to be fixed. Thus, to better identify Mandelbugs, we propose a novel fUzzy Set based fEature Selection algorithm named USES, which selects the features (i. e., terms) which have high ability to distinguish Mandelbugs from Bohrbugs. USES first caches a set of terms based on their fuzzy affinity scores to Bohrbug or Mandelbug. Next, it iterates many times, and in each iteration, it selects a subset of terms, and builds a classifier on these terms. USES selects the classifier and the terms which could achieve the best performance on a training data. We evaluate our solution on 4 datasets including Linux, Mysql, Apache HTTPD, and AXIS containing a total of 809 bug reports. We show that USES with naive Bayes multinomial achieves the best performance; it achieves Mandelbug F-measure scores of 0.298 -0.615. We also compare USES with other baseline approaches. The results show that USES on average improves Mandelbug F-measure scores of the best performing baseline by 12.3%.

Owing to the improved performance characteristics, time-frequency (TF) transformation tools are commonly used for such analysis. In this article, we propose a one-step characterization approach that exploits the collective advantages of TF analysis and discriminative kernels in the intermediate ambiguity domain (AD) for non-stationary signal analysis. Here, a machine learning kernel is used to suitably model the AD-map, following which certain robust AD-based features are extracted from the signal-and cross-term (generated during TF transformation) components. The novelty of the work is also geared towards finding out the usefulness of cross-terms for non-stationary signal classification applications. The proposed technique is evaluated for a multiclass quantification problem using one of the challenging stochastic triangular waveform datasets. Obtained misclassification accuracies are close to the theoretical minimum, previously reported using a Bayes classifier. Results indicate that this scheme shows great potential and can be extended in design of robust tools for real-life signal nonstationary analysis.

This paper surveys different spam filtering techniques, Support Vector Machine (SVM) training problems and need to introduce MapReduce Hadoop to train SVM. Techniques to separate spam mails are word based, content based, machine learning based and hybrid. Machine learning techniques are most popular because of high accuracy and mathematical support. SVM is the mostly used machine learning based technique in the spam filtering process because its ability to handle data with large attribute. Hurdles in training of SVM are, large time requirement and large dataset can't be given as an input. These both problems can be solved by implementing the training algorithm on MapReduce (Hadoop) framework which gives up to 6 times speedup than sequential algorithm.

Testing processes are done in four environment conditions to determine the sound prediction accuracy level. The four conditions are environments with low and high noise, far and near sound sources. AudiTion has two sound databases, the first database is indoor sounds and the second database is outdoor sounds with a total of 23 sounds. The results show that the average level of accuracy is relatively low at around 26.25% for the detection in the four conditions using both sound databases. Due to the low accuracy, we conducted trials by reducing indoor databases only for five sounds. This trial shows the accuracy of 40%. Since the accuracy results are still less than 50%, we conclude that AudiTion applications need to use another approach.

A Deep Learning Methodology to Proliferate Golden Signoff Timing	2014 DESIGN, AUTOMATION AND TEST IN EUROPE CONFERENCE AND EXHIBITION (DATE)	Design Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Expo		English	Proceedings Paper	Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition (DATE)	MAR 24-28, 2014	Dresden, GERMANY	European Design & Automat Assoc, EDA Consortium, IEEE Council Elect Design Automat, ECSI, ACM Special Interest Grp Design Automat, Russian Acad Sci, IEEE Comp Soc Test Technol Tech Council, IEEE Solid State Circuits Soc, Int Federat Informat Proc				Signoff timing analysis remains a critical element in the IC design flow. Multiple signoff corners, libraries, design methodologies, and implementation flows make timing closure very complex at advanced technology nodes. Design teams often wish to ensure that one tool's timing reports are neither optimistic nor pessimistic with respect to another tool's reports. The resulting "correlation" problem is highly complex because tools contain millions of lines of black-box and legacy code, licenses prevent any reverse-engineering of algorithms, and the nature of the problem is seemingly "unbounded" across possible designs, timing paths, and electrical parameters. In this work, we apply a "big-data" approach to the timer correlation problem. We develop a machine learning-based tool, Golden Timer eXtension (GTX), to correct divergence in flip-flop setup time, cell arc delay, wire delay, stage delay, and path slack at timing endpoints between timers. We propose a methodology to apply GTX to two arbitrary timers, and we evaluate scalability of GTX across multiple designs and foundry technologies /libraries, both with and without signal integrity analysis. Our experimental results show reduction in divergence between timing tools from 139.3ps to 21.1ps (i.e., 6.6x) in endpoint slack, and from 117ps to 23.8ps (4.9x reduction) in stage delay. We further demonstrate the incremental application of our methods so that models can be adapted to any outlier discrepancies when new designs are taped out in the same technology /library. Last, we demonstrate that GTX can also correlate timing reports between signoff and design implementation tools.

This tolerance can be exploited to design approximate circuits that perform within acceptable accuracies but have much lower power consumption and smaller area footprints (and often better run times) than their exact counterparts. In this paper, we propose a new class of automated synthesis methods for generating approximate circuits directly from behavioral-level descriptions. In contrast to previous methods that operate at the Boolean level or use custom modifications, our automated behavioral synthesis method enables a wider range of possible approximations and can operate on arbitrary designs. Our method first creates an abstract synthesis tree (AST) from the input behavioral description, and then applies variant operators to the AST using an iterative stochastic greedy approach to identify the optimal inexact designs in an efficient way. Our method is able to identify the optimal designs that represent the Pareto frontier trade-off between accuracy and power consumption. Our methodology is developed into a tool we call ABACUS, which we integrate with a standard ASIC experimental flow based on industrial tools. We validate our methods on three realistic Verilog-based benchmarks from three different domains - signal processing, computer vision and machine learning. Our tool automatically discovers optimal designs, providing area and power savings of up to 50% while maintaining good accuracy.	[Nepal, Kumud; Li, Yueting; Bahar, R.

One of the key issues related to workload consolidation is contention for shared resources such as last level cache, main memory, memory controller, etc. Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) of CPU is another effective technique that has widely been used to trade the performance for power reduction. We have found that the degree of resource contention of a system affects its performance sensitivity to CPU frequency. In this paper, we apply machine learning techniques to construct a model that quantifies runtime performance degradation caused by resource contention and frequency scaling. The inputs of our model are readings from Performance Monitoring Units (PMU) screened using standard feature selection technique. The model is tested on an SMT-enabled chip multi-processor and it reaches up to 90% accuracy. Experimental results show that, guided by the performance model, runtime power management techniques such as DVFS can achieve more accurate power and performance tradeoff without violating the quality of service (QoS) agreement. The QoS violation of the proposed system is significantly lower than systems that have no performance degradation information.

To address this issue, side-channel attacks have recently been combined with modeling techniques to make attacks more efficient [25][26]. In this work, we present an overview and survey of these so-called "hybrid modeling and side-channel attacks" on PUFs, as well as of classical side channel techniques for PUFs. A taxonomy is proposed based on the characteristics of different side-channel attacks. The practical reach of some published side-channel attacks is discussed. Both challenges and opportunities for PUF attackers are introduced. Countermeasures against some certain side-channel attacks are also analyzed. To better understand the side-channel attacks on PUFs, three different methodologies of implementing side-channel attacks are compared. At the end of this paper, we bring forward some open problems for this research area.

Based on clinical guidelines, the use of mammogram for an early detection of this cancer is an important step in reducing its danger. Thus, computer aided detection using image processing techniques in analyzing mammogram images and localizing abnormalities such as mass has been used. A False Positive (FP) rate is considered a challenge in localizing mass in mammogram images. Hence, in this paper, the rejection model based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been used in reducing the FP rate of segmented mammogram images using the Chan-Vese method, initialized by the Marker Controller Watershed (MCWS) algorithm. Firstly, a mammogram image is segmented using the MCWS algorithm. Then, the segmentation is refined using Chan-Vese. After that, the SVM rejection model is built and is used in rejecting the non-correct segmented nodules. The dataset which consists of 16 nodules and 28 non-nodules has been obtained from the UKM Medical Centre. The experiment has shown the effectiveness of the SVM rejection model in reducing the FP rate compared to the result without the use of the SVM rejection model.

Therefore, we need a kind of recommendation system to select the most preferable contents. Although there have been many personalization techniques proposed, there are few works on the recommendation of personal game contents. In this paper, we attempt to propose to use machine learning based on game contents with user's explicit preference (like or dislike). Especially, we incorporate game domain knowledge on the design of features for learning. As a test bed, we select a famous real-time strategy game, StarCraft, because there are many game replays played by professional players. To generate training samples, each participant is invited to review replays and express his/her preference. Using the data, machine learning algorithms build a set of models to predict preference on new replays. For five participants, we labeled two hundred StarCraft replays. The exploratory study on the selection of the features and classification algorithms show the importance of the careful selection of them. The experimental results show that the proposed recommendation system can predict the users' preference with an accuracy of 79% when we select appropriate models and features.

J	Ghane, K			IEEE	Ghane, Kamran			A Model and System for Applying Lean Six Sigma to Agile Software Development Using Hybrid Simulation	2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE (ITMC)	IEEE International Technology Management Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Technology Management Conference (ITMC)	JUN 12-15, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE				Software quality control and quality assurance have close ties with predictability, speed/time, and cost of software development. Process improvement has essential impact on these factors that drive the quality of software project outcomes. While stochastic design and process improvement methodologies based on the Lean Six Sigma can greatly help with process design and improvement, software development processes are substantially different from the processes in the other disciplines such as manufacturing or service operations that produce same/similar product/services. It's not feasible to quantify software processes in a discrete manner that is required by the Six Sigma methodologies. The discrete simulation that is used in operations such as car manufacturing relies on the fact that system activities change state at discrete time points. However this cannot be applied to software development as the activities are not repetitive and they have time estimates at best. The continuous simulation approach lacks the discrete simulation advantage of identifying inefficiencies and improving the processes along the line. Then the discrete simulation has the shortcoming of detecting consequences of improvements late in the process. The model and system introduced in this paper applies Six Sigma methodologies to software processes using hybrid simulation. It uses the relatively detailed empirical data - which the lean software development and agile methodologies produce - to simulate future activities. Such predictions are used as the baseline measurement data to assess the actual results of the continuous improvement activities. The Monte Carlo simulation is used to eliminate dependency on assumption of a specific distribution function for software development activities. The System also includes a framework for collecting process data and creating the empirical knowledge base that optimizes simulation, analytics and data mining. The System collects empirical data on process actors and uses them in simulation to provide estimations that incorporate the human factor that has substantial role in software processes. Over time the System effectively uses machine learning to improve estimation and in some cases to recommend actions to improve performance. The resulted data can be used not only for process improvement but also for evaluating impacts of factors such as outsourcing, geographical base cost, and time zone difference on the process quality.

The considerable reduction in size and energy consumption of CMOS circuitry together with the self-organizational capability of network nodes are leading WSNs to be ubiquitous. WSNs operate under very strict energy constraints and the power supply is usually the most expensive component of the node being designed. This study proposes a methodology to reduce the power consumption by means of an energy-efficient management of node resources and tasks. We focus our attention on hydrometric level sensors. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used to predict the nonlinear dynamics of hydrometric level given a limited set of previous measurements. The procedure takes the error committed by the predictor and the battery charge status as input parameters. Based on the input state, fuzzy logic (FL) is used to infer the most appropriate sensor sampling rate and the need to transmit real-time data to the gateway node.

EMI method utilizes piezoelectric transducers for directly measuring the mechanical properties of the host structure, obtaining the so called impedance measurement, highly influenced by the variations of dynamic parameters of the structure. These measurements usually contain a large number of frequency points, as well as a high number of dimensions, since each frequency range swept can be considered as an independent variable. That makes this kind of data hard to handle, increasing the computational costs and being substantially time-consuming. In that sense, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based data compression has been employed in this work, in order to enhance the analysis capability of the raw data. Furthermore, a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which has been widespread used in machine learning and pattern recognition fields, has been applied in this study in order to model any possible existing pattern in the PCA-compress data, using for that just the first two Principal Components. Different known non-damaged and damaged measurements of an experimental tested beam were used as training input data for the SVM algorithm, using as test input data the same amount of cases measured in beams with unknown structural health conditions. Thus, the purpose of this work is to demonstrate how, with a few impedance measurements of a beam as raw data, its healthy status can be determined based on pattern recognition procedures.

This is indeed a fundamental step in the development of a simulator, because it allows reducing the dimensionality of the parameter set, making model tuning more efficient. With parameter ranking we denote the process of measuring the relevance of the parameters for accurately simulating a phenomenon, while with parameter screening we denote the choice of a specific subset of parameters to be used for model tuning. We will present ranking techniques based on Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron, and a simple procedure for going from ranking to screening. Our techniques have been validated against a helicopter simulator case-study but the techniques do not rely on any domain-specific feature or assumption.

Particularly, we focus on how to achieve safe behavior of a robot if it is requested to perform exploration of unknown states. Presented methods are studied from the viewpoint of reinforcement learning, a partially-supervised machine learning method. To collect training data for this algorithm, the robot is required to freely explore the state space - which can lead to possibly dangerous situations. The role of safe exploration is to provide a framework allowing exploration while preserving safety. The examined methods range from simple algorithms to sophisticated methods based on previous experience or state prediction. Our overview also addresses the issues of how to define safety in the real-world applications (apparently absolute safety is unachievable in the continuous and random real world). In the conclusion we also suggest several ways that are worth researching more thoroughly.

These algorithms use a collection of features subsets as support to classify a new object, which is called support set system. Each support set consists of selected features that are intended to discriminate the class of each object in the learning matrix. In this paper, a new model called AlVot By Class (AlVot BC) is proposed. It is aimed to build a support set system by class, so that each class-specific support set provides evidence of the membership of an object to the class represented by that support set. The classification performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on seven databases from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The results show a clear improvement over its analogous algorithm based on AlVot.

As a consequence, we also do not know how brain processes are affected by nerve cell deaths in neurodegenerative diseases (ND). We can register symptoms of ND such as motor and/or mental disorders (dementias) and even provide symptomatic relief, though the structural effects of these are in most cases not yet understood. Fortunately, with early diagnosis there are often many years of disease progression with symptoms that, when they are precisely monitored, may result in improved therapies. In the case of Parkinson's disease, measurements of eye movements can be diagnostic. In order to better understand their relationship to the underlying disease process, we have performed measurements of reflexive eye movements in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We have compared our measurements and algorithmic diagnoses with experts' diagnoses. The purpose of our work was to find universal rules, using rough set theory, to classify how condition attributes predict the neurologist's diagnosis. Prediction of individual UPDRS values only from reflexive saccade (RS) latencies was not possible. But for n = 10 patients, the patient's age, latency, amplitude, and duration of RS gave a global accuracy in individual patients' UPRDS predictions of about 80%, based on cross-validation. This demonstrates that broadening the spectrum of physical measurements and applying data mining and machine learning (ML) can lead to a powerful biomarker for symptom progression in Parkinson's.

In this paper, we present our parallel design of time series analysis and implementation of ARIMA modeling in MADlib's framework. The algorithms for fitting time series models are intrinsically sequential since any calculation for a specific time t depends on the result from the previous time step t - 1. Our solution parallelizes this computation by splitting the data into n chunks. Since the model fitting involves multiple iterations, we use the results from previous iteration as the initial values for each chunk in the current iteration. Thus the computation for each chunk of data is not dependenton on the results from the previous chunk. We further improve performance by redistributing the original data such that each chunk can be loaded into memory, minimizing communication overhead. Experiments show that our parallel implementation has good speed-up when compared to a sequential version of the algorithm and R's default implementation in the "stats" package.

To protect these networks, intrusion detection systems are used. Signature-based intrusion detection cannot find previously unknown attacks, which is why anomaly detection is needed. However, many new systems are slow and complicated. We propose a log anomaly detection framework which aims to facilitate quick anomaly detection and also provide visualizations of the network traffic structure. The system preprocesses network logs into a numerical data matrix, reduces the dimensionality of this matrix using random projection and uses Mahalanobis distance to find outliers and calculate an anomaly score for each data point. Log lines that are too different are flagged as anomalies. The system is tested with real-world network data, and actual intrusion attempts are found. In addition, visualizations are created to represent the structure of the network data. We also perform computational time evaluation to ensure the performance is feasible. The system is fast, finds real intrusion attempts and does not need clean training data.

In this paper, we propose an extension to an initial research effort, namely, towards fingerprinting malicious traffic by putting an emphasis on the attribution of maliciousness to malware families. The proposed technique in the previous work establishes a synergy between automatic dynamic analysis of malware and machine learning to fingerprint badness in network traffic. Machine learning algorithms are used with features that exploit only high-level properties of traffic packets (e.g. packet headers). Besides, the detection of malicious packets, we want to enhance fingerprinting capability with the identification of malware families responsible in the generation of malicious packets. The identification of the underlying malware family is derived from a sequence of application protocols, which is used as a signature to the family in question. Furthermore, our results show that our technique achieves promising malware family identification rate with low false positives.

In this paper, we find that there exists influence transfer effect in the process of user interactions, and present a regional user interaction model to analyze and understand interactions between users in a local region by influence transfer effect. Based on real data from Sina Weibo, we validate the effectiveness of our model by the experiments of user type classification, influential user identification and zombie user identification in online social networks. The experimental results show that our model present better performance than the PageRank based method and machine learning method.

Although the etiology of the pulmonary edema is deduced with the help of history, physical examination and various biochemical and radiological investigations, computer aided evaluation of pulmonary edema will be helpful for physicians in determining the course of management for the condition. In this study we present texture analysis of chest x-ray, using Gabor filter and one of the machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machine (SVM), to distinguish the normal chest x-ray from the chest x-ray of pulmonary edema.

Understanding the intensity of the wakes and the nature of its propagation within the wind farm still remains a challenge to scientist, engineers and utility operators. In this paper, five different machine learning methods are used to estimate the power deficit experienced by wind turbines due to the wake losses. Production data from the Horns Rev offshore wind farm, Denmark, have been used for the study. The methods used are linear regression, linear regression with feature engineering, nonlinear regression, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Power developed by individual turbines located at different positions within the farm were computed based on the above methods and compared with the actual power measurements. With the respective Variance Normalized Root Mean Square Error (VNRMSE) of 0.21 and 0.22, models based on ANN and SVR could estimate the wind farm wake effects at an acceptable accuracy level. The study shows that suitable machine learning methods can effectively be used in estimating the power deficits due to wake effects experienced in large wind farms.

The appropriate control parameters for actual power system operation can be determined by using these predictions. Although parameters determined by conventional methods are accurate, they may not be determined in time before the beginning of operation because extensive time is required for the calculations. In this paper, the support vector machine-a machine learning method that solves the two-class classification problem-is used to determine the line drop compensator (LDC) parameters instantly. To verify the validity of the proposed method, we carried out numerical simulations to determine the LDC parameters. From the simulated results, we found that the proposed method can instantly and accurately determine the LDC parameters.

Through the study of the value contributed by symptoms to syndrome diagnosis of Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB), that is diagnosis weight, constructing symptom-syndrome scale of CHB, and realizing quantitative diagnosis from symptom to syndrome. Methods. Collecting the information from four diagnostic methods and diagnostic information of patients who were confirmed of Chronic Hepatitis B from November 2009 to April 2010 from 3 hospitals, the researchers construct a clinical record data base of Chronic Hepatitis B, which is used as the dataset for machine learning. Then association rule mining algorithm is adopted to analyze the data automatically. The confidence of the association rule between symptom and syndrome is taken as the weight of symptom contributed to syndrome diagnosis. All the weights of association rule are collected as symptom-diagnostic scale. Then a test data set is used to evaluate the accuracy of the diagnostic scale. Results. (1) Damp-Heat in the Liver and Gallbladder, Yin Deficiency of Liver and Kidney, Liver Qi Stagnation and Spleen Deficiency are three major syndromes of CHB. (2) Spider nevus, white tongue, moderate pulse and soft pulse are of decisive significance to the diagnosis of Liver Qi Stagnation and Spleen Deficiency. Scaly dry skin, heavy sensation in the limbs and body and short pulse have decisive significance to the diagnosis of Yin Deficiency of Liver and Kidney. Three symptoms are of decisive significance to the diagnosis of Damp-Heat in the Liver and Gallbladder, which are spotted tongue, withered tongue and long pulse. (3) 327 rules are achieved. 91 symptoms can be found in three syndromes of the patients. 9 symptoms can be found in the syndromes of Damp-Heat in the Liver and Gallbladder, Yin Deficiency of Liver and Kidney. 8 symptoms can be seen in Damp-Heat in the Liver and Gallbladder, Liver Qi Stagnation and Spleen Deficiency. 3 symptoms are seen in Yin Deficiency of Liver and Kidney, Liver Qi Stagnation and Spleen Deficiency. The value that every symptom contributes to the syndrome can be regarded as the differential diagnostic evidence of different syndromes. 60 cases are taken as test data set to evaluate the diagnostic scale and the accuracy reaches 83.3%. Conclusion. The diagnostic scale has a good predictive ability. Quantitative diagnosis from symptoms to syndromes can be realized by the confidence of the association rule between symptom and syndrome. The application of this method in other diseases' differentiation is up to be studied.

Although great efforts have been done to fight the virus, the need of new therapeutics candidates of any kind still remains. This process needs huge time and experimental endeavor. However, Computer-aided techniques and can speed up the procedure. Currently, cheminformatics tools have proven to be extremely valuable in pharmaceutical research. In the past few decades, a huge number of different molecular descriptors were designed to describe chemical molecules in a quantitative way to make it easy to use them for computational studies. Herein, we present a computational study of anti-HIV small molecules test by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to introduce the most efficient molecular descriptors for anti-HIV activity. In this regard a dataset of 199 highly active anti-HIV and 174 inactive compounds were defined by 905 molecular descriptors. Data were classified using Random Forest algorithm and the most important molecular descriptors were introduced as the parameters responsible for representing anti-HIV activity. Applying the mentioned computational and cheminformatics methods, it is possible to predict the anti-HIV activity of any given small molecule with high accuracy.

Ontology Population (OP) concerns both the extraction and classification of instances of the concepts and relations defined by an ontology. Developing IE rules for OP is an intensive and time-consuming process. Thus, an automated mechanism, based on machine-learning techniques, able to convert textual data from web pages into ontology instances may be a crucial path. This paper presents an inductive logic programming-based method that automatic induces symbolic extraction rules, which are used for populating a domain ontology with instances of entity classes. This method uses domain-independent linguistic patterns for retrieving candidate instances from web pages, and a WordNet semantic similarity measure as background knowledge to be used as input by a generic inductive logic programming system. Experiments were conducted concerning both the instance classification problem and a comparison with other popular machine learning algorithms, with encouraging results.

People are showing more inclination towards on line shops, due to large variety of options at fingertips, ease of access, access to global products. Further the buyer also benefits from information regarding user review of products, comparison of similar products etc. Therefore the importance of product review is also escalating exponentially. Most of the existing sentiment analysis systems require large training datasets and complex tools for implementation. This paper presents a Two-Parse algorithm with a training dataset of approximately 7,000 keywords, for automatic product review analysis. The proposed algorithm is more efficient as compared to some of the popular review analysis systems with enormous datasets. This algorithm is a solution to a very common problem of high polarity of datasets. This paper proposes a Weighted k-Nearest Neighbor (Weighted k-NN) Classifier which achieves a better efficiency than the classical k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier. The proposed Classifier is capable of successfully classifying weakly and mildly polar reviews along with the highly polar ones. The Classifier provides an option of modifying the parameters according to need of the system and thus overcomes the problem of static parameters in classical machine learning algorithms.

In view of these reasons, this paper discusses a new approach for Documentation Taxonomy (DT) based on combining efficient algorithms to be used for english language. The important aspect of automatically classifying and providing taxonomy to a set of documents into any taxonomical structure with the help of predefined categories is termed as Documentation Taxonomy. Automated Documentation Taxonomy is gaining prominence since it frees organizations from the frantic and time consuming need of manually organizing documents. This manual process can be expensive and given the time constraints of the application or the number of documents involved, simply not feasible. In terms of accuracy, modern documentation taxonomy systems proves better than that of trained human professionals, which is made possible by a combination of information retrieval technology and machine learning technology. This research put forwards a mechanism that shows that the use of combination of different algorithms brings down the ambiguity in taxonomical issues. There are numerable useful applications of this approach spanning various scientific and general fields of work.

Some algorithm is wonder performance but generate negative association rule and also suffered from multi-scan problem. In this paper we proposed IMLMS-PANR-GA association rule mining based on min-max algorithm and MLMS formula. In this method we used a multi-level multiple support of data table as 0 and 1. The divided process reduces the scanning time of database. The proposed algorithm is a combination of MLMS and min-max algorithm.

Digital circuits in the form of digital arithmetic and digital logics are employed for various applications. On the other side, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is considered as a state-of-the-art tool for pattern recognition. In this paper, a novel attempt is made to study, assess and design digital circuits using two-class and multi class support vector machine classifiers. It is reported in literature that computational complexity and the classification time for SVM classifier depends on the number of support vectors required for classification. In order to reduce the number of support vectors, an optimum threshold technique based SVM classifier is employed for the design of digital circuits and it is observed that a maximum of 87.5% of total support vectors are pruned on using the technique.

Latent Factor Model for Traffic Signal Control	2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SERVICE OPERATIONS AND LOGISTICS, AND INFORMATICS (SOLI)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Service Operations and Logistics, and Informatics (SOLI)	OCT 08-10, 2014	Qingdao, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE		Collaborative Filtering; Intelligent Transportation Systems; Recommendation System; Signal Control	TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS; RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT	The increased ownership of motor vehicles has brought many urban problems, such as traffic congestion, environmental pollution. Traffic signal control is recognized as one of effective ways to alleviate these problems. However, it is still hard to automatically choose appropriate traffic signal timing plans for different traffic conditions due to the dynamics and uncertainty of transportation systems. In this paper, we propose a latent factor model based traffic signal timing plan recommendation method to address this problem. In the proposed method, we model the abstract traffic states as the "users" in recommendation systems, and timing plans as the "items". And there are many explicit or implicit factors in the interactions between "users" and "items". The latent factor model is successfully used to deal with uncertain factors which cannot be modeled accurately in math. The novel method adopted the model-free adaptive idea to solve the problem of modeling from the perspective of data mining and machine learning framework. And, the proposed method is tested by using simulation data generated by a microscopic traffic simulator called Paramics. The results are compared to the baseline Webster method. The results indicate that the proposed latent factor model based recommendation method outperforms the Webster method on reducing the delay.

This paper presents a hybrid recommender system that integrates user demographics and item characteristics, around a collaborative filtering core based on user-item interactions. The recommender system is evaluated on Movielens data (including genre information and user data) as well as real-world data from a discount coupon provider. We show that the inclusion of additional item and user information can have great impact on recommendation quality, especially in settings where little interaction data is available.

The proposed approach uses subspace grids as input to synergistic and distributed neural network models. The paper first describes projection of multidimensional Microarray data to a number of lower dimensional subspaces. This work makes use of two algorithms to define lower dimensional subspaces. The range of value associated with each vector of a subspace is divided into a number of equal parts to define subspace grids. The resulting subspace grid data is used with the proposed synergistic and distributed neural network models to classify patterns associated with multidimensional Microarray data. The results show that the use of subspaces grids with synergistic and distributed neural network models produces good results to classify patterns in multidimensional Microarray data.			awani@uok.edu.in						16	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-1-4799-3009-8				2014							444	450		10.1109/CSCI.2014.80		7	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BC8NS	WOS:000355911900076

Due to the attenuation of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals in Indoor applications, alternative methods have been proposed to refine location estimates. In search of practical methods, researchers have considered the use of currently deployed 802.11 networks as the basis of positioning, adopting Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) as the standard distance measure. However, attempts at accurate localization have failed due to reliance on heavily distorted power measurements acquired on saturated 2.4 and increasingly crowded 5 GHz channels. In this paper, A Dual Source-Observation Weighted Localization method is proposed as a solution to the Wi-Fi positioning problem, estimating user position through Tikhonov Regularization Cost Functional Minimization. This novel solution combines a) Weighted Kernel Ridge Regression (WKRR), and b) Weighted Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernels to develop an algorithm which increases estimation accuracy by up to 1/4 meter compared to the current leading localization technology, Weighted K-Nearest Neighbors (WKNN), and substantially reduces error variance, due to the dual Empirical Loss, Complexity objective.

In our case study, the solar transmittance of the window glass and the thermal conductivity of the bricks were the most influential parameters.

Identifying the transformation rules is nontrivial task, where it might be much easier for the experts to provide examples of the transformations rather than specifying complete and consistent rules. The examples provided by expert represent their knowledge in the domain. Thus, it is much beneficial to utilize a set of examples, i.e. pairs of transformation source and target models, in order to learn transformation rules. Machine learning (ML) techniques proved their ability of learning relations and concepts in various domains. In this paper, we aim to apply Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) for learning the transformation rules between the requirements analysis and software design based on a set of pairs of transformation analysis and design models. ALEPH and GILPS systems have been employed, individually, to induce the intended transformation rules; however the resultant rules don't accommodate the desire transformations. Thus, in this paper we focus on identifying the problem of analysis-design transformation and discussing the derived rules as well as the limitations of the current ILP systems.

Experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to the local sensitive hashing in velocity.

The business identification and control is meaningful to management of NGN and safety. Aimed at the accuracy and effectiveness of network business identification mechanism, one systematic model is developed with accurate and intelligent identification function. The research on business flow identification technology is conducted. Through testing the identification accuracy has been improved a lot. Foreword: With the development of network technology, the network access rate has been improved with more and more users. The terminal function has been even stronger. Under the background of three nets fusion, the business on network has been diversified, among which there is not only normal business but also illegal business. The operators hope to have different service to different business type. They want to limit the illegal business and enhance the control capability over network so as to use the limit bandwidth effectively. It is the prerequisite for accurate identification of specific network business no matter for providing differentiation service or control the thread on network management.

Except for designing features, a reasonable utilization of training examples is also significant to the detection accuracy and training time. In this paper, we propose a new method, named Weight-Loss Control Sampling (WLCS), to deal with the negative training examples by improving the training process of AdaBoost. The WLCS updates the negative training set by sampling hard examples from original negative set. It determines when to implement sampling process by the weight-loss of the negative training set. And we reduce the capacity of negatives after each sampling to accelerate the training. In this paper, we implement experiments to prove that the WLCS can train a better classifier in a short training time via a specific pedestrian detection method.

With the rapid development of stereoscopic display techniques, stereoscopic saliency detection is much desired for the emerging stereoscopic applications. Compared with 2D saliency detection, the depth factor has to be considered in stereoscopic saliency detection. Inspired by the wide applications of machine learning techniques in 2D saliency detection, we propose to use the machine learning technique for stereoscopic saliency detection in this paper. The contrast features from color, luminance and texture in 2D images are adopted in the proposed framework. For the depth factor, we consider both the depth contrast and depth degree in the proposed learned model. Additionally, the center-bias factor is also used as an input feature for learning the model. Experimental results on a recent large-scale eye tracking database show the better performance of the proposed model over other existing ones.

Finally, quality score is predicted by multiple iterations in test procedure. Experimental results on three publicly available 3D image quality assessment databases demonstrate that, in comparison with the most related existing methods, the proposed technique achieves comparatively consistent performance with subjective assessment.

The subspace selected by CDF maximizes the performance of the entire classification pipeline, and is chosen from a set of candidate subspaces that are each discriminative. Our method is based on Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis, and can be viewed as a generalization of the PLS1 algorithm, designed to increase discrimination in classification tasks. We demonstrate our approach on the UCF50 action recognition dataset, two object detection datasets (INRIA pedestrians and vehicles from aerial imagery), and machine learning datasets from the UCI Machine Learning repository. Experimental results show that the proposed approach improves significantly in terms of accuracy over linear SVM, and also over PLS in terms of compactness and efficiency, while maintaining or improving accuracy.

However, currently only with the help of expert knowledge and experience are we able to evaluate the documentation quality one by one. As a result, it brings difficulty in management of Web services. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel domain-oriented evaluation and prediction framework for documentation quality of Web services. Our evaluation model is based on a large amount of Web service documents in broad domains. The key innovation is that our framework can measure and predict the documentation quality for new Web service descriptions, so that more expressive, more readable and more easily composable Web services will be provided for service requesters. In addition, experiments conducted on 1090 Web services demonstrated the efficacy of our approach in evaluating and predicting the documentation quality for both WSDL and OWL-S documents.

After each session, the physician must manually review and annotate the recordings and then debrief the trainees. The physician responsible for the simulation has recorded over 100 videos, and has realized that this process can be tedious and that retrieval of specific video segments should be automated. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based approach to detect and classify scenes that involve CPR scenes. It provides answers to queries that are of interest to the physician supervising the training sessions such as: show me all the scenes that have a CPR action from a given video simulation training, or "retrieve time specific data about such critical events as elapsed time between failure of circulation and the initiation of CPR, a measure clearly association with patient outcome". Our approach consists of two main steps: The first one segments the video into shots, selects one keyframe for each shot, and identifies regions with skin-like colors in each keyframe. Each skin region is then represented by sequence of observations that encode its motion in the different frames within the shot boundary. The second step consists of using motion-based features in a discrete HMM classifier to identify the skin-like regions that involve CPR activities. The proposed approach was evaluated and validated using a 30 min video simulation session. We show that the HMM classifier can detect 80% of the CPR scenes with only 10% false alarms.

Called felicific calculus, this system would judge an action to be morally right or wrong based on several factors like the amount of pleasure it would provide and how much pain the action would inflict upon others. Because of its basis as a type of "moral mathematics" felicific calculus may be a viable candidate as a working ethical system for artificial intelligent agents. This paper examines the concepts of felicific calculus and Utilitarianism in the light of their possible application to artificial intelligence, and proposes methods for its adoption in an actual intelligent machine. In order to facilitate the calculations necessary for this moral system, novel approaches to synthetic pain, pleasure, and empathy are also proposed.

Recent research reveals that many ad libraries, including popular ones pose threats to user privacy. Some aggressive ad libraries involve in active privacy leaks with the intention of providing targeted ads. Few intrusive ad libraries are classified as adware by commercial mobile anti-virus apps. Despite such issues, semantic detection of ad libraries from Android apps remains an unsolved problem. To this end, we have proposed and developed the AdDetect framework to perform automatic semantic detection of in-app ad libraries using semantic analysis and machine learning. A module decoupling technique based on hierarchical clustering is used to identify and recover the primary and non-primary modules of apps. Each of these modules is then represented as vectors using semantic features. A SVM classifier trained with these feature vectors is used to detect ad libraries. We have conducted an experimental study on 300 apps spread across 15 categories obtained from the official market to verify the effectiveness of AdDelect. The simulation results are promising. AdDetect achieves 95.34% accurate detection of ad libraries with very less false positives.

Several algorithms are designed to solve the challenges. Algorithms that stand apart, help in solving the challenge in addition to performing faster and efficient manner. In this paper, we propose a human cognition inspired projection based learning for person-independent human action recognition in the H.264/AVC compressed domain and demonstrate a PBL-McRBEN based approach to help take the machine learning algorithms to the next level. Here, we use gradient image based feature extraction process where the motion vectors and quantization parameters are extracted and these are studied temporally to form several Group of Pictures (GoP). The GoP is then considered individually for two different bench mark data sets and the results are classified using person independent human action recognition. The functional relationship is studied using Projection Based Learning algorithm of the Meta-cognitive Radial Basis Function Network (PBL-McRBFN) which has a cognitive and meta-cognitive component. The cognitive component is a radial basis function network while the Meta-Cognitive Component(MCC) employs self regulation. The McC emulates human cognition like learning to achieve better performance. Performance of the proposed approach can handle sparse information in compressed video domain and provides more accuracy than other pixel domain counterparts. Performance of the feature extraction process achieved more than 90% accuracy using the PTIL-McRBFN which catalyzes the speed of the proposed high speed action recognition algorithm. We have conducted twenty random trials to find the performance in GoP. The results are also compared with other well known classifiers in machine learning literature.

The proposed node split measure (MGI) modifies attribute selection process of gini index by giving importance to almost equal sized sub partitions and at same time counts frequently occurring target classes in those sub partitions. This results in less skewed decision trees, while maintaining similar accuracy as provided by gini index. As a part of data pre processing step. MGI gives a new approach to handle missing values and also provides initial data set size reduction. The performance evaluation is done on few sample data sets taken from UCI Machine learning repository. The experimental evaluation of MGI node split measure is done with gini index which shows that the proposed split measure produces height balanced decision tree of reduced height, which in turn reduces antecedents in the rule generated.

A total of 589 Karan Fries crossbred cows data from the herd maintained at National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), Karnal were recorded for the health status (lame or healthy) as target variable and other non-genetic variables such as percent of body weight distributed to individual legs (using load cell platform), parity (11010), status of pregnancy (non-pregnant, less than 90days, 91-180days and more than 181days pregnant), status of lactation (less than 60days, 61-120days, more than 121days and dry), and daily milk yield were used as input variables. These variables were used for the development of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks (NNs). Simulation of network were carried out using varying data partition strategies for training and validation data sets (60:40, 70:30 and 80:20), number of nodes in hidden layers and different optimization algorithms. It was found that to predict the heath status of cows RBF neural architect with Leven-burg Marquardt (LM) optimization algorithm, gave the best performance in comparison to MLP with highest classification accuracy rate (83.19%) at 80:20 data partition strategy.

The problems associated with spam and various approaches that attempt to deal with it, have been presented here. Statistical classifiers are one such group of methods that show adequate performance in filtering span!, based upon the previous knowledge gathered through collected and classified emails. Learning algorithms that uses the Naive Bayesian classifier have shown promising results in separating spam from legitimate mail. An encoded and fragmented database approach that resembles radix sort technique has been proposed and applied for first time to improve Paul Graham's Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm for spam filtering. The main objective of this paper is to reduce overall time in the process of spam detection. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the proposed technique, performed on two public spam databases (SpamAssasin and Ling Spam) has shown improved time performance. The proposed method has performed up to six times faster than the existing Paul Graham's Bayesian approach.

It is a predictive modelling task which is defined as building a model for the target variable as a function of the explanatory variables. There are many well established techniques for classification, while decision tree is a very important and popular technique from the machine learning domain. Decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs and utility. C4.5 is a well known decision tree algorithm used for classifying datasets. The C4.5 algorithm is Quinlan's extension of his own ID3 algorithm for decision tree classification. It induces decision trees and generates rules from datasets, which could contain categorical and/or numerical attributes. The rules could he used to predict categorical values of attributes from new records. C4.5 performs well in classifying the dataset as well as in generating useful rules. In this paper, a web based software for rule generation and decision tree induction using C4.5 algorithm has been discussed. The visualization in the form of tree structure enhances the understanding of the generated rules. The software contains the feature to impute the missing values in data. The input data can both he categorical and numerical in nature. The software can import TXT, XLS and CSV data file formats. Enhanced waterfall model has been used for the software development process. This software will he useful for academicians, researchers and students working in the area of data mining, agriculture and other fields where huge amount of data is generated.

Data-driven components in a model of inner-shelf sorted bedforms: a new hybrid model	EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS			English	Article							SUSPENDED SEDIMENT CONCENTRATIONS; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; RIPPLED SCOUR DEPRESSIONS; GENETIC ALGORITHM; CONTINENTAL-SHELF; NORTH-CAROLINA; WAVES; TRANSPORT; DYNAMICS; CURRENTS	Numerical models rely on the parameterization of processes that often lack a deterministic description. In this contribution we demonstrate the applicability of using machine learning, a class of optimization tools from the discipline of computer science, to develop parameterizations when extensive data sets exist. We develop a new predictor for near-bed suspended sediment reference concentration under unbroken waves using genetic programming, a machine learning technique. We demonstrate that this newly developed parameterization performs as well or better than existing empirical predictors, depending on the chosen error metric. We add this new predictor into an established model for inner-shelf sorted bedforms. Additionally we incorporate a previously reported machine-learning-derived predictor for oscillatory flow ripples into the sorted bedform model. This new "hybrid" sorted bedform model, whereby machine learning components are integrated into a numerical model, demonstrates a method of incorporating observational data (filtered through a machine learning algorithm) directly into a numerical model. Results suggest that the new hybrid model is able to capture dynamics previously absent from the model - specifically, two observed pattern modes of sorted bedforms. Lastly we discuss the challenge of integrating data-driven components into morphodynamic models and the future of hybrid modeling.	[Goldstein, E. B.; Murray, A.

Previous approaches have investigated augmenting applications with additional logic to detect and correct errors efficiently. In this paper, we investigate the impact of different algorithmic designs on error resilience and propose an approach for algorithm selection for a class of equations, i.e. partial differential equations (PDEs), that are at the core of many scientific computing applications, which drive HPC systems. Many different schemes have been devised for the approximation of PDE systems, each with different accuracy, stability, and performance properties. In this paper, there are two primary questions that we address: (1) Does numerical stability translate to error resilience? and (2) How do we design schemes to improve error resilience? If an algorithm's error resilience is correlated with its numerical stability properties, this may allow us to design more resilient applications by leveraging well-established information on numerical stability. Even with a clear translation of numerical stability to error resilience properties, the question of designing these algorithms still remains however, due to the variety of implementations, schemes, and largely input specific nature of the design. In this paper, we propose one approach for automated design using machine-learning. We observe that intelligent selection of the algorithm or a given problem, improves robustness by 20%-50%, on average, over the traditional selection of algorithms, without the addition of any other detection/correction logic.

In this process, different users may follow different decision making strategies, some are compensatory in which only an overall value on all the criteria is evaluated, some evaluate one criterion at a time in the order of their importance levels, while others count on the number of winning criteria. Most of the current QoS-based service selection systems do not consider these decision strategies in the ranking process, which we believe are crucial for generating accurate ranking results for individual users. In this paper, we propose a decision strategy based service ranking model. Furthermore, considering that different users follow different strategies in different contexts at different times, we apply a machine learning algorithm to learn a personalized ranking model for individual users based on how they select services in the past. Our experiment result shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

It's very tedious for a service consumer to select the appropriate one according to her/his needs. In this paper, we propose a non-logic-based matchmaking approach that uses the Correlated Topic Model (CTM) to extract topic from semantic service descriptions and model the correlation between the extracted topics. Based on the topic correlation, service descriptions can be grouped into hierarchical clusters. In our approach, we use the Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) formalism to organize the constructed hierarchical clusters into concept lattices according to their topics. Thus, service discovery may be achieved more easily using the concept lattice. In our approach, topic models are used as efficient dimension reduction techniques, which are able to capture semantic relationships between word-topic and topic-service interpreted in terms of probability distributions. In our experiment, we compared the accuracy of the our hierarchical clustering algorithm with that of a classical hierarchical agglomerative clustering. The comparisons of Precision@n and Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCGn) values for our approach, Apache lucene and SAWSDL-MX2 Matchmaker indicate that the method based on CTM presented in this paper outperform all the others matchmakers in terms of ranking of the most relevant services.

Often adaptation and ranking (used interchangeably) of discovered Web services is carried out using functional and non-functional information of Web Services. Existing approaches are either found to be only focusing on semantic modeling and representation only, or using data mining and machine learning based approaches on unstructured and raw data to perform discovery and ranking. We propose an approach to allow semantically formalized representation of logs during Web Service execution and then use such logs to perform ranking and adaptation of discovered Web Services. We have built Semantic FP-Tree based technique to perform association rule learning on functional and non-functional characteristics of Web Services. The process of automated execution of Web Services is improved in two steps, i.e., (1) we provide semantically formalized logs that maintain well-structured and formalized information about past interactions of Services Consumers and Web Services, (2) we perform an extended association rule mining on semantically formalized logs to find out any possible correlation in functional and non-functional characteristics of Web Services during past execution which is then used in automated ranking and adaptation of Web Services.

As understanding natural language is important, understanding sign language is also very important. The sign language is the basic communication method within hearing disable people. People with hearing disabilities face problems in communicating with other hearing people without a translator. For this reason, the implementation of a system that recognize the sign language would have a significant benefit impact on deaf people social live. In this paper, we have proposed a marker-free, visual Indian Sign Language recognition system using image processing, computer vision and neural network methodologies, to identify the characteristics of the hand in images taken from a video trough web camera. This approach will convert video of daily frequently used full sentences gesture into a text and then convert it into audio. Identification of hand shape from continuous frames will be done by using series of image processing operations. Interpretation of signs and corresponding meaning will be identified by using Haar Cascade Classifier. Finally displayed text will be converted into speech using speech synthesizer.

A fashion style classification system can improve the customer search functionality and provide a more personalized experience for the user. Supervised learning techniques with fashion based applications face the problem of developing quantitative measures for describing fashion products which are subjective in nature. To address this issue the authors asked fashion experts to assist in the assembly of a training set of brand-style associations. Quantitative measures were attributed to each brand in the training set by applying natural language processing, text mining, and eBay query results. This data set was used to train a support vector machine which classified the approximately 8000 remaining brands into style categories. The prospective classifier model was assessed based on its positive predictive values which yielded a 56.25% success rate. Given that there are eight different styles to choose from, a baseline for the percentage is only 12.5%. The SVM thus adds significant value to the classification of fashion brands. The final style categorization was integrated as a new filter feature that allows the user to narrow down their searches and access relevant results.	[Kreyenhagen, C.

This suggests a rising concern about the influence of these sites on adolescent drinking behavior. Parents, health organizations, and school administrators need a deeper understanding of online promotional patterns in order to combat risky behaviors through intervention and education. To address these problems, we developed a system that automatically identifies alcohol promotions in online Twitter content. The identification of promotions was modeled using supervised machine learning algorithms. Predictor variables were derived from the content of tweets, the Twitter meta-data, and the network structure. We evaluated this system using held-out testing data in a cross-validated experimental design. We found that random forest models were best at predicting promotional tweets. Yet, logistic regression main effects models were useful in determining the significance of each variable, both Twitter specific and textual. For Twitter specific variables, number of hashtags and number of mentions significantly increased the likelihood of a tweet being a promotion. Using the TF-IDF method for textual predictors, we found that words that describe a type of alcohol, such as "beer" or "wine," increased the likelihood of a tweet being a promotion. Our analysis provides information about the current state of online alcohol promotion, salient characteristics of promotions and promoters, and the influence of promotions on other users of social networking sites.

Empirically, not much research has been per-formed on the question of an appropriate description of artificial learner's performance. Objective: The objective of this paper is to find out which mathematical description fits best learning curves produced by a neural network classification algorithm. Methods: A Weka-based multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network classification algorithm was applied to a set of datasets (n=109) from publicly available repositories (UCI) in step wise k-fold cross-validation and an error rate was measured in each step. First, four different functions, i.e. power, linear, logarithmic, exponential, were fit to the measured error rates. Where the fit was statistically significant (n=69), we measured the average mean squared error rate for each function and its rank. The dependent samples T-test was performed to test whether the differences between mean squared error rates are significantly different from each other, and Wilcoxon's signed rank test was used to test whether the differences between ranks are significant. Results: The error rates, induced by a neural network, were best modeled by an exponential function. In a total of 69 datasets, exponential function was a better descriptor of error rate function in 60 of 69 cases, power was best in 8, logarithmic in 1, and linear in none out of 69 cases. Average mean squared error across all datasets was 0,000365 for exponential function, and was significantly different at P=0,002 from power, at P=0,000 from linear and at P=0,001 from logarithmic function. The exponential function's rank is, using Wilcoxon's test, significantly different at any reasonable threshold (P=0,000) from the rank of any other model. Conclusion: In the area of human cognitive performance the exponential function was found to be the best fit for a description of an individual learner. In the area of artificial learners, specifically the multilayer perceptron, our findings are consistent with the mentioned. Our work can be used to forecast and model the future performance of a MLP neural network when not all data have been used or there is a need to obtain more data for better accuracy.

Multiple methods are available in this regard and the more common is the k-fold cross-validation. Other similar methods are the bootstrap method and the k-fold repeated cross-validation. Objective: This paper compares three such methods, namely the k-fold cross-validation, the k-fold repeated cross-validation, and the bootstrap method. The latter two have regarding our experimental set-up a 20-fold increase in computational effort. The objective of this paper was to experimentally find the best cross-validation method regarding both its accuracy and its computational effort. Methods: Four classification algorithms were selected and applied on multiple datasets within the field of Life Sciences (n=35) using all three selected cross-validation methods. We used the pairwise dependent Student's T-Test with the standard 95% confidence interval for statistical comparisons. Results: The results of the statistical comparisons between the cross-validation methods were as follows. Despite 20 times less computational effort, the k-fold cross-validation method was statistically considered equal to the k-fold repeated cross-validation. The third method, the bootstrap method, was considered to be too pessimistic and therefore inferior to the other two selected methods. Conclusion: The k-fold cross-validation was proved to be the best choice between the selected cross-validation methods both regarding its accuracy and its computational effort.

One way to achieve efficient compound prediction is to use data mining or machine learning methods. In this chapter we present a few algorithms for data mining compound prediction and their applications to different materials discovery problems. In particular, the patterns or correlations governing phase stability for experimental or computational inorganic compound databases are statistically learned and used to build probabilistic or regression models to identify novel compounds and their crystal structures. The stability of those compound candidates is then assessed using ab initio techniques. Finally, we report a few cases where data mining driven computational predictions were experimentally confirmed through inorganic synthesis.

Dataset shift is a crucial example of this where training and testing datasets follow different distributions. However, most of the existing dataset shift solving algorithms need costly retraining operation and are not suitable to use the existing model. In this paper, we propose a new approach called reframing to handle dataset shift. The main objective of reframing is to build a model once and make it workable without retraining. We propose two efficient reframing algorithms to learn the optimal shift parameter values using only a small amount of labelled data available in the deployment. Thus, they can transform the shifted input attributes with the optimal parameter values and use the same existing model in several deployment environments without retraining. We have addressed supervised learning tasks both for classification and regression. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach compared to the existing solutions. In particular, we report the existence of dataset shift in two real-life datasets. These real-life unknown shifts can also be accurately modeled by our algorithms.

However, none of the state-of-the-art solvers for TSP outperforms the others in all problem instances within a given time limit. Therefore, the prediction of the best performing algorithm can save computational resources and optimise the results. In this paper, the TSP is studied in context of automated algorithm selection. Our aim is to identify the relevant features of problem instances and tackle this scenario as a machine learning task. We extend the set of existing features in the literature and propose several novel features to better characterise the problem. The contribution of the new features is statistically analysed and experiments show that adding our new features improves the prediction accuracy. We identified that our features based on kNN graph transformation are especially helpful. To create the training datasets, two state-of-the-art (meta-) heuristic algorithms are systematically evaluated on more than 2000 problems. Overall, we show that our prediction can be substantially more accurate than simple preference of an algorithm with the best performance for a majority of problem instances.

To address this problem, we propose to analyse feedback automatically using sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is domain dependent and although it has been applied to the educational domain before, it has not been previously used for real-time feedback. To find the best model for automatic analysis we look at four aspects: preprocessing, features, machine learning techniques and the use of the neutral class. We found that the highest result for the four aspects is Support Vector Machines (SVM) with the highest level of preprocessing, unigrams and no neutral class, which gave a 95 percent accuracy.

However, standard off-the-shelve lexicons are static and typically do not adapt, in content and context, to a target domain. This limitation, adversely affects the effectiveness of sentiment analysis algorithms. In this paper, we introduce the idea of distant-supervision to learn a domain-focused lexicon to improve coverage and sentiment context of terms. We present a weighted strategy to integrate scores from the domain-focused with the static lexicon to generate a hybrid lexicon. Evaluations of this hybrid lexicon on social media text show superior sentiment classification over either of the individual lexicons. A further comparative study with typical machine learning approaches to sentiment analysis also confirms this position. We also present promising results from our investigations into the transferability of this distant-supervised hybrid lexicon on three different social media.

In this paper, we present a work on analyzing human communication and interaction in Twitter. The aim is to get indicative factors about user's behavior as well as public stance and attitude towards various events around the globe. The methodology initially analyzes users' tweets and determines their emotional content based on Ekman emotional scale. Then, user's characteristics and behavior in Twitter are analyzed and their influence in the network is calculated.

How to solve this problem has given rise to increase of interest in research on multi-document summarization. With the aim of seeking a new method to help justify the importance and similarity of sentences in multi-document summarization, this study proposes a novel approach based on well-known hierarchical Bayesian topic models. By investigating hierarchical topics and their correlations with respect to the lexical co-occurrences of words, the proposed contextual topic model can determine the relevance of sentences more effectively, and recognize latent topics and arrange them hierarchically as well. The quantitative evaluation results show that this model has outperformed hLDA and LDA in document modeling. In addition, a practical application demonstrates that a summarization system implementing this model can significantly improve the performance of summarization and make it comparable to state-of-the-art summarization systems.

Most of machine learning approaches that have been attempted to address this issue are based on knowledge transfer between different BCIs users. Assuming that there is a common underlying data generating process, they try to learn a subject-independent classification model from multiple users in order to classify data of future users. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that allows inter-subjects classification of EEG signals without relying on the strong assumptions considered in previous work. It consists of learning a prediction model of a new BCI user through an ensemble of classifiers where base classifiers are trained on data from other users separately and weighted according to the performance of the ensemble on few labeled data of the new user. Evaluation on real EEG data showed that our approach allows achieving good classification accuracy when the size of calibration set is small.

Set-valued data are the generalized models of single-valued data. Some mutual information-based feature selection algorithms have been extensively studied, but less effort has been made to investigate the feature selection issue with the mutual information analysis in set-valued data. Just owing to these, mutual information is firstly introduced in the set-valued data in this paper. Unlike the traditional computations, the mutual information is estimated on the unmarked objects. Correspondingly, a feature selection algorithm based on mutual information is developed, which is implemented in a dwindling universe to quicken the feature selection process. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the experimental results on different data sets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in set-valued data.

This paper provides an algorithmic approach allowing to generate random PRMs from scratch to cover the absence of generation process. The proposed method allows to generate PRMs as well as synthetic relational data from a randomly generated relational schema and a random set of probabilistic dependencies.

In previous studies, prediction and accuracy are approached using different machine learning models. Results show that Gaussian processes provided the best result, based on a range of statistical measures. In general the ultimate aim of these machine learning experiments is to try to understand, analyze and predict the percutaneous absorption of drugs across human skin. One way to do this is to select the best set of chemical descriptors and the dataset of synthetic (Polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS) membranes, containing so many descriptors, is considered a suitable dataset to use in this study. Hence, one of the main purposes of the study is to use feature selection methods to select the molecular properties that exert the most important influence on percutaneous absorption across PDMS membranes, in the hope that this will better inform studies on human skin.

The goal of this paper is to assess the impact of HW and OS currency on server availability based on a large set of incident tickets and server attributes data collected from several different IT environments. In order to achieve this we first identify the server failure incidents using a machine learning method for automatic ticket classification. Then we conduct the data analysis to inspect the impact of HW and OS type along with their currency on the rates of server failures. This can further be used to derive guidelines to support the technology refresh decisions in the data centers.

However, within a service delivery context, enterprise clients are demanding predictive analytics that outline future "costs" associated with changing conditions. The service delivery staffing costs incurred in addressing problems and requests (arriving in the form of incident and other problem tickets) in the managed environment is especially of high importance. This paper describes an analytical study addressing such cost prediction. Specifically, a novel approach is described in which support vector regression is used to predict service delivery workloads (measured by ticket volumes) based on managed server characteristics Additionally, a proposed framework combining various analytical models is proposed to predict service delivery staffing requirements under changing IT infrastructure characteristics and conditions. Detailed descriptions of the workload prediction techniques, as well as an evaluation using data from an actual large service delivery engagement, are presented.

By using machine learning techniques, the interview transcripts are automatically processed to identify important topics of interest along with an associated sentiment for each topic. The output of the sentiment analysis is then used as an input (in addition to client satisfaction survey scores) to classify contract renewal risk. We show that, by using sentiment analysis to transform unstructured textual information into structured input, the classification accuracy of non-renewing contracts, in particular, is substantially enhanced. Moreover, the topics with negative sentiments can shed light on the root causes of problems leading to contract non-renewal.

However, the success of network virtualisation will depend in part on how efficiently the virtual networks utilise substrate network resources. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach to virtual network resource management. We propose to model the substrate network as a decentralised system and introduce a learning algorithm in each substrate node and substrate link, providing self-organization capabilities. We propose a multiagent learning algorithm that carries out the substrate network resource management in a coordinated and decentralised way. The task of these agents is to use evaluative feedback to learn an optimal policy so as to dynamically allocate network resources to virtual nodes and links. The agents ensure that while the virtual networks have the resources they need at any given time, only the required resources are reserved for this purpose. Simulations show that our dynamic approach significantly improves the virtual network acceptance ratio and the maximum number of accepted virtual network requests at any time while ensuring that virtual network quality of service requirements such as packet drop rate and virtual link delay are not affected.

Because of the complexity of the maintenance guiding system's image background and the high dimensionality of gesture characteristics, the whole process of gesture recognition can be divided into three stages which are gesture segmentation, gesture characteristic feature modeling and trick recognition. In segmentation stage, for solving the misrecognition of skin-like region, a segmentation algorithm combing background mode and skin color to preclude some skin-like regions is adopted. In gesture characteristic feature modeling of image attributes stage, plenty of characteristic features are analyzed and acquired, such as structure characteristics, Hu invariant moments features and Fourier descriptor. In trick recognition stage, a classifier based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) is introduced into the augmented reality maintenance guiding process. SVM is a novel learning method based on statistical learning theory, processing academic foundation and excellent learning ability, having a lot of issues in machine learning area and special advantages in dealing with small samples, non-linear pattern recognition at high dimension. The gesture recognition of augmented reality maintenance guiding system is realized by SVM after the granulation of all the characteristic features. The experimental results of the simulation of number gesture recognition and its application in augmented reality maintenance guiding system show that the real-time performance and robustness of gesture recognition of AR maintenance guiding system can be greatly enhanced by improved SVM.

The paper details the description, the modeling and the resolution technique of on-line booking. The latter problem is modeled using the paradigms of machine learning, in place of standard 'If-Then-Else' chains of conditional rules. In particular, a supervised three layers MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) ANN is adopted, which is trained using information from previous customers' reservations. Performances of our ANNs are analyzed: they behave in a quite satisfactory way in managing the (simulated) booking service in a hotel. The customer requires single or double rooms, while the system gives as a reply the confirmation of the required services, if available. Moreover, in the case rooms or services are not at disposal, we highlight that using our approach the system proposes alternative accommodations (from two days in advance to two days later with respect to the requested day). Numerical results are given, where the effectiveness of the proposed approach is critically analyzed. Finally, we outline guidelines for future research. (C) 2014 The Authors.

By applying aesthetic means that are computed by the machine, we can regard the role of the computer in this process as an "Automated Artificial Musical Aesthete". Also the input data is being processed by using internal metrics that are relevant to a particular musical genre. The internal algorithm clusters this data finding characteristics that could be particular to more than one genre, thus leading to the link with the Musicology and Ethnomusicology fields that are concerned with the broad study of music, emphasizing on more than one dimension. This set of tools could help students get insight on the interconnections between the musical genres like social or cultural implications that were not so obvious at first, or simply provide metrics for each genre that could be the start for future research. The authors reused already established open source methods and developed an environment in which these tools become modules of a broader system.

These problems are NP-complete and very often the optimization process targets more than one objective, at least two, and they can have an antagonist behavior. As an example, we can consider a simple car design: two objectives - cost (production cost or fuel consumption) that should be minimized and performance (speed limit or reliability) which are to be maximized. Or, if we talk about a microprocessor design the multi-criteria analysis must targets: high performance, small integration area, small energy consumption having also constraints about thermal dissipation. Given the above, becomes more difficult to teach optimization methods, to communicate new concepts and skills in an informative and formative manner, and in the same time to be attractive for students. Thus, developing effective e-learning tools targeting evolutionary algorithms in order to solve optimization problems is a continuous challenge. Moreover, technology applied to education became a key issue in nowadays knowledge society and education represents an essential element for knowledge improvement and economy growth. In this work we try to tackle the above challenges by developing the ETTOP tool (E-learning Tool for Teaching Optimization Problems) in order to gain a better understanding and familiarity of the students with new advanced learning methods and tools in the Evolutionary Computing domains, and especially in the optimization methods field. The main aim of our work consists in highlighting of different approaches for solving mono and multi-objective optimization problems using interactive e-learning tools (non-Pareto techniques, Pareto techniques and techniques based on swarm behavior). Although our software tool is designed and developed as an Application Programming Interface (API) that allows each user to select an existing problem or define a new one, to customize the solution algorithm based on problem specific constraints that the users can construct themselves or take over from sets of predetermined functions and rules, in this stage we present only three case studies that we implemented.

However, most studies on active learning are cost-insensitive. Cost-sensitive learning is a type of learning that misclassification costs are taken into consideration in the learning algorithm. In this paper, we propose a cost-sensitive active learning algorithm based on self-training. In addition, labeling cost is also considered in this paper. The results of experiments show a better performance of our algorithm compared to the current methods.

Since the evolution of web spam, a new based on machine learning algorithm web spam detection method which has self-learning ability has emerged. Web spam detection is viewed as a binary classification learning problem. Because labeled training examples are fairly expensive to obtain which need the participation of experts in this field and labor costs, how to fully utilize a large number of unlabeled web page examples on the web is a challenge faced by web spam detection. In this paper, we present a web spam detection algorithm according to improve tri-training. It uses a small amount of labeled examples and a large number of unlabeled examples to train classifiers, which can reduce the cost of labeled examples and improve the learning performance. Both web page content features and link features are used in this paper.

Here, we present a classification-based method for source localization that uses discriminative support vector machine-learning of correlation patterns that are indicative of source presence or absence. Subsequent probabilistic modeling generates a map of sound source presence probability in given directions. Being data-driven, the method during training adapts to characteristics of the sensor setup, such as convolution effects in non-free-field situations, and to target signal specific acoustic properties. Experimental evaluation was conducted with algorithm training in anechoic single-talker scenarios and test data from several reverberant multi-talker situations, together with diffuse and real-recorded background noise, respectively. Results demonstrate that the method successfully generalizes from training to test conditions. Improvement over the best of five investigated state-of-the-art angular spectrum-based reference methods was on average about 45% in terms of relative F-measure-related error reduction.

These techniques are evaluated on a large test database (86 hours) that includes babble noise and reverberation using both artificial and real room impulses responses (RIRs). All methods are trained on a database which contains noise, speech and simulated RIRs different from the test set. The performance results show that the DBN model gives the lowest error for the simulated RIRs whereas the LR model gives the best generalization performance with the highest accuracy for real RIRs.

Several machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks, reclial basis function networks and support vector machines, are successfully applied to the classification of different types of heart beat arrhythmia. This paper explores the use of a hierarchical model for the classification of cardiac arrhythmia. Furthermore, it investigates the performance of four machine learning techniques for heart beat arrhythmia classification. The benchmark MIT ECG arrhythmia database is used to evaluate the different models. The results indicate that a Tree Boost based supervised model generally achieves the best performance result. A decision tree forest has comparable results to that of Tree Boost and has slightly higher performance, compared to SVM. However, MLP has the lowest performance result. The results also show that the hierarchical model slightly outperforms the conventional one-stage model in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

Traditional supervised or semi-supervised machine learning methods become more and more difficult to adapt to the explosive Internet information. This paper proposed a web page classification method based on the topological structure of Wikipedia knowledge network. The kinship-relation association based on content similarity was proposed to solve the unbalance problem when a category node inherited the probability from multiple fathers. We used N-gram based on Wikipedia words to extract the keywords from web page, and introduce Bayes classifier to estimate the page class probability. Experimental results shown that the proposed method has very good scalability, robustness and reliability for different web pages.

Uncertainty in this area can impede optimization of wind farms by making it difficult to 1) show the benefit of upgrades to individual turbines, 2) jointly optimize wind turbine performance in a farm, and 3) validate the effects of optimization algorithms - particularly farm level algorithms and strategies that mitigate waking affects. In this paper we introduce methods that augment traditional methods for baselining wind turbine performance using multi- feature estimation based on empirical data and present a method for normalizing AEP uncertainty estimates. This innovative method does not rely solely on nacelle anemometer estimates or expensive additional sensors, as has been the historical approach but can leverage these trusted sensors if they are available. Future directions for whole farm optimizations are discussed.

This approach, while widely spread in industry, is also subject to critique due to large parameter uncertainty and due to the reliance on small data sets on which regressions are based. Issues are accentuated in early mission formulation efforts, due to the immaturity of the mission concept and technical data available in preliminary design phases. In other words, conventional cost estimation methods sometimes have too high ambitions for the quantity of the information available in early mission formulation. Yet, cost estimation is of primary importance to determine feasibility of a mission within a space program. In this paper, we explore less ambitious approaches based on machine learning algorithms that are better suited to cost estimation for early mission formulation. In particular, we use classification algorithms to categorize missions into a predefined number of cost classes, e.g. Discovery or Flagship mission class. We compare different classification algorithms, study the performance and the utility of different levels of granularity in class definition, and test the proposed approaches on selected Earth Observation missions for which public information on cost is available. The methodology proposed in this paper provides an alternative approach for early cost estimation of new missions to cost and systems engineers.

There are many works in literature about developing efficient strategies for this problem, both inside and outside the machine learning community. This paper shift the focus from finding a "good strategy" in absolute terms, to dynamically adapting and optimizing the strategy against the current opponent. Turan evolves competitive non-deterministic models of the current opponent, and exploit them to predict its moves and maximize the payoff as the game develops. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to obtain good performances against different kind of opponent, whether their strategies can or cannot be implemented as finite state machines.

Meanwhile the computational cost is heavy for most supervised learning algorithms in the training stage when a large set of training images is used. To learn edge detectors without ground truth and reduce the computational cost, an unsupervised Genetic Programming (GP) system is proposed for low-level edge detection. A new fitness function is developed from the energy functions in active contours. The proposed GP system utilises single images to evolve GP edge detectors, and these evolved edge detectors are used to detect edges on a large set of test images. The results of the experiments show that the proposed unsupervised learning GP system can effectively evolve good edge detectors to quickly detect edges on different natural images.

This becomes especially relevant in simulation-based optimization where the objectives lack a closed form and are expensive to evaluate. Over the years, meta-modeling or surrogate modeling techniques have been used to build inexpensive approximations of the objective functions which reduce the overall number of function evaluations (simulations). Some recent studies however, have pointed out that accurate models of the objective functions may not be required at all since evolutionary algorithms only rely on the relative ranking of candidate solutions. Extending this notion to MOEAs, algorithms which can 'learn' Pareto-dominance relations can be used to compare candidate solutions under multiple objectives. With this goal in mind, in this paper, we study the performance of ten different off-the-shelf classification algorithms for learning Pareto-dominance relations in the ZDT test suite of benchmark problems. We consider prediction accuracy and training time as performance measures with respect to dimensionality and skewness of the training data. Being a preliminary study, this paper does not include results of integrating the classifiers into the search process of MOEAs.	[Bandaru, Sunith; Ng, Amos H.

When an analysis of RRL trading performance is conducted using low frequency financial data (e.g. daily data), the weakening autocorrelation in price changes may lead to a decrease in trading profits as compared to its applications in high frequency trading. There therefore is a need to improve RRL for the purposes of daily equity trading. This paper presents two parameter update schemes (the 'average elitist' and the 'multiple elitist') for RRL. The purpose of the first scheme is to improve out-of-sample performance of RRL-type trading systems. The second scheme aims to exploit serial dependence in stock returns to improve trading performance, when traders deal with highly correlated stocks.

This paper proposes a new evolutionary system, i.e., EDARIC, based on the Pittsburgh approach for evolutionary machine learning and classification. The new system uses a destructive approach that starts with large-sized rules and gradually decreases the sizes as evolution progresses. Unlike most previous works, EDARIC adopts an intelligent deletion mechanism, evolves a separate population for each class of a given problem and uses an ensemble system to classify unknown instances. These features help in avoiding over-fitting and class-imbalance problems, which are beneficial for improving generalization ability of a classification system. EDARIC also applies a rule post-processing step to exempt the evolution phase from the burden of tuning a large number of parameters. Experimental results on various benchmark classification problems reveal that EDARIC has better generalization ability in case of both standard and imbalanced datasets compared to many existing algorithms in the literature.

This study achieves the task by using Learning Classifier System (LCS) and spatial-frequency features. The model built by using LCS achieves Area Under Curve (AUC) = 0.91 and accuracy rate over 86%. The result of the LCS is compared with other traditional machine-learning algorithms (e.g., Radial-Basis Function Network (RBF Network)) that are normally used in classification tasks. The study presents user-independent results which indicate that the horizontal visual stimulations contribute more to the emotion elicitation than the vertical visual stimulation.

The extant approaches, in this respect, rely on processing the post-optimization Pareto sets for automatic rule discovery using statistical or machine learning methods. However such approaches fall short of providing any information during the progress of the optimization process, which can be critical for decision analysis especially if the problem is dynamic. In this paper, we present a multi-objective optimization framework that uses a knowledge-based representation to search for patterns of Pareto optimal design variables instead of conventional point form solution search. The framework facilitates the online discovery of knowledge during the optimization process in the form of interpretable rules. The core contributing idea of our research is that we apply multi-objective evolutionary process on a population of bounding hypervolumes, or rules, instead of evolving individual point-based solutions. The framework is generic in a sense that any existing multi-objective optimization algorithm can be adapted to evaluate the rule quality based on the sampled solutions from the bounded space. An instantiation of the framework using hyperrectangular representation and non-dominated sorting based rule evaluation is presented in this paper. Experimental results on a specifically designed test function as well as some standard test functions are presented to demonstrate the working and convergence properties of our algorithm.

Such constraint limits the number of objective function evaluations allowed during the optimization. We consider an algorithm inspired by a continuous version of a multi-armed bandit problem which attacks this optimization problem by solving the tradeoff between exploration (initial quasi-uniform search of the domain) and exploitation (local optimization around the potentially global maxima). We introduce the so-called Simultaneous Optimistic Optimization (SOO), a deterministic algorithm that works by domain partitioning. The benefit of such an approach are the guarantees on the returned solution and the numerical efficiency of the algorithm. We present this machine learning rooted approach to optimization, and provide the empirical assessment of SOO on the CEC'2014 competition on single objective real-parameter numerical optimization test-suite.

In this paper, a series of comparative experiments are performed in which two simple interpretable supervised classifiers (specifically, Naive Bayes and linear Support Vector Machines) are trained (i) directly on "real" data, as would be the normal case, and (ii) indirectly, using special artificial datasets derived from real data via evolutionary optimization. The results across several challenging test problems show that supervised classifiers trained indirectly using our novel evolution-based approach produce models with superior predictive classification performance. Besides presenting the accuracy of the learned models, we also analyze the sensitivity of our artificial data optimization process to Differential Evolution's parameters, and then we examine the statistical characteristics of the artificial data that is evolved.

Our study aims to investigate the applicability of Genetic Programming (GP) approach on this complex real world problem. Traditional methods often require substantial human efforts to define good features. Moreover the optimal features for one type of activity may not be suitable for another. In comparison, our GP approach does not require such feature extraction process, hence, more suitable for complex activities where good features are difficult to be pre-defined. To facilitate this study we therefore propose a benchmark of activity data collected from various smartphone sensors, as currently there is no existing publicly available database for activity recognition. In this study, a GP-based approach is applied to nine types of activity recognition tasks by directly taking raw data instead of features. The effectiveness of this approach can be seen by the promising results. In addition our benchmark data provides a platform for other machine learning algorithms to evaluate their performance on activity recognition.

The document contains essential information such as, origin and destination of the freight, involved actors, and the type of freight being transported. We believe, the information from a waybill, when presented in an electronic format, can be utilized for building knowledge about the freight movement. The knowledge may be helpful for decision makers, e.g., freight transport companies and public authorities. In this paper, the results from a study of a Swedish transport company are presented using order data from a customer ordering database, which is, to a larger extent, similar to the information present in paper waybills. We have used the order data for predicting the type of freight moving between a particular origin and destination. Additionally, we have evaluated a number of different machine learning algorithms based on their prediction performances. The evaluation was based on their weighted average true-positive and false-positive rate, weighted average area under the curve, and weighted average recall values. We conclude, from the results, that the data from a waybill, when available in an electronic format, can be used to improve knowledge about freight transport. Additionally, we conclude that among the algorithms IBk, SMO, and LMT, IBk performed better by predicting the highest number of classes with higher weighted average values for truepositive and false-positive, and recall.

It removes irrelevant and redundant attributes from the dataset with an aim of improving the algorithm performance. There exist feature selection methods which focus on discovering features that are most suitable. These methods include wrappers, a subroutine of the learning algorithm itself, and filters, which discover features according to heuristics, based on the data characteristics and not tied to a specific algorithm. This paper improves the filter approach by enabling it to select strongly relevant and weakly relevant features and gives room to the researcher to decide which of the weakly relevant features to include. This new approach brings clarity and understandability to the feature selection preprocessing step.

CA-125 test is used as a tumor marker. A high level of CA-125 could be a sign of ovarian cancer or other conditions. We use a machine learning technique to explore better knowledge and most important factors useful for detecting early-stage ovarian cancer by evaluating the significance of data between the amino acids and the ovarian cancer. Therefore, we propose a Fuzzy Rough with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model to mine suitable rules. In pre-processing stage, we use Fuzzy Rough set theory for feature selection. In post-processing stage, we use SVM to merit of dealing with real and complex data, performing quick learning and having good classification performance.

This is an area with many different possible applications, giving users a simpler and more natural way to communicate with robots/systems interfaces, without the need for extra devices. So, the primary goal of gesture recognition research is to create systems, which can identify specific human gestures and use them to convey information or for device control. For that, vision-based hand gesture interfaces require fast and extremely robust hand detection, and gesture recognition in real time. In this study we try to identify hand features that, isolated, respond better in various situations in human-computer interaction. The extracted features are used to train a set of classifiers with the help of RapidMiner in order to find the best learner. A dataset with our own gesture vocabulary consisted of 10 gestures, recorded from 20 users was created for later processing. Experimental results show that the radial signature and the centroid distance are the features that when used separately obtain better results, with an accuracy of 91 % and 90,1 % respectively obtained with a Neural Network classifier. These to methods have also the advantage of being simple in terms of computational complexity, which make them good candidates for real-time hand gesture recognition.

In this setting, class binarization techniques and feature selection are powerful methods to reduce the size of the output and input spaces, respectively. These approaches are expected to reduce the complexity of the multi-class problem of tear film classification. In previous researches, several machine learning algorithms have been tried and only evaluated in terms of accuracy. Up to now, the evaluation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) has not been done in depth. This paper presents a methodology to evaluate the classification performance of ANNs using several measures.
