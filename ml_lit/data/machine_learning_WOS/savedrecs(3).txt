Within this approach, we proposed earlier to map each incoming document to its corresponding task context - denominated as Attentive Task (AT) - by applying search with Dempster-Shafer theory. In this paper, we extend the search algorithm with methods from machine learning for addressing the challenges in real enterprise domains: (1) information gain trees for optimizing initial evidence selection and (2) five strategies for detecting search failures. We evaluate all proposed methods on a corpus from a financial institution and give an overview on how the approach enables automation services in multichannel management.

The system uses coupling Markov chains that terminate with probability 1. Since each hypothesis is generated by an independent run of the Markov chain, the system makes the induction step in parallel by several threads. After that the abduction step refines the hypotheses by the CloseByOne operation with training examples (in several threads too). Then the system predicts presence/absence of the effect by the analogical reasoning. We test the system on SPECT dataset from UCI machine learning repository. The accuracy is 85.56 percent (that exceeds 84.0 percent accuracy of the CLIP3 algorithm developed by the authors of the dataset).

Such a system will be invaluable to farmers and plantation managers who need to sell their oil palm fresh fruit bunch (FFB) for the mill as this will avoid disputes. In this paper the authors have investigated and presented the way of grading the oil palm FFB automatically by using the digital image processing techniques based on the Gabor, GLCM and BGLAM texture feature extraction and K nearest neighbourhood (KNN) and artificial Neural Network (ANN) supervised machine learning. The results show that the oil palm fruit bunch maturity inspection system using GLCM technique based on the ANN classifier with ROI 1 yields the best quality classification result at 91.3% compared with the systems of the BGLAM based ANN classifier with ROI 3 and Gabor based KNN classifier with ROI 1 which obtained results with AUC test accuracy up to of 91.3 and 88.7%, respectively.

In this paper, we introduce a novel NER system for Arabic using a hybrid approach, which combines a rule-based approach and a machine learning approach in order to improve the performance of Arabic NER. The system is able to recognize three types of named entities, including Person, Location and Organization. Experimental results on ANERcorp dataset showed that our hybrid approach has achieved better performance than using the rule-based approach and the machine learning approach when they are processed separately.

The aim is to investigate whether the relationship between human motion and the activity of skeletal muscles in the leg might be used to aid other positioning sensors, or even to determine independently the path taken by a pedestrian. The paper describes an exercise to collect sample EMG data alongside leg motion data, and the subsequent analysis of this data set using machine learning techniques to infer motion from a set of EMG sensors. The sample data set included measurements from multiple EMG sensors, a camera-based motion tracking system and a foot mounted inertial sensor. The camera based motion tracking system at MMU allowed many targets on the subjects lower body to be tracked in a small (3m x 3m x 3m) volume to millimetre accuracy. Processing the data revealed a strong, but not trivial, relationship between leg muscle activity and motion. Each type of motion involves many different muscles, and it is not possible to conclude merely from the triggering of any single muscle that a particular type of motion has occurred. For instance, a similar set of leg muscles is involved in both forward and backward steps. It is the precise sequencing, duration and magnitude of multiple muscle activity that allows us to determine what type of motion has occurred. Preliminary analyses of the data suggest that subsets of the EMG sensors can be used to distinguish, for instance, forward motion from backward motion, and it is expected that further analysis will reveal additional correlations that will be useful in inferring the subjects motion in more detail. This paper will introduce the EMG personal navigation concept, describe the data collected, explore the machine learning techniques applied to the dataset, and present the results of the analysis.

The most notable example is the Linked Open Data (LOD) initiative where an increasing number of data sources are published in the Semantic Web's Resource Description Framework and where the various data sources are linked to reference one another. In this paper we apply machine learning to semantic graph data and argue that scalability and robustness can be achieved via an urn-based statistical sampling scheme. We apply the urn model to the SUNS framework which is based on multivariate prediction. We argue that multivariate prediction approaches are most suitable for dealing with the resulting high-dimensional sparse data matrix. Within the statistical framework, the approach scales up to large domains and is able to deal with highly sparse relationship data. We summarize experimental results using a friend-of-a-friend data set and a data set derived from DBpedia. In more detail, we describe novel experiments on disease gene prioritization using LOD data sources. The experiments confirm the ease-of-use, the scalability and the good performance of the approach.

One type of recommender system is collaborative filtering that considers feedback of like-minded people. The fundamental assumption of collaborative filtering is that people who previously shared similar preferences behave similarly later on. This paper introduces several novel, classification-based similarity metrics that are used to compare user preferences. Furthermore, the concept of partial preference similarity based on a machine learning model is presented. For evaluation the cold-start behavior of the presented classification-based similarity metrics is evaluated in a large-scale experiment. It is shown that classification-based similarity metrics with machine learning significantly outperforms other similarity approaches in different cold-start situations under different degrees of data-sparseness.

Non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM) is an approach to find out how much energy each of them consumes in order to take measures to improve the overall energy efficiency. This article describes the ongoing research on improving electric loads recognition performed by NIALM algorithms within the context of smart homes and intelligent environments. The recognition performance can be significantly improved by decreasing the number of categories to be analyzed. The authors studied several labeling methods to categorize and group loads in order to increase the overall recognition rate. 31 different devices have been measured and labeled in different device states. Their input curves have been compared with 5 different machine learning algorithms. The best results could be reached by dividing all the loads into groups with small divergence in their normalized current curve. This approach has significantly increased the performance of NIALM recognition algorithms.

Word clustering is important for parts of speech (POS) tagging, word sense disambiguation, text classification, recommender system, spell checker, grammar checker, knowledge discover and for many others Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. Computerization of Bangla language processing has been started a long ago, but still it is in neophyte stage and suffers from resource scarcity. We propose anunsupervised machine learning technique to develop Bangla word clusters based on their semantic and contextual similarity using N-gram language model. According to N-gram model, a word can be predictedbased on its previous and next words sequence. N-gram model is applied successfully for word clustering in English and some other languages. As word clustering in Bangla is a new dimension in Bangla language processing research, so we think this process is good way to start and our assumption is true as our result is quite decent. We produced 456 clusters using a locally available large Bangla corpus. Subjective score derived from the clusters reveal strong similarity of the words in the same cluster.

Due to poor performance in recognition of patterns, several methods have been used. Among them genetic algorithm (GA) have shown better performance than other algorithms. Microbial Genetic Algorithm (MGA) or Bacterial Genetic Algorithm is one of the newer branch of GA. MGA follows the evaluation procedure of microbial which gives better results in pattern recognition. In this paper, microbial genetic algorithm with neural network approach for fitness calculation has been developed and it is used for performance analysis of different pattern recognition problems. Proposed algorithm is named as Microbial Neuro-Genetic Algorithm (MNGA). Advantages of MNGA over simple genetic algorithm (SGA) have also been discussed. XOR, Breast Cancer, Diabetes, Heart Diseases, Glass and Card classification problems are taken from UCI machine learning repository dataset as sample problems for performance analysis which shows that this method provides good performance for different types of problems and thus reduces the need for different types of methods for different types of problems.

The paper, computes 22 metrics using a tool developed in MATLAB. Website quality prediction is developed using statistical and some machine learning methods. The work has been validated using dataset collected from webby awards web site. The results are analyzed using Area Under the Curve (AUC) obtained from Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis. The results show that the model predicted using the random forest and Bayes Net methods outperformed over all the other models. Hence, based on these results it is reasonable to claim that quality models have a significant relevance with design metrics and the machine learning methods have a comparable performance with statistical methods. Univariate analysis results provide an empirical view for website design guidance and suggest which metrics are more important for website development.

The proper choice and number of predictors used for prediction of response variable plays an important role. Multicollinearity affects the model accuracy hence emphasis has to be made to keep it as low as possible. The coefficients of the regression equation are calculated by X-T X. In case of strong correlation amongst attributes it is difficult for software to calculate this term. In addition to all this the approach has to be pictorial or graphical in nature for better comprehensibility which is unique.

The problem is even more complex when considering that also the compiler requires some tuning, since standard optimization options have been customized for specific architectures or designed for the average case. This paper proposes a machine-learning approach for reducing the cost of the compiler autotuning phase and to speedup the application performance in embedded architectures. The proposed framework is based on an application characterization done dynamically with microarchitecture independent features and based on the usage of Bayesian Networks. The main characteristic of the Bayesian Network approach consists of not describing the solution as a strict set of compiler transformations to be applied, but as a complex probability distribution function to be sampled. Experimental results, carried out on an ARM platform and GCC transformation space, proved the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for the selected benchmarks. The selected set of solutions (less than 10% of the search space) demonstrated to be very close to the optimal sequence of transformations, showing also an applications performance speedup up to 2.8 (1.5 on average) with respect to -O2 and -O3 for the cBench suite. Additionally, the proposed method demonstrated a 3x speedup in terms of search time with respect to an iterative compilation approach, given the same quality of the solutions(1).

This encourages highway users to ride together, thus, in theory, more efficiently transporting people through the highway system. In order to be effective, however, adherence to the vehicle occupancy rules has to be enforced. Recent studies have shown that the traditional approach of dispatching traffic law enforcement officers to perform roadside visual inspections is not only expensive and dangerous, but also ineffective for managed lane enforcement. In this paper, we describe an image-based machine learning approach for automatic or semi-automatic vehicle occupancy detection. Our method localizes windshield regions by constructing an elastic deformation model from sets of uniquely defined landmark points along the front windshield. From the localized windshield region, the method calculates image-level feature representations, which are then applied to a trained classifier for classifying the vehicle into violator and non-violator classes.

In this paper, we present a traffic light recognition algorithm for varying illumination conditions using computer vision and machine learning. More specifically, a convolutional neural network is used to extract and detect features from visual camera images. To improve the recognition accuracy, an on-board GPS sensor is employed to identify the region-of-interest, in the visual image, that contains the traffic light. In addition, a saliency map containing the traffic light location is generated using the normal illumination recognition to assist the recognition under low illumination conditions. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on our data sets acquired in a variety of real world environments and compared with the performance of a baseline traffic signal recognition algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the high recognition accuracy of the proposed algorithm in varied illumination conditions.

Students describe their learning attitudes, tendencies and behaviors by writing their comments freely after each lesson. The main difficulty of this research is to predict students' performance by separately using two class data in each lesson. Although students learn the same subject, there exist differences between the comments in the two classes. The proposed methods basically employ latent semantic analysis (LSA) and two types of machine learning technique: SVM (support vector machine) and ANN (artificial neural network) for predicting students' final results in four grades of S, A, B and C. Moreover, an overlap method was proposed to improve the accuracy prediction results, the method allows to accept two grades for one mark to get the correct relation between LSA results and students' grades. The proposed methods achieve 50.7% and 48.7% prediction accuracy of students' grades by SVM and ANN, respectively. To this end, the results of this study reported models of students' academic performance predictors that are valuable sources of understanding students' behavior and giving feedback to them so that we can improve their learning activities.

A query often causes enormous consumption of endpoints' computing resources since it is sometimes difficult to understand and predict what computations will occur on the endpoints. Preventing such an execution of time-consuming queries, approximating the original query could reduce loads of endpoints. In this paper, we present a preliminary idea and its concept on building endpoints having a mechanism to automatically avoid unwanted amount of inference computation by predicting its computational costs and allowing it to transform such a query into speed optimized query. Our preliminary experiment shows a potential benefit on speed optimizations of query executions by applying query rewriting approach. We also present a preliminary prototype system that classifies whether a query execution is time-consuming or not by using machine learning techniques at the endpoint-side.

First we compare important utterance extraction by the scoring method and SVMs. In the machine learning technique, we introduce verbal features, such as relations between utterances and anaphora features, and nonverbal features. Next we generate a summary from the outputs of the scoring method and SVMs. In our approach, a basic summary consists of utterances with high confidence extracted from the scoring method. Utterances from SVMs are used as supplementary information. In the experiment, we compare a combination method and a method with only SVMs. The output of our method was suitable in terms of readability and correctness as a summary of original conversation.

Proper sampling and feature selection contributes to reducing the size of the dataset while obtaining satisfactory results in model building. Theoretically, therefore, it is interesting to investigate whether a given dataset possesses a critical feature dimension, or the minimum number of features that is required for a given learning machine to achieve "satisfactory" performance. (Likewise, the critical sampling size problem concerns whether, for a given dataset, there is a minimum number of data points that must be included in any sample for a learning machine to achieve satisfactory performance.) Here the specific meaning of "satisfactory" performance is to be defined by the user. This paper addresses the complexity of both problems in one general theoretical setting and shows that they have the same complexity and are highly intractable. Next, an empirical method is applied in an attempt to find the approximate critical feature dimension of datasets. It is demonstrated that, under generally reasonable assumptions pertaining to feature ranking algorithms, the critical feature dimension are successfully discovered by the empirical method for a number of datasets of various sizes. The results are encouraging in achieving significant feature size reduction and point to a promising way in dealing with big data. The significance of the existence of crucial dimension in datasets is also explained.

The proposed method is based on facial expression recognition since the emotional scenes can be detected by taking the facial expressions into consideration. Most of conventional facial expression recognition methods require a large amount of training data to construct a recognition model. Adopting such methods for large-scale video databases is unrealistic because preparing sufficient training data requires considerable human efforts. We introduce an unsupervised machine learning framework to solve this issue by making it possible to construct a facial expression recognition model without any training data set.

Emergence is global phenomena occurred by local mechanisms, such as, by collective behavior of autonomous agents. Understanding of emergence phenomena is a challenging subject. In this paper we use the framework of inductive logic programming (ILP) for artificial society and emergence behavior study. ILP is a branch of machine learning based on logic programming and inductive inference. We investigate the possibility of ILP in artificial society study. ILP and logic programming technique are applied to representation of an artificial society model, called Sugarscape, and to rule learning for agent behavior. Although classical ILP algorithms target classification problems, the proposed algorithm grows behavior rule for an evaluation measurement. Phenomena which this paper treate is limited but we showed that ILP technique can be applied to study in the field of artificial society.

Link adaptation and performance improvement is one of the approaches in cognitive radio. Cognitive radio improves the performance of the wireless link by applying intelligence machine learning techniques. Many machine learning techniques are used for cognitive radio performance improvement such as Game Theory, Rule Based Reasoning, Artificial Neural Networks, SVM, Genetic algorithm etc. In this paper an adaptive parameter adjustment technique based on genetic algorithm is going to be used. Under this approach bit error rate, power, bandwidth, data rate parameters are going to optimized to provide better performance. Even though many methods proposed for adaptation techniques they are very few real time implementation analyses. So this paper is going to implement link adaptation algorithm on Software Defined Radio (SDR) MIMO supported platform to study the performance of it in real time.	[Kumar, P. Vijaya; Sai, M.

Atherosclerosis is a condition where the arteries become narrowed and hardened due to an excessive build-up of plaque around artery wall. The growth of the disease is slow, asymptomatic, and may lead to abrupt cardiac arrest, stroke, or myocardial infarction. Currently imaging methods are applied, however they lack the required resolution and sensitivity for detection. In this work, clinical observations and habits of individuals are considered. Intelligent machine learning technique, multiclass SVM is used for assorting the individuals. A case study was made in this work regarding the atherosclerosis disease progression and crucial features were selected for effectuating the performance of the classifier. The state-of-the-art technique was enhanced with efficient pre-processing technique. Optimized missing value imputation strategy, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for STULONG dataset and efficient feature subset selection method, hybrid FCBF have been employed for extracting the relevant features and dismissing the redundant features. Further proceeding to intensify the target, our work has outperformed with utmost accuracy of about 98.97% compared with other state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.

Autoregressive model parameters as a feature set of texture image represent texture and used for synthesis. Yule walker Least Square (LS) method has used for parameter estimation. The test statistics for choice of proper neighbourhood (N) has also been suggested. The Brodatz texture image album has chosen for the experimentation. Parameters have estimated from the textures. The test statistics decides the best neighbourhood or proper order of the model. The synthesized texture image and the original texture image have compared for perceptual similarities. It is been inferred that the proper neighbourhood for a given texture is unique and solely depends on the properties of the texture.	[Vaishali, D.; Christaline, J.

The multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques are noteworthy to judge different alternatives on various criteria. In this paper, a simplified MCDM technique is applied to make a judgement on different alternatives (classifiers) among multiple criteria in financial risk datasets. For this purpose, the paired t-test statistical significance test and significant win-loss tables are used to determine the performance scores for each classifier. Then, the weights are determined using an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and finally simplified MCDM weighted sum model is applied to rank the classifiers. In addition, the efficiency of this simplified MCDM method is compared with other top MCDM methods such as TOPSIS, PROMETHEE and VIKOR to evaluate if there are any discrepancies in ranking. Analysis has been done for the three financial risk datasets from the UCI machine learning repository and surprisingly this simplified approach and the other top MCDM methods produce consistent rankings. Logistic regression and Bayesnet are ranked as the top two classifiers for financial risk datasets by this simplified approach and the other top MCDM methods. The simplified MCDM model can be applied to rank the classifiers which use simplified backgrounds in making right decisions among multiple criteria.

The unique structure is formed by folding of proteins from sequence of amino acids. In this paper, we have discussed about the proteins and its different types with their structures. Recently many computer algorithms are playing main role in the protein folding process. Every protein sequence have different types of folds and different energy levels. Energy levels are calculated from the Contacts between amino acid residues in different folding types. Machine learning techniques are used to fold proteins and predict the folding rates. Based on the sequence length, proteins are computed as short, medium and long range. Proteins sometimes incorrectly fold or unfold, many diseases will occur. Protein misfolding diseases are also briefed in this paper. Bio-inspired algorithms are mostly used for this problem compared to other algorithms.

Therefore, it is a necessary to summarize them. In this study, TM is used to analyze the vast amount of text produced in newspaper articles in Turkey. We mine unstructured economy news with natural language processing techniques including tokenization, transform cases, filtering stopwords and stemming. Similarity analysis is also used to determine similar documents. The word vector is extracted. Therefore, economy news is structured into numeric representations that summarize them. In addition, k-means clustering is used. Consequently, the clusters and similarities of the articles are obtained. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Modality is the expression of the speaker's (or the subject's) attitude towards the content of the sentences and may be marked with lexical clues such as verbs, adverbs, adjectives, but also by mood and tense. Here we focus exclusively on 9 verbal clues that are frequent in Portuguese and that may have more than one modal meaning. We use as our gold data set a corpus of 160.000 tokens manually annotated, according to a modality annotation scheme for Portuguese. We apply a machine learning approach to predict the modal meaning of a verb in context. This modality tagger takes into consideration all the features available from the parsed data (pos, syntactic and semantic). The results show that the tagger improved the baseline for all verbs, and reached macro-average F-measures between 35 and 81% depending on the modal verb and on the modal value.

This is the basis for a calibrated Structure from Motion (SfM) approach employing image triplets for complex, unordered image sets, e.g., obtained by combining terrestrial images and images from small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). Poor intersection geometry results from a small ratio between the baseline length and the depth of the scene. If there is no baseline between views, the intersection geometry becomes undefined. Our approach can detect image pairs without or with a very weak baseline (motion degeneracy). For the detection we have developed various metrics and evaluated them by means of extensive experiments with about 1500 image pairs. The metrics are based on properties of the reconstructed 3D points, such as the roundness of the error ellipsoid. The detection of weak baselines is formulated as a classification problem using the metrics as features. Machine learning techniques are applied to improve the classification. By taking into account the critical camera configurations during the iterative composition of the image set, a complete, metric 3D reconstruction of the whole scene could be achieved also in this case. We sketch our approach for the orientation of unordered image sets and finally demonstrate that the approach is able to produce very accurate and reliable orientations.

The new developed method allows both for exploring and ranking search spaces of image-based features, and selecting subsets of optimal features for feeding Machine Learning Classifiers (MLCs). The method was evaluated using six mammography-based datasets (containing calcifications and masses lesions) with different configurations extracted from two public Breast Cancer databases. According to the Wilcoxon Statistical Test, the proposed method demonstrated to provide competitive Breast Cancer classification schemes reducing the number of employed features for each experimental dataset.

In like manner, finding the best subset of good features is involved and difficult when the dataset has significantly large number of features (more than a thousand). In this paper we address the problem of feature selection for multi-label classification with large number of features. The proposed method is a hybrid of two phases - preliminary feature selection based on the information value and additional correlation-based selection. We show how with the first phase we can do preliminary selection of features from tens of thousands to couple of hundred, and then with the second phase we can make fine-grained feature selection with more sophisticated but computationally intensive methods. Finally, we analyze the ways of allocating the selected features to diverse subsets, which are suitable for training of ensembles of classifiers.

Multi-label classification problems require each instance to be assigned a subset of a defined set of h labels. This problem is equivalent to finding a multi-valued decision function that predicts a vector of h binary classes. In this paper we obtain the decision boundaries of two widely used Bayesian network approaches for building multi-label classifiers: Multi-label Bayesian network classifiers built using the binary relevance method and Bayesian network chain classifiers. We extend our previous single-label results to multi-label chain classifiers, and we prove that, as expected, chain classifiers provide a more expressive model than the binary relevance method.

Spear phishing is a complex targeted attack in which, an attacker harvests information about the victim prior to the attack. This information is then used to create sophisticated, genuine-looking attack vectors, drawing the victim to compromise confidential information. What makes spear phishing different, and more powerful than normal phishing, is this contextual information about the victim. Online social media services can be one such source for gathering vital information about an individual. In this paper, we characterize and examine a true positive dataset of spear phishing, spam, and normal phishing emails from Symantec's enterprise email scanning service. We then present a model to detect spear phishing emails sent to employees of 14 international organizations, by using social features extracted from LinkedIn. Our dataset consists of 4,742 targeted attack emails sent to 2,434 victims, and 9,353 non targeted attack emails sent to 5,912 non victims; and publicly available information from their LinkedIn profiles. We applied various machine learning algorithms to this labeled data, and achieved an overall maximum accuracy of 97.76% in identifying spear phishing emails. We used a combination of social features from LinkedIn profiles, and stylometric features extracted from email subjects, bodies, and attachments. However, we achieved a slightly better accuracy of 98.28% without the social features. Our analysis revealed that social features extracted from LinkedIn do not help in identifying spear phishing emails. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to make use of a combination of stylometric features extracted from emails, and social features extracted from an online social network to detect targeted spear phishing emails.

Unfortunately some molecules encoded by a same graph and differing only by the three dimensional orientation of their atoms in space have different properties. Such molecules are called stereoisomers. These latter properties can not be predicted by usual graph methods which do not encode stereoisomerism. In this paper we propose to encode the stereoisomerism property of each atom of a molecule by a local subgraph. A kernel between bags of such subgraphs provides a similarity measure incorporating stereoisomerism properties. We then propose two extensions of this kernel incorporating in each sub graph information about its surroundings.

In classification problems, the posterior probabilities reflect the uncertainty of assessing an example to particular class. Such residual information will be useful for more deep understanding or analysis of examples. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear discriminant analysis based on the probabilistic estimation of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). We use GMM to estimate the Bayesian a posterior probabilities of any classification problems. Then we use posterior probabilities estimated by GMM to construct discriminative kernel function. The performance of the proposed kernel function is confirmed by several experiments using UCI machine learning repository.

Two kinds of fusion schemes are generally considered: The early fusion and the late fusion. We focus on late classifier fusion, where one combines the scores of each modality at the decision level. To tackle this problem, we investigate a recent and elegant well-founded quadratic program named MinCq coming from the machine learning PAC-Bayesian theory. MinCq looks for the weighted combination, over a set of real-valued functions seen as voters, leading to the lowest misclassification rate, while maximizing the voters' diversity. We propose an extension of MinCq tailored to multimedia indexing. Our method is based on an order-preserving pairwise loss adapted to ranking that allows us to improve Mean Averaged Precision measure while taking into account the diversity of the voters that we want to fuse. We provide evidence that this method is naturally adapted to late fusion procedures and confirm the good behavior of our approach on the challenging PASCAL VOC'07 benchmark.

It is based on an optimisation method that minimises the cost of the correspondence while forcing it (to the most) to be a weighted mean. We tested our strategy comparing ourselves with the classical minimum cost matching system, using a palmprint database, with each palmprint is represented by an average of 1000 minutiae.

Afterward, based on the training results of the support vector machine (SVM) with the proposed vehicle feature extraction, the kernel function is found and employed in the classifier to find the real vehicles.

Imagery is a promising way to address this challenge, but the complexity of diverse organisms thwarts simple automated analysis. We consider the problem of automated annotation of complex communities of sessile marine invertebrates and macroalgae in order to automate percent coverage estimation. We propose an efficient fusion technique amongst diverse classifiers based on the idea of "dropout" in machine learning. We use dropout technique to weight each classifier implicitly and for each specie we optimize the size of the region of interest (ROI) for highest accuracy. The preliminary results are promising and show 20% increase in average accuracy (over 30 species) when compared with the best base performance of Random Forest classifiers.

This is insured by performing data anonymization as required by legislation. In this context, many different anonymization techniques have been proposed in the literature. These methods are usually specific to a particular de-anonymization procedure - or attack - one wants to avoid, and to a particular known set of characteristics that have to be preserved after the anonymization. They are difficult to use in a general context where attacks can be of different types, and where measures are not known to the anonymizer. The paper proposes a novel approach for automatically finding an anonymization procedure given a set of possible attacks and a set of measures to preserve. The approach is generic and based on machine learning techniques. It allows us to learn directly an anonymization function from a set of training data so as to optimize a tradeoff between privacy risk and utility loss. The algorithm thus allows one to get a good anonymization procedure for any kind of attacks, and any characteristic in a given set. Experiments made on two datasets show the effectiveness and the genericity of the approach.

Organizing the Web services into functionally similar clusters is one of a very efficient approach for reducing the search space. However, similarity calculation methods that are used in current approaches such as string-based, corpus-based, knowledge-based and hybrid methods have problems that include discovering semantic characteristics, loss of semantic information, encoding fine-grained information and shortage of high-quality ontologies. Because of these issues, the approaches couldn't identify the correct clusters for some services and placed them in wrong clusters. As a result of this, cluster performance is reduced. This paper proposes post-filtering approach to increase precision by rearranging services incorrectly clustered. Our approach uses context aware method that learns term similarity by machine learning under domain context. Experimental results show that our post-filtering approach works efficiently.

Expert-designed segmented scorecards fill this need. Building such models is a laborious data-guided task for experienced modelers. It can take weeks to hone a model for deployment. Lenders would like to design, update and test models, predictors and segmentation schemes more frequently, objectively and cost-effectively, as environments change fast and as new data emerge. We propose scorecard design as an automated analytic computing service used by domain experts, comprising data-driven machine learning with expert-imposed palatability restrictions and model visualization, in two stages: Stage I fits a tree ensemble model to render a best-fit score and a list of segmentation candidates. Stage II uses this information to generate optimal palatable segmented scorecards subject to restrictions provided by the experts. When implemented on a computer cluster, our process yields close to deployment-ready scorecards within minutes to hours, which can be rapidly honed and upon approval deployed into a separate scoring service. While motivated by transparency needs of credit scoring, such a service can be valuable for any application requiring highly predictive yet palatable scoring algorithms.

This fact is reflected specifically in the prediction of molecular functions such as catalytic and binding activities. This, along with the massive amount of information has made that tools based on machine learning techniques have increase their popularity in the last years. However, these tools are confronted to several problems associated to the treated data, one of them is the learning with large imbalance between their categories. There exist several techniques to overcomes the class imbalance, but most of them present many weakness that difficult the obtaining of reliable results. Moreover, models based on cost sensitive learning seems to be a good choice to deal with imbalance data, yet, the obtaining of a optimal cost matrix still remains an open issue. In this paper, a methodology to calculate a optimal cost matrix for models based on cost sensitive learning is proposed. The results show the superiority of this approach compared with several techniques in the state of the art regarding to class imbalance. Tests were applied to prediction of molecular functions in Embryophyta plants.

In this paper, we propose a new interactive registration-learning method to register functional fluorescence (IF) and structural histology (HE) images in a pyramidal fashion. We synthesize HE image from the multi-channel IF image using a supervised machine learning technique and hence reduce the multi-modality registration problem into a mono-modality one, in which case the normalised cross correlation is used as the similarity measure. Unlike conventional applications of supervised learning, our classifier is not trained by 'ground-truth' (perfectly-registered) training dataset, as they are not available. Instead, we use a relatively noisy training dataset (affinely-registered) as an initialization and rely on the robustness of machine learning to the outliers and label updates via pyramidal deformable registration to gain better learning and predictions. In this sense, the proposed methodology has potential to be adapted in other learning problems as the manual labelling is usually imprecise and very difficult in the case of heterogeneous tissues.

Sutton has presented with the Incremental Delta Bar Delta algorithm a versatile method for many tasks. However, this algorithm was formulated only for linear models. A straightforward generalization to nonlinear models is possible, but we show in this work that it poses some obstacles, namely the stability of the learning algorithm. We propose a new self-regulation of the model's activation which ensures stability. Our algorithm shows better performance than other approaches on a nonstationary benchmark task. Furthermore we show how to derive this algorithm from basic loss functions.

EIM has so far been applied to very few computational problems. We show that using a purpose-built hardware platform called Mecobo, it is possible to evolve voltages and signals applied to physical materials to solve machine learning classification problems. This is the first time that EIM has been applied to such problems. We evaluate the approach on two standard datasets: Lenses and Iris. Comparing our technique with a well-known software-based evolutionary method indicates that EIM performs reasonably well. We suggest that EIM offers a promising new direction for evolutionary computation.

The atherosclerotic process, mainly affecting the medium-and large-size arteries, is a degenerative condition that causes thickening and the reduction of elasticity in the blood vessels. The Intima-Media Thickness (IMT) of the Common Carotid Artery (CCA) is a reliable early indicator of atherosclerosis. Usually, it is manually measured by marking pairs of points on a B-mode ultrasound scan image of the CCA. This paper proposes an automatic image segmentation procedure for the measurement of the IMT, avoiding the user dependence and the inter-rater variability. In particular, Radial Basis Function (RBF) Networks are designed and trained by means of the Optimally Pruned-Extreme Learning Machine (OP-ELM) algorithm to classify pixels from a given ultrasound image, allowing the extraction of IMT boundaries. The suggested approach has been validated on a set of 25 ultrasound images by comparing the automatic segmentations with manual tracings.

The amount of database video instances to be annotated is huge, tedious manual labeling sessions are required, the multi-modal annotation needs exact information of space, time, and context, and the different labeling opportunities require special agreements between annotators, and alike. Crowd-sourcing with quality assurance by experts may come to the rescue here. We have developed a special tool: individual experts can annotate videos over the Internet, their work can be joined and filtered, the annotated material can be evaluated by machine learning methods, and automated annotation may start according to a predefined confidence level. A relatively small number of manually labeled instances may efficiently bootstrap the machine annotation procedure. We present the new mathematical concepts and algorithms for semi-supervised induction and the corresponding manual annotation tool which features special visualization methods for crowd-sourced users. A special feature is that the annotation tool is usable for users not familiar with machine learning methods; for example, we allow them to ignite and handle a complex bootstrapping process.

However, our means of transport evolve and we develop radically new says of transporting ourselves; thus new TMD sub-classification methods are needed to distinguish these new transport forms. As we transition from fossil-fueled cars to electric vehicles, switch to bikes with electric motors, ride in hybrid buses, or do city sightseeing on Segways, new challenges arise in distinguishing these from a mobile sensing perspective. Distinguishing electric vehicles (EVs) from fossil-fueled vehicles (FFVs) is a challenge, where traditional methods based on features such as GPS speed, or statistics on raw accelerometer data, are insufficient. In this paper, we present methods for distinguishing EVs from FFVs using smartphones with built-in inertial sensors, by reliably identifying idle-engine motor vibrations through features built on frequency analysis. We provide an extensive analysis of the challenges involved in making the EV/FFV distinction, as well as practical tools based on the methods. This includes analyzing the measurable similarities and differences between EVs and FFVs, and developing methods of reliably separating them. The presented tools implement the methods as classifiers built using machine learning. The analysis of our experiments shows that we can achieve an accuracy of 89-95% distinguishing EVs from FFVs, even with on-body phones.

In recent years, real-time analytics on stream data has formed into a new research field, which aims to answer queries about "what-is-happening-now" with a negligible delay. The real challenge with real-time stream data processing is that it is impossible to store instances of data, and therefore online analytical algorithms are utilized. To perform real-time analytics, pre-processing of data should be performed in a way that only a short summary of stream is stored in main memory. In addition, due to high speed of arrival, average processing time for each instance of data should be in such a way that incoming instances are not lost without being captured. Lastly, the learner needs to provide high analytical accuracy measures. Sentinel is a distributed system written in Java that aims to solve this challenge by enforcing both the processing and learning process to be done in distributed form. Sentinel is built on top of Apache Storm, a distributed computing platform.

Comparison of Machine Learning Methods for Estimating Energy Consumption in Buildings	2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PROBABILISTIC METHODS APPLIED TO POWER SYSTEMS (PMAPS)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Probabilistic Methods Applied to Power Systems (PMAPS)	JUL 07-10, 2014	Durham, ENGLAND			Energy prediction; Stochastic method; Artificial Neural Networks; Hidden Markov Models; Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines		The increasing number of decentralized renewable energy sources together with the grow in overall electricity consumption introduce many new challenges related to dimensioning of grid assets and supply-demand balancing. Approximately 40% of the total energy consumption is used to cover the needs of commercial and office buildings. To improve the design of the energy infrastructure and the efficient deployment of resources, new paradigms have to be thought up. Such new paradigms need automated methods to dynamically predict the energy consumption in buildings. At the same time these methods should be easily expandable to higher levels of aggregation such as neighborhoods and the power grid. Predicting energy consumption for a building is complex due to many influencing factors, such as weather conditions, performance and settings of heating and cooling systems, and the number of people present. In this paper, we investigate a newly developed stochastic model for time series prediction of energy consumption, namely the Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (CRBM), and evaluate its performance in the context of building automation systems. The assessment is made on a real dataset consisting of 7 weeks of hourly resolution electricity consumption collected from a Dutch office building. The results showed that for the energy prediction problem solved here, CRBM outperforms Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).

The framework of demand response (DR) to promote the reduction of electricity consumption in the household sector by regulating the price of the electricity will be introduced in the future. In this situation, residents must operate their appliances so as not to affect much to their lifestyles while taking into account the power cost. A home energy management system (HEMS) will have an essential role to control appliances such as air conditioners (ACs), battery energy storage systems (BESSs), electric vehicles (EVs), and heat pump water heaters (HPWHs) and automatically match their operations to the behavior of a resident when the electricity price changes. In this study, a Bayesian network, a fundamental tool of machine learning, is adapted to an HEMS to learn the behavior of the resident and appropriate operations of controllable appliances.

Knowledge discovery in data streams is valuable task for research, business and community. The fundamental step of knowledge discovery in data stream is the classification of the data streams in target classes. In this paper we have proposed classification mechanism for the data streams, conventional classification algorithm are of little significance in data streams due to the complex nature, unbounded memory requirements and concept drifting problem in data streams. The proposed method takes a novel approach towards the classification of the data streams through applying unsupervised classification techniques such as clustering followed by supervised classifier such as Support Vector Machine. The high volume data is sampled and reduced with Simple Aggregation and Approximation (SAX) Density based clustering algorithm DB Scan is applied on the data stream to reveal the number of classes present and subsequently label the data. Support vector Machine (SVM) is a well-known and proven supervised classification algorithm, SVM are applied to classify the label data. We tested our proposed method on the Intel Lab Data set, a data set of four environmental variables (Temperature, Voltage, Humidity, light) collected through 54 Mica2Dot sensors over 36 Days at per second rate. We have sampled the data stream in days and window of certain size n is trained on the SVM classifier. The algorithm is evaluated on different test size and average accuracy of 80% is obtained.

In this regard, a multi-transfer framework was proposed to keep context models adaptable in order to reduce the efforts in retraining context models in the event of an uncertainty. The framework is used to transfer knowledge from a source domain to a target one by reusing as much information from the source domain. This way, the efforts of training activity models for new users in the target domain can be effectively reduced. This paper presents one instantiation of the framework and its implementation details. The preliminary results show that the effort of training activity models for a new user can be effectively reduced meanwhile maintaining satisfactory performance.

Uncertainty representation mechanisms, such as rough set theory, or information processing paradigms like granular computing also lean upon well-defined similarity measures to better model the objects in the universe of discourse. In this information-laden world, the responsibility of designing these crucial granular constructs is shifting from domain experts to intelligent systems that automatically learn from data. An approach that hybridizes particle swarm optimization with elements from rough set theory has been recently proposed [1] to build these similarity measures from scratch. However, this scheme still remains fairly sensitive to the values of the similarity thresholds both in the input attribute space and the decision space. In this paper, we tackle this limitation by employing fuzzy sets to categorize the domain of both similarity thresholds. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is illustrated with the K-nearest neighbor classifier. Empirical results over several well-known repositories confirm that this approach preserves the classification accuracy while reducing the number of system parameters and enhancing its interpretability.

Kolmogorov complexity theory suggests that the best possible explanation for an object is represented by the shortest possible description of it. Two compression algorithms, COSIATEC and SIATECCOMPRESS, are described that take point-set representations of musical objects as input and generate compressed encodings of these point sets as output. The algorithms were evaluated on a task in which 360 folk songs were classified into tune families using normalized compression distance, a 1-nn classifier and leave-one-out cross-validation. COSIATEC achieved a success rate of 84% on this task, compared with a success rate of 13% for a general-purpose compressor. Variants of the algorithms incorporating modifications that have been suggested in the literature were also run on the task and the results were compared.

Such a prediction helps in allocating the resources appropriately and thus, reduces costs associated with software maintenance. But predicting the changes using the historical data (data of past releases) of the software is not always possible due to unavailability of data. Thus, it would be highly advantageous if we can train the model using the data from other projects rather than the same project. In this paper, we have performed cross project predictions using 12 datasets obtained from three open source Apache projects, Abdera, POI and Rave. In the study, cross project predictions include both the inter-project (different projects) and inter-version (different versions of same projects) predictions. For cross project predictions, we investigated whether the characteristics of the datasets are valuable for selecting the training set for a known testing set. We concluded that cross project predictions give high accuracy and the distributional characteristics of the datasets are extremely useful for selecting the appropriate training set. Besides this, within cross project predictions, we also examined the accuracy of inter-version predictions.

Eight flower categories were analyzed in order to extract their features. Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Segmentation-based Fractal Texture Analysis (SFTA) algorithms are used to extract flower features. The proposed approach consists of three phases namely: segmentation, feature extraction, and classification phases. In segmentation phase, the flower region is segmented to remove the complex background from the images dataset. Then flower image features are extracted. Finally for classification phase, the proposed approach applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forests (RF) algorithms to classify different kinds of flowers. An experiment was carried out using the proposed approach on a dataset of 215 flower images. It shows that Support Vector Machine (SVM) based algorithm provides better accuracy compared to the Random Forests (RF) algorithm when using the SIFT as a feature extraction algorithm. While, Random Forests (RF) algorithm provides its better accuracy with SFTA. Moreover, the system is capable of automatically recognize the flower name with a high degree of accuracy.

Traditionally, Naked eye observation is used to assess the quality of mango. Hence, there is a need to automate grading process. Image processing and machine learning provide one alternative for an automated, non-destructive and cost-effective grading. In this paper, proposed methodology is divided in two halves: First part discusses selecting healthy mangoes and then classifying it into ripe and unripe category. Second part talks about grading mangoes based on its size. The image database is used to analyze performance of CIELab colour space and to find colour ranges for different regions of mango. CIELab colour model with Dominant density range method is used for colour feature extraction which easily discriminate colour and classify healthy and diseased mangoes. Same method is used to classify Healthy mangoes in ripe and unripe category. Rest of work is devoted for size measure evaluation using fuzzy expert system for grading of mango. Size feature is calculated using ellipse properties in order to classify in different grades. At final stage, size feature is fed to fuzzy expert system for grading. Integration of whole system results 97.47% average accuracy.

Traditional data storage and processing techniques are ineffective in handling such huge data [10]. Many real life applications require iterative computations in general and in particular used in most of machine learning and data mining algorithms over large datasets, such as web link structures and social network graphs. MapReduce is a software framework for easily writing applications which process large amount of data (multi-terabyte) in parallel on large clusters (thousands of nodes) of commodity hardware. However, because of batch oriented processing of MapReduce we are unable to utilize the benefits of MapReduce in iterative computations. Our proposed work is mainly focused on optimizing three factors resulting in performance improvement of iterative algorithms in MapReduce environment. In this paper, we address the key issues based on execution of tasks, the unnecessary creation of new task in each iteration and excessive shuffling of data in each iteration. Our preliminary experiments have shown promising results over the basic MapReduce framework. The comparative study with existing solutions based on MapReduce framework like HaLoop, has also shown better performance w.r.t algorithm run time and amount of data traffic over Hadoop Cluster.

The most commonly occurring preposition errors are preposition replacement, preposition missing and unwanted preposition. So, in this method, a system is developed for finding and handling the English preposition errors in preposition replacement case. The proposed method applies 2-Singular Value Decomposition (SVD2) concept for data decomposition resulting in fast calculation and these features are given for classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier which obtains an overaU accuracy above 90%. Features are retrieved using novel SVD2 based method applied on trigrams which is having a preposition in the middle of the context. A matrix with the left and right vectors of each word in the trigram is computed for applying SVD2 concept and these features are used for supervised classification. Preliminary results show that this novel feature extraction and dimensionality reduction method is the appropriate method for handling preposition errors.

Nevertheless, there were researchers working in Machine Translation that deal with real time information for over 50 years since the first computer has come along. Merely, the need for translating data has become larger than before as the world was getting together through social media. Especially, translating proper nouns and technical terms has become openly challenging task in Machine Translation. The Machine transliteration was emerged as a part of information retrieval and machine translation projects to translate the Named Entities based on phoneme and grapheme, hence, those are not registered in the dictionary. Many researchers have used approaches such as conventional Graphical models and also adopted other machine translation techniques for Machine Transliteration. Machine Transliteration was always looked as a Machine Learning Problem. In this paper, we presented a new area of Machine Learning approach termed as a Deep Learning for improving the bilingual machine transliteration task for Tamil and English languages with limited corpus. This technique precedes Artificial Intelligence. The system is built on Deep Belief Network (DBN), a generative graphical model, which has been proved to work well with other Machine Learning problem. We have obtained 79.46% accuracy for English to Tamil transliteration task and 78.4 % for Tamil to English transliteration.

One of the most challenging issues in cluster analysis is the determination of true clusters. This challenge becomes more intriguing in case of hierarchical clustering techniques that requires dynamic termination of the clustering process at true conception of clusters. In this paper, a dynamic cut-off for hierarchical agglomerative clustering has been proposed which automatically terminates the clustering process once optimal number of clusters are obtained. The cut-off is based on the computation of validity index to assess the global proximity and local proximity of the clusters at every level of the hierarchy. The decision of optimality is rendered during the construction of the hierarchical tree. This eliminates the need for the computation of the complete tree. Experimental analyses on real datasets from UCI machine learning repository demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in detecting true clusters	[Bhargavi, M.

What made the study quite difficult was the non-stationary component of the signals along with a very low signal to noise ratio. Reduction in the noise content was achieved through a threshold technique based on Steins Unbiased Risk Estimate. To reduce the non-stationary content, the trend and seasonality components of the signals were examined and removed when necessary. This was done in accordance with the Classical Decomposition Theory. In order to find the best features to determine the calls of whales, wavelet packet decomposition technique was used using Daubechies 2 (db2) as mother wavelet. Wavelets were used as they provide a good frequency resolution over other formats like Fourier Transform. This led to the decomposition of the signals into separate filter banks whose energy contents were used as features. A backward sequential feature selection approach then found out the best subset of features to be used for classification. Two classification algorithms, Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes were used to classify the signals.

We first show the ability of a deep neural network to extract meaningful, low-dimensional features from high-dimensional laser-welding camera data. These features are then used by a temporal-difference learning algorithm to predict and anticipate important aspects of the system's sensor data. The third part of our proposed architecture suggests using these features and predictions to learn to deliver situation-appropriate welding power; preliminary control results are demonstrated using a laser-welding simulator. The intelligent laser-welding architecture introduced in this work has the capacity to improve its performance without further human assistance and therefore addresses key requirements of modern industry. To our knowledge, it is the first demonstrated combination of deep learning and Nexting with general value functions and also the first usage of deep learning for laser welding specifically and production engineering in general. This work also provides a unique example of how predictions can be explicitly learned using reinforcement learning to support laser welding.

One of the fundamental challenges is the selection of input variables, a problem reflected by the various set of predictors used in previous investigations; a situation that hinders the generalization of the methodology. This work attempts to establish a single optimum set. First, it evaluates the impact of using different methods to select input variables on the accuracy of their predictions and then performs statistical tests on their residuals to establish a selection criterion between sets. It discusses the findings and relates the similarities and differences to the high cross-correlation found in the set of candidates. Finally, it drafts recommendations for the development of a robust system. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The kernel internally applies a technique known as volatility homogenisation (VET). This technique decomposes a given time series into regular-sized movements in space (in this case, price). We show that this kernel, when used in conjunction with a kernel-technique such as support vector classification (SVC), can yield predictions of whether a time series will move up or down with an accuracy greater than simply using a standard kernel with the raw data. Furthermore, this kernel demonstrates a novel way of dealing with inputs to a kernel which are not equal in dimension while maintaining the property of a convex optimal solution for a technique such as SVC. Our results show a significant increase in prediction accuracy of up to eighteen percent when comparing the results of our VH kernels with standard kernels.

We perform the spectral analysis of the time series and compare two approaches to forecast the outbursts of this time series. Since the data contain missing values we do the missing values imputation as well. The outbursts occur regularly, but our analysis shows that they are not strictly periodic. Hence, to improve the forecast of outburst position we compare several machine learning techniques for the two main forecasting approaches. Our results show that each approach can be beneficial depending on the starting point of forecast.

The strategy has been tested in a number of simulations on historical data as well as data outside learning periods. Tests were performed mainly in the selected currency markets, including the primary currency pair of EURUSD. Presented approach opens long and short positions alternately during candle closing events. Closing a position is based on recommendation which is deduced from changes in characteristics of time series. The strategy has parameters that vary through time and are adapted to a market changes. To present the strategy a metaphor of an innovative artificial earthworm that feeds on a time series was used. The earthworm has its own artificial intelligence which enables it to analyse "consumed" candles, change its preferences about movement direction or to stay in neutral state. The goal was to implement presented strategy for trading platform to achieve the automatic trading effect. The strategy was tested in two development environments - MATLAB environment and trading platform MetaTrader after conversion of M-file into MQL4 file. Implemented strategy enables to achieve interesting results.

For the issue of collaborator selection is a key element of the success of applying the algorithm, the paper proposes a new method to select collaborators called Distance-based Collaborators Selection Algorithm (DBCCGA), which draws on the idea of classification in machine learning, two individuals are selected as reference individuals in each population, then evaluate individuals according to the distance of candidate individual and reference individuals by which evaluate operation is needed only once, a rule of getting individuals around the best individual is set to make the search more directional. The availability and validity of this algorithm are verified by experiments on the typical function optimization problem as well as on the Job Shop scheduling problem.

Much research has been performed to study the structures of RBM, such as sparsity and probabilistic distributions of hidden units. However, little attention has been paid to investigating the features of weight components that connect visible and hidden layers. In this paper, we formulate a nonparametric Bayesian RBM model, in the sense that Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) is imposed as a prior of weights. Thus, the original RBM is decomposed as a group-structured machine, where the groups are revealed by HDP. The clustering effect of HDP is helpful to simplify the structure of RBM and the hierarchical structure of our model is advantageous to maintain the diversity of weight components within each group. The Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm is adopted to perform weight training and hyperparameter estimation. Various experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed model.

Meta-cognition enables self-regulation and collaboration for effective learning and problem solving skills. Meta-cognition has been successfully applied in machine learning algorithms for providing better solutions. Taking an inspiration from this, we present a human meta-cognition inspired, population based collaborative search algorithm for optimization problems. In this algorithm, a group of people will move in a certain direction and choose an appropriate strategy for their new direction and position to lead them towards the optimum solution. The performance of the proposed HMICSO is evaluated using 4 benchmark test functions from the CEC2005 [23] competition. The performance is also compared with other existing search based optimization algorithms reported in the literature. The results clearly indicate better performance of HMICSO algorithm over other existing search based optimization algorithms.	[Tanweer, M.

Rule generation is an important part of Association rule mining. In this paper, a novel approach named ARAS (Association Rule Using Antecedent Support) has been proposed for rule generation that uses memory resident data structure named FCET (Frequent Closed Enumeration Tree) to find frequent/closed itemsets. In addition, the computational speed of ARAS is enhanced by giving importance to the rules that have lower antecedent support. Comparative performance evaluation of ARAS with fast association rule mining algorithm for rule generation has been done on synthetic datasets (generated by IBM Synthetic Data Generator) and real life datasets (taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository). Performance analysis shows that ARAS is computationally faster as compared to the existing algorithms for rule generation.

The ensemble classifier which consists of a number of basic classifiers is an efficient classification technique and has shown its effectiveness in many applications. The diversity and strength of the basic ones are two main elements which influence the performance of the ensemble classifier. Since different classification methods could capture the different discriminative information of the data by different classification criteria, using different classification techniques to build the basic ones could increase their diversity and strength. This paper proposes a new ensemble learning method which combines three different learning techniques to build the ensemble basic learners and adopts a double-layer voting method to enhance the strength and diversity of the basic ones, simultaneously. The new method is tested on six benchmark datasets from UCI machine learning repository. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the other ensemble techniques and single classifiers in the classification accuracy in most cases.

Among them, feature selection using positive approximation(FSPA) is an accelerator for traditional rough set based feature selection algorithms, which can significantly reduce the running time. However, FSPA still cannot handle large scale and high dimension dataset due to the memory constraints. In this paper, we propose a parallel implementation of FSPA using MapReduce framework, which is a programming model for processing large scale datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can process large scale and high dimension dataset efficiently on commodity computers.

The common strategy for these algorithms, e.g., Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), facilitates neighborhood relationships which can be constructed by knn or epsilon criterion. This paper presents a simple technique for constructing the nearest neighborhood by combining l(2) and l(1) norm. The proposed criterion, called Compressive Neighborhood Embedding (CNE), gives rise to a modified spectral manifold learning technique. The validated discriminating power of sparse representation has illuminated in [1], we additionally formulate the semi-supervised learning variation of CNE, SCNE for short, based on the proposed criterion to utilize both labeled and unlabeled data for inference on a graph.

Unfortunately, some of them don't know they have been contracted CKD until they need dialysis treatment at the end stage. Diagnosis through non-invasive ultrasonic imaging techniques become important clinical approaches for detecting CKD, and high potential or at-risk CKD patients could avoid being infected via blood test and/or reduce chances of abrupt deterioration in renal function by taking iodinated contrast medium. This research established a detection system based on computer vision and machine learning techniques for facilitating diagnosis of CKD and different stages of CKD. Novel features and support vector machine were applied for rapid detection. In this study, several evaluations on different clustered groups were performed and compared according to estimated glomerular filtration rates (GFR). In addition, the proposed system required 0.016 seconds in average for feature extraction and classification for each testing case. The results showed that the system could produce consistent diagnosis based on noninvasive ultrasonographic approaches and which could be considered as the most proper clinical diagnosis and medical treatment for CKD patients.

The main purpose of a network forensics system is reconstructing evidences of network attacks. In order to reconstruct evidence, the network attack is firstly identified. Therefore, network attack detection solutions play an important role in network forensics. There are two main types of network attacks: network level and application level. Network level attack detection solutions focus on the information in the headers of network packets.

Hadoop is the most popular open-source implementation of the MapReduce programming model. In Hadoop, input files are divided into many data blocks and these blocks are distributed over several nodes in cluster. To efficiently process the data blocks, Hadoop should provide an efficient scheduling mechanism for enhancing the performance of the system in a shared cluster environment. In Hadoop scheduling mainly caused by data locality issues due to limited network bandwidth. By introducing the scheduling issues with regarding to the data locality, this paper review different data locality aware scheduling algorithms that handling the data locality issues. In addition, this paper also evaluating their features, strength, weakness and provided some guidelines on how to improve further these scheduling algorithms.

Contourlet Transform (CT) offer a much richer set of directions and shapes, and it is more effective in capturing smooth contours and geometric structures in images. While dictionaries learned by machine learning methods can represent images more effectively. In this paper, we propose a multi-level adaptive dictionary learning (DL) strategy which combines both of the above advantages. We learn sub-dictionaries of high frequency of CT by an improved K-SVD algorithm, and moreover, the stopping criteria of sparse representation stage is associated with the iteratively updated dictionaries to get an adaptive sparse constraint, which gets more effective sparse representation coefficients and then improves the dictionary updating. This approach achieves a good reconstruction accuracy of the high frequency with less CS measurement. Experiment results demonstrate that the reconstructed images using dictionaries learned by the proposed algorithm in CS have better effect.

However, building a large dedicated cluster for MapReduce is not cost effective if the system is underutilized. To speedup the MapReduce computation with low cost, the computing resources donated from idle desktop/notebook computers in an organization become true potential. The MapReduce framework is then implemented into Volunteer Computing environment to allow such data processing tasks to be carried out on the unused computers. Virtualization technology is deployed to resolve the security and heterogeneity problem in Volunteer Computing so that the MapReduce jobs can always run under a unified runtime and isolated environment. This paper presents a Hadoop cluster that can be scaled into virtualized Volunteer Computing environment. The system consists of a small fixed set of dedicate nodes plus a variable number of volatile volunteer nodes which give additional computing power to the cluster. To this end, we consolidate Apache Hadoop, the most popular MapReduce implementation, with the virtualized BOINC platform. We evaluate the proposed system on our testbed with MapReduce benchmark that represents different workload patterns. The performance of the Hadoop cluster is measured when its computing capability is expanded with volunteer nodes. The results show that the system can be scaled preferably for CPU-intensive jobs, as opposed to data-intensive jobs which their scalability is more restricted.

Giving scientists access to more powerful tools for collecting and understanding data enables them to both ask and answer new kinds questions that were previously beyond their reach. Of these new tools at their disposal, machine learning offers the opportunity to understand and analyze data at unprecedented scales and levels of detail. The standard machine learning pipeline consists of data labeling, feature extraction, training, and evaluation. However, without expert machine learning knowledge, it is difficult for scientists to optimally construct this pipeline to fully leverage machine learning in their work. Using ecology as a motivating example, we analyze a typical scientist's data collection and processing workflow and highlight many problems facing practitioners when attempting to capitalize on advances in machine learning and pattern recognition. Understanding these shortcomings allows us to outline several novel and underexplored research directions. We end with recommendations to motivate progress in future cross-disciplinary work.

This framework allows us to elegantly integrate ontological constraints and machine learning classifiers in one formalism to construct high-level semantic interpretations that describe video activity. The unit of analysis is a generator that could represent either an ontological label as well as a group of features from a video. These generators are linked using bonds with different constraints. An interpretation of a video is a configuration of these connected generators, which results in a graph structure that is richer than conventional graphs used in computer vision. The quality of the interpretation is quantified by an energy function that is optimized using Markov Chain Monte Carlo based simulated annealing. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach over a purely machine learning based approach (SVM) using more than 650 video shots from the YouCook dataset. This dataset is very challenging in terms of complexity of background, presence of camera motion, object occlusion, clutter, and actor variability. We find significantly improved performance in nearly all cases. Our results show that the pattern theory inference process is able to construct the correct interpretation by leveraging the ontological constraints even when the machine learning classifier is poor and the most confident labels are wrong.

In this paper, we propose a new classifier ensemble framework, named as multi-view based Adaboost classifier ensemble framework (MV-ACE), which not only utilizes a random view generation technique to regulate different views and applies adaboost to adjust the training set, but also designs an adaptive process which explores the feasible combination of multiple views through an optimization process. Traditional multi-view learning focuses on exploring diverse views and the best integration of multiple views in a straight-forwardmanner, such as the linear combination of different views. Our proposed model, however, additionally applies a progressive training approach to improve the accuracies of the base classifiers. Moreover, we investigate the assembly of views at the model level, and employ an adaptive process to optimize the multi-view learning model to improve its performance. Our experiments on 12 cancer gene data sets for the classification task show that (i) MV-ACE works well on a diverse class of cancer gene expression profiles. (ii) It outperforms most of the state-of-the-art classifier ensemble approaches on these datasets.

It is noticeable that very few of these methods have explicitly addressed the dimensionality reduction along the time axis. This is however a major issue with regard to the use of elastic distances characterized by a quadratic complexity. To partially fill this apparent gap, we present in this paper an approach based on temporal down-sampling associated to elastic kernel machine learning. We experimentally show, on two data sets that are widely referenced in the domain of human gesture recognition, and very different in terms of quality of motion capture, that it is possible to significantly reduce the number of skeleton frames while maintaining a good recognition rate. The method proves to give satisfactory results at a level currently reached by state-of-the-art methods on these data sets. The computational complexity reduction makes this approach eligible for real-time applications.

The most particular case is activity-based modeling, whereby mobility choices (e.g. mode, path, and departure time) are made in order to carry out specific activities. A current challenge, however, lies on getting appropriate data that relates observed trips with their purpose. Recently, a Smartphone-based travel survey (the Future Mobility Survey, FMS) was conducted in Singapore that collected location data from 793 participants. Each FMS user was required to collect data for at least 14 days and validate at least 5 of them. This dataset presents diverse opportunities in terms of developing machine learning models for the future versions of FMS, where the validation process is intelligent and easy to use (e.g. having pre-filled activities associated to the user traces). This paper proposes a learning model that, given a stop location, identifies the most likely activity associated to it. Our data often contains errors or noise due to limited functionality of physical sensors in a dense area, and human mistakes in the validation process. To alleviate this effect, we generate heterogeneous features by different spatial quantization techniques and apply ensemble learning for a good generalization performance.

This task is most frequently tackled using machine learning methods that generalize across brains, by learning from training brain images in order to generalize to novel test brains. However this approach faces many obstacles that threaten its performance, such as the ability to properly perform multi-brain registration or brain-atlas alignment, or to extract appropriate high-dimensional features that support good generalization. These operations are both nontrivial and time-consuming, limiting the practicality of these approaches in a clinical context. In this paper, we propose to side step these issues by approaching the problem as one of within brain generalization. Specifically, we propose a semi-automatic method that segments a given brain by training and generalizing within that brain only, based on some minimum user interaction. We investigate how k nearest neighbors (kNN), arguably the simplest machine learning method available, combined with the simplest feature vector possible (raw MR signal + (x,y,z) position) can be combined into a method that is both simple, accurate and fast. Results obtained on the online BRATS dataset reveal that our method is fast and second best in terms of the complete and core test set tumor segmentation.

Their success, however, critically depends on the choice of kernel parameters. Using Gaussian process (GP) classification as a working example, this paper focuses on Bayesian inference of covariance (kernel) parameters using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The motivation is that, compared to standard optimization of kernel parameters, they have been systematically demonstrated to be superior in quantifying uncertainty in predictions. Recently, the Pseudo-Marginal MCMC approach has been proposed as a practical inference tool for GP models. In particular, it amounts in replacing the analytically intractable marginal likelihood by an unbiased estimate obtainable by approximate methods and importance sampling. After discussing the potential drawbacks in employing importance sampling, this paper proposes the application of annealed importance sampling. The results empirically demonstrate that compared to importance sampling, annealed importance sampling can reduce the variance of the estimate of the marginal likelihood exponentially in the number of data at a computational cost that scales only polynomially. The results on real data demonstrate that employing annealed importance sampling in the Pseudo-Marginal MCMC approach represents a step forward in the development of fully automated exact inference engines for GP models.

Computer science's research fields concerned by this domain are machine learning and graph theory. An interesting approach consists in using graph kernels which allow to combine graph theory and machine learning frameworks. Graph kernels allow to define a similarity measure between molecular graphs corresponding to a scalar product in some Hilbert space. Most of existing graph kernels proposed in chemoinformatics do not allow to explicitly encode cyclic information, hence limiting the efficiency of these approaches.

This problem is relevant for multi-dimensional scaling problems with missing data, and is applicable within anchor-free sensor network node calibration and anchor-free node localization using radio or sound TOA measurements. There are also applications within chemistry for deducing molecular 3D structure given inter-atom distance measurements and within machine learning and visualization of data, where only similarity measures between sample points are provided. The problem has been studied previously within the field of rigid graph theory. Our aim is here to construct numerically stable and efficient solvers for finding all embeddings of such minimal rigid graphs. The method is based on the observation that all graphs are either irreducibly rigid, here called prime rigid graphs, or contain smaller rigid graphs. By solving the embedding problem for the prime rigid graphs and for ways of assembling such graphs to other minimal rigid graphs, we show how to (i) calculate the number of embeddings and (ii) construct numerically stable and efficient algorithms for obtaining all embeddings given inter-node measurements. The solvers are verified with experiments on simulated data.

Classification algorithms developed with data from one domain cannot be directly used in another related domain, unless the data representation or the classifier have been adapted to the new data distribution. This is crucial in satellite/airborne image analysis: when confronted to domain shifts issued from changes in acquisition or illumination conditions, image classifiers tend to become inaccurate. In this paper, we introduce a method to align data manifolds that represent the same land cover classes, but have undergone spectral distortions. The proposed method relies on a semi-supervised manifold alignment technique and relaxes the requirement of labeled data in all domains by exploiting centrality measures over graphs to match the manifolds. Experiments on multispectral pixel classification at very high spatial resolution show the potential of the method.

For this purpose, we perform a manifold embedding for each person in the training dataset and then learn a linear transformation that aligns the individual, person-dependent manifolds. We evaluate the effect of manifold alignment on the recently presented Columbia dataset, where we analyze the influence on 6 regression methods and 8 feature variants. Using manifold alignment, we are able to improve the person-independent gaze estimation performance by up to 31.2% compared to the best approach without manifold alignment.

One of the most popular approaches in cluster analysis is the one based on the parametric finite mixture model. However, often, parametric models are not well adapted to represent complex and realistic data sets. Another issue in the finite mixture model-based clustering approach is the one of selecting the number of mixture components. The Bayesian non-parametric statistical methods for clustering provide a principled way to overcome these issues. This paper proposes a new Bayesian non-parametric approach for clustering. It relies on an Infinite Gaussian mixture model with an eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix of each cluster, and a Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) prior over the hidden partition. The CRP prior allows to control the model complexity in a principled way, and to automatically learn the number of clusters from the data. The covariance matrix decomposition allows to fit various flexible models going from simplest spherical ones to the more complex general one. We develop a Gibbs sampler to learn the various models and apply it to simulated data and benchmarks, and a real-world data issued from a challenging problem of whale song decomposition. The obtained results highlight the interest of the proposed non-parametric parsimonious mixture model for clustering.

Specific domain knowledge can help design some features, but it often needs a long time to hand-craft them. On the other hand, unsupervised learning can automatically learn a good representation of either labeled or unlabeled data. Currently one of the dominant approaches is the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). In this paper, we investigate an alternative approach for feature learning, which is based on Bayesian linear regression model. This model can also be denoted as Factor analysis, which is a statistical method for modeling the covariance structure of high dimensional data, but has not been used for feature learning. We will compare the proposed framework with RBM on different kinds of computer vision applications. Experiment results on different datasets are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature learning framework.

Most of the existing methods focus on modeling the similarity/dissimilarity relationship among instances, such as k-means and spectral clustering, and ignore to extract more effective representation for clustering. In this paper, we propose a deep embedding network for representation learning, which is more beneficial for clustering by considering two constraints on learned representations. We first utilize a deep autoencoder to learn the reduced representations from the raw data. To make the learned representations suitable for clustering, we first impose a locality-persevering constraint on the learned representations, which aims to embed original data into its underlying manifold space. Then, different from spectral clustering which extracts representations from the block diagonal similarity matrix, we apply a group sparsity constraint for the learned representations, and aim to learn block diagonal representations in which the nonzero groups correspond to its cluster. After obtaining the learned representations, we use k-means to cluster them. To evaluate the proposed deep embedding network, we compare its performance with k-means and spectral clustering on three commonly-used datasets. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves promising performance.

Recently, with the emerging and development of structured sparsity, signals can be recovered more accurately. However, solving structured sparsity problems often involves much higher computational complexity. Few of existing works can reduce the computational complexity of such problems. Especially for overlapping group sparsity, the computational complexity for each entry is linear to the degree of overlapping, making it infeasible for large-scale problems. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms to efficiently address this issue, where the computational complexity for each entry is always O(1) and independent to the degree of overlapping. Experiments on 1D signal and 2D image demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods. This work may inspire more scalable algorithms for structured sparsity.

These images, whether gray-level, RGB, or depth, have a human-readable 2D structure which describes the spatial distribution of the scene. In this paper, we explore the possibility to use distributed color sensors to infer high level information, such as room occupancy. Unlike a camera, the output of a color sensor has only a few variables. However, if the light in the room is color controllable, we can use the outputs of multiple color sensors under different lighting conditions to recover the light transport model (LTM) in the room. While the room occupancy changes, the LTM also changes accordingly, and we can use machine learning to establish the mapping from LTM to room occupancy.

Some special tasks, such as automatic check preprocessing, require Handwritten Chinese Legal Amounts recognition as a prerequisite. Since we expect to utilize machine instead of human to process bank checks, the recognition rate in such task must reach a relatively high rate. This paper proposes to use deep learning, auto-encoder as an effective approach for obtaining hierarchical representations of Isolated Handwritten Chinese Legal Amounts. Experiments show such representations are highly abstractive and can be used in character recognition. Meanwhile, a novel way by combining multiple Neural Networks in doing the work is proposed which proves to be able to improve the recognition rate significantly. This method reports a 0.64% error rate on a large test set over 10,000 samples and outperforms traditional methods using hand-crafted features and convolutional neural network committees (another deep learning model), narrowing the gap to human performance.

This paper presents an adaptation of Random Forest to the structure-based protein function prediction. Our system represents protein's 3D physicochemical structural information in microenvironment descriptors whose spatial resolution is much finer than other sequence-based protein descriptors. We prepare our datasets for seven active sites from five protein function classes by using multiple public data banks and train Random Forest classifiers to identify these seven function models in proteins. This paper presents two experiment studies: 1) a 5-fold stratified cross-validation for comparing Random Forest with Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine and 2) systematic comparison of Random Forest's two variable importance measures. Promising results of these studies demonstrate a potential for Random Forest to improve the accuracy of the current protein function assays.

Many heuristic algorithms have been proposed for staff removal and recently a competition was organized in the 2013 ICDAR/GREC conference. Music score images are often subject to different deformations and variations, and existing algorithms do not work well for all cases. We investigate the application of a machine learning based method for the staff removal problem. The method consists in learning multiple image operators from training input-output pairs of images and then combining the results of these operators. Each operator is based on local information provided by a neighborhood window, which is usually manually chosen based on the content of the images. We propose a feature selection based approach for automatically defining the windows and also for combining the operators.

To remedy this, a crude but common approach is to approximate all tissue properties as equivalent to those of water. We improve upon this using an algorithm that automatically identifies bone tissue in MR. More specifically; we focus on segmenting the skull prior to stereotactic neurosurgery, where it is common that only MR images are available. In the proposed approach, a machine learning algorithm known as a support vector machine is trained on patients for which both a CT and an MR scan are available. As input, a combination of local and global information is used. The latter is needed to distinguish between bone and air as this is not possible based only on the local image intensity. A whole skull segmentation is achievable in minutes. In a comparison with two other methods, one based on mathematical morphology and the other on deformable registration, the proposed method was found to yield consistently better segmentations.

The type of microscopy is one of the considerations in the trade-offs between experimental setup, image acquisition speed, molecular labelling, resolution and quality of images. In many cases, phase contrast imaging gets higher weights in this optimization. And it comes at the price of reduced image quality in imaging 3D cell cultures. For such data, the existing state-of-the-art computer vision methods perform poorly in segmenting specific cell type. Low SNR, clutter and occlusions are basic challenges for blind segmentation approaches. In this study we propose an automated method, based on a learning framework, for detecting particular cell type in cluttered 2D phase contrast images of 3D cell cultures that overcomes those challenges. It depends on local features defined over superpixels. The method learns appearance based features, statistical features, textural features and their combinations. Also, the importance of each feature is measured by employing Random Forest classifier. Experiments show that our approach does not depend on training data and the parameters.

These methods have been especially successful in the area of computer vision. However, there is a problem that it is difficult to determine what kind of features will result in a high classification performance. Indeed, the difficulty of determining the learning parameters is a widely known problem in the field of feature learning. To address this problem, this paper presents a feature-learning method which uses classification results to progressively learn multiple features of varied complexity. The proposed method enables the learning of both simple robust features and complex features which represents difficult patterns. In addition, we assign regularization weights that are based on the complexity of the features. This modification emphasizes simple representation and prevents overfitting. Experimental results with medical image classification show that the proposed method is superior to the conventional method, especially when classification is difficult.

In this paper we propose a new type of auto-encoder coined label-denoising auto-encoder to learn a representation for robust classification under this situation. For this purpose, we include both the feature and the (noisy) label of a data point in the input layer of the auto-encoder network, and during each learning iteration, we disturb the label according to the posterior probability of the data estimated by a softmax regression classifier. The learnt representation is shown to be robust against label noise on three real-world data-sets.

This paper provides a survey of current researches on Intrusive Load Monitoring (ILM) techniques. ILM relies on low-end electricity meter devices spread inside the habitations, as opposed to Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) that relies on an unique point of measurement, the smart meter. Potential applications and principles of ILMs are presented and compared to NILM. A focus is also given on feature extraction and machine learning algorithms typically used for ILM applications.

The similarity between two binary codes is measured by their Hamming distance. In this method, a hash table is often used for realizing the constant time similarity search. The number of accesses to the hash table, however, increases when the number of bits becomes long. In this paper, we consider the method that does not access the data with long Hamming radius by using multiple binary codes. Then, we propose the learning method of the binary hash functions for multiple binary codes. We conduct the experiment on similarity search utilizing up to 20 million data set, and show that our proposed method achieves a fast similarity search compared with the conventional linear scan and hash table search.

Given a graph whose nodes represent the points and the weighted edges the relations between them, the goal is to predict the values of all unlabeled nodes exploiting the information provided by both label and unlabeled nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based approach for semi-supervised binary classification. The algorithm extends the Fisher Subspace estimation approaches by adopting a kernel graph covariance measure. This similarity measure defines a relation between nodes generalizing both the shortest path and the commute time distance. This quantity is called the sum-over-paths covariance. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets highlight that the proposed algorithm achieves better results with respect to those obtained by state-of-the-art competitors.

The classical Support Vector Machines is heavily relied on the Support Vector which has neglected the holistic distribution of the data that sometimes will lead to gross errors. We first take use of the majority of the data distribution. Then we apply the distance between the two classes and modify the original SVM objective function. In the last step we search the best weights to make a balance between the distance and the maximum margin. We developed an improved method for optimizing over the SVM algorithm. Experiments on 10 famous data sets clearly demonstrate improved performance and this method is also readily applicable for data sets with different distribution.

We combine Gaussian derivatives with Local Binary Patterns to provide a robust and powerful descriptor especially suited to extracting texture from facial images. Gaussian features in the form of image derivatives form the input to the Linear Binary Pattern(LBP) operator instead of the original image. The proposed descriptor is tested for face recognition and smile detection. For face recognition we use the CMU-PIE and the YaleB+extended YaleB database. Smile detection is performed on the benchmark GENKI 4k database. With minimal machine learning our descriptor outperforms the state of the art at smile detection and compares favourably with the state of the art at face recognition.

Recently the impressive breakthrough in general object recognition made by large scale convolutional networks shows that convolutional networks are able to extract discriminative hierarchical features in large scale object classification task. However, for vision tasks other than end-to-end classification, such as K Nearest Neighbor classification, the learned intermediate features are not necessary optimal for the specific problem. In this paper, we aim to exploit the power of deep convolutional networks and optimize the output feature layer with respect to the task of K Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classification. By directly optimizing the kNN classification error on training data, we in fact learn convolutional nonlinear features in a data-driven and task-driven way. Experimental results on standard image classificatioin benchmarks show that the proposed method is able to learn better feature representations than other general end-to-end classification methods on kNN classification task.

SN aims to extract anisotropic features from an image in order to efficiently capture the facial geometry (shearface); MTSL is used to exploit the relationships among multiple shared tasks generated by changing the regularization parameter to make the optimization convex. We compare our algorithm, called Sparse Multi-Regularized Shearlet Network (SMRSN), against different state-of-the-art methods on different experimental protocols with AR, ORL, LFW, FERET, FRGC v1 and Lab2 databases. Our tests show that the SMRSN approach yields a very competitive performance and outperforms several standard methods of FR.

The existing frameworks employed back-propagated error as a performance criteria (or termed, object function) aiming for supervising model-learning. Inspired by the recent success achieved by learning with the privileged information (LPI), we propose a novel regression-based framework by extending the concept of back-propagation in supervised learning methods to high-level guiding the model learning, so the proposed model is able to mine the importance of samples contributed to the fitting performance, which is missed in the existing regression techniques. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed learning paradigm, both low-level imagery features and intermediary semantic attributes are adopted in this paper. Extensive evaluations on pedestrian counting with public UCSD and Mall benchmarks demonstrate that the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

In this work, we have applied them to pair-wise language recognition tasks. The proposed systems have been evaluated on challenging pairs of languages from NIST LRE' 09 dataset. Results have been compared with two spectral systems based on Factor Analysis and Total Variability (i-vector) strategies, respectively. Moreover, a simple fusion of the developed approaches and the reference systems has been performed. Some individual and fusion systems outperform the reference systems, obtaining similar to 17% of relative improvement in terms of minC(DET) for one of the challenging pairs.

However, not many works have addressed the robustness of these systems under noisy conditions. Recently, the machine learning community has proposed new methods to improve the accuracy of DNNs by using techniques such as dropout and maxout. In this paper, we investigate Deep Maxout Networks (DMN) for acoustic modeling in a noisy automatic speech recognition environment. Experiments show that DMNs improve substantially the recognition accuracy over DNNs and other traditional techniques in both clean and noisy conditions on the TIMIT dataset.

In this work, we present an approach to automate the segmentation of subtitles through machine learning techniques, allowing the creation of customized models adapted to the specific segmentation rules of subtitling companies. Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression classifiers were trained over a reference corpus of subtitles manually created by professionals and used to segment the output of speech recognition engines. We describe the performance of both classifiers and discuss the merits of the approach for the automatic segmentation of subtitles.

ESA was developed in close collaboration with users to ensure fitness-for-purpose for the tasks performed by emergency services agencies. ESA processes large volumes of Twitter data and identifies discussion threads, trends and hot topics using language models. A burst detector generates alerts for unusually high frequency words that are filtered using text mining techniques and machine learning algorithms to identify Tweets of interest to emergency managers. An overview of the ESA platform is presented along with example case studies of its use to detect earthquakes, identify bushfire events and provide all-hazard monitoring in a crisis coordination centre.

When no satisfactory tagset already exists, such as in under-resourced or undocumented languages, it must be developed iteratively while annotating data. This process naturally gives rise to a sequence of datasets, each annotated differently. We argue that this problem is best regarded as a transfer learning problem with multiple source tasks. Using part-of-speech tagging data with simulated exploratory tagsets, we demonstrate that even simple transfer learning techniques can significantly improve the quality of pre-annotations in an exploratory annotation.

Many researchers have applied ML to readability prediction for English, while Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) has received little attention. Here I describe a system which leverages ML to automatically predict the readability of MSA. I gathered a corpus comprising 179 documents that were annotated with the Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) levels. Then, I extracted lexical and discourse features from each document. Finally, I applied the Tilburg Memory-Based Learning (TiMBL) program to read these features and predict the ILR level of each document using 10-fold cross validation for both 3-way and 5-way classification tasks. I measured performance using the F-score. For 3-way and 5-way classifications my system achieved F-scores of 0.719 and 0.519 respectively. I discuss the implication of these results and the possibility of future development.

One of the steps towards alleviating this problem is concept extraction. In this work, we proposed a machine learning-based named entity recognition system to extract clinical concepts from patient discharge summaries and progress notes without the need for any external knowledge resources. Three pre- and post-processing methods were investigated, i.e. truecasing, abbreviation disambiguation, and distributional thesaurus lookup, the individual annotation results of which were combined into a final annotation set using two refinement schemes. While truecasing and abbreviation disambiguation capture the inflectional morphology of words, the distributional thesaurus lookup allows for statistics-based similarity matching. We achieved a maximum F-score of 0.7586 and 0.8444 for exact and inexact matching, respectively.

Twitter, specifically, has flourished to several hundred million users and could present a rich information source for the detection of serious medical conditions, like adverse drug reactions (ADRs). However, Twitter also presents unique challenges due to brevity, lack of structure, and informal language. We present a freely available, manually annotated corpus of 10,822 tweets, which can be used to train automated tools to mine Twitter for ADRs. We collected tweets utilizing drug names as keywords, but expanding them by applying an algorithm to generate misspelled versions of the drug names for maximum coverage. We annotated each tweet for the presence of a mention of an ADR, and for those that had one, annotated the mention (including span and UMLS IDs of the ADRs). Our inter-annotator agreement for the binary classification had a Kappa value of 0.69, which may be considered substantial (Viera & Garrett, 2005). We evaluated the utility of the corpus by training two classes of machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines. The results we present validate the usefulness of the corpus for automated mining tasks. The classification corpus is available from http://diego.asu.edu/downloads.

The language addressed is Modern Greek, one of the not widely spoken and not-richly-equipped-with-resources languages. The population of the ontology is achieved through collaborative crowdsourcing, i.e. players annotate ad video content through a multi-player videogame, implemented especially for this purpose. The provided annotations concern the ad content, its production values, its impact, and they constitute the ontology terms and concepts. Dependencies, correlations, statistical information and knowledge governing the ontology terms and concepts are to be revealed through data mining and machine learning techniques. The extracted knowledge constitutes the core of a support tool, i.e. a semantic thesaurus, which will help ad designers in the brainstorming process of creating a new ad campaign. Unlike existing creativity support models, that are static and depend on expert knowledge, thereby hurting creativity, the proposed support tool is generic in nature (as it is based on a collaborative crowdsourcing-based semantic thesaurus), dynamic and minimally restricting the brainstorming process.

To mine this big data, a critical ability is to enable meaningful question answering beyond keywords search. In this paper, we present a study on the characteristics and classification of IBM sales questions. The characteristics are analyzed both semantically and syntactically, from where a question classification guideline evolves. We adopted an enterprise level expert sourcing approach to gather questions, annotate questions based on the guideline and manage the quality of annotations via enhanced inter-annotator agreement analysis. We developed a question feature extraction system and experimented with rule-based, statistical and hybrid question classifiers. We share our annotated corpus of questions and report our experimental results. Statistical classifiers separately based on n-grams and hand-crafted rule features give reasonable macro-f1 scores at 61.7% and 63.1% respectively. Rule based classifier gives a macro-f1 at 77.1%. The hybrid classifier with n-gram and rule features using a second guess model further improves the macro-f1 to 83.9%.

It focuses on Danish as a low-resourced language and aims at increasing the level of technological resources available for the Danish HLT community. A primary project goal is to provide semantically annotated text corpora of Danish following agreed standards and to let these serve as training data for advanced machine learning algorithms which will address data scarcity and domain adaptation as central problem areas. The Danish CLARIN Reference Corpus - supplemented by a selection of additional text types from social media and the web - are being sense and role annotated. We experiment with an adaptation of PropBank roles to Danish as well as with a scalable sense inventory of Danish. This inventory spans from supersense annotations (semantic classes) to wordnet-derived sense annotations which rely on a distinction between ontological types and main and subsenses. The annotation tool WebAnno, which is being developed as part of the German CLARIN project, is applied for the annotation task.

As we are currently lacking a suitable resource with detailed modal information for Portuguese, we experiment with small sample of 160.000 tokens, manually annotated according to the modality scheme that we previously developed for European Portuguese (Hendrickx et al., 2012). We consider modality as the expression of the speaker (or subject)' s attitude towards the proposition and our modality scheme accounts for seven major modal values, and nine sub values. This experiment focuses on three modal verbs, poder 'may/can', dever 'shall/might' and conseguir 'manage to/ succeed in/ be able to', which may all have more than one modal value. We first report on the task of correctly detecting the modal uses of poder and dever, since these two verbs may have non modal meanings. For the identification of the modal value of each occurrence of those three verbs, we applied a machine learning approach that takes into consideration all the features available from a syntactic parser's output. We obtained the best performance using SVM with a string kernel and the system improved the baseline for all three verbs, with a maximum F-score of 76.2.

The approach is based on firstly, a language-independent machine learning algorithm, Maximum Affix Overlap, that generates candidates for morphological decompositions from an initial set of language-specific training data; and secondly, language-dependent post-processing using language specific patterns. In this paper, the Maximum Affix Overlap algorithm is applied to Zulu, a morphologically complex Bantu language. It can be assumed that the algorithm will work for other Bantu languages and possibly other language families as well. With limited training data and a ranking adapted to the language family, the effort for manual verification can be strongly reduced. The machine generated list is manually verified by humans via a web frontend.

A possible remedy of this problem is to apply distant supervision (DS) approaches, which learn from large amounts of automatically annotated data. In this research, we explore DS for SSA on Arabic Twitter feeds using emoticons as noisy labels. We achieve 95.19% accuracy, which is a 48.57% absolute improvement over our previous fully supervised results. While our results show a significant gain in detecting subjectivity, this approach proves to be difficult for sentiment analysis. An error analysis suggests that the most likely cause for this shortcoming is the unclear facing of emoticons due to the right-to-left direction of the Arabic alphabet.

The difficulty of resolving these ambiguities is mitigated for statistical machine translation systems for language pairs with large bilingual corpora, as large n-gram language models and phrase tables containing common multi-word expressions can encourage coherent word choices. For most language pairs these resources are not available, so a primarily rule-based approach becomes attractive. In cases where some training data is available, though, we can investigate hybrid RBMT and machine learning approaches, leveraging small and potentially growing bilingual corpora. In this paper we describe the integration of statistical cross-lingual word-sense disambiguation software with SQUOIA, an existing rule-based MT system for the Spanish-Quechua language pair, and show how it allows us to learn from the available bitext to make better lexical choices, with very few code changes to the base system. We also describe Chipa, the new open source CL-WSD software used for these experiments.

Manual extraction of arguments is a non-trivial task and requires extensive training and expertise. We investigated several possibilities to support this process by using natural language processing (NLP), from classifying pieces of text as either argumentative or non-argumentative to clustering answers to policy green paper questions in the hope that these clusters would contain similar arguments. Results are diverse, but also show that we cannot come a long way without an extensive pre-tagged corpus.

However, installing, maintaining, and running NLP tools can be time consuming, and many commercial and research end users have only intermittent need for large processing capacity. This paper describes ILLINOISCLOUDNLP, an on-demand framework built around NLPCURATOR and Amazon Web Services' Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). This framework provides a simple interface to end users via which they can deploy one or more NLPCURATOR instances on EC2, upload plain text documents, specify a set of Text Analytics tools (NLP annotations) to apply, and process and store or download the processed data. It also allows end users to use a model trained on their own data: ILLINOISCLOUDNLP takes care of training, hosting, and applying it to new data just as it does with existing models within NLPCURATOR. As a representative use case, we describe our use of ILLINOISCLOUDNLP to process 3 : 0 5 million documents used in the 2012 and 2013 Text Analysis Conference Knowledge Base Population tasks at a relatively deep level of processing, in approximately 20 hours, at an approximate cost of US$500; this is about 20 times faster than doing so on a single server and requires no human supervision and no NLP or Machine Learning expertise.

In particular it is shown how supervised machine learning was used to annotate a Twitter dataset (London Riots) with argumentation classes. An investigation of issues arising from a natural inconsistency within social media data found that machine learning algorithms tend to overfit to the data because Twitter contains a lot of repetition in the form of retweets. It is also noted that when learning argumentation classes we must be aware that the classes will most likely be of very different sizes and this must be kept in mind when analysing the results. Encouraging results were found in adapting a model from one domain of Twitter data (London Riots) to another (OR2012). When adapting a model to another dataset the most useful feature was punctuation. It is probable that the nature of punctuation in Twitter language, the very specific use in links, indicates argumentation class.

Beyond scientific aspects, creating and managing such annotated data sets is a recurrent problem. While using human annotators is obviously expensive in time and money, relying on automatic annotation processes is not a simple solution neither. Typically, the high diversity of annotation tools and of data formats, as well as the lack of efficient middleware to interface them all together, make such processes very complex and painful to design. To circumvent this problem, this paper presents the toolkit ROOTS, a freshly released open source toolkit (http://roots-toolkit.gforge.inria.fr) for easy, fast and consistent management of heterogeneously annotated data. ROOTS is designed to efficiently handle massive complex sequential data and to allow quick and light prototyping, as this is often required for research purposes. To illustrate these properties, three sample applications are presented in the field of speech and language processing, though ROOTS can more generally be easily extended to other application domains.

We present the annotation process, and report statistical data on the frequency of LVCs in each language. We also offer inter-annotator agreement rates and we highlight some interesting facts and tendencies on the basis of comparing multilingual data from the four corpora. According to the frequency of LVC categories and the calculated Kendalls coefficient for the four corpora, we found that Spanish and German are very similar to each other, Hungarian is also similar to both, but German differs from all these three. The qualitative and quantitative data analysis might prove useful in theoretical linguistic research for all the four languages. Moreover, the corpus will be an excellent testbed for the development and evaluation of machine learning based methods aiming at extracting or identifying light verb constructions in these four languages.

For the compilation, we use the German Reference Corpus (DeReKo) with more than 5 billion word forms, which is the largest linguistic resource worldwide for the study of contemporary written German. The result is a comprehensive database of German genitive formations, enriched with a broad range of intra- und extralinguistic metadata. It can be used for the notoriously controversial classification and prediction of genitive endings (short endings, long endings, zero-marker). We also evaluate the main factors influencing the use of specific endings. To get a general idea about a factor's influences and its side effects, we calculate chi-square-tests and visualize the residuals with an association plot. The results are evaluated against a gold standard by implementing tree-based machine learning algorithms. For the statistical analysis, we applied the supervised LMT Logistic Model Trees algorithm, using the WEKA software. We intend to use this gold standard to evaluate GenitivDB, as well as to explore methodologies for a predictive genitive model.

However, nearly all state-of-the-art works in the area still very much depend on the datasets they were trained and tested on, since they heavily draw on content features, mostly a large number of recurrent words or combinations of words extracted from the training sets. We show that using a small number of features that mainly depend on the structure of the texts we can outperform other approaches that depend mainly on the content of the texts and that use a huge number of features in the process of identifying if the author of a text is a man or a woman. Our system has been tested against a dataset constructed for our work as well as against two datasets that were previously used in other papers.

We present a corpus of online communication messages randomly sampled from newsgroups and bug trackers, manually annotated as requests or non-requests. We identify several linguistically shallow, content-based heuristics that correlate with the classification and investigate the extent to which they can serve as independent classification criteria. Then, we train machine-learning classifiers on these heuristics. We experiment with a wide range of settings, such as different learners, excluding some heuristics and adding unigram features of various parts-of-speech and frequency. We conclude that some heuristics can perform well, while their accuracy can be improved further using machine learning, at the cost of obtaining manual annotations.

Our study establishes a baseline for Basque SRL. Although there are no directly comparable systems for English we can state that the results we have achieved are quite good. In addition, we have performed a Leave-One-Out feature selection procedure in order to establish which features are the worthiest regarding argument classification.

Several obstacles lie in the way of achieving this goal. Recent work suggests a testing technique called elicited imitation (EI) that can serve to accurately approximate global oral proficiency. This testing methodology, however, does not incorporate some fundamental aspects of language, such as fluency. Other work has suggested another testing technique, simulated speech (SS), as a supplement or an alternative to EI that can provide automated fluency metrics. In this work, we investigate a combination of fluency features extracted from SS tests and EI test scores as a means to more accurately predict oral language proficiency. Using machine learning and statistical modeling, we identify which features automatically extracted from SS tests best predicted hand-scored SS test results, and demonstrate the benefit of adding EI scores to these models. Results indicate that the combination of EI and fluency features do indeed more effectively predict hand-scored SS test scores. We finally discuss implications of this work for future automated oral testing scenarios.			lonz@byu.edu; cvchristensen@gmail.com						22	0	0	EUROPEAN LANGUAGE RESOURCES ASSOC-ELRA	PARIS	55-57, RUE BRILLAT-SAVARIN, PARIS, 75013, FRANCE			978-2-9517408-8-4				2014							1956	1961				6	Linguistics; Language & Linguistics	Linguistics	BC8FH	WOS:000355611003091

Intuitively, this is due to different language use in different genres and domains. We measure such differences in a sentiment analysis gold standard dataset that contains texts from 1 genre and 10 domains. Differences in language use are quantified using certain language statistics, viz. domain complexity measures. We investigate 4 domain complexity measures: percentage of rare words, word richness, relative entropy and corpus homogeneity. We relate domain complexity measurements to performance of a standard machine learning-based classifier and find strong correlations. We show that we can accurately estimate its performance based on domain complexity using linear regression models fitted using robust loss functions. Moreover, we illustrate how domain complexity may guide us in model selection, viz. in deciding what word n-gram order to employ in a discriminative model and whether to employ aggressive or conservative word n-gram feature selection.

Machine-learning approaches outperformed knowledge-based techniques on categories where sufficient annotated data was available. We showed that the use of external features (unsupervised clusters, information from ontology and taxonomy) improved the results significantly.

The experiment was made over the HAREM corpora, a golden standard for named entities recognition in Portuguese. The tools experimented are based on natural language processing techniques and also machine learning. Specifically, one of the tools is based on Conditional random fields, an unsupervised machine learning model that has being used to named entities recognition in several languages, while the other tools follow more traditional natural language approaches. The comparison results indicate advantages for different tools according to the different classes of named entities. Despite of such balance among tools, we conclude pointing out foreseeable advantages to the machine learning based tool.	[Amaral, Daniela O.

However, there aren't sufficient human resources to produce that knowledge at the same rate of its demand. Considering the Portuguese language, which has few resources in the semantic area, the situation is even more alarming. Aiming to solve that problem, this work investigates how some semantic relations can be automatically extracted from Portuguese texts. The two main approaches investigated here are based on (i) textual patterns and (ii) machine learning algorithms. Thus, this work investigates how and to which extent these two approaches can be applied to the automatic extraction of seven binary semantic relations (is-a, part-of, location-of, effect-of, property-of, made-of and used-for) in Portuguese texts. The results indicate that machine learning, in particular Support Vector Machines, is a promising technique for the task, although textual patterns presented better results for the used-for relation.

It is designed to serve multiple purposes: detection of age, gender, authorship, personality, sentiment, deception, topic and genre. Another major advantage is its planned yearly expansion with each year's new students. The corpus currently contains about 305,000 tokens spread over 749 documents. The average review length is 128 tokens; the average essay length is 1126 tokens. The corpus will be made available on the CLiPS website (www.clips.uantwerpen.be/datasets) and can freely be used for academic research purposes. An initial deception detection experiment was performed on this data. Deception detection is the task of automatically classifying a text as being either truthful or deceptive, in our case by examining the writing style of the author. This task has never been investigated for Dutch before. We performed a supervised machine learning experiment using the SVM algorithm in a 10-fold cross-validation setup. The only features were the token unigrams present in the training data. Using this simple method, we reached a state-of-the-art F-score of 72.2%.

To construct a good knowledge extraction system, annotated corpora in the scientific domain are required to train machine learning models. As described in this paper, we have constructed an annotated corpus for coreference resolution in multiple scientific domains, based on an existing corpus. We have modified the annotation scheme from Message Understanding Conference to better suit scientific texts. Then we applied that to the corpus. The annotated corpus is then compared with corpora in general domains in terms of distribution of resolution classes and performance of the Stanford Dcoref coreference resolver. Through these comparisons, we have demonstrated quantitatively that our manually annotated corpus differs from a general-domain corpus, which suggests deep differences between general-domain texts and scientific texts and which shows that different approaches can be made to tackle coreference resolution for general texts and scientific texts.

We describe an implementation of coreference resolution tools for Latvian language, developed as a part of a tool chain for newswire text analysis but usable also as a separate, publicly available module. LVCoref is a rule based CR system that uses entity centric model that encourages the sharing of information across all mentions that point to the same real-world entity. The system is developed to provide starting ground for further experiments and generate a reference baseline to be compared with more advanced rule-based and machine learning based future coreference resolvers. It now reaches 66.6 F-score using predicted mentions and 78.1% F-score using gold mentions. This paper describes current efforts to create a CR system and to improve NER performance for Latvian.

The two corpora consist of naturally occurring triadic conversations in Danish and Polish, which were annotated according to the same scheme. The intersection of common annotation features was used in the experiments. A Naive Bayes classifier was trained on the annotations of a corpus and tested on the annotations of the other corpus. Training and test datasets were then reversed and the experiments repeated. The results show that the classifier identifies more feedback behaviours than the majority baseline in both cases and the improvements are significant. The performance of the classifier decreases significantly compared with the results obtained when training and test data belong to the same corpus. Annotating multimodal data is resource consuming, thus the results are promising. However, they also confirm preceding studies that have identified both similarities and differences in the use of feedback head movements in different languages. Since our datasets are small and only regard a communicative behaviour in two languages, the experiments should be tested on more data types.

However, it is not always straightforward for a given user to find the "right" song version he or she is looking for. As streaming services may be affected by the potential dissatisfaction among their customers, the quality of songs and the presence of tags (or labels) associated with songs returned to the users are very important. Thus, the need for precise and reliable metadata becomes paramount. In this work, we are particularly interested in distinguishing between live and studio versions of songs. Specifically, we tackle the problem in the case where very little-annotated training data are available, and demonstrate how an original co-training algorithm in a semi-supervised setting can alleviate the problem of data scarcity to successfully discriminate between live and studio music recordings.

As an example we use the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) and describe by means of a short case study how the obtained data can be applied. We explain how we exploit the structure of the database for compiling training material and a testset. Using a Naive Bayes document classification approach based on words, stem bigrams and MeSH descriptors we achieve a macro-average F-score of 61% on a subset of 8 action terms. This outperforms a baseline system based on a lookup of stemmed keywords by more than 20%. Furthermore, we present directions of future work, taking the described system as a vantage point. Future work will be aiming towards a weakly supervised system capable of discovering complete biomedical interactions and events.

In this context, it focuses on studying various strategies for adapting a statistical classifier to a new domain when training data only exist for one or several other domains. This study shows more precisely that a self-training procedure consisting in enlarging the initial training corpus with unannotated texts from the target domain that were reliably classified by the classifier is the most successful and stable strategy for the tested domains. Moreover, this strategy gets better results in most cases than (Blitzer et al., 2007)'s method on the same evaluation corpus while it is more simple.

While sentences are delimited by punctuation marks for written data, there is no obvious hint nor limit to major units for speech. As a reference, we used the manual annotation of macrosyntactic units based on illocutionary as well as syntactic criteria and developed for the Rhapsodie corpus, a 33.000 words prosodic and syntactic treebank. Our segmenters were built using machine learning methods as supervised classifiers : segmentation is about identifying the boundaries of units, which amounts to classifying each interword space. We trained six different models on Rhapsodie using different sets of features, including prosodic and morphosyntactic cues, on the assumption that their combination would be relevant for the task. Both types of cues could be resulting either from manual annotation/correction or from fully automated processes, which comparison might help determine the cost of manual effort, especially for the 3M words of spoken French of the Orfeo project those experiments are contributing to.

The latter type of features has not yet been used in this kind of application and represents a way to access the semantic context of new words. The results suggest that form related features are helpful at the overall classification task, while morpho-lexical and thematic features better single out true neologisms.

To develop a backchannel prediction model using a machine learning technique, it is necessary to discriminate between the timings of the interlocutor's speech when more listeners commonly respond with backchannels and the timings when fewer listeners do so. The proposed corpus indicates the normative timings for backchannels in each speech with millisecond accuracy. In the proposed method, we first extracted each speech comprising a single turn from recorded conversation. Second, we presented these speeches as stimuli to 89 participants and asked them to respond by key hitting whenever they thought it appropriate to respond with a backchannel. In this way, we collected 28983 responses. Third, we applied the Gaussian mixture model to the temporal distribution of the responses and estimated the center of Gaussian distribution, that is, the backchannel relevance place (BRP), in each case. Finally, we synthesized 10 pairs of stereo speech stimuli and asked 19 participants to rate each on a 7-point scale of naturalness. The results show that backchannels inserted at BRPs were significantly higher than those in the original condition.

Detecting and classifying named entities has traditionally been taken on by the natural language processing community, whilst linking of entities to external resources, such as those in DBpedia, has been tackled by the Semantic Web community. As these tasks are treated in different communities, there is as yet no oversight on the performance of these tasks combined. We present an approach that combines the state-of-the art from named entity recognition in the natural language processing domain and named entity linking from the semantic web community. We report on experiments and results to gain more insights into the strengths and limitations of current approaches on these tasks. Our approach relies on the numerous web extractors supported by the NERD framework, which we combine with a machine learning algorithm to optimize recognition and linking of named entities. We test our approach on four standard data sets that are composed of two diverse text types, namely newswire and microposts.

As a consequence, people express their opinions and sentiments in a totally different way with respect to the past. All this information hinders potential business opportunities, especially within the advertising world, and key stakeholders need to catch up with the latest technology if they want to be at the forefront in the market. In practical terms, the automatic analysis of online opinions involves a deep understanding of natural language text, and it has been proved that the use of semantics improves the accuracy of existing sentiment analysis systems based on classical machine learning or statistical approaches. To this end, the Concept Level Sentiment Analysis challenge aims to provide a push in this direction offering the researchers an event where they can learn new approaches for the employment of Semantic Web features within their systems of sentiment analysis bringing to better performance and higher accuracy. The challenge aims to go beyond a mere word-plevel analysis of text and provides novel methods to process opinion data from unstructured textual information to structured machine-pprocessable data.

Sentiment classification of online reviews: using sentence-based language model	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						online reviews; document-level sentiment classification; sentence-level sentiment classification; evaluation domains; languages		With the development of social media, the increasing online reviews of products are greatly influencing the electronic market, making sentiment classification the topic of interest for both industry and academia. This paper develops a sentence-based language model to perform sentiment classification at a fine-grained sentence level. The proposed approach applies a machine learning method to determine the sentiment polarity of a sentence at first, then designs statistical algorithm to compute the weight of the sentence in sentiment classification of the whole document and at last aggregates the weighted sentence to predict the sentiment polarity of document. Besides, experiments are carried out on corpuses in different evaluation domains and languages, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the sentence-based approach in obtaining a more accurate result of sentiment classification across different reviews. Furthermore, the experimental results also indicate that the position and the sentiment of a sentence have great impact on predicting the sentiment polarity of document, and corpuses with different evaluative objects, languages and sentiments also greatly influence the performance of sentiment classification. It is believed that these conclusions will be a good inspiration for similar researches.

The proposed approaches include (1) a new declaration mechanism, called connection declarations, for bottom clause construction, which is simpler but more expressive than the commonly used mode declarations; (2) a new covering technique, called super_covering, which reduces the examples in such a way that recursion can be learned, independently from the ordering of the examples; (3) a new search heuristics, called neg_coverage heuristics, which guides the search using only the number of negative examples covered by each hypothesis and (4) a new search algorithm, called doubly_guided_search, which searches for best clauses by alternating the use of two search heuristics, i.e. the traditional coverage search heuristics and the new neg_coverage search heuristics. The TWEETY system is shown to be more effective and efficient than the state-of-the-art ILP system ALEPH; the proposed techniques can be used to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of ALEPH and other systems based on the same ILP principles.

Current methods that predict SS from sequences rely on complex machine learning-derived models andprovide the three-state accuracy (Q(3)) at about 82%. Further improvements in predictive quality could be obtained with a consensus-based approach, which so far received limited attention. We perform first-of-its-kind comprehensive design of a SS consensus predictor (SScon), in which we consider 12 modern standalone SS predictors and utilize Support Vector Machine (SVM) to combine their predictions. Using a large benchmark data-set with 10 random training-test splits, we show that a simple, voting-based consensus of carefully selected base methods improves Q(3) by 1.9% when compared to the best single predictor. Use of SVM provides additional 1.4% improvement with the overall Q(3) at 85.6% and segment overlap (SOV3) at 83.7%, when compared to 82.3 and 80.9%, respectively, obtained by the best individual methods. We also show strong improvements when the consensus is based on ab-initio methods, with Q(3) = 82.3% and SOV3 = 80.7% that match the results from the best template-based approaches. Our consensus reduces the number of significant errors where helix is confused with a strand, provides particularly good results for short helices and strands, and gives the most accurate estimates of the content of individual SSs in the chain. Case studies are used to visualize the improvements offered by the consensus at the residue level.

However, there has been little work done on multi-agent scheduling with learning effects. This article investigates a two-agent single-machine scheduling problem with learning effects via an objective function which minimises the weighted completion time of all the jobs subject to a constraint that one agent makespan cannot exceed a prescribed upper bound. This article develops a branch-and-bound algorithm along with three simulated-annealing (SA) algorithms searching for an optimal and near-optimal solution. The computational results show that all the average error percentages of combined SA algorithms are less than 0.076%.

Advanced recognition of explosives in traces on polymer surfaces using LIBS and supervised learning classifiers	ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy; Explosives; Confusants; Polymer surfaces; Machine learning classifiers	INDUCED BREAKDOWN SPECTROSCOPY; RESIDUES; DISCRIMINATION; IDENTIFICATION; CLASSIFICATION	The large similarity existing in the spectral emissions collected from organic compounds by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a limiting factor for the use of this technology in the real world. Specifically, among the most ambitious challenges of today's LIBS involves the recognition of an organic residue when neglected on the surface of an object of identical nature. Under these circumstances, the development of an efficient algorithm to disclose the minute differences within this highly complex spectral information is crucial for a realistic application of LIBS in countering explosive threats. An approach cemented on scatter plots of characteristic emission features has been developed to identify organic explosives when located on polymeric surfaces (teflon, nylon and polyethylene). By using selected spectral variables, the approach allows to design a concise classifier for alerting when one of four explosives (DNT, TNT, RDX and PETN) is present on the surface of the polymer. Ordinary products ( butter, fuel oil, hand cream, olive oil and motor oil) cause no confusion in the decisions taken by the classifier. With rates of false negatives and false positives below 5%, results demonstrate that the classification algorithm enables to label residues according to their harmful nature in the most demanding scenario for a LIBS sensor.

In regular culture conditions, ESCs' self-renewal is maintained through molecules that inhibit spontaneous differentiation enabling long-term cellular expansion. This undifferentiating condition is characterized by multiple metastable states that fluctuate between self-renewal and differentiation balance. Here, we aim to characterize the high-pluripotent ESC metastate marked by the expression of Zscan4 through a supervised machine learning framework based on an ensemble of support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Our study revealed a leukaemia inhibitor factor (Lif) dependent not-canonical pluripotency signature (AF067063, BC061212, Dub1, Eif1a, Gm12794, Gm13871, Gm4340, Gm4850, Tcstv1/3, and Zfp352), that specifically marks Zscan4 ESCs' fluctuation. This novel ESC metastate is enhanced by high-pluripotency culture conditions obtained through Extracellular signal Regulated-Kinase (ERK) and Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (Gsk-3) signaling inhibition (2i). Significantly, we reported that the conditional ablation of the novel ESC metastate marked by the expression of Gm12794 is required for ESCs self-renewal maintenance. In conclusion, we extend the comprehension of ESCs biology through the identification of a novel molecular signature associated to pluripotency programming.

DACH1: Its Role as a Classifier of Long Term Good Prognosis in Luminal Breast Cancer	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FATE DETERMINATION FACTOR; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR; CYCLIN D1; EXPRESSION; DACHSHUND; GROWTH; DROSOPHILA; HOMOLOG; TUMORS	Background: Oestrogen receptor (ER) positive (luminal) tumours account for the largest proportion of females with breast cancer. Theirs is a heterogeneous disease presenting clinical challenges in managing their treatment. Three main biological luminal groups have been identified but clinically these can be distilled into two prognostic groups in which Luminal A are accorded good prognosis and Luminal B correlate with poor prognosis. Further biomarkers are needed to attain classification consensus. Machine learning approaches like Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been used for classification and identification of biomarkers in breast cancer using high throughput data. In this study, we have used an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to identify DACH1 as a candidate luminal marker and its role in predicting clinical outcome in breast cancer is assessed. Materials and methods: A reiterative ANN approach incorporating a network inferencing algorithm was used to identify ER-associated biomarkers in a publically available cDNA microarray dataset. DACH1 was identified in having a strong influence on ER associated markers and a positive association with ER. Its clinical relevance in predicting breast cancer specific survival was investigated by statistically assessing protein expression levels after immunohistochemistry in a series of unselected breast cancers, formatted as a tissue microarray. Results: Strong nuclear DACH1 staining is more prevalent in tubular and lobular breast cancer. Its expression correlated with ER-alpha positive tumours expressing PgR, epithelial cytokeratins (CK) 18/19 and 'luminal-like' markers of good prognosis including FOXA1 and RERG (p < 0.05). DACH1 is increased in patients showing longer cancer specific survival and disease free interval and reduced metastasis formation (p < 0.001). Nuclear DACH1 showed a negative association with markers of aggressive growth and poor prognosis. Conclusion: Nuclear DACH1 expression appears to be a Luminal A biomarker predictive of good prognosis, but is not independent of clinical stage, tumour size, NPI status or systemic therapy.

Distributed learning and multi-objectivity in traffic light control	CONNECTION SCIENCE			English	Article						traffic control; DCEE; reinforcement learning; multi-objective optimisation		Traffic jams and suboptimal traffic flows are ubiquitous in modern societies, and they create enormous economic losses each year. Delays at traffic lights alone account for roughly 10% of all delays in US traffic. As most traffic light scheduling systems currently in use are static, set up by human experts rather than being adaptive, the interest in machine learning approaches to this problem has increased in recent years. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches are often used in these studies, as they require little pre-existing knowledge about traffic flows. Distributed constraint optimisation approaches (DCOP) have also been shown to be successful, but are limited to cases where the traffic flows are known. The distributed coordination of exploration and exploitation (DCEE) framework was recently proposed to introduce learning in the DCOP framework. In this paper, we present a study of DCEE and RL techniques in a complex simulator, illustrating the particular advantages of each, comparing them against standard isolated traffic actuated signals. We analyse how learning and coordination behave under different traffic conditions, and discuss the multi-objective nature of the problem. Finally we evaluate several alternative reward signals in the best performing approach, some of these taking advantage of the correlation between the problem-inherent objectives to improve performance.

This literature review shows that in conjunction with in situ data collection, EO data have been used to observe, monitor, measure and model many environmental variables that are associated with disease vectors. Furthermore, satellite derived aerosol optical depth has been increasingly employed to estimate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations, which have been found to associate with various health outcomes such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. It is suggested that Landsat-like imagery data may provide important data sources to analyse and understand contagious and infectious diseases at the local and regional scales, which are tied to urbanisation and associated impacts on the environment. There is also a great need of data products from coarse resolution imagery, such as those from moderate resolution imaging spectrometer, multiangle imaging spectroradiometer and geostationary operational environmental satellite , to model and characterise infectious diseases at the continental and global scales. The infectious diseases at greater geographical scales have become unprecedentedly significant as global climate change and the process of globalisation intensify. The relationship between infectious diseases and environmental characteristic have been explored by using statistical, geostatistical and physical models, with recent emphasis on the use of machine-learning techniques such as artificial neural networks. Lastly, we suggest that the planned HyspIRI mission is crucial for observing, measuring and modelling environmental variables impacting various diseases as it will improve both spectral resolution and revisit time, thus contributing to better prediction of occurrence of infectious diseases, target intervention and tracking of epidemic events.

It is the base pitch, which an artist chooses in order to construct the melodies during a rg(a) rendition, and all accompanying instruments are tuned using the tonic pitch. Consequently, tonic identification is a fundamental task for most computational analyses of Indian art music, such as intonation analysis, melodic motif analysis and rg recognition. In this paper we review existing approaches for tonic identification in Indian art music and evaluate them on six diverse datasets for a thorough comparison and analysis. We study the performance of each method in different contexts such as the presence/absence of additional metadata, the quality of audio data, the duration of audio data, music tradition (Hindustani/Carnatic) and the gender of the singer (male/female). We show that the approaches that combine multi-pitch analysis with machine learning provide the best performance in most cases (90% identification accuracy on average), and are robust across the aforementioned contexts compared to the approaches based on expert knowledge. In addition, we also show that the performance of the latter can be improved when additional metadata is available to further constrain the problem. Finally, we present a detailed error analysis of each method, providing further insights into the advantages and limitations of the methods.

Classification of Melodic Motifs in Raga Music with Time-series Matching	JOURNAL OF NEW MUSIC RESEARCH			English	Article						raga-characteristic phrases; melodic motifs; machine learning	POLYPHONIC MUSIC; RECOGNITION; EXTRACTION	Ragas are characterized by their melodic motifs or catch phrases that constitute strong cues to the raga identity for both the performer and the listener, and therefore are of great interest in music retrieval and automatic transcription. While the characteristic phrases, or pakads, appear in written notation as a sequence of notes, musicological rules for interpretation of the phrase in performance in a manner that allows considerable creative expression, while not transgressing raga grammar, are not explicitly defined. In this work, machine learning methods are used on labelled databases of Hindustani and Carnatic vocal audio concerts to obtain phrase classification on manually segmented audio. Dynamic time warping and HMM based classification are applied on time series of detected pitch values used for the melodic representation of a phrase. Retrieval experiments on raga-characteristic phrases show promising results while providing interesting insights on the nature of variation in the surface realization of raga-characteristic motifs within and across concerts.

The algorithm is applied for the spectral classification in astronomy. Restricted Boltzmann machine is a bipartite generative graphical model with two separate layers (one visible layer and one hidden layer), which can extract higher level features to represent the original data. Despite generative, restricted Boltzmann machine can be used for classification when modified with a free energy and a soft-max function. Before spectral classification, the original data are binarised according to some rule. Then, we resort to the binary restricted Boltzmann machine to classify cataclysmic variables and non-cataclysmic variables (one half of all the given data for training and the other half for testing). The experiment result shows state-of-the-art accuracy of 100%, which indicates the efficiency of the binary restricted Boltzmann machine algorithm.

Labour-Efficient In Vitro Lymphocyte Population Tracking and Fate Prediction Using Automation and Manual Review	PLOS ONE			English	Review							PROBABILISTIC DATA ASSOCIATION; CELL TRACKING; LINEAGE CONSTRUCTION; CHEMOTAXIS; SOFTWARE; MINIMUM; IMAGES	Interest in cell heterogeneity and differentiation has recently led to increased use of time-lapse microscopy. Previous studies have shown that cell fate may be determined well in advance of the event. We used a mixture of automation and manual review of time-lapse live cell imaging to track the positions, contours, divisions, deaths and lineage of 44 B-lymphocyte founders and their 631 progeny in vitro over a period of 108 hours. Using this data to train a Support Vector Machine classifier, we were retrospectively able to predict the fates of individual lymphocytes with more than 90% accuracy, using only time-lapse imaging captured prior to mitosis or death of 90% of all cells. The motivation for this paper is to explore the impact of labour-efficient assistive software tools that allow larger and more ambitious live-cell time-lapse microscopy studies. After training on this data, we show that machine learning methods can be used for realtime prediction of individual cell fates. These techniques could lead to realtime cell culture segregation for purposes such as phenotype screening. We were able to produce a large volume of data with less effort than previously reported, due to the image processing, computer vision, tracking and human-computer interaction tools used. We describe the workflow of the software-assisted experiments and the graphical interfaces that were needed. To validate our results we used our methods to reproduce a variety of published data about lymphocyte populations and behaviour. We also make all our data publicly available, including a large quantity of lymphocyte spatio-temporal dynamics and related lineage information.

Near-Term Prediction of Sudden Cardiac Death in Older Hemodialysis Patients Using Electronic Health Records	CLINICAL JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEPHROLOGY			English	Article							STAGE RENAL-DISEASE; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; DIALYSIS PATIENTS; BLOOD INSTITUTE; NATIONAL HEART; KIDNEY-DISEASE; RISK-FACTORS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PREVENTION; ARREST	Background and objectivesSudden cardiac death is the most common cause of death among individuals undergoing hemodialysis. The epidemiology of sudden cardiac death has been well studied, and efforts are shifting to risk assessment. This study aimed to test whether assessment of acute changes during hemodialysis that are captured in electronic health records improved risk assessment.Design, setting, participants, & measurementsData were collected from all hemodialysis sessions of patients 66 years and older receiving hemodialysis from a large national dialysis provider between 2004 and 2008. The primary outcome of interest was sudden cardiac death the day of or day after a dialysis session. This study used data from 2004 to 2006 as the training set and data from 2007 to 2008 as the validation set. The machine learning algorithm, Random Forests, was used to derive the prediction model.ResultsIn 22 million sessions, 898 people between 2004 and 2006 and 826 people between 2007 and 2008 died on the day of or day after a dialysis session that was serving as a training or test data session, respectively. A reasonably strong predictor was derived using just predialysis information (concordance statistic=0.782), which showed modest but significant improvement after inclusion of postdialysis information (concordance statistic=0.799, P<0.001). However, risk prediction decreased the farther out that it was forecasted (up to 1 year), and postdialytic information became less important.ConclusionSubtle changes in the experience of hemodialysis aid in the assessment of sudden cardiac death and are captured by modern electronic health records. The collected data are better for the assessment of near-term risk as opposed to longer-term risk.

Automatic Classification of Cellular Expression by Nonlinear Stochastic Embedding (ACCENSE)	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						immunophenotyping; machine learning; class discovery; CyTOF; FACS	FLOW-CYTOMETRY DATA; MEMORY T-CELLS; EFFECTOR; HOMEOSTASIS; LYMPHOCYTES; CONTINUUM; IMMUNE; GUIDE	Mass cytometry enables an unprecedented number of parameters to be measured in individual cells at a high throughput, but the large dimensionality of the resulting data severely limits approaches relying on manual "gating." Clustering cells based on phenotypic similarity comes at a loss of single-cell resolution and often the number of subpopulations is unknown a priori. Here we describe ACCENSE, a tool that combines nonlinear dimensionality reduction with density-based partitioning, and displays multivariate cellular phenotypes on a 2D plot. We apply ACCENSE to 35-parameter mass cytometry data from CD8(+) T cells derived from specific pathogen-free and germ-free mice, and stratify cells into phenotypic subpopulations. Our results show significant heterogeneity within the known CD8(+) T-cell subpopulations, and of particular note is that we find a large novel subpopulation in both specific pathogen-free and germ-free mice that has not been described previously. This subpopulation possesses a phenotypic signature that is distinct from conventional naive and memory subpopulations when analyzed by ACCENSE, but is not distinguishable on a biaxial plot of standard markers. We are able to automatically identify cellular subpopulations based on all proteins analyzed, thus aiding the full utilization of powerful new single-cell technologies such as mass cytometry.

Despite the existence of various probabilistic approaches in these fields, there is arguably no method that is able to distinguish between two very different sources of uncertainty: aleatoric uncertainty, which is due to statistical variability and effects that are inherently random, and epistemic uncertainty which is caused by a lack of knowledge. In this paper, we propose a method for binary classification that does not only produce a prediction of the class of a query instance but also a quantification of the two aforementioned sources of uncertainty. Despite being grounded in probability and statistics, the method is formalized within the framework of fuzzy preference relations. The usefulness and reasonableness of our approach is confirmed on a suitable data set with information about patients suffering from chest pain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In particular, solution to this has found successful application in tasks that involve datasets containing huge numbers of features (in the order of tens of thousands), which would otherwise be impossible to process further. Recent examples include text processing and web content classification. Rough set theory has been used as such a dataset pre-processor with much success, but current methods are inadequate at finding globally minimal reductions, the smallest sets of features possible. This paper proposes a technique that considers this problem from a propositional satisfiability perspective. In this framework, globally minimal subsets can be located and verified.

The basis for such a task is usually a training set consisting of labeled patterns. In real-world settings, however, such labeled data are usually scarce, and the corresponding models might yield unsatisfying results. Unlabeled data, on the other hand, can often be obtained in huge quantities without much additional effort. A prominent research direction in the field of machine learning is semi-supervised support vector machines. This type of binary classification approach aims at taking the additional information provided by the unlabeled patterns into account to reveal more information about the structure of the data at hand. In some cases, this can yield significantly better classification results compared to a straightforward application of supervised models. One drawback, however, is the fact that generating such models requires solving difficult non-convex optimization tasks. In this work, we present a simple but effective gradient-based optimization framework to address the induced problems. The resulting method can be implemented easily using black-box optimization engines and yields excellent classification and runtime results on both sparse and non-sparse data sets.

Incremental filter and wrapper approaches for feature discretization	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Pattern Recognition - Applications and Methods (ICPRAM)	FEB 06-08, 2012	PORTUGAL			Feature discretization; Static discretization; Incremental discretization; Filter; Wrapper; Feature selection	EFFICIENT FEATURE-SELECTION; THEORETIC FEATURE-SELECTION; INPUT FEATURE-SELECTION; MULTIPLE DATA SETS; MUTUAL INFORMATION; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; CONTINUOUS ATTRIBUTES; EXPRESSION DATA; ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION	Discrete data representations are necessary, or at least convenient, in many machine learning problems. While feature selection (FS) techniques aim at finding relevant subsets of features, the goal of feature discretization (FD) is to find concise (quantized) data representations, adequate for the learning task at hand. In this paper, we propose two incremental methods for FD. The first method belongs to the filter family, in which the quality of the discretization is assessed by a (supervised or unsupervised) relevance criterion. The second method is a wrapper, where discretized features are assessed using a classifier. Both methods can be coupled with any static (unsupervised or supervised) discretization procedure and can be used to perform FS as pre-processing or post-processing stages. The proposed methods attain efficient representations suitable for binary and multi-class problems with different types of data, being competitive with existing methods. Moreover, using well-known FS methods with the features discretized by our techniques leads to better accuracy than with the features discretized by other methods or with the original features.

A complex-valued neuro-fuzzy inference system and its learning mechanism	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Complex-valued neural network; Fuzzy inference system; Wirtinger calculus; Meta-cognition; Self-regulation	BASIS FUNCTION NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS; CHANNEL EQUALIZATION; MULTIVALUED NEURONS; ALGORITHM; IDENTIFICATION; MACHINE; PREDICTION; POWER	In this paper, we present a complex-valued neuro-fuzzy inference system (CNFIS) and develop its meta-cognitive learning algorithm. CNFIS has four layers - an input layer with m rules, a Gaussian layer with K rules, a normalization layer with K rules and an output layer with n rules. The rules in the Gaussian layer map the m-dimensional complex-valued input features to a K-dimensional real-valued space. Hence, we use the Wirtinger calculus to obtain the complex-valued gradients of the real-valued function in deriving the learning algorithm of CNFIS. Next, we also develop the meta-cognitive learning algorithm for CNFIS referred to as "meta-cognitive complex-valued neuro-fuzzy inference system (MCNFIS)". CNFIS is the cognitive component of MCNFIS and a self-regulatory learning mechanism that decides what-to-learn, how-to-learn, and when-to-learn in a meta-cognitive framework is its meta-cognitive component. Thus, for every epoch of the learning process, the meta-cognitive component decides if each sample in the training set must be deleted or used to update the parameters of CNFIS or to be reserved for future use. The performances of CNFIS and MCNFIS are studied on a set of approximation and real-valued classification problems, in comparison to existing complex-valued learning algorithms in the literature. First, we evaluate the approximation performances of CNFIS and MCNFIS on a synthetic complex-valued function approximation problem, an adaptive beam-forming problem and a wind prediction problem. Finally, we study the decision making performance of CNFIS and MCNFIS on a set of benchmark real-valued classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository. Performance study results on approximation and real-valued classification problems show that CNFIS and MCNFIS outperform existing algorithms in the literature. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

They can be used as an intermediary step in protein structure predictions. However, the prediction of contact maps represents an unbalanced problem as far fewer examples of contacts than non-contacts exist in a protein structure. In this study we explore the possibility of completely eliminating the unbalanced nature of the contact map prediction problem by predicting real-value distances between residues. Predicting full inter-residue distance maps and applying them in protein structure predictions has been relatively unexplored in the past. Results: We initially demonstrate that the use of native-like distance maps is able to reproduce 3D structures almost identical to the targets, giving an average RMSD of 0.5 angstrom. In addition, the corrupted physical maps with an introduced random error of +/- 6 angstrom are able to reconstruct the targets within an average RMSD of 2 angstrom. After demonstrating the reconstruction potential of distance maps, we develop two classes of predictors using two-dimensional recursive neural networks: an ab initio predictor that relies only on the protein sequence and evolutionary information, and a template-based predictor in which additional structural homology information is provided. We find that the ab initio predictor is able to reproduce distances with an RMSD of 6 angstrom, regardless of the evolutionary content provided. Furthermore, we show that the template-based predictor exploits both sequence and structure information even in cases of dubious homology and outperforms the best template hit with a clear margin of up to 3.7 angstrom. Lastly, we demonstrate the ability of the two predictors to reconstruct the CASP9 targets shorter than 200 residues producing the results similar to the state of the machine learning art approach implemented in the Distill server. Conclusions: The methodology presented here, if complemented by more complex reconstruction protocols, can represent a possible path to improve machine learning algorithms for 3D protein structure prediction. Moreover, it can be used as an intermediary step in protein structure predictions either on its own or complemented by NMR restraints.

J	Kursa, MB				Kursa, Miron Bartosz			Robustness of Random Forest-based gene selection methods	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; PACKAGE; CANCER	Background: Gene selection is an important part of microarray data analysis because it provides information that can lead to a better mechanistic understanding of an investigated phenomenon. At the same time, gene selection is very difficult because of the noisy nature of microarray data. As a consequence, gene selection is often performed with machine learning methods. The Random Forest method is particularly well suited for this purpose. In this work, four state-of-the-art Random Forest-based feature selection methods were compared in a gene selection context. The analysis focused on the stability of selection because, although it is necessary for determining the significance of results, it is often ignored in similar studies. Results: The comparison of post-selection accuracy of a validation of Random Forest classifiers revealed that all investigated methods were equivalent in this context. However, the methods substantially differed with respect to the number of selected genes and the stability of selection. Of the analysed methods, the Boruta algorithm predicted the most genes as potentially important. Conclusions: The post-selection classifier error rate, which is a frequently used measure, was found to be a potentially deceptive measure of gene selection quality. When the number of consistently selected genes was considered, the Boruta algorithm was clearly the best. Although it was also the most computationally intensive method, the Boruta algorithm's computational demands could be reduced to levels comparable to those of other algorithms by replacing the Random Forest importance with a comparable measure from Random Ferns (a similar but simplified classifier). Despite their design assumptions, the minimal optimal selection methods, were found to select a high fraction of false positives.

Systems analysis of sex differences reveals an immunosuppressive role for testosterone in the response to influenza vaccination	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						aging; gender; immuno-endocrine; sexual dimorphism; immunosenescence	C-REACTIVE PROTEIN; RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; GONADAL-STEROIDS; DENDRITIC CELLS; INFLAMMATION; VIRUS; GENE; DIMORPHISM	Females have generally more robust immune responses than males for reasons that are not well-understood. Here we used a systems analysis to investigate these differences by analyzing the neutralizing antibody response to a trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (TIV) and a large number of immune system components, including serum cytokines and chemokines, blood cell subset frequencies, genome-wide gene expression, and cellular responses to diverse in vitro stimuli, in 53 females and 34 males of different ages. We found elevated antibody responses to TIV and expression of inflammatory cytokines in the serum of females compared with males regardless of age. This inflammatory profile correlated with the levels of phosphorylated STAT3 proteins in monocytes but not with the serological response to the vaccine. In contrast, using a machine learning approach, we identified a cluster of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and previously shown to be up-regulated by testosterone that correlated with poor virus-neutralizing activity in men. Moreover, men with elevated serum testosterone levels and associated gene signatures exhibited the lowest antibody responses to TIV. These results demonstrate a strong association between androgens and genes involved in lipid metabolism, suggesting that these could be important drivers of the differences in immune responses between males and females.

Given some training data, an RBM or a stack of several RBMs can be used to extract informative features. Meanwhile, ensemble learning is an active research area in machine learning owing to their potential to greatly increase the prediction accuracy of a single classifier. However, RBMs have not been studied to work with ensemble learning so far. In this study, we present several methods for integrating RBMs with bagging to generate diverse and accurate individual classifiers. Taking a classification tree as the base learning algorithm, a thoroughly experimental study conducted on 31 real-world data sets yields some promising conclusions. When using the features extracted by RBMs in ensemble learning, the best way is to perform model combination respectively on the original feature set and the one extracted by a single RBM. However, the prediction performance becomes worse when the features detected by a stack of 2 RBMs are also considered. As for the features detected by RBMs, good classification can be obtained only when they are used together with the original features. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The study was performed for 5 different protein kinases, and several sets of compounds (active, inactive and assumed inactives) were docked into their targets. The resulting ligand-protein complexes were represented by the means of structural interaction fingerprints profiles (SIFts profiles) that constituted an input for ML methods.

Moreover, the analysis is also complicated by the loss of synchrony occurring in cell cycle experiments, which often results in additional background noise. Results: To overcome these problems, here we propose the LEON (LEarning and OptimizatioN) algorithm, able to characterize the 'cyclicity degree' of a gene expression time profile using a two-step cascade procedure. The first step identifies a potentially cyclic behavior by means of a Support Vector Machine trained with a reliable set of positive and negative examples. The second step selects those genes having peak timing consistency along two cell cycles by means of a non-linear optimization technique using radial basis functions. To prove the effectiveness of our combined approach, we use recently published human fibroblasts cell cycle data and, performing in vivo experiments, we demonstrate that our computational strategy is able not only to confirm well-known cell cycle-regulated genes, but also to predict not yet identified ones.

A conserved role for Snail as a potentiator of active transcription	GENES & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						transcription factor; Snail; Twist; repression; activation; spatiotemporal gene expression; Drosophila embryogenesis	EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION; EARLY MESODERM DEVELOPMENT; SHORT-RANGE REPRESSION; CELL-SHAPE CHANGES; DROSOPHILA-EMBRYO; GENE-EXPRESSION; DORSOVENTRAL PATTERN; NUCLEAR-LOCALIZATION; REGULATORY CODE; DIRECT TARGET	The transcription factors of the Snail family are key regulators of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions, cell morphogenesis, and tumor metastasis. Since its discovery in Drosophila similar to 25 years ago, Snail has been extensively studied for its role as a transcriptional repressor. Here we demonstrate that Drosophila Snail can positively modulate transcriptional activation. By combining information on in vivo occupancy with expression profiling of hand-selected, staged snail mutant embryos, we identified 106 genes that are potentially directly regulated by Snail during mesoderm development. In addition to the expected Snail-repressed genes, almost 50% of Snail targets showed an unanticipated activation. The majority of "Snail-activated" genes have enhancer elements cobound by Twist and are expressed in the mesoderm at the stages of Snail occupancy. Snail can potentiate Twist-mediated enhancer activation in vitro and is essential for enhancer activity in vivo. Using a machine learning approach, we show that differentially enriched motifs are sufficient to predict Snail's regulatory response. In silico mutagenesis revealed a likely causative motif, which we demonstrate is essential for enhancer activation. Taken together, these data indicate that Snail can potentiate enhancer activation by collaborating with different activators, providing a new mechanism by which Snail regulates development.

Evolutionary support vector regression algorithm applied to the prediction of the thickness of the chromium layer in a hard chromium plating process	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						Hard chromium plating process; Support vector machines for regression (SVR); Machine learning; Evolutionary algorithms (EAs); Evolutionary support vector machines (ESVMs)	SVM; OPTIMIZATION	The hard chromium plating process aims at creating a coating of hard and wear-resistant chromium with a thickness of some microns directly on the metal part, without the insertion of copper or nickel layers. It is one of the most difficult electroplating processes due to the influence of the hydrogen evolution that occurs on the cathode surface simultaneously to the chromium deposition. Chromium plating is characterized by high levels of hardness and resistance to wear and it is thanks to these properties that they can be applied in a huge range of sectors. Resistance to corrosion of a hard chromium plate depends on the thickness of the coating, adherence and micro-fissures of the latter. This micro-fissured structure is what provides the optimal hardness of the layers. The electro-deposited chromium layer is not uniformly distributed: there are zones such as sharp edges or points where deposits are highly accentuated, while deposits are virtually nonexistent in holes or in the undercuts. The hard chromium plating process is one of the most effective ways of protecting the base material in a hostile environment or improving surface properties of the base material. However, in the electroplating industry, electro-platers are faced with many problems and often achieve undesirable results on chromium-plated materials. Problems such as matt deposition, milky white chromium deposition, rough or sandy chromium deposition and insufficient thickness or hardness are the most common problems faced in the electroplating industry. Finally, it must be remarked that defects in the coating locally lower the corrosion resistance of the layer and that the decomposition of chromium hydrides causes the formation of a network of cracks in the coating. This innovative research work uses an evolutionary support vector regression algorithm for the prediction of the thickness of the chromium layer in a hard chromium plating process. Evolutionary support vector machines (ESVMs) is a novel technique that assimilates the learning engine of the state-of-the-art support vector machines (SVMs) but evolves the coefficients of the decision function by means of evolutionary algorithms (EAs). In this sense, the current research is focused on the estimation of the hyper-parameters required for the support vector machines technique for regression (SVR), by means of evolutionary strategies. The results are briefly compared with those obtained by authors in a previous paper, where a model based on an artificial neural network was tuned using the design of experiments (DOE).

Four contrasting methods for estimating mean flow, proportion of flow in February, 7-day mean annual low flow, mean annual high flow, the all-time flow duration curve and the February flow duration curve at ungauged sites across New Zealand were compared. The four methods comprised: (1) an uncalibrated national-coverage physically-based rainfall-runoff model (TopNet); (2) data-driven empirical approaches informed by hydrological theory (Hydrology of Ungauged Catchments); (3) a purely empirically-based machine learning regression model (Random Forests); and (4) correction of the TopNet estimates using flow duration curves estimated using Random Forests. Model performance was assessed through comparison with observed data from 485 gauging stations located across New Zealand. Three model performance metrics were calculated: Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency, a normalised error index statistic (the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of observed data) and the percentage bias. Results showed that considerable gains in TopNet model performance could be made when TopNet time-series were corrected using flow duration curves estimated from Random Forests. This improvement in TopNet performance occurred regardless of two different parameterisations of the TopNet model. The Random Forests method provided the best estimates of the flow duration curves and all hydrological indices except mean flow. Mean flow was best estimated using the already published Hydrology of Ungauged Catchments method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Booker, D.

The aim of this study is to apply different methods to modeling energy dissipation in napped and skimming flow regimes over stepped spillway by using original experimental dataset through the artificial networks (ANNs) and Genetic Expression Programming (GEP) techniques. Subsequently, three kinds of data including the napped and skimming regimes data as well as combination of them are applied as models input-output variables. A preliminary investigation on various GEP operators is also carried out for selecting the proper operators. The obtained results indicate that applied machine learning techniques have reliable performance in predicting energy dissipation over stepped spillways. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Long-term SPI drought forecasting in the Awash River Basin in Ethiopia using wavelet neural network and wavelet support vector regression models	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						ANN; Support vector regression; SPI; Drought forecasting; Wavelet transforms; Africa	TIME-SERIES; MACHINES; INDEXES; PREDICTION; CONJUNCTION; IRAN	Long-term drought forecasts can provide valuable information to help mitigate some of the consequences of drought. Data driven models are suitable forecast tools due to their minimal information requirements and rapid development times. This study compares the effectiveness of five data driven models for forecasting long-term (6 and 12 months lead time) drought conditions in the Awash River Basin of Ethiopia. The Standard Precipitation Index (SPI 12 and SPI 24) was forecasted using a traditional stochastic model (ARIMA) and compared to machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector regression (SVR). In addition to these three model types, wavelet transforms were used to pre-process the inputs for ANN and SVR models to form WA-ANN and WA-SVR models; this is the first time that WA-SVR models have been explored and tested for long-term SPI forecasting. The performances of all models were compared using RMSE, MAE, R-2 and a measure of persistence. The forecast results indicate that the coupled wavelet neural network (WA-ANN) models were better than all the other models in this study for forecasting SPI 12 and SPI 24 values over lead times of 6 and 12 months in the Awash River Basin.

The key idea is to interpret large-scale atmospheric dynamical processes as information flow around the globe and to identify the pathways of this information flow using a climate network based on causal discovery and graphical models. We construct such networks using the daily geopotential height data from the Community Climate System Model Version 4.0 (CCSM4.0)'s 20(th) century climate simulation and 21(st) century climate projection. We show that in the CCSM4.0 model under enhanced greenhouse gases (GHGs) forcing, prominent midlatitude information pathways in the midtroposphere weaken and shift poleward, while major tropical information pathways start diminishing. Averaged over the entire Northern Hemisphere, the atmospheric information flow weakens. The implications of this weakening for the interconnectivity among different geographical locations and for the intrinsic predictability of the atmosphere are discussed.

J	Torii, M; Wagholikar, K; Liu, HF				Torii, Manabu; Wagholikar, Kavishwar; Liu, Hongfang			Detecting concept mentions in biomedical text using hidden Markov model: multiple concept types at once or one at a time?	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL SEMANTICS			English	Article						Natural language processing; Information storage and retrieval; Data mining; Electronic health records	CLINICAL TEXT; INFORMATION; EXTRACTION	Background: Identifying phrases that refer to particular concept types is a critical step in extracting information from documents. Provided with annotated documents as training data, supervised machine learning can automate this process. When building a machine learning model for this task, the model may be built to detect all types simultaneously (all-types-at-once) or it may be built for one or a few selected types at a time (one-type-or a-few-types-at-a-time). It is of interest to investigate which strategy yields better detection performance. Results: Hidden Markov models using the different strategies were evaluated on a clinical corpus annotated with three concept types (i2b2/VA corpus) and a biology literature corpus annotated with five concept types (JNLPBA corpus). Ten-fold cross-validation tests were conducted and the experimental results showed that models trained for multiple concept types consistently yielded better performance than those trained for a single concept type. F-scores observed for the former strategies were higher than those observed for the latter by 0.9 to 2.6% on the i2b2/VA corpus and 1.4 to 10.1% on the JNLPBA corpus, depending on the target concept types. Improved boundary detection and reduced type confusion were observed for the all-types-at-once strategy. Conclusions: The current results suggest that detection of concept phrases could be improved by simultaneously tackling multiple concept types. This also suggests that we should annotate multiple concept types in developing a new corpus for machine learning models. Further investigation is expected to gain insights in the underlying mechanism to achieve good performance when multiple concept types are considered.

J	De, J; Li, HQ; Cheng, L				De, Jaydeep; Li, Huiqi; Cheng, Li			Tracing retinal vessel trees by transductive inference	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							BLOOD-VESSELS; FUNDUS IMAGES; SEGMENTATION; RECONSTRUCTION; MORPHOLOGY; NEURON	Background: Structural study of retinal blood vessels provides an early indication of diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and hypertensive retinopathy. These studies require accurate tracing of retinal vessel tree structure from fundus images in an automated manner. However, the existing work encounters great difficulties when dealing with the crossover issue commonly-seen in vessel networks. Results: In this paper, we consider a novel graph-based approach to address this tracing with crossover problem: After initial steps of segmentation and skeleton extraction, its graph representation can be established, where each segment in the skeleton map becomes a node, and a direct contact between two adjacent segments is translated to an undirected edge of the two corresponding nodes. The segments in the skeleton map touching the optical disk area are considered as root nodes. This determines the number of trees to-be-found in the vessel network, which is always equal to the number of root nodes. Based on this undirected graph representation, the tracing problem is further connected to the well-studied transductive inference in machine learning, where the goal becomes that of properly propagating the tree labels from those known root nodes to the rest of the graph, such that the graph is partitioned into disjoint sub-graphs, or equivalently, each of the trees is traced and separated from the rest of the vessel network. This connection enables us to address the tracing problem by exploiting established development in transductive inference. Empirical experiments on public available fundus image datasets demonstrate the applicability of our approach. Conclusions: We provide a novel and systematic approach to trace retinal vessel trees with the present of crossovers by solving a transductive learning problem on induced undirected graphs.

J	Son, C				Son, Changman			Intelligent jamming region division with machine learning and fuzzy optimization for control of robot's part micro-manipulative task	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Intelligent jamming region division; Subregion weight; Part mating; Machine intelligence; Fuzzy optimization	PLANNING-ALGORITHMS; ENTROPY MEASURES; ASSEMBLY TASK; INFORMATION; SIMILARITY; SETS; MOTIONS; SYSTEMS	An algorithm for an intelligent jamming region division with machine learning and fuzzy optimization for the control of a robot's part micro-manipulative task is introduced. A comparison with existing works and the advantages of the proposed algorithm in this paper are described. A quasi-static part mating (micro-assembly) is accomplished using a fuzzy coordinator combined with a learning algorithm of the jamming region division while avoiding jamming. Depending on the positional relationships between a part and an assembly hole (target) in a workspace, a specific rule base for avoiding jamming is activated. The region division algorithm merges all adjoining subregions, of which the quad-tuple control values describe similar jamming states, into one region and the weights of the subregions are adjusted. A fuzzy entropy, which is a useful tool for measuring variability and information in terms of uncertainty, is used to measure the degree of uncertainty related to an execution of the part micro-assembly task. A degree of uncertainty associated with a task execution of the part micro-assembly is used as a criterion of optimality, e.g. minimum fuzzy entropy. Through a decision-making procedure, the most appropriate quad-tuple control value with the lowest fuzzy entropy in each region is chosen as a final control value to carry out an assigned task. The proposed technique is applicable to a wide range of the robot's tasks, including choosing and placing operations, manufacturing tasks, part mating with various shaped parts, etc. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Large Scale Identification and Categorization of Protein Sequences Using Structured Logistic Regression	PLOS ONE			English	Article							P-TYPE ATPASES; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; PHYLOGENETIC TREES; CALCIUM-PUMP; ION PUMPS; TRANSPORT; ORGANIZATION; SUPERFAMILY; EUKARYOTES; EVOLUTION	Background: Structured Logistic Regression (SLR) is a newly developed machine learning tool first proposed in the context of text categorization. Current availability of extensive protein sequence databases calls for an automated method to reliably classify sequences and SLR seems well-suited for this task. The classification of P-type ATPases, a large family of ATP-driven membrane pumps transporting essential cations, was selected as a test-case that would generate important biological information as well as provide a proof-of-concept for the application of SLR to a large scale bioinformatics problem. Results: Using SLR, we have built classifiers to identify and automatically categorize P-type ATPases into one of 11 pre-defined classes. The SLR-classifiers are compared to a Hidden Markov Model approach and shown to be highly accurate and scalable. Representing the bulk of currently known sequences, we analysed 9.3 million sequences in the UniProtKB and attempted to classify a large number of P-type ATPases. To examine the distribution of pumps on organisms, we also applied SLR to 1,123 complete genomes from the Entrez genome database. Finally, we analysed the predicted membrane topology of the identified P-type ATPases. Conclusions: Using the SLR-based classification tool we are able to run a large scale study of P-type ATPases. This study provides proof-of-concept for the application of SLR to a bioinformatics problem and the analysis of P-type ATPases pinpoints new and interesting targets for further biochemical characterization and structural analysis.

Traditional cytotoxic therapies, such as radiation and chemotherapy, are expensive and cause severe side effects. Currently, design of anticancer peptides is a more effective way for cancer treatment. So there is a need to develop a computational method for predicting the anticancer peptides. In the present study, two methods have been developed to predict these peptides using support vector machine (SVM) as a powerful machine learning algorithm. Classifiers have been applied based on the concept of Chou's pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAAC) and local alignment kernel. Since a number of HIV-1 proteins have cytotoxic effect, therefore we predicted the anticancer effect of HIV-1 p24 protein with these methods. After the prediction, mutagenicity of 2 anticancer peptides and 2 non-anticancer peptides was investigated by Ames test. Our results show that, the accuracy and the specificity of local alignment kernel based method are 89.7% and 92.68%, respectively. The accuracy and specificity of PseAAC-based method are 83.82% and 8536%, respectively. By computational analysis, out of 22 peptides of p24 protein, 4 peptides are anticancer and 18 are non-anticancer. In the Ames test results, it is clear that anticancer peptides (ARP788.8 and ARP788.21) are not mutagenic. Therefore the results demonstrate that the described computation methods are useful to identify potential anticancer peptides, which are worthy of further experimental validation and 2 peptides (ARP788.8 and ARP788.21) of HIV-1 p24 protein can be used as new anticancer candidates without mutagenicity.

The inherent property, such as sequence diversity and global scattering throughout the whole genome, makes it a big challenge to effectively identify the full set of T4SS effectors. Therefore, an effective inter-species T4SS effector prediction tool is urgently needed to help discover new effectors in a variety of bacterial species, especially those with few known effectors, e. g., Helicobacter pylori. Results: In this research, we first manually annotated a full list of validated T4SS effectors from different bacteria and then carefully compared their C-terminal sequential and position-specific amino acid compositions, possible motifs and structural features. Based on the observed features, we set up several models to automatically recognize T4SS effectors. Three of the models performed strikingly better than the others and T4SEpre_Joint had the best performance, which could distinguish the T4SS effectors from non-effectors with a 5-fold cross-validation sensitivity of 89% at a specificity of 97%, based on the training datasets. An inter-species cross prediction showed that T4SEpre_Joint could recall most known effectors from a variety of species. The inter-species prediction tool package, T4SEpre, was further used to predict new T4SS effectors from H. pylori, an important human pathogen associated with gastritis, ulcer and cancer. In total, 24 new highly possible H. pylori T4S effector genes were computationally identified. Conclusions: We conclude that T4SEpre, as an effective inter-species T4SS effector prediction software package, will help find new pathogenic T4SS effectors efficiently in a variety of pathogenic bacteria.

J	Jin, LN; Boev, A; Egiazarian, K; Gotchev, A				Jin, Lina; Boev, Atanas; Egiazarian, Karen; Gotchev, Atanas			Quantifying the importance of cyclopean view and binocular rivalry-related features for objective quality assessment of mobile 3D video	EURASIP JOURNAL ON IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING			English	Article						3D quality assessment; Cyclopean view; Binocular rivalry; Linear regression		3D video is expected to provide an enhanced user experience by using the impression of depth to bring greater realism to the user. Quality assessment plays an important role in the design and optimization of 3D video processing systems. In this paper, a new 3D image quality model that is specifically tailored for mobile 3D video is proposed. The model adopts three quality components, called the cyclopean view, binocular rivalry, and the scene geometry, in which the quality must be quantified. The cyclopean view formation process is simulated and its quality is evaluated using the three proposed approaches. Binocular rivalry is quantified over the distorted stereo pairs, and the scene quality is quantified over the disparity map. Based on the model, the 3D image quality can then be assessed using state-of-the-art 2D quality measures selected appropriately through a machine learning approach. To make the metric simple, fast, and efficient, final selection of the quality features is accomplished by also considering the computational complexity and the CPU running time.

However, despite the increasing number of microorganisms with well-characterized sets of essential genes, selection of appropriate training sets for predicting the essential genes of poorly-studied or newly sequenced organisms remains challenging. In this study, a machine learning approach was applied reciprocally to predict the essential genes in 21 microorganisms. Results showed that training set selection greatly influenced predictive accuracy. We determined four criteria for training set selection: (1) essential genes in the selected training set should be reliable; (2) the growth conditions in which essential genes are defined should be consistent in training and prediction sets; (3) species used as training set should be closely related to the target organism; and (4) organisms used as training and prediction sets should exhibit similar phenotypes or lifestyles. We then analyzed the performance of an incomplete training set and an integrated training set with multiple organisms. We found that the size of the training set should be at least 10% of the total genes to yield accurate predictions. Additionally, the integrated training sets exhibited remarkable increase in stability and accuracy compared with single sets. Finally, we compared the performance of the integrated training sets with the four criteria and with random selection. The results revealed that a rational selection of training sets based on our criteria yields better performance than random selection. Thus, our results provide empirical guidance on training set selection for the identification of essential genes on a genome-wide scale.

Monitoring oak-hickory forest change during an unprecedented red oak borer outbreak in the Ozark Mountains: 1990 to 2006	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						change detection; Landsat TM/ETM; normalized difference water index; in situ data; insect outbreak	ENAPHALODES-RUFULUS COLEOPTERA; NORTHERN ARKANSAS; MISSOURI OZARKS; CERAMBYCIDAE; DECLINE; MORTALITY; HALDEMAN; SCARLET; BLACK; STAND	Upland oak-hickory forests in Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma experienced oak decline in the late 1990s and early 2000s during an unprecedented outbreak of a native beetle, the red oak borer (ROB), Enaphalodes rufulus (Haldeman). Although remote sensing supports frequent monitoring of continuously changing forests, comparable in situ observations are critical for developing an understanding of past and potential ROB damage in the Ozark Mountains. We categorized forest change using a normalized difference water index (NDWI) applied to multi-temporal Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery (1990, 2001, and 2006). Levels of decline or growth were categorized using simple statistical thresholds of change in the NDWI over time. Corresponding decline and growth areas were then observed in situ where tree diameter, age, crown condition, and species composition were measured within variable radius plots. Using a machine learning decision tree classifier, remote sensing-derived decline and growth was characterized in terms of in situ observation. Plots with tree quadratic mean diameter at breast height >= 21.5 cm were categorized remotely as in severe decline. Landsat TM/ETM+-based NDWI derivatives reveal forest decline and regrowth in post-ROB outbreak surveys. Historical and future Landsat-based canopy change detection should be incorporated with existing landscape-based prediction of ROB hazard. (C) The Authors.

Furthermore, no studies on the association of hypotension with anthropometric indices have been reported. The objectives of the present study were to determine the best predictors of hypertension and hypotension among various anthropometric indices and to assess the use of combined indices as a method of improving the predictive power in adult Korean women and men. Methods: For 12789 subjects 21-85 years of age, we assessed 41 anthropometric indices using statistical analyses and data mining techniques to determine their ability to discriminate between hypertension and normotension as well as between hypotension and normotension. We evaluated the predictive power of combined indices using two machine learning algorithms and two variable subset selection techniques. Results: The best indicator for predicting hypertension was rib circumference in both women (p=<0.0001; OR = 1.813; AUC = 0.669) and men (p=<0.0001; OR = 1.601; AUC = 0.627); for hypotension, the strongest predictor was chest circumference in women (p=<0.0001; OR = 0.541; AUC = 0.657) and neck circumference in men (p=<0.0001; OR = 0.522; AUC = 0.672). In experiments using combined indices, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for the prediction of hypertension risk in women and men were 0.721 and 0.652, respectively, according to the logistic regression with wrapper-based variable selection; for hypotension, the corresponding values were 0.675 in women and 0.737 in men, according to the naive Bayes with wrapper-based variable selection. Conclusions: The best indicators of the risk of hypertension and the risk of hypotension may differ. The use of combined indices seems to slightly improve the predictive power for both hypertension and hypotension.

Extracting rate changes in transcriptional regulation from MEDLINE abstracts	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							NETWORKS	Background: Time delays are important factors that are often neglected in gene regulatory network (GRN) inference models. Validating time delays from knowledge bases is a challenge since the vast majority of biological databases do not record temporal information of gene regulations. Biological knowledge and facts on gene regulations are typically extracted from bio-literature with specialized methods that depend on the regulation task. In this paper, we mine evidences for time delays related to the transcriptional regulation of yeast from the PubMed abstracts. Results: Since the vast majority of abstracts lack quantitative time information, we can only collect qualitative evidences of time delays. Specifically, the speed-up or delay in transcriptional regulation rate can provide evidences for time delays (shorter or longer) in GRN. Thus, we focus on deriving events related to rate changes in transcriptional regulation. A corpus of yeast regulation related abstracts was manually labeled with such events. In order to capture these events automatically, we create an ontology of sub-processes that are likely to result in transcription rate changes by combining textual patterns and biological knowledge. We also propose effective feature extraction methods based on the created ontology to identify the direct evidences with specific details of these events. Our ontologies outperform existing state-of-the-art gene regulation ontologies in the automatic rule learning method applied to our corpus. The proposed deterministic ontology rule-based method can achieve comparable performance to the automatic rule learning method based on decision trees. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our ontology in identifying rate-changing events. We also tested the effectiveness of the proposed feature mining methods on detecting direct evidence of events. Experimental results show that the machine learning method on these features achieves an F1-score of 71.43%. Conclusions: The manually labeled corpus of events relating to rate changes in transcriptional regulation for yeast is available in https://sites.google.com/site/wentingntu/data. The created ontologies summarized both biological causes of rate changes in transcriptional regulation and corresponding positive and negative textual patterns from the corpus. They are demonstrated to be effective in identifying rate-changing events, which shows the benefits of combining textual patterns and biological knowledge on extracting complex biological events.

J	Folkman, L; Stantic, B; Sattar, A				Folkman, Lukas; Stantic, Bela; Sattar, Abdul			Towards sequence-based prediction of mutation-induced stability changes in unseen non-homologous proteins	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Conference (APBC)	JAN 17-19, 2014	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA				SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; AMINO-ACID SUBSTITUTIONS; NETWORK-BASED METHOD; ACCURATE PREDICTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SINGLE; CLASSIFICATION; POTENTIALS; GENERATION; MUTANTS	Background: Reliable prediction of stability changes induced by a single amino acid substitution is an important aspect of computational protein design. Several machine learning methods capable of predicting stability changes from the protein sequence alone have been introduced. Prediction performance of these methods is evaluated on mutations unseen during training. Nevertheless, different mutations of the same protein, and even the same residue, as encountered during training are commonly used for evaluation. We argue that a faithful evaluation can be achieved only when a method is tested on previously unseen proteins with low sequence similarity to the training set. Results: We provided experimental evidence of the limitations of the evaluation commonly used for assessing the prediction performance. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the prediction of stability changes in previously unseen non-homologous proteins is a challenging task for currently available methods. To improve the prediction performance of our previously proposed method, we identified features which led to over-fitting and further extended the model with new features. The new method employs Evolutionary And Structural Encodings with Amino Acid parameters (EASE-AA). Evaluated with an independent test set of more than 600 mutations, EASE-AA yielded a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.36 and was able to classify correctly 66% of the stabilising and 74% of the destabilising mutations. For real-value prediction, EASE-AA achieved the correlation of predicted and experimentally measured stability changes of 0.51. Conclusions: Commonly adopted evaluation with mutations in the same protein, and even the same residue, randomly divided between the training and test sets lead to an overestimation of prediction performance. Therefore, stability changes prediction methods should be evaluated only on mutations in previously unseen non-homologous proteins. Under such an evaluation, EASE-AA predicts stability changes more reliably than currently available methods.

Parts of the dataset are processed locally at each machine, and then the consensus communication algorithm is employed to consolidate the results. This iterative two stage process converges as if the entire dataset had been on a single machine. The principal contribution of this paper is the proof of convergence of the distributed learning process in the general case that the learning algorithm is a contraction. Moreover, we derive the distributed update equation of a feed-forward neural network with back-propagation for the purpose of verifying the theoretical results.

J	Lu, XQ; Yuan, Y				Lu, Xiaoqiang; Yuan, Yuan			Hybrid structure for robust dimensionality reduction	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Dimensionality reduction; Pattern recognition; Manifold learning; Unsupervised learning; Face recognition	TANGENT-SPACE ALIGNMENT; FACE-RECOGNITION; FRAMEWORK	In recent years, dimensionality reduction has attracted a great deal of attention in the communities of machine learning and data mining. The basic goal of dimensionality reduction is to discover the low dimensional manifold embedded in a high dimensional space. Although some existing manifold learning algorithms (ISOMAP, LE, LLE, LTSA, etc.) can capture the local structure of data manifold, they have poor performance in some recognition tasks. This is mainly because that they cannot handle well with the "out of sample" problem. Moreover, these algorithms are sensitive to the choice of nearest neighbors, which is crucial in classification. To address these problems, this paper proposes a Robust Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm With Local and Global Structure (RLGS) based on a novel adaptive weighting mechanism. Hybrid structure of local and global structures is studied. By using the adaptive weight, RLGS has the capacity of adaptively exploiting non-linear structure of data manifold and is robust to parameters. Experiments demonstrate that RLGS performs better on public face databases compared with other reported algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An important source of synthesized evidence resides in systematic reviews. However, a bottleneck in review production involves dual screening of citations with titles and abstracts to find eligible studies. For this research, we tested the effect of various kinds of textual information (features) on performance of a machine learning classifier. Based on our findings, we propose an automated system to reduce screeing burden, as well as offer quality assurance. Methods: We built a database of citations from 5 systematic reviews that varied with respect to domain, topic, and sponsor. Consensus judgments regarding eligibility were inferred from published reports. We extracted 5 feature sets from citations: alphabetic, alphanumeric(+), indexing, features mapped to concepts in systematic reviews, and topic models. To simulate a two-person team, we divided the data into random halves. We optimized the parameters of a Bayesian classifier, then trained and tested models on alternate data halves. Overall, we conducted 50 independent tests. Results: All tests of summary performance (mean F3) surpassed the corresponding baseline, P<0.0001. The ranks for mean F3, precision, and classification error were statistically different across feature sets averaged over reviews; P-values for Friedman's test were.045,.002, and.002, respectively. Differences in ranks for mean recall were not statistically significant. Alphanumeric(+) features were associated with best performance; mean reduction in screening burden for this feature type ranged from 88% to 98% for the second pass through citations and from 38% to 48% overall. Conclusions: A computer-assisted, decision support system based on our methods could substantially reduce the burden of screening citations for systematic review teams and solo reviewers. Additionally, such a system could deliver quality assurance both by confirming concordant decisions and by naming studies associated with discordant decisions for further consideration.

One notable feature of these networks in mammals is the large number of distinct proteins that catalyze the same reaction. While the existence of these isoenzymes has long been known, their evolutionary significance is still unclear. Using a phylogenetically-aware comparative genomics approach, we infer enzyme orthology networks for sixteen mammals as well as for their common ancestors. We find that the pattern of isoenzymes copy-number alterations (CNAs) in these networks is suggestive of natural selection acting on the retention of certain gene duplications. When further analyzing these data with a machine-learning approach, we found that that the pattern of CNAs is also predictive of several important phenotypic traits, including milk composition and geographic range. Integrating tools from network analyses, phylogenetics and comparative genomics both allows the prediction of phenotypes from genetic data and represents a means of unifying distinct biological disciplines.

Here, we evaluated the performance of Random Forest in upscaling airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)-based carbon estimates compared to the stratification approach over a 16-million hectare focal area of the Western Amazon. We considered two runs of Random Forest, both with and without spatial contextual modeling by including-in the latter case-x, and y position directly in the model. In each case, we set aside 8 million hectares (i.e., half of the focal area) for validation; this rigorous test of Random Forest went above and beyond the internal validation normally compiled by the algorithm (i.e., called "out-of-bag"), which proved insufficient for this spatial application. In this heterogeneous region of Northern Peru, the model with spatial context was the best preforming run of Random Forest, and explained 59% of LiDAR-based carbon estimates within the validation area, compared to 37% for stratification or 43% by Random Forest without spatial context. With the 60% improvement in explained variation, RMSE against validation LiDAR samples improved from 33 to 26 Mg C ha(-1) when using Random Forest with spatial context. Our results suggest that spatial context should be considered when using Random Forest, and that doing so may result in substantially improved carbon stock modeling for purposes of climate change mitigation.

These models were generated from unstructured clinical notes taken from a national sample of U. S. Veterans Administration (VA) medical records. We created three matched cohorts: veterans who committed suicide, veterans who used mental health services and did not commit suicide, and veterans who did not use mental health services and did not commit suicide during the observation period (n = 70 in each group). From the clinical notes, we generated datasets of single keywords and multi-word phrases, and constructed prediction models using a machine-learning algorithm based on a genetic programming framework. The resulting inference accuracy was consistently 65% or more. Our data therefore suggests that computerized text analytics can be applied to unstructured medical records to estimate the risk of suicide. The resulting system could allow clinicians to potentially screen seemingly healthy patients at the primary care level, and to continuously evaluate the suicide risk among psychiatric patients.

In this study, a new IQA method of standardizing the target object recognition rate (ORR) is presented to reflect quality. First, several quality degradation treatments with high-resolution ORSIs are implemented to model the ORSIs obtained in different imaging conditions; then, a machine learning algorithm is adopted for recognition experiments on a chosen target object to obtain ORRs; finally, a comparison with commonly used IQA indicators was performed to reveal their applicability and limitations. The results showed that the ORR of the original ORSI was calculated to be up to 81.95%, whereas the ORR ratios of the quality-degraded images to the original images were 65.52%, 64.58%, 71.21%, and 73.11%. The results show that these data can more accurately reflect the advantages and disadvantages of different images in object identification and information extraction when compared with conventional digital image assessment indexes. By recognizing the difference in image quality from the application effect perspective, using a machine learning algorithm to extract regional gray scale features of typical objects in the image for analysis, and quantitatively assessing quality of ORSI according to the difference, this method provides a new approach for objective ORSI assessment.

With the recent availability of large genome-wide data sets, often comprising several epigenetic marks, novel approaches are required to explore functionally relevant interactions between histone modifications. Computational discovery of "chromatin states" defined by such combinatorial interactions enabled descriptive annotations of genomes, but more quantitative approaches are needed to progress towards predictive models. Results: We propose non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as a new unsupervised method to discover combinatorial patterns of epigenetic marks that frequently co-occur in subsets of genomic regions. We show that this small set of combinatorial "codes" can be effectively displayed and interpreted. NMF codes enable dimensionality reduction and have desirable statistical properties for regression and classification tasks. We demonstrate the utility of codes in the quantitative prediction of Pol2-binding and the discrimination between Pol2-bound promoters and enhancers. Finally, we show that specific codes can be linked to molecular pathways and targets of pluripotency genes during differentiation. Conclusions: We have introduced and evaluated a new computational approach to represent combinatorial patterns of epigenetic marks as quantitative variables suitable for predictive modeling and supervised machine learning. To foster widespread adoption of this method we make it available as an open-source software-package - epicode at https://github.com/mcieslik-mctp/epicode.

In this paper we exploit the wealth of user-generated data, available through the micro-blogging service Twitter, to estimate and track the incidence of health conditions in society. The method is based on two stages: we start by extracting possibly relevant tweets using a set of specially crafted regular expressions, and then classify these initial messages using machine learning methods. Furthermore, we selected relevant features to improve the results and the execution times. To test the method, we considered four health states or conditions, namely flu, depression, pregnancy and eating disorders, and two locations, Portugal and Spain. We present the results obtained and demonstrate that the detection results and the performance of the method are improved after feature selection. The results are promising, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0.7 and 0.9, and f-measure values around 0.8 and 0.9. This fact indicates that such approach provides a feasible solution for measuring and tracking the evolution of health states within the society.

Chemical and Genetic Validation of the Statin Drug Target to Treat the Helminth Disease, Schistosomiasis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HMG-COA REDUCTASE; FARNESYL PYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE; MEVALONATE PATHWAY; IN-VITRO; PROTEIN PRENYLATION; ANTISCHISTOSOMAL ACTION; TRANSFERASE INHIBITORS; PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; TRYPANOSOMA-CRUZI	The mevalonate pathway is essential in eukaryotes and responsible for a diversity of fundamental synthetic activities. 3-hydroxy- 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway and is targeted by the ubiquitous statin drugs to treat hypercholesterolemia. Independent reports have indicated the cidal effects of statins against the flatworm parasite, S. mansoni, and the possibility that SmHMGR is a useful drug target to develop new statin-based anti-schistosome therapies. For six commercially available statins, we demonstrate concentration-and time-dependent killing of immature (somule) and adult S. mansoni in vitro at sub-micromolar and micromolar concentrations, respectively. Cidal activity trends with statin lipophilicity whereby simvastatin and pravastatin are the most and least active, respectively. Worm death is preventable by excess mevalonate, the product of HMGR. Statin activity against somules was quantified both manually and automatically using a new, machine learning-based automated algorithm with congruent results. In addition, to chemical targeting, RNA interference (RNAi) of HMGR also kills somules in vitro and, again, lethality is blocked by excess mevalonate. Further, RNAi of HMGR of somules in vitro subsequently limits parasite survival in a mouse model of infection by up to 80%. Parasite death, either via statins or specific RNAi of HMGR, is associated with activation of apoptotic caspase activity. Together, our genetic and chemical data confirm that S. mansoni HMGR is an essential gene and the relevant target of statin drugs. We discuss our findings in context of a potential drug development program and the desired product profile for a new schistosomiasis drug.

Did these ubiquitous spatial metaphors arise in language coincidentally or did they arise because they are rooted in a common neural computation? To address this question, we used statistical pattern recognition techniques to analyze human fMRI data. First, a machine learning algorithm was trained to discriminate patterns of fMRI responses based on relative egocentric distance within trials from one distance domain (e.g., photographs of objects relatively close to or far away from the viewer in spatial distance trials). Next, we tested whether the decision boundary generated from this training could distinguish brain responses according to relative egocentric distance within each of two separate distance domains (e.g., phrases referring to the immediate or more remote future within temporal distance trials; photographs of participants' friends or acquaintances within social distance trials). This procedure was repeated using all possible combinations of distance domains for training and testing the classifier. In all cases, above-chance decoding across distance domains was possible in the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Furthermore, the representational similarity structure within this brain area reflected participants' own judgments of spatial distance, temporal soon-ness, and social familiarity. Thus, the right IPL may contain a parsimonious encoding of proximity to self in spatial, temporal, and social frames of reference.

Glaucomatous Patterns in Frequency Doubling Technology (FDT) Perimetry Data Identified by Unsupervised Machine Learning Classifiers	PLOS ONE			English	Article							STANDARD AUTOMATED PERIMETRY; RELEVANCE VECTOR MACHINE; VISUAL-FIELD DEFECTS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL MEASUREMENTS; DIAGNOSTIC-ACCURACY; OPTIC DISC; MIXTURE; EYES	Purpose: The variational Bayesian independent component analysis-mixture model (VIM), an unsupervised machine-learning classifier, was used to automatically separate Matrix Frequency Doubling Technology (FDT) perimetry data into clusters of healthy and glaucomatous eyes, and to identify axes representing statistically independent patterns of defect in the glaucoma clusters. Methods: FDT measurements were obtained from 1,190 eyes with normal FDT results and 786 eyes with abnormal FDT results from the UCSD-based Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study (DIGS) and African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation Study (ADAGES). For all eyes, VIM input was 52 threshold test points from the 24-2 test pattern, plus age. Results: FDT mean deviation was -1.00 dB (S.D. = 2.80 dB) and -5.57 dB (S.D. = 5.09 dB) in FDT-normal eyes and FDT-abnormal eyes, respectively (p<0.001). VIM identified meaningful clusters of FDT data and positioned a set of statistically independent axes through the mean of each cluster. The optimal VIM model separated the FDT fields into 3 clusters. Cluster N contained primarily normal fields (1109/1190, specificity 93.1%) and clusters G(1) and G(2) combined, contained primarily abnormal fields (651/786, sensitivity 82.8%). For clusters G(1) and G(2) the optimal number of axes were 2 and 5, respectively. Patterns automatically generated along axes within the glaucoma clusters were similar to those known to be indicative of glaucoma. Fields located farther from the normal mean on each glaucoma axis showed increasing field defect severity. Conclusions: VIM successfully separated FDT fields from healthy and glaucoma eyes without a priori information about class membership, and identified familiar glaucomatous patterns of loss.

Accelerated training of max-margin Markov networks with kernels	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Convex optimization; Max-margin models; Kernel method; Graphical models	MINIMIZATION	Structured output prediction is an important machine learning problem both in theory and practice, and the max-margin Markov network ((MN)-N-3) is an effective approach. All state-of-the-art algorithms for optimizing (MN)-N-3 objectives take at least O(1/epsilon) number of iterations to find an epsilon accurate solution. Nesterov [1] broke this barrier by proposing an excessive gap reduction technique (EGR) which converges in O(1/root epsilon) iterations. However, it is restricted to Euclidean projections which consequently requires an intractable amount of computation for each iteration when applied to solve (MN)-N-3. In this paper, we show that by extending EGR to Bregman projection, this faster rate of convergence can be retained, and more importantly, the updates can be performed efficiently by exploiting graphical model factorization.

J	Cortes, C; Mohri, M				Cortes, Corinna; Mohri, Mehryar			Domain adaptation and sample bias correction theory and algorithm for regression	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Machine learning; Learning theory; Domain adaptation; Optimization	COVARIATE SHIFT	We present a series of new theoretical, algorithmic, and empirical results for domain adaptation and sample bias correction in regression. We prove that the discrepancy is a distance for the squared loss when the hypothesis set is the reproducing kernel Hilbert space induced by a universal kernel such as the Gaussian kernel. We give new pointwise loss guarantees based on the discrepancy of the empirical source and target distributions for the general class of kernel-based regularization algorithms. These bounds have a simpler form than previous results and hold for a broader class of convex loss functions not necessarily differentiable, including L-q losses and the hinge loss. We also give finer bounds based on the discrepancy and a weighted feature discrepancy parameter. We extend the discrepancy minimization adaptation algorithm to the more significant case where kernels are used and show that the problem can be cast as an SDP similar to the one in the feature space. We also show that techniques from smooth optimization can be used to derive an efficient algorithm for solving such SDPs even for very high-dimensional feature spaces and large samples. We have implemented this algorithm and report the results of experiments both with artificial and real-world data sets demonstrating its benefits both for general scenario of adaptation and the more specific scenario of sample bias correction. Our results show that it can scale to large data sets of tens of thousands or more points and demonstrate its performance improvement benefits. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Machine learning on brain MRI data for differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Support Vector Machine (SVM); Parkinson's disease (PD); Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP); Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Machine learning	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; MULTIPLE SYSTEM ATROPHY; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ANATOMICAL MRI; CLASSIFICATION; PATHOLOGY; MULTIVARIATE; SELECTION; CRITERIA	Background: Supervised machine learning has been proposed as a revolutionary approach for identifying sensitive medical image biomarkers (or combination of them) allowing for automatic diagnosis of individual subjects. The aim of this work was to assess the feasibility of a supervised machine learning algorithm for the assisted diagnosis of patients with clinically diagnosed Parkinson's disease (PD) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). Method: Morphological T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) of PD patients (28), PSP patients (28) and healthy control subjects (28) were used by a supervised machine learning algorithm based on the combination of Principal Components Analysis as feature extraction technique and on Support Vector Machines as classification algorithm. The algorithm was able to obtain voxel-based morphological biomarkers of PD and PSP. Results: The algorithm allowed Individual diagnosis of PD versus controls, PSP versus controls and PSP versus PD with an Accuracy, Specificity and Sensitivity > 90%. Voxels influencing classification between PD and PSP patients involved midbrain, pons, corpus callosum and thalamus, four critical regions known to be strongly involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of PSP. Comparison with existing methods: Classification accuracy of individual PSP patients was consistent with previous manual morphological metrics and with other supervised machine learning application to MRI data, whereas accuracy in the detection of individual PD patients was significantly higher with our classification method. Conclusions: The algorithm provides excellent discrimination of PD patients from PSP patients at an individual level, thus encouraging the application of computer-based diagnosis in clinical practice.

Their implementation on neuromorphic hardware platforms emulating large-scale networks of spiking neurons can have significant advantages from the perspectives of scalability, power dissipation and real-time interfacing with the environment. However, the traditional RBM architecture and the commonly used training algorithm known as Contrastive Divergence (CD) are based on discrete updates and exact arithmetics which do not directly map onto a dynamical neural substrate. Here, we present an event-driven variation of CD to train a RBM constructed with Integrate & Fire (I&F) neurons, that is constrained by the limitations of existing and near future neuromorphic hardware platforms. Our strategy is based on neural sampling, which allows us to synthesize a spiking neural network that samples from a target Boltzmann distribution. The recurrent activity of the network replaces the discrete steps of the CD algorithm, while Spike Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP) carries out the weight updates in an online, asynchronous fashion. We demonstrate our approach by training an RBM composed of leaky l&F neurons with STDP synapses to learn a generative model of the MNIST hand-written digit dataset, and by testing it in recognition, generation and cue integration tasks. Our results contribute to a machine learning-driven approach for synthesizing networks of spiking neurons capable of carrying out practical, high-level functionality.

Combining of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of morphology and kinetic features from DCE-MRI to improve the discrimination power of malignant from benign breast masses is rarely reported. Materials and Methods: The study comprised of 234 female patients with 85 benign and 149 malignant lesions. Four distinct groups of features, coupling with pathological tests, were estimated to comprehensively characterize the pictorial properties of each lesion, which was obtained by a semi-automated segmentation method. Classical machine learning scheme including feature subset selection and various classification schemes were employed to build prognostic model, which served as a foundation for evaluating the combined effects of the multi-sided features for predicting of the types of lesions. Various measurements including cross validation and receiver operating characteristics were used to quantify the diagnostic performances of each feature as well as their combination. Results: Seven features were all found to be statistically different between the malignant and the benign groups and their combination has achieved the highest classification accuracy. The seven features include one pathological variable of age, one morphological variable of slope, three texture features of entropy, inverse difference and information correlation, one kinetic feature of SER and one DWI feature of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Together with the selected diagnostic features, various classical classification schemes were used to test their discrimination power through cross validation scheme. The averaged measurements of sensitivity, specificity, AUC and accuracy are 0.85, 0.89, 90.9% and 0.93, respectively. Conclusion: Multi-sided variables which characterize the morphological, kinetic, pathological properties and DWI measurement of ADC can dramatically improve the discriminatory power of breast lesions.

J	Hermans, M; Schrauwen, B; Bienstman, P; Dambre, J				Hermans, Michiel; Schrauwen, Benjamin; Bienstman, Peter; Dambre, Joni			Automated Design of Complex Dynamic Systems	PLOS ONE			English	Article							LOCOMOTION; ROBOTS	Several fields of study are concerned with uniting the concept of computation with that of the design of physical systems. For example, a recent trend in robotics is to design robots in such a way that they require a minimal control effort. Another example is found in the domain of photonics, where recent efforts try to benefit directly from the complex nonlinear dynamics to achieve more efficient signal processing. The underlying goal of these and similar research efforts is to internalize a large part of the necessary computations within the physical system itself by exploiting its inherent non-linear dynamics. This, however, often requires the optimization of large numbers of system parameters, related to both the system's structure as well as its material properties. In addition, many of these parameters are subject to fabrication variability or to variations through time. In this paper we apply a machine learning algorithm to optimize physical dynamic systems. We show that such algorithms, which are normally applied on abstract computational entities, can be extended to the field of differential equations and used to optimize an associated set of parameters which determine their behavior. We show that machine learning training methodologies are highly useful in designing robust systems, and we provide a set of both simple and complex examples using models of physical dynamical systems. Interestingly, the derived optimization method is intimately related to direct collocation a method known in the field of optimal control. Our work suggests that the application domains of both machine learning and optimal control have a largely unexplored overlapping area which envelopes a novel design methodology of smart and highly complex physical systems.

There is a wide variety of domains in which this can be useful, i.e., assistive technologies, e-learning, e-commerce, health care or recommender systems, among others. The most commonly used procedure to obtain the user personality consists of asking the user to fill in questionnaires. However, on one hand, it would be desirable to obtain the user personality as unobtrusively as possible, yet without compromising the reliability of the model built. On the other hand, our hypothesis is that users with similar personality are expected to show common behavioral patterns when interacting through virtual social networks, and that these patterns can be mined in order to predict the tendency of a user personality. With the goal of inferring personality from the analysis of user interactions within social networks, we have developed TP2010, a Facebook application. It has been used to collect information about the personality traits of more than 20,000 users, along with their interactions within Facebook. Based on all the collected data, automatic classifiers were trained by using different machine-learning techniques, with the purpose of looking for interaction patterns that provide information about the users' personality traits. These classifiers are able to predict user personality starting from parameters related to user interactions, such as the number of friends or the number of wall posts. The results show that the classifiers have a high level of accuracy, making the proposed approach a reliable method for predicting the user personality (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Intervals are used for modeling the variability of the data that can be attributed to the repetition of learning and testing stages over the same folds in cross validation. Numerical experiments are provided that support the following three claims: (1) Bootstrap tests can be more powerful than ANOVA or Friedman test for comparing multiple classifiers. (2) In the presence of outliers, interval-valued bootstrap tests achieve a better discrimination between stochastic algorithms than nonparametric tests. (3) Choosing ANOVA, Friedman or Bootstrap can produce different conclusions in experiments involving actual data from machine learning tasks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This papers introduces and illustrates a methodology for integrated building heating and cooling control to reduce energy consumption and maintain indoor temperature set-point, based on the prediction of occupant behavior patterns and local weather conditions. Advanced machine learning methods including Adaptive Gaussian Process, Hidden Markov Model, Episode Discovery and Semi-Markov Model are modified and implemented into this study. A Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is designed and implemented in real-time based on dynamic programming. The experiment test-bed is setup in the Solar House, with over 100 sensor points measuring indoor environmental parameters, power consumption and ambient conditions. The experiments are carried out for two continuous months in the heating season and for a week in the cooling season. The results show that there is a 30.1% measured energy reduction in the heating season compared with the conventional scheduled temperature set-points, and 17.8% energy reduction in the cooling season.

In this paper the support vector machines approach is applied to an image classification task. Starting with the corresponding Tikhonov regularization problem, reformulated as a convex optimization problem, we introduce a conjugate dual problem to it and prove that, whenever strong duality holds, the function to be learned can be expressed via the dual optimal solutions. Corresponding dual problems are then derived for different loss functions. The theoretical results are applied by numerically solving a classification task using high dimensional real-world data in order to obtain optimal classifiers. The results demonstrate the excellent performance of support vector classification for this particular problem.

J	Ding, W; Liu, J; Li, YP				Ding, Wei; Liu, Jing; Li, Yanpeng			Towards a Better Trade-Off Between Sensor Accuracy and Comfort in Smart Clothing Design: A Machine Learning Approach	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND THEORETICAL NANOSCIENCE			English	Article						Smart Clothing; Sensor; Temperature Sensor; Machine Learning		Smart clothing technique is to embed sensors as well as other electronic devices into clothing to collect signals from human body and environment and make intelligent reaction accordingly. In its design, one of the biggest challenges is the difficulty to address both comfort and sensor accuracy in real-world application. Usually, skin-tight sensors yield good signal accuracy but uncomfortable feeling, while comfortable sensors loosely contacted with the skin lead to poor accuracy. In this work, we propose the idea that employs statistical machine learning approach to enhance the sensor performance by integrating the information from the inaccurate non-contact sensors, so that higher accuracy can be expected without making people uncomfortable. We justify the idea using the task of detecting body temperature using the sensors not in direct contact with the skin. We develop several types of features from the temperature sensors and integrate them in a non-linear regression model. The experimental results indicate that the method can improve the performance over 30% against the method of simple average and linear regression, which justifies the feasibility and potential of machine learning approach used for a better trade-off between sensor accuracy and comfort in smart clothing design.

Predictive soil parent material mapping at a regional-scale: A Random Forest approach	GEODERMA			English	Article						Soil parent material; Digital soil mapping; Knowledge discovery; Random forest; Environmental correlation; Machine leaming	REGRESSION TREE; CLASSIFICATION; MAP; MODELS; DISAGGREGATION; LANDSCAPE; AUSTRALIA; TERRAIN; STOCKS; RULES	In this study, we evaluate the application of a Random Forest (RF) classifier as a tool for understanding and predicting the complex hierarchical relationships between soil parent material and topography using a digital elevation model (DEM) and conventional soil survey maps. Single-component soil polygons from conventional soil survey maps of the Langley-Vancouver Map Area, British Columbia (Canada), were used to generate randomized training points for 9 parent material classes. Each point was intersected with values from 27 topographic indices derived from a 100 m DEM. RFs m(try), parameter was optimized using multiple replicates of 5-fold cross validation and parent material predictions were made for the region. Predictive parent material maps were validated through comparisons with legacy soil survey maps and 307 field points. Results show that predictions made by a non-optimized RF resulted in a kappa index of 89.6% when validated with legacy soil survey data from single-component polygons and a kappa index of 79.5% when validated with field data. Variable reduction and m(try) optimization resulted in minimal improvements in RF predictions. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of RF as a machine learning and data mining approach; however, the need for reliable training data was highlighted by less reliable results for polygon disaggregation in portions of the map where fewer training data points could be established.

Our goal is to combine two technologies: wireless communication and radio frequency tomography, for the close-in remote sensing. The hybrid system, including wireless communication devices for wireless tomography is proposed in this paper. Noise reduction, modified standard phase reconstruction, and imaging are exploited sequentially to perform wireless tomography in noisy environments. The performance given in this paper illustrates the significance and prospect of wireless tomography. The contributions of this paper are threefold: 1) the hybrid system provides a strong and flexible infrastructure for wireless tomography; 2) machine learning, especially nonlinear dimensionality reduction, is explored to execute noise reduction and combat the nonlinear noise effect; and 3) modified standard phase reconstruction is well achieved using the de-noised amplitude-only total fields from the simple sensors and the received accurate full-data total fields from the advanced sensors. Experimental data provided by the Institute Fresnel in Marseille, France are used to demonstrate the concept of wireless tomography and validate the corresponding algorithms.

However, the state-of-the-art machine-learning-based algorithms for hyperspectral target detection cannot perform well when the training samples, especially for the target samples, are limited in number. This is because the training data and test data are drawn from different distributions in practice and given a small-size training set in a high-dimensional space, traditional learning models without the sparse constraint face the over-fitting problem. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel feature extraction algorithm named sparse transfer manifold embedding (STME), which can effectively and efficiently encode the discriminative information from limited training data and the sample distribution information from unlimited test data to find a low-dimensional feature embedding by a sparse transformation. Technically speaking, STME is particularly designed for hyperspectral target detection by introducing sparse and transfer constraints. As a result of this, it can avoid over-fitting when only very few training samples are provided. The proposed feature extraction algorithm was applied to extensive experiments to detect targets of interest, and STME showed the outstanding detection performance on most of the hyperspectral datasets.

The texton forest (TF)-based method has received increasing research attention because of its speed, good generalization characteristics, stability, and especially its ability to capture spatial contextual information. In this paper, we propose a TF-based method for transition detection in remotely sensed imagery. We investigate a maximal joint-information gain criterion for random forests to better capture combined information in the bi-temporal images in transition detection, which is implemented by a natural extension of binary-trees in traditional methods into a quad-decision tree structure. We also utilize color-invariant gradient as a feature to help alleviate the impact of difference in imaging conditions on bi-temporal transition detection. The experimental results for transition detection show that our bi-temporal TF classifier achieves better performance than a post-classification comparison method and several other alternative methods.

K.; Koch, Barbara			A framework for mapping tree species combining hyperspectral and LiDAR data: Role of selected classifiers and sensor across three spatial scales	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION			English	Article						Hyperspectral; nDSM; Support Vector Machines (SVM); Random Forest (RF); Scale; Tree species classification	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; REMOTE-SENSING DATA; IMAGING SPECTROSCOPY; TEMPERATE FOREST; NATIONAL-PARK; RAIN-FORESTS; CLASSIFICATION; VEGETATION; RESOLUTION; IMAGERY	Knowledge of tree species distribution is important worldwide for sustainable forest management and resource evaluation. The accuracy and information content of species maps produced using remote sensing images vary with scale, sensor (optical, microwave, LiDAR), classification algorithm, verification design and natural conditions like tree age, forest structure and density. Imaging spectroscopy reduces the inaccuracies making use of the detailed spectral response. However, the scale effect still has a strong influence and cannot be neglected. This study aims to bridge the knowledge gap in understanding the scale effect in imaging spectroscopy when moving from 4 to 30 m pixel size for tree species mapping, keeping in mind that most current and future hyperspectral satellite based sensors work with spatial resolution around 30 m or more. Two airborne (HyMAP) and one spaceborne (Hyperion) imaging spectroscopy dataset with pixel sizes of 4,8 and 30 m, respectively were available to examine the effect of scale over a central European forest. The forest under examination is a typical managed forest with relatively homogenous stands featuring mostly two canopy layers. Normalized digital surface model (nDSM) derived from LiDAR data was used additionally to examine the effect of height information in tree species mapping. Six different sets of predictor variables (reflectance value of all bands, selected components of a Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF), Vegetation Indices (VI) and each of these sets combined with LiDAR derived height) were explored at each scale. Supervised kernel based (Support Vector Machines) and ensemble based (Random Forest) machine learning algorithms were applied on the dataset to investigate the effect of the classifier. Iterative bootstrap-validation with 100 iterations was performed for classification model building and testing for all the trials. For scale, analysis of overall classification accuracy and kappa values indicated that 8 m spatial resolution (reaching kappa values of over 0.83) slightly outperformed the results obtained from 4m for the study area and five tree species under examination. The 30 m resolution Hyperion image produced sound results (kappa values of over 0.70), which in some areas of the test site were comparable with the higher spatial resolution imagery when qualitatively assessing the map outputs. Considering input predictor sets, MNF bands performed best at 4 and 8 m resolution. Optical bands were found to be best for 30 m spatial resolution. Classification with MNF as input predictors produced better visual appearance of tree species patches when compared with reference maps. Based on the analysis, it was concluded that there is no significant effect of height information on tree species classification accuracies for the present framework and study area. Furthermore, in the examined cases there was no single best choice among the two classifiers across scales and predictors. It can be concluded that tree species mapping from imaging spectroscopy for forest sites comparable to the one under investigation is possible with reliable accuracies not only from airborne but also from spaceborne imaging spectroscopy datasets.

Evolutionary feature selection to estimate forest stand variables using LiDAR	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION			English	Article						Evolutionary computation; Forest-stand variables; LiDAR; Regression; Stepwise selection	LASER SCANNER DATA; WAVE-FORM LIDAR; NONPARAMETRIC-TESTS; BIOMASS ESTIMATION; CLASSIFICATION; MACHINE; MODELS; DENSITY; HEIGHT; PLANTATIONS	Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has become an important tool in forestry. LiDAR-derived models are mostly developed by means of multiple linear regression (MLR) after stepwise selection of predictors. An increasing interest in machine learning and evolutionary computation has recently arisen to improve regression use in LiDAR data processing. Although evolutionary machine learning has already proven to be suitable for regression, evolutionary computation may also be applied to improve parametric models such as MLR. This paper provides a hybrid approach based on joint use of MLR and a novel genetic algorithm for the estimation of the main forest stand variables. We show a comparison between our genetic approach and other common methods of selecting predictors. The results obtained from several LiDAR datasets with different pulse densities in two areas of the Iberian Peninsula indicate that genetic algorithms perform better than the other methods statistically. Preliminary studies suggest that a lack of parametric conditions in field data and possible misuse of parametric tests may be the main reasons for the better performance of the genetic algorithm. This research confirms the findings of previous studies that outline the importance of evolutionary computation in the context of LiDAR analisys of forest data, especially when the size of fieldwork datatasets is reduced.

Current signal processing methods, able to address these issues, often rely on strong prior information. In this article, a new method for tissue segmentation is proposed. It is based on a discriminative strategy, in a self-supervised machine learning approach. This method avoids the use of prior information, which makes it very versatile, and able to cope with different tissue types. It also returns tissue probabilities for each voxel, crucial for a good characterization of the evolution of brain lesions. Simulated as well as real benchmark data were used to validate the accuracy of the method and compare it against other segmentation algorithms.

In the past, several evaluation metrics have been proposed in information retrieval and web search, among them Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG) has emerged as one that is widely adopted for evaluating the performance of ranking functions used in web search. However, the two sets of parameters, the gain values and discount factors, used in DCG are usually determined in a rather ad-hoc way, and their impacts have not been carefully analyzed. In this paper, we first show that DCG is generally not coherent, i.e., comparing the performance of ranking functions using DCG very much depends on the particular gain values and discount factors used. We then propose a novel methodology that can learn the gain values and discount factors from user preferences over rankings, modeled as a special case of learning linear utility functions. We also discuss how to extend our methods to handle tied preference pairs and how to explore active learning to reduce preference labeling. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Moreover, experiments are also conducted over a side-by-side comparison data set from a commercial search engine to validate the proposed methods on real-world data.

Especially, SVM for rank learning has been applied to various applications including search engines or relevance feedback systems. A ranking function F learned by SVM becomes the query in some search engines: A relevance function F is learned from the user's feedback which expresses the user's search intention, and top-k results are found by evaluating the entire database by F. This paper proposes an exact indexing solution for the SVM function queries, which is to find top-k results without evaluating the entire database. Indexing for SVM faces new challenges, that is, an index must be built on the kernel space (SVM feature space) where (1) data points are invisible and (2) the distance function changes with queries. Because of that, existing top-k query processing algorithms, or existing metric-based or reference-based indexing methods are not applicable. We first propose key geometric properties of the kernel space - ranking instability and ordering stability - which is crucial for building indices in the kernel space. Based on them, we develop an index structure iKernel and processing algorithms. We then present clustering techniques in the kernel space to enhance the pruning effectiveness of the index. According to our experiments, iKernel is highly effective overall producing 1-5% of evaluation ratio on large data sets. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Kernel self-optimization learning for kernel-based feature extraction and recognition	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Kernel method; Data-dependent kernel; Kernel self-optimization; Kernel principal component analysis; Kernel discriminant analysis; Kernel locality preserving projection	DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; FACE RECOGNITION; PROJECTION	Kernel learning is becoming an important research topic in the area of machine learning, and it has wide applications in pattern recognition, computer vision, image and signal processing. Kernel learning provides a promising solution to nonlinear problems, including nonlinear feature extraction, classification and clustering. However, in kernel-based systems, the problem of the kernel function and its parameters remains to be solved. Methods of choosing parameters from a discrete set of values have been presented in previous studies, but these methods do not change the data distribution structure in the kernel-based mapping space. Accordingly, performance is not improved because the current kernel optimization does not change the data distribution. Based on this problem, this paper presents a uniform framework for kernel self-optimization with the ability to adjust the data structure. The data-dependent kernel is extended and applied to kernel learning, and optimization equations with two criteria for measuring data discrimination are used to solve the optimal parameter values. Some experiments are performed to evaluate the performance in popular kernel learning methods, including kernel principal components analysis (KPCA), kernel discriminant analysis (KDA) and kernel locality-preserving projection (KLPP). These evaluations show that the framework of kernel self-optimization is feasible for enhancing kernel-based learning methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The Mai Liao Wind Farm is the most important wind farm in Taiwan, and forecasting the wind power output for national sustainable development continues to be a challenging research feature. In this study, we attempt to forecast the wind power data collected from the Mai Liao Wind Farm. Our forecast model is based on a Multi-Layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP) model using the data collected at the Mai Liao Wind Farm over a period of five years from September 2002 to August 2007. We proposed a new algorithm, namely improved Simplified Swarm Optimization (iSSO), which improves Simplified Swarm Optimization (SSO) by justifying the weights and bias in training the MLP. The proposed iSSO combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Autocorrelation Function (AF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PAF) for the selection of features which increases the efficiency of the proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of iSSO outperforms the other six most popular algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is expected that not only can smart grid reduce electricity consumption, but it can also provide a more reliable and versatile service than the traditional power grid can. Although the infrastructure of smart grid all over the world is far from complete yet, there is no doubt that our daily life will benefit a lot from smart grid. Hence, many researches are aimed to point out the challenges and needs of future smart grid. The question is, how do we use the massive data captured by smart meters to provide services that are as "smart'' as possible instead of just automatically reading information from the meters. This paper begins with a discussion of the smart grid before we move on to the basic computational awareness for smart grid. A brief review of data mining and machine learning technologies for smart grid, which are often used for computational awareness, is then given to further explain their potentials. Finally, challenges, potentials, open issues, and future trends of smart grid are addressed.

In this study, a method SSEA SVM is developed using secondary structure element alignment and support vector machine. Moreover, a novel kernel function is designed to utilize secondary structure information in the support vector machine classifier. A benchmark dataset, which consists of 208 OMPs, 673 globular proteins, and 206 alpha-helical membrane proteins, is used to evaluate the performance of SSEA SVM. A high accuracy of 97.7% with 0.926 MCC is achieved while SSEA SVM is applied to discriminating OMPs and non-OMPs. In comparison with existing methods in the literature, SSEA SVM is also highly competitive. We suggest that SSEA SVM is a much more promising method to identify OMPs in genomic proteins.

Each round of panning consists of two basic processes: Selection and amplification. However, recent studies have showed that the amplification step would decrease the diversity of phage display libraries due to different propagation capacity of phage clones. This may induce phages with growth advantage rather than specific affinity to appear in the final experimental results. The peptides displayed by such phages are termed as propagation-related target-unrelated peptides (PrTUPs). They would mislead further analysis and research if not removed. In this paper, we describe PhD7Faster, an ensemble predictor based on support vector machine (SVM) for predicting clones with growth advantage from the Ph.D.-7 phage display peptide library. By using reduced dipeptide composition (ReDPC) as features, an accuracy (Acc) of 79.67% and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.595 were achieved in 5-fold cross-validation. In addition, the SVM-based model was demonstrated to perform better than several representative machine learning algorithms. We anticipate that PhD7Faster can assist biologists to exclude potential PrTUPs and accelerate the finding of specific binders from the popular Ph.D.-7 library.

It is unknown whether they can be used in discriminant analysis for diagnosis of MDD. In the present study we examined the efficiency of discriminant analysis of MDD by individualized computer-assisted diagnosis. Methods: Based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data, a new approach was adopted to investigate functional connectivity changes in 39 MDD patients and 37 well-matched healthy controls. By using the proposed feature selection method, we identified significant altered functional connections in patients. They were subsequently applied to our analysis as discriminant features using a support vector machine classification method. Furthermore, the relative contribution of functional connectivity was estimated. Results: After subset selection of high-dimension features, the support vector machine classifier reached up to approximately 84% with leave-one-out training during the discrimination process. Through summarizing the classification contribution of functional connectivities, we obtained four obvious contribution modules: inferior orbitofrontal module, supramarginal gyrus module, inferior parietal lobule-posterior cingulated gyrus module and middle temporal gyrus-inferior temporal gyrus module. Conclusion: The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method is effective in discriminating MDD patients from healthy controls. Functional connectivities might be useful as new biomarkers to assist clinicians in computer auxiliary diagnosis of MDD.

In order to improve the differential diagnosis, we combined fluorine-18 2-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-18-FDG PET), proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 MRS) and histological data to develop a multi-parametric machine-learning model. Methods: We enrolled twelve post-therapy patients with grade 2 and 3 gliomas that were suspicious of tumor progression. All patients underwent F-18-FDG PET and 1H MRS. Maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the tumors and reference regions were obtained. Multiple 2D maps of choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) of the tumors were generated. A support vector machine (SVM) learning model was established to take imaging biomarkers and histological data as input vectors. A combination of clinical follow-up and multiple sequential MRI studies served as the basis for assessing the clinical outcome. All vector combinations were evaluated for diagnostic accuracy and cross validation. The optimal cutoff value of individual parameters was calculated using Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots. Results: The SVM and ROC analyses both demonstrated that SUVmax of the lesion was the most significant single diagnostic parameter (75% accuracy) followed by Cho concentration (67% accuracy). SVM analysis of all paired parameters showed SUVmax and Cho concentration in combination could achieve 83% accuracy. SUVmax of the lesion paired with SUVmax of the white matter as well as the tumor Cho paired with the tumor Cr both showed 83% accuracy. These were the most significant paired diagnostic parameters of either modality. Combining all four parameters did not improve the results. However, addition of two more parameters, Cho and Cr of brain parenchyma contralateral to the tumor, increased the accuracy to 92%. Conclusion: This study suggests that SVM models may improve detection of glioma progression more accurately than single parametric imaging methods.

The outcome of each breeding can be affected by many management and physiological features that vary between farms and interact with each other. Hence, the ability of machine learning algorithms to accommodate complex relationships in the data and missing values for explanatory variables makes these algorithms well suited for investigation of reproduction performance in dairy cattle. The objective of this study was to develop a user-friendly and intuitive on-farm tool to help farmers make reproduction management decisions. Several different machine learning algorithms were applied to predict the insemination outcomes of individual cows based on phenotypic and genotypic data. Data from 26 dairy farms in the Alta Genetics (Watertown, WI) Advantage Progeny Testing Program were used, representing a 10-yr period from 2000 to 2010. Health, reproduction, and production data were extracted from on-farm dairy management software, and estimated breeding values were downloaded from the US Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service Animal Improvement Programs Laboratory (Beltsville, MD) database. The edited data set consisted of 129,245 breeding records from primiparous Holstein cows and 195,128 breeding records from multiparous Holstein cows. Each data point in the final data set included 23 and 25 explanatory variables and 1 binary outcome for of 0.756 +/- 0.005 and 0.736 +/- 0.005 for primiparous and multiparous cows, respectively. The nave Bayes algorithm, Bayesian network, and decision tree algorithms showed somewhat poorer classification performance. An information-based variable selection procedure identified herd average conception rate, incidence of ketosis, number of previous (failed) inseminations, days in milk at breeding, and mastitis as the most effective explanatory variables in predicting pregnancy outcome.

In the current work, a methodology for estimating the distribution of failure and survival rate of automobile components affected by multiple factors is presented. A novel adaptation of an ensemble recursive partitioning and tree-based learning method, mutually exclusive forest, is introduced. The proposed method is capable of handling a high dimensional dataset and maximizing the extracted information to estimate the distribution of mileage at failure of automobile components. Each tree in the proposed mutually exclusive forest uses a mutually exclusive set of factors in each of its constituent decision trees to classify the failure data. Information across the trees is combined to obtain the failure rate distribution of an automobile component with respect to mileage. A case study, based on real-world field failure data and censored data of automobile components, is presented to evaluate the proposed algorithm. Results show similar results to the C-Forest approach in terms of prediction quality, while generating models with significantly lower space that are easier to interpret.

The complexity of Arabic poses special challenges to researchers of Arabic NER, which is essential for both monolingual and multilingual applications. We used the hybrid approach to develop an Arabic NER system that is capable of recognizing 11 types of Arabic named entities: Person, Location, Organization, Date, Time, Price, Measurement, Percent, Phone Number, ISBN and File Name. Extensive experiments were conducted using decision trees, Support Vector Machines and logistic regression classifiers to evaluate the system performance. The empirical results indicate that the hybrid approach outperforms both the rule-based and the ML-based approaches when they are processed independently. More importantly, our system outperforms the state-of-the-art of Arabic NER in terms of accuracy when applied to ANERcorp standard dataset, with F-measures 0.94 for Person, 0.90 for Location and 0.88 for Organization.

J	Frenay, B; Verleysen, M				Frenay, Benoit; Verleysen, Michel			Pointwise probability reinforcements for robust statistical inference	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Maximum likelihood; Outliers; Robust inference; Filtering; Cleansing; Probability reinforcements	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; TRIMMED LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATOR; SPARSE APPROXIMATION; LEARNING ALGORITHM; EM ALGORITHM; REGRESSION; OUTLIERS; IDENTIFICATION; MODELS; PCA	Statistical inference using machine learning techniques may be difficult with small datasets because of abnormally frequent data (AFDs). AFDs are observations that are much more frequent in the training sample that they should be, with respect to their theoretical probability, and include e.g. outliers. Estimates of parameters tend to be biased towards models which support such data. This paper proposes to introduce pointwise probability reinforcements (PPRs): the probability of each observation is reinforced by a PPR and a regularisation allows controlling the amount of reinforcement which compensates for AFDs. The proposed solution is very generic, since it can be used to robustify any statistical inference method which can be formulated as a likelihood maximisation. Experiments show that PPRs can be easily used to tackle regression, classification and projection: models are freed from the influence of outliers. Moreover, outliers can be filtered manually since an abnormality degree is obtained for each observation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tian, YJ; Ping, Y				Tian, Yingjie; Ping, Yuan			Large-scale linear nonparallel support vector machine solver	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Machine learning; Support vector machines; Classification; Nonparallel support vector machine	NEWTON METHOD; CLASSIFICATION	Twin support vector machines (TWSVMs), as the representative nonparallel hyperplane classifiers, have shown the effectiveness over standard SVMs from some aspects. However, they still have some serious defects restricting their further study and real applications: (1) They have to compute and store the inverse matrices before training, it is intractable for many applications where data appear with a huge number of instances as well as features; (2)TWSVMs lost the sparseness by using a quadratic loss function making the proximal hyperplane close enough to the class itself. This paper proposes a Sparse Linear Nonparallel Support Vector Machine, termed as L-1-NPSVM, to deal with large-scale data based on an efficient solver-dual coordinate descent (DCD) method. Both theoretical analysis and experiments indicate that our method is not only suitable for large scale problems, but also performs as good as TWSVMs and SVMs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, a random forest classifier (RFC) approach is proposed to diagnose lymph diseases. Focusing on feature selection, the first stage of the proposed system aims at constructing diverse feature selection algorithms such as genetic algorithm (GA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Relief-F, Fisher, Sequential Forward Floating Search (SFFS) and the Sequential Backward Floating Search (SBFS) for reducing the dimension of lymph diseases dataset. Switching from feature selection to model construction, in the second stage, the obtained feature subsets are fed into the RFC for efficient classification. It was observed that GA-RFC achieved the highest classification accuracy of 92.2%. The dimension of input feature space is reduced from eighteen to six features by using GA.

Geological mapping using remote sensing data: A comparison of five machine learning algorithms, their response to variations in the spatial distribution of training data and the use of explicit spatial information	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Geological mapping; Remote sensing; Machine learning; Supervised classification; Spatial clustering; Spatial information	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; BROKEN-HILL BLOCK; IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; AIRBORNE GEOPHYSICS; WILLYAMA SUPERGROUP; DISCRIMINATION	Machine learning algorithms (MLAs) are a powerful group of data-driven inference tools that offer an automated means of recognizing patterns in high-dimensional data. Hence, there is much scope for the application of MLAs to the rapidly increasing volumes of remotely sensed geophysical data for geological mapping problems. We carry out a rigorous comparison of five MLAs: Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Artificial Neural Networks, in the context of a supervised lithology classification task using widely available and spatially constrained remotely sensed geophysical data. We make a further comparison of MLAs based on their sensitivity to variations in the degree of spatial clustering of training data, and their response to the inclusion of explicit spatial information (spatial coordinates). Our work identifies Random Forests as a good first choice algorithm for the supervised classification of lithology using remotely sensed geophysical data. Random Forests is straightforward to train, computationally efficient, highly stable with respect to variations in classification model parameter values, and as accurate as, or substantially more accurate than the other MLAs trialed. The results of our study indicate that as training data becomes increasingly dispersed across the region under investigation, MLA predictive accuracy improves dramatically. The use of explicit spatial information generates accurate lithology predictions but should be used in conjunction with geophysical data in order to generate geologically plausible predictions. MLAs, such as Random Forests, are valuable tools for generating reliable first-pass predictions for practical geological mapping applications that combine widely available geophysical data.

GASPAD: A General and Efficient mm-wave Integrated Circuit Synthesis Method Based on Surrogate Model Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Expensive optimization; Gaussian process; high-frequency integrated circuit; mm-wave integrated circuit design automation; RF circuit synthesis; surrogate model assisted evolutionary computation	MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES; OPTIMIZATION; COMPUTATION; CMOS; AMPLIFIER; GHZ	The design and optimization (both sizing and layout) of mm-wave integrated circuits (ICs) have attracted much attention due to the growing demand in industry. However, available manual design and synthesis methods suffer from a high dependence on design experience, being inefficient or not general enough. To address this problem, a new method, called general mm-wave IC synthesis based on Gaussian process model assisted differential evolution (GASPAD), is proposed in this paper. A medium-scale computationally expensive constrained optimization problem must be solved for the targeted mm-wave IC design problem. Besides the basic techniques of using a global optimization algorithm to obtain highly optimized design solutions and using surrogate models to obtain a high efficiency, a surrogate model-aware search mechanism (SMAS) for tackling the several tens of design variables (medium scale) and a method to appropriately integrate constraint handling techniques into SMAS for tackling the multiple (high-) performance specifications are proposed. Experiments on two 60 GHz power amplifiers in a 65 nm CMOS technology and two mathematical benchmark problems are carried out. Comparisons with the state-of-art provide evidence of the important advantages of GASPAD in terms of solution quality and efficiency.

Ambiguous or incorrect diagnosis results lead to long debug times and even wrong repair actions, which significantly increase repair cost. We propose a smart diagnosis method based on multikernel support vector machines (MK-SVMs) and incremental learning. The MK-SVM method leverages a linear combination of single kernels to achieve accurate faulty-component classification based on the errors observed. The MK-SVMs thus generated can also be updated based on incremental learning, which allows the diagnosis system to quickly adapt to new error observations and provide even more accurate fault diagnosis. Two complex boards from industry, currently in volume production, are used to validate the proposed diagnosis approach in terms of diagnosis accuracy (success rate) and quantifiable improvements over previously proposed machine-learning methods based on several single-kernel SVMs and artificial neural networks.

Heuristically-Accelerated Multiagent Reinforcement Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; heuristic algorithms; machine learning; multiagent systems	ROBOCUP	This paper presents a novel class of algorithms, called Heuristically-Accelerated Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (HAMRL), which allows the use of heuristics to speed up well-known multiagent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms such as the Minimax-Q. Such HAMRL algorithms are characterized by a heuristic function, which suggests the selection of particular actions over others. This function represents an initial action selection policy, which can be handcrafted, extracted from previous experience in distinct domains, or learnt from observation. To validate the proposal, a thorough theoretical analysis proving the convergence of four algorithms from the HAMRL class (HAMMQ, HAMQ(lambda), HAMQS, and HAMS) is presented. In addition, a comprehensive systematical evaluation was conducted in two distinct adversarial domains. The results show that even the most straightforward heuristics can produce virtually optimal action selection policies in much fewer episodes, significantly improving the performance of the HAMRL over vanilla RL algorithms.

A Gesture Learning Interface for Simulated Robot Path Shaping With a Human Teacher	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Gesture recognition; human-robot interaction; machine learning; robots	REAL-TIME; NEURAL NETWORKS; RECOGNITION; MOTION; REPRESENTATION; REINFORCEMENT; PERCEPTION; BEHAVIOR; MODELS; MAPS	Recognition of human gestures is an active area of research integral for the development of intuitive human-machine interfaces for ubiquitous computing and assistive robotics. In particular, such systems are key to effective environmental designs that facilitate aging in place. Typically, gesture recognition takes the form of template matching in which the human participant is expected to emulate a choreographed motion as prescribed by the researchers. A corresponding robotic action is then a one-toone mapping of the template classification to a library of distinct responses. In this paper, we explore a recognition scheme based on the growing neural gas (GNG) algorithm that places no initial constraints on the user to perform gestures in a specific way. Motion descriptors extracted from sequential skeletal depth data are clustered by GNG and mapped directly to a robotic response that is refined through reinforcement learning. A simple good/bad reward signal is provided by the user. This paper presents results that show that the topology-preserving quality of GNG allows generalization between gestured commands. Experimental results using an automated reward are presented that compare learning results involving single nodes versus results involving the influence of node neighborhoods. Although separability of input data influences the speed of learning convergence for a given neighborhood radius, it is shown that learning progresses toward emulation of an associative memory that maps input gesture to desired action.

RC has been used successfully to solve complex problems such as signal classification and signal generation. These systems are mainly implemented in software, and thereby they are limited in speed and power efficiency. Several optical and optoelectronic implementations have been demonstrated, in which the system has signals with an amplitude and phase. It is proven that these enrich the dynamics of the system, which is beneficial for the performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel optical architecture based on nanophotonic crystal cavities. This allows us to integrate many neurons on one chip, which, compared with other photonic solutions, closest resembles a classical neural network. Furthermore, the components are passive, which simplifies the design and reduces the power consumption. To assess the performance of this network, we train a photonic network to generate periodic patterns, using an alternative online learning rule called first-order reduced and corrected error. For this, we first train a classical hyperbolic tangent reservoir, but then we vary some of the properties to incorporate typical aspects of a photonics reservoir, such as the use of continuous-time versus discrete-time signals and the use of complex-valued versus real-valued signals. Then, the nanophotonic reservoir is simulated and we explore the role of relevant parameters such as the topology, the phases between the resonators, the number of nodes that are biased and the delay between the resonators. It is important that these parameters are chosen such that no strong self-oscillations occur. Finally, our results show that for a signal generation task a complex-valued, continuous-time nanophotonic reservoir outperforms a classical (i.e., discrete-time, real-valued) leaky hyperbolic tangent reservoir (normalized root-mean-square errors = 0.030 versus NRMSE = 0.127).

Quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning is a popular approach to the problem, but typically requires solving a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, which is computationally expensive. The worst case complexity of solving an SDP problem involving a matrix variable of size D x D with O(D) linear constraints is about O(D-6.5) using interior-point methods, where D is the dimension of the input data. Thus, the interior-point methods only practically solve problems exhibiting less than a few thousand variables. Because the number of variables is D(D + 1)/2, this implies a limit upon the size of problem that can practically be solved around a few hundred dimensions. The complexity of the popular quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning approach thus limits the size of problem to which metric learning can be applied. Here, we propose a significantly more efficient and scalable approach to the metric learning problem based on the Lagrange dual formulation of the problem. The proposed formulation is much simpler to implement, and therefore allows much larger Mahalanobis metric learning problems to be solved. The time complexity of the proposed method is roughly O(D-3), which is significantly lower than that of the SDP approach. Experiments on a variety of data sets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an accuracy comparable with the state of the art, but is applicable to significantly larger problems. We also show that the proposed method can be applied to solve more general Frobenius norm regularized SDP problems approximately.

Because this method requires multiple, well-trained human subjects, a more convenient approach is required to enable predictions of odor qualities. In this article, we propose an approach involving linking internal states of the olfactory system with perceptual characteristics. In the study, the glomerular responses of rats were taken to represent internal olfactory system states. Similarities between the glomerular responses of rats were quantified by correlations between glomerular activity patterns, overlap rate of strongly activated part across glomerular activity patterns, and the similarity between histograms of the strength of activity. These indices were then compared with perceptual similarities measured from human subjects in sensory tests. The results of experiments involving 22 odorants showed medium strength correlations between each index and perceptual similarity. In addition, when the 3 indices were combined using their Euclidean distance, we observed middle to high correlations (r 0.650.79) to human perceptual similarity. We also report the results of our use of a machine learning technique to classify the odorants into a similar and dissimilar category. Although the correct rate of classification varied from 33.3% to 92.9%, these results support the feasibility of linking the glomerular responses of rats to human perception.

This work develops learning-based premise selection in two ways. First, a fine-grained dependency analysis of existing high-level formal mathematical proofs is used to build a large knowledge base of proof dependencies, providing precise data for ATP-based re-verification and for training premise selection algorithms. Second, a new machine learning algorithm for premise selection based on kernel methods is proposed and implemented. To evaluate the impact of both techniques, a benchmark consisting of 2078 large-theory mathematical problems is constructed, extending the older MPTP Challenge benchmark. The combined effect of the techniques results in a 50 % improvement on the benchmark over the state-of-the-art Vampire/SInE system for automated reasoning in large theories.

Achieving to design piecewise segmentation patterns on the time series in an evolutionary fashion and use them in order to produce fitter secondary data sets, the developed system adapts itself to the nature of the problem each time and finally elects an optimally parameterized classifier (artificial neural network or support vector machine), along with the fittest time series segmentation pattern. The application of the system onto two different problems involving time series data analysis and requiring predictive and classification capabilities (torrential risk assessment and plant virus identification, respectively), reveals that the proposed methodology was crucial in finding the optimum solution for both problems. Piecewise evolutionary segmentation time series model analysis, utilized by the accompanying software tool, succeeded in controlling the dimensionality and noise inherent in the initial raw time series information. The process eventually proposes a segmentation pattern for each problem, enhancing the potential of the corresponding classifier.

Among them, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used extensively due to their generalization properties. SVM was initially designed for binary classifications. However, most classification problems arising in domains such as image annotation usually involve more than two classes. Notably, SVM training is a computationally intensive process especially when the training dataset is large. This paper presents a resource aware parallel multiclass SVM algorithm (named RAMSMO) for large-scale image annotation which partitions the training dataset into smaller binary chunks and optimizes SVM training in parallel using a cluster of computers. A genetic algorithm-based load balancing scheme is designed to optimize the performance of RAMSMO in balancing the computation of multiclass data chunks in heterogeneous computing environments. RAMSMO is evaluated in both experimental and simulation environments, and the results show that it reduces the training time significantly while maintaining a high level of accuracy in classifications.

As mobility is a key element of many processes and activities, an interesting class of information to extract is movement patterns that quantify how humans move, interact and group. In this paper we propose methods for detecting two common pedestrian movement patterns, namely individual following relations and group leadership. The proposed methods for identifying following patterns employ machine learning on features derived using similarity analysis on time-lagged sequences of WiFi measurements containing either raw signal strength values or derived locations. To detect leadership we combine the individual following relations into directed graphs and detect leadership within groups by graph link analysis. Methods for detecting these movement patterns open up new possibilities in - amongst others - computational social science, reality mining, marketing research and location-based gaming. We provide evaluation results that show error rates down to 7%, improving over state-of-the-art methods with up to eleven percentage points for following patterns and up to twenty percentage points for leadership patterns. Furthermore, we provide an analysis of the computational efficiency of the proposed methods and present visualizations for the analysis of detected patterns. Our methods are, contrary to state of the art, also applicable in challenging indoor environments, e.g., multi-story buildings. This implies that even quite small samples allow us to detect information such as how events and campaigns in multi-story shopping malls may trigger following in small groups, or which group members typically take the lead when triggered by e.g. commercials, or how rescue or police forces act during training exercises.

In this paper, we are particularly interested in attacks targeting Web services. We therefore propose a honeypot implementation for Web services, called WS Honeypot. However, the data collected by honeypots can become very large, which greatly complicates the analysis task performed by the human analyst. As a solution for this problem, we propose in this paper an automatic technique to analyze the data collected from our WS Honeypot. The proposed approach is based on four machine learning methods: support vector machines, support vector regression, spectral clustering, and k-means clustering. Our main objectives are to analyze the collected data, automatically characterizing the captured attacks and detecting the denial-of-service and novel attacks.

However, less attention has been paid to date to steady-state activities following onset activities. In this study, we used machine learning to investigate whether steady-state neural activities in the presence of continuous sound represented the sound frequency and the emotion that was associated with the sound. A microelectrode array with a grid of 96 sites recorded local field potentials (LFPs) in the fourth layer of the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats, and sparse logistic regression (SLR) decoded the sound frequency from the steady-state neural activities of the LFPs. The band-specific power at every recording site and the phase locking values between every pair of recording sites served as the input vectors for SLR. In addition, we investigated how these decoding accuracies depended on either aversive or appetitive auditory classical conditioning. We found that the SLR was able to decode the sound frequency from the steady-state neural activities as well as the onset activities and that the decoding accuracy in particular bands either significantly improved or worsened in a conditioning-dependent manner. These results demonstrated that the steady-state neural activities contained rich information about not only test sounds but also the emotions that were associated with the sounds.

Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of PCI-CT to visualize (1) structural details of the human patellar cartilage matrix and (2) changes to chondrocyte organization induced by osteoarthritis. This study investigates the use of high-dimensional geometric features in characterizing such chondrocyte patterns in the presence or absence of osteoarthritic damage. Geometrical features derived from the scaling index method (SIM) and statistical features derived from gray-level co-occurrence matrices were extracted from 842 regions of interest (ROI) annotated on PCI-CT images of ex vivo human patellar cartilage specimens. These features were subsequently used in a machine learning task with support vector regression to classify ROIs as healthy or osteoarthritic; classification performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). SIM-derived geometrical features exhibited the best classification performance (AUC, 0.95 +/- 0.06) and were most robust to changes in ROI size. These results suggest that such geometrical features can provide a detailed characterization of the chondrocyte organization in the cartilage matrix in an automated and non-subjective manner, while also enabling classification of cartilage as healthy or osteoarthritic with high accuracy. Such features could potentially serve as imaging markers for evaluating osteoarthritis progression and its response to different therapeutic intervention strategies.

This paper describes a method for generating feature measurements that characterize a lesion's vascular heterogeneity as well as a supervised learning formulation that represents an improvement over the conventional support vector machine in this application. Spatially varying signal-intensity measures were extracted from the examinations using principal components analysis and the machine learning technique known as the support vector machine (SVM) was used to classify the results. An alternative vector machine formulation was found to improve on the results produced by the established SVM in randomized bootstrap validation trials, yielding a receiver-operating characteristic curve area of 0.82 which represents a statistically significant improvement over the SVM technique in this application.

Adaptive and multi-mining versions of the DM-GRASP hybrid metaheuristic	JOURNAL OF HEURISTICS			English	Article						Hybrid metaheuristic; GRASP; Data mining; Reliable multicast	RELIABLE MULTICAST; SEARCH PROCEDURES; LOCAL RECOVERY; ASSIGNMENT	Metaheuristics represent an important class of techniques to solve, approximately, hard combinatorial optimization problems for which the use of exact methods is impractical. Some researches have been combining machine learning techniques with metaheuristics to adaptively guide and improve the search for near optimal solutions. An example of such development is the DM-GRASP, a hybrid version of the Greedy Randomized Adaptative Search Procedures (GRASP) metaheuristic which incorporates a data mining process. In this hybrid proposal, after executing half of the total number of iterations, the data mining process extracts patterns from an elite set of sub-optimal solutions for the optimization problem. These patterns present characteristics of near optimal solutions and can be used to guide the following half GRASP iterations in the search through the solution space. In this work, we explore new versions of the DM-GRASP metaheuristic to experiment, not a single activation, but multiple and adaptive executions of the data mining process during the metaheuristic execution. We also applied the data mining technique into a reactive GRASP to show that a more sophisticated and not memoryless GRASP approach can also benefit from the use of this technique. In order to evaluate these new proposals, we adopted the server replication for reliable multicast problem since the best known results for this problem were obtained by GRASP and DM-GRASP implementations. The computational experiments, comparing traditional GRASP, DM-GRASP, and the new proposals, showed that multiple and adaptive executions of the data mining process can improve the results obtained by the DM-GRASP hybrid metaheuristic-the new proposals were able to find better results in less computational time for the reliable multicast problem.

We argue that a three-way decision approach provides a more meaningful way to users for precautionary handling their incoming emails. Three email folders instead of two are produced in a three-way spam filtering system, a suspected folder is added to allow users make further examinations of suspicious emails, thereby reducing the chances of misclassification. Different from existing ternary email spam filtering systems, we focus on two issues that are less studied, that is, the computation of required thresholds to define the three email categories, and the interpretation of the cost-sensitive characteristics of spam filtering. Instead of supplying the thresholds based on intuitive understandings of the levels of tolerance for errors, we systematically calculate the thresholds based on decision-theoretic rough set model. A loss function is interpreted as the costs of making classification decisions. A decision is made for which the overall cost is minimum. Experimental results show that the new approach reduces the error rate of misclassifying a legitimate email to spam and demonstrates a better performance for the cost-sensitivity aspect.

Shane; Bertok, Peter			Efficient and effective realtime prediction of drive-by download attacks	JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Drive-by downloads; Web client exploits; Anomaly detection; Machine learning; Dynamic analysis		Drive-by download attacks are common attack vector for compromising personal computers. While several alternatives to mitigate the threat have been proposed, approaches to realtime detection of drive-by download attacks has been predominantly limited to static and semi-dynamic analysis techniques. These techniques examine the original or deobfuscated JavaScript source code to assess the potential maliciousness of a webpage. However, static and semi-dynamic analysis techniques are vulnerable to commonly employed evasion techniques. Dynamic anomaly detection approaches are less susceptible to targeted evasion, but are used less often as a realtime solution on the individual systems because these techniques are typically resource intensive. This paper presents a novel approach to detect drive-by downloads in web browser environments using low resource dynamic analysis. By dynamically monitoring the bytecode stream generated by a web browser during rendering, the approach is able to detect previously unseen drive-by download attacks at runtime. The proposed method is effective, space efficient, and performs the analysis with low performance overhead, making the approach amenable to in-browser drive-by download detection on resource constrained devices, such as mobile phones.

J	Bottou, L				Bottou, Leon			From machine learning to machine reasoning An essay	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Machine learning; Reasoning; Recursive networks	NETWORKS; SYSTEMS	A plausible definition of "reasoning" could be "algebraically manipulating previously acquired knowledge in order to answer a new question". This definition covers first-order logical inference or probabilistic inference. It also includes much simpler manipulations commonly used to build large learning systems. For instance, we can build an optical character recognition system by first training a character segmenter, an isolated character recognizer, and a language model, using appropriate labelled training sets. Adequately concatenating these modules and fine tuning the resulting system can be viewed as an algebraic operation in a space of models. The resulting model answers a new question, that is, converting the image of a text page into a computer readable text. This observation suggests a conceptual continuity between algebraically rich inference systems, such as logical or probabilistic inference, and simple manipulations, such as the mere concatenation of trainable learning systems. Therefore, instead of trying to bridge the gap between machine learning systems and sophisticated "all-purpose" inference mechanisms, we can instead algebraically enrich the set of manipulations applicable to training systems, and build reasoning capabilities from the ground up.

Previous approaches to learning these grounded meaning representations require detailed annotations at training time. In this paper, we present an approach to grounded language acquisition which is capable of jointly learning a policy for following natural language commands such as "Pick up the tire pallet," as well as a mapping between specific phrases in the language and aspects of the external world; for example the mapping between the words "the tire pallet" and a specific object in the environment. Our approach assumes a parametric form for the policy that the robot uses to choose actions in response to a natural language command that factors based on the structure of the language. We use a gradient method to optimize model parameters. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the model on a corpus of commands given to a robotic forklift by untrained users.

The capability of software agents and robots to learn how to communicate verbally with human users would obviously be highly useful in several real-world applications, and our framework is meant to provide a further step towards this goal. Whereas the large majority of existing approaches to the machine learning of word sense and other language aspects focuses on learning using text corpora, our framework allows for the interactive learning of concepts in a dialog of human and agent, using an approach in the area of Relational Reinforcement Learning. Such an approach has a wide range of possible applications, e.g., the interactive acquisition of semantic categories for the Semantic Web, Human-Computer Interaction, (interactive) Information Retrieval, and Natural Language Processing.

J	Goldwasser, D; Roth, D				Goldwasser, Dan; Roth, Dan			Learning from natural instructions	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Semantic interpretation; Indirect supervision; Structure prediction		Machine learning is traditionally formalized and investigated as the study of learning concepts and decision functions from labeled examples, requiring a representation that encodes information about the domain of the decision function to be learned. We are interested in providing a way for a human teacher to interact with an automated learner using natural instructions, thus allowing the teacher to communicate the relevant domain expertise to the learner without necessarily knowing anything about the internal representations used in the learning process. In this paper we suggest to view the process of learning a decision function as a natural language lesson interpretation problem, as opposed to learning from labeled examples. This view of machine learning is motivated by human learning processes, in which the learner is given a lesson describing the target concept directly and a few instances exemplifying it. We introduce a learning algorithm for the lesson interpretation problem that receives feedback from its performance on the final task, while learning jointly (1) how to interpret the lesson and (2) how to use this interpretation to do well on the final task. traditional machine learning by focusing on supplying the learner only with information that can be provided by a task expert. We evaluate our approach by applying it to the rules of the solitaire card game. We show that our learning approach can eventually use natural language instructions to learn the target concept and play the game legally. Furthermore, we show that the learned semantic interpreter also generalizes to previously unseen instructions.

However, the free parameters in energy function-based segmentation techniques are often set by hand or using heuristic techniques. In this paper, we explore parameter learning in detail. We show how probabilistic graphical models can be used for segmentation problems to illustrate Markov random fields (MRFs), their discriminative counterparts conditional random fields (CRFs) as well as kernel CRFs. We discuss the relationships between energy function formulations, MRFs, CRFs, hybrids based on graphical models and their relationships to key techniques for inference and learning. We then explore a series of novel 3D graphical models and present a series of detailed experiments comparing and contrasting different approaches for the complete volumetric segmentation of multiple organs within computed tomography imagery of the abdominal region. Further, we show how these modeling techniques can be combined with state of the art image features based on histograms of oriented gradients to increase segmentation performance. We explore a wide variety of modeling choices, discuss the importance and relationships between inference and learning techniques and present experiments using different levels of user interaction. We go on to explore a novel approach to the challenging and important problem of adrenal gland segmentation. We present a 3D CRF formulation and compare with a novel 3D sparse kernel CRF approach we call a relevance vector random field. The method yields state of the art performance and avoids the need to discretize or cluster input features. We believe our work is the first to provide quantitative comparisons between traditional MRFs with edge-modulated interaction potentials and CRFs for multi-organ abdominal segmentation and the first to explore the 3D adrenal gland segmentation problem. Finally, along with this paper we provide the labeled data used for our experiments to the community.

Inherent physiologic compensatory mechanisms may prevent accurate diagnosis and mask true severity in many circumstances. The objective of this project was the development and validation of a multiparameter machine learning algorithm and system capable of predicting the need for life-saving interventions (LSIs) in trauma patients. Statistics based on means, slopes, and maxima of various vital sign measurements corresponding to 79 trauma patient records generated over 110,000 feature sets, which were used to develop, train, and implement the system. Comparisons among several machine learning models proved that a multilayer perceptron would best implement the algorithm in a hybrid system consisting of a machine learning component and basic detection rules. Additionally, 295,994 feature sets from 82 h of trauma patient data showed that the system can obtain 89.8 % accuracy within 5 min of recorded LSIs. Use of machine learning technologies combined with basic detection rules provides a potential approach for accurately assessing the need for LSIs in trauma patients. The performance of this system demonstrates that machine learning technology can be implemented in a real-time fashion and potentially used in a critical care environment.

Combining Computational Methods for Hit to Lead Optimization in Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Drug Discovery	PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						bayesian models; clustering; Collaborative Drug Discovery Tuberculosis database; dual-event models; function class fingerprints; lead optimization; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; tuberculosis	HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREEN; IN-VITRO; BAYESIAN MODELS; INHIBITORS; IDENTIFICATION; CYTOTOXICITY; CHALLENGES; PREDICTION; BIOLOGY	Tuberculosis treatments need to be shorter and overcome drug resistance. Our previous large scale phenotypic high-throughput screening against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has identified 737 active compounds and thousands that are inactive. We have used this data for building computational models as an approach to minimize the number of compounds tested. A cheminformatics clustering approach followed by Bayesian machine learning models (based on publicly available Mtb screening data) was used to illustrate that application of these models for screening set selections can enrich the hit rate. In order to explore chemical diversity around active cluster scaffolds of the dose-response hits obtained from our previous Mtb screens a set of 1924 commercially available molecules have been selected and evaluated for antitubercular activity and cytotoxicity using Vero, THP-1 and HepG2 cell lines with 4.3%, 4.2% and 2.7% hit rates, respectively. We demonstrate that models incorporating antitubercular and cytotoxicity data in Vero cells can significantly enrich the selection of non-toxic actives compared to random selection. Across all cell lines, the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR) and cytotoxicity model identified similar to 10% of the hits in the top 1% screened (> 10 fold enrichment). We also showed that seven out of nine Mtb active compounds from different academic published studies and eight out of eleven Mtb active compounds from a pharmaceutical screen (GSK) would have been identified by these Bayesian models. Combining clustering and Bayesian models represents a useful strategy for compound prioritization and hit-to lead optimization of antitubercular agents.

Classification using sparse representations: a biologically plausible approach	BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Sparse coding; Classification; Predictive coding; Neural networks; Pattern recognition	DICTIONARY LEARNING ALGORITHMS; PREDICTIVE CODING MODEL; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; NATURAL IMAGES; INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS; MATRIX FACTORIZATION; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; CORTICAL FUNCTION; GENERATIVE MODEL; VISUAL-CORTEX	Representing signals as linear combinations of basis vectors sparsely selected from an overcomplete dictionary has proven to be advantageous for many applications in pattern recognition, machine learning, signal processing, and computer vision. While this approach was originally inspired by insights into cortical information processing, biologically plausible approaches have been limited to exploring the functionality of early sensory processing in the brain, while more practical applications have employed non-biologically plausible sparse coding algorithms. Here, a biologically plausible algorithm is proposed that can be applied to practical problems. This algorithm is evaluated using standard benchmark tasks in the domain of pattern classification, and its performance is compared to a wide range of alternative algorithms that are widely used in signal and image processing. The results show that for the classification tasks performed here, the proposed method is competitive with the best of the alternative algorithms that have been evaluated. This demonstrates that classification using sparse representations can be performed in a neurally plausible manner, and hence, that this mechanism of classification might be exploited by the brain.

However, manual segmentation is time-consuming and subjective. Previous attempts to automate this process were limited to high-quality scans from mice with no missing layers or visible pathology. This paper presents an automatic approach for segmenting retinal layers in spectral domain OCT images using sparsity based denoising, support vector machines, graph theory, and dynamic programming (S-GTDP). Results show that this method accurately segments all present retinal layer boundaries, which can range from seven to ten, in wild-type and rhodopsin knockout mice as compared to manual segmentation and has a more accurate performance as compared to the commercial automated Diver segmentation software.

J	Seok, HS; Kim, J				Seok, Ho-Sik; Kim, Jaebum			Computational prediction of transcription factor binding sites based on an integrative approach incorporating genomic and epigenomic features	GENES & GENOMICS			English	Article						Transcription factor binding site prediction; ENCODE; Machine learning; Genomic feature; Epigenomic feature	CHIP-SEQ DATA; GENE-EXPRESSION; DNA METHYLATION; CHROMATIN; SEQUENCE; REGIONS; IDENTIFICATION; NETWORKS; ELEMENTS; MODELS	Transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) are often predicted by sequence-based methods that use a position weight matrix or consensus sequences. However, the degeneracy of TFBSs makes the prediction of them very challenging. Recent completion of the encyclopedia of DNA elements project provides many useful additional information enabling researchers to tackle these difficulties from a noble point of view. In this paper we developed an integrative TFBS prediction method incorporating genomic as well as epigenomic features, such as DNA methylation, histone modification and chromatin accessibility. We found that (i) an integration of various features facilitates more accurate TFBS prediction, (ii) the proximity range of -500 to 500 nt relative to the transcription start site of a gene resulted in slightly more accurate prediction than the other ranges, and (iii) the proximity of an epigenomic feature contributes more than the other properties of epigenomic or genomic features to the accurate prediction of TFBSs. This study demonstrates that epigenomic features play a critical role in an integrative approach for predicting TFBSs.

Assessing Scientific Practices Using Machine-Learning Methods: How Closely Do They Match Clinical Interview Performance?	JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Applications in subject areas; Evaluation methodologies; Improving classroom teaching; Pedagogical issues; Teaching/learning strategies	NATURAL-SELECTION; CONCEPTUAL INVENTORY; SCIENCE-EDUCATION; EXPLANATIONS; STUDENTS; EVOLUTION; KNOWLEDGE; COMPUTER; CONSTRUCTION; DISTINCTION	The landscape of science education is being transformed by the new Framework for Science Education (National Research Council, A framework for K-12 science education: practices, crosscutting concepts, and core ideas. The National Academies Press, Washington, DC, 2012), which emphasizes the centrality of scientific practices-such as explanation, argumentation, and communication-in science teaching, learning, and assessment. A major challenge facing the field of science education is developing assessment tools that are capable of validly and efficiently evaluating these practices. Our study examined the efficacy of a free, open-source machine-learning tool for evaluating the quality of students' written explanations of the causes of evolutionary change relative to three other approaches: (1) human-scored written explanations, (2) a multiple-choice test, and (3) clinical oral interviews. A large sample of undergraduates (n = 104) exposed to varying amounts of evolution content completed all three assessments: a clinical oral interview, a written open-response assessment, and a multiple-choice test. Rasch analysis was used to compute linear person measures and linear item measures on a single logit scale. We found that the multiple-choice test displayed poor person and item fit (mean square outfit > 1.3), while both oral interview measures and computer-generated written response measures exhibited acceptable fit (average mean square outfit for interview: person 0.97, item 0.97; computer: person 1.03, item 1.06). Multiple-choice test measures were more weakly associated with interview measures (r = 0.35) than the computer-scored explanation measures (r = 0.63). Overall, Rasch analysis indicated that computer-scored written explanation measures (1) have the strongest correspondence to oral interview measures; (2) are capable of capturing students' normative scientific and naive ideas as accurately as human-scored explanations, and (3) more validly detect understanding than the multiple-choice assessment. These findings demonstrate the great potential of machine-learning tools for assessing key scientific practices highlighted in the new Framework for Science Education.

Manual model classification is laborious and error prone. At the same time, the automatic classification methods are scarce due to the intrinsic complexity of 3D CAD models. In this paper, we propose an automatic 3D CAD model classification approach based on deep neural networks. According to prior knowledge of the CAD domain, features are selected and extracted from 3D CAD models first, and then preprocessed as high dimensional input vectors for category recognition. By analogy with the thinking process of engineers, a deep neural network classifier for 3D CAD models is constructed with the aid of deep learning techniques. To obtain an optimal solution, multiple strategies are appropriately chosen and applied in the training phase, which makes our classifier achieve better performance. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach through experiments on 3D CAD model datasets.

In this paper, a sample-expand method is proposed as data pre-processing procedure to improve the predictive performance of the zeolite synthesis on imbalance data set. First, the data pre-processing is implemented for expanding samples by exploring the marginal structure of the given data set using k-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN). Then, the expanded data set is input to support vector machines (SVM) for classification. Finally, Q times n-fold cross-validations procedure (CVs) is adopted to assess the prediction performance. The advantage of the data pre-processing is that it can obtain stable data set for establishing the training model and abide by the classification criteria of SVM, such that the improved predictive performance is achievable. Moreover, other classical machine learning methods are also presented to accomplish the prediction task. Compared experimental results demonstrate that SVM method can reach very satisfactory predictive accuracy on the pre-processing data set. Specially, the phase diagram of gel composition is provided as a guiding role for subsequent rational synthesis experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, the structures of homologous proteins belonging to the same family contain useful information because functionally important residues are expected to preserve physico-chemical, structural and energetic features. This information forms the basis of our method, which detects RNA-binding residues of a given RNA-binding protein as those residues that preserve physico-chemical, structural and energetic features in its homologs. Tests on 81 RNA-bound and 35 RNA-free protein structures showed that our method yields a higher fraction of true RNA-binding residues (higher precision) than two structure-based and two sequence-based machine-learning methods. Because the method requires no training data set and has no parameters, its precision does not degrade when applied to 'novel' protein sequences unlike methods that are parameterized for a given training data set. It was used to predict the 'unknown' RNA-binding residues in the C-terminal RNA-binding domain of human CPEB3. The two predicted residues, F430 and F474, were experimentally verified to bind RNA, in particular F430, whose mutation to alanine or asparagine nearly abolished RNA binding.

To study how human cells response to stress, we analyzed the expression of >5000 genes in cultured B cells from nearly 100 normal individuals following endoplasmic reticulum stress and exposure to ionizing radiation. We identified thousands of genes that are induced or repressed. Then, we constructed coexpression networks and inferred interactions among genes. We used coexpression and machine learning analyses to study how genes interact with each other in response to stress. The results showed that for most genes, their interactions with each other are the same at baseline and in response to different stresses; however, a small set of genes acquired new interacting partners to engage in stress-specific responses. These genes with altered interacting partners are associated with diseases in which endoplasmic reticulum stress response or sensitivity to radiation has been implicated. Thus, our findings showed that to understand disease-specific pathways, it is important to identify not only genes that change expression levels but also those that alter interactions with other genes.

Classification of women with and without hip fracture based on quantitative computed tomography and finite element analysis	OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Bone strength; Finite element analysis; Fracture; Machine learning; Proximal femur; QCT	PROXIMAL FEMORAL STRENGTH; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; OSTEOPOROTIC FRACTURES; SIDEWAYS FALL; FAILURE LOAD; RISK-FACTORS; FEMUR; MODELS; PREDICTION; BONE	We used quantitative computed tomography and finite element analysis to classify women with and without hip fracture. Highly accurate classifications were achieved indicating the potential for these methods to be used for subject-specific assessment of fracture risk. Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) is the current clinical diagnostic standard for assessing fracture risk; however, many fractures occur in people not defined as osteoporotic by aBMD. Finite element (FE) analysis based on quantitative computed tomography (QCT) images takes into account both bone material and structural properties to provide subject-specific estimates of bone strength. Thus, our objective was to determine if FE estimates of bone strength could classify women with and without hip fracture. Twenty women with femoral neck fracture and 15 women with trochanteric fractures along with 35 age-matched controls were scanned with QCT at the hip. Since it is unknown how a specific subject will fall, FE analysis was used to estimate bone stiffness and bone failure load under loading configurations with femoral neck internal rotation angles ranging from -30A degrees to 45A degrees with 15A degrees intervals. Support vector machine (SVM) models and a tenfold cross-validation scheme were used to classify the subjects with and without fracture. High accuracy was achieved when using only FE analysis for classifying the women with and without fracture both when the fracture types were pooled (82.9 %) and when analyzed separately by femoral neck fracture (87.5 %) and trochanteric fracture (80.0 %). The accuracy was further increased when FE analysis was combined with volumetric BMD (pooled fractures accuracy, 91.4 %) While larger prospective studies are needed, these results demonstrate that FE analysis using multiple loading configurations together with SVM models can accurately classify individuals with previous hip fracture.

Hierarchical spatiotemporal feature extraction using recurrent online clustering	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Deep machine learning; Online clustering; Recurrent clustering; Unsupervised feature extraction; Spatiotemporal signals; Pattern recognition	RECOGNITION; FACE	Deep machine learning offers a comprehensive framework for extracting meaningful features from complex observations in an unsupervised manner. The majority of deep learning architectures described in the literature primarily focus on extracting spatial features. However, in real-world settings, capturing temporal dependencies in observations is critical for accurate inference. This paper introduces an enhancement to DeSTIN - a compositional deep learning architecture in which each layer consists of multiple instantiations of a common node - that learns to represent spatiotemporal patterns in data based on a novel recurrent clustering algorithm. Contrary to mainstream deep architectures, such as deep belief networks where layer-by-layer training is assumed, each of the nodes in the proposed architecture is trained independently and in parallel. Moreover, top-down and bottom-up information flows facilitate rich feature formation. A semi-supervised setting is demonstrated achieving state-of-the-art results on the MNIST classification benchmarks. A GPU implementation is discussed further accentuating the scalability properties of the proposed framework. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Young, S.

SEARCHING FOR PULSARS USING IMAGE PATTERN RECOGNITION	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: data analysis; pulsars: general; stars: neutron; techniques: image processing	CANDIDATES; DISCOVERY	In the modern era of big data, many fields of astronomy are generating huge volumes of data, the analysis of which can sometimes be the limiting factor in research. Fortunately, computer scientists have developed powerful datamining techniques that can be applied to various fields. In this paper, we present a novel artificial intelligence (AI) program that identifies pulsars from recent surveys by using image pattern recognition with deep neural nets-the PICS (Pulsar Image-based Classification System) AI. The AI mimics human experts and distinguishes pulsars from noise and interference by looking for patterns from candidate plots. Different from other pulsar selection programs that search for expected patterns, the PICS AI is taught the salient features of different pulsars from a set of human-labeled candidates through machine learning. The training candidates are collected from the Pulsar Arecibo L-band Feed Array (PALFA) survey. The information from each pulsar candidate is synthesized in four diagnostic plots, which consist of image data with up to thousands of pixels. The AI takes these data from each candidate as its input and uses thousands of such candidates to train its similar to 9000 neurons. The deep neural networks in this AI system grant it superior ability to recognize various types of pulsars as well as their harmonic signals. The trained AI's performance has been validated with a large set of candidates from a different pulsar survey, the Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey. In this completely independent test, the PICS ranked 264 out of 277 pulsar-related candidates, including all 56 previously known pulsars and 208 of their harmonics, in the top 961 (1%) of 90,008 test candidates, missing only 13 harmonics. The first non-pulsar candidate appears at rank 187, following 45 pulsars and 141 harmonics. In other words, 100% of the pulsars were ranked in the top 1% of all candidates, while 80% were ranked higher than any noise or interference. The performance of this system can be improved over time as more training data are accumulated. This AI system has been integrated into the PALFA survey pipeline and has discovered six new pulsars to date.	[Zhu, W. W.; Berndsen, A.; Madsen, E. C.; Tan, M.; Stairs, I.

J	Uragami, D; Takahashi, T; Matsuo, Y				Uragami, Daisuke; Takahashi, Tatsuji; Matsuo, Yoshiki			Cognitively inspired reinforcement learning architecture and its application to giant-swing motion control	BIOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Q-learning; Exploration-exploitation dilemma; Bio-inspired computing; Cognitive bias; Loosely symmetric model; Acrobot; Multi-armed bandit problems	DECISION-MAKING; BANDIT PROBLEM; MODEL; EXPLORATION; ACQUISITION; BEHAVIOR; ACROBOT; MAP	Many algorithms and methods in artificial intelligence or machine learning were inspired by human cognition. As a mechanism to handle the exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning, the loosely symmetric (LS) value function that models causal intuition of humans was proposed (Shinohara et al., 2007). While LS shows the highest correlation with causal induction by humans, it has been reported that it effectively works in multi-armed bandit problems that form the simplest class of tasks representing the dilemma. However, the scope of application of LS was limited to the reinforcement learning problems that have K actions with only one state (K-armed bandit problems). This study proposes LS-Q learning architecture that can deal with general reinforcement learning tasks with multiple states and delayed reward. We tested the learning performance of the new architecture in giant-swing robot motion learning, where uncertainty and unknown-ness of the environment is huge. In the test, the help of ready-made internal models or functional approximation of the state space were not given. The simulations showed that while the ordinary Q-learning agent does not reach giant-swing motion because of stagnant loops (local optima with low rewards), LS-Q escapes such loops and acquires giant-swing. It is confirmed that the smaller number of states is, in other words, the more coarse-grained the division of states and the more incomplete the state observation is, the better LS-Q performs in comparison with Q-learning. We also showed that the high performance of LS-Q depends comparatively little on parameter tuning and learning time. This suggests that the proposed method inspired by human cognition works adaptively in real environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Gowtham, R; Krishnamurthi, I				Gowtham, R.; Krishnamurthi, Ilango			A comprehensive and efficacious architecture for detecting phishing webpages	COMPUTERS & SECURITY			English	Article						Phishing; Anti-phishing; Anti-phishing framework; E-commerce security; Machine learning		Phishing is a web-based criminal act. Phishing sites lure sensitive information from naive online users by camouflaging themselves as trustworthy entities. Phishing is considered an annoying threat in the field of electronic commerce. Due to the short lifespan of phishing webpages and the rapid advancement of phishing techniques, maintaining blacklists, white-lists or employing solely heuristics-based approaches are not particularly effective. The impact of phishing can be largely mitigated by adopting a suitable combination of all these techniques. In this study, the characteristics of legitimate and phishing webpages were investigated in depth, and based on this analysis, we proposed heuristics to extract 15 features from such webpages. These heuristic results were fed as an input to a trained machine learning algorithm to detect phishing sites. Before applying heuristics to the webpages, we used two preliminary screening modules in this system. The first module, the preapproved site identifier, checks webpages against a private white-list maintained by the user, and the second module, the Login Form Finder, classifies webpages as legitimate when there are no login forms present. These modules help to reduce superfluous computation in the system and in addition reducing the rate of false positives without compromising on the false negatives. By using all of these modules, we are able to classify webpages with 99.8% precision and a 0.4% of false positive rate. The experimental results indicate that this method is efficient for protecting users from online identity attacks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wei, LY; Li, GL; Gao, X; Chen, WC; Xuan, P; Liao, MH				Wei, Leyi; Li, Guilin; Gao, Xing; Chen, Weicheng; Xuan, Ping; Liao, Minghong			A 2-Layer Web Server for Enzyme and Multifunctional Enzyme Identification	CURRENT BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Bioinformatics; enzyme family class; machine learning; multi-functional enzyme	AMINO-ACID-COMPOSITION; FUNCTIONAL DOMAIN COMPOSITION; MEMBRANE-PROTEIN TYPES; FAMILY CLASSES; PREDICTION; DATABASE	With the explosive growth of databanks consisting of protein sequences, there is an increasing need for annotating a number of newly discovered enzyme sequences. Given a protein sequence, the question arises on how to identify whether it is an enzyme or a non-enzyme? If it is an enzyme, and then which main functional class does it belong to? Since the biology experiment methods are both time-consuming and expensive, it is highly desired to develop an in silicon method to address these problems. In this paper, two effective methods are taken into consideration to constitute the 2-layer predictor: the 1st layer prediction engine respectively extracts 188-D features based on composition and physical-chemical property of protein and extract 20-D features by using position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), for determining a query protein as an enzyme or a non-enzyme; the 2nd layer prediction engine extracts 20-D feature by PSSM and is designed for predicting the main family class of the enzyme. In our experiment, multifunctional enzymes due to their specific characterstics are viewed as the 7th category of enzyme. As a result, the accuracy of 1st layer prediction reaches 98.99% (188-D) and 98.25% (20-D) using 10-cross-validation, and for the 2nd layer prediction, 97.12% by Random Forest and 98.39% accuracy by IB1 are obtained. These high accuracies indicate that the current method could be an effective and promising high throughput method in the enzyme research. Furthermore, we developed an online web server which can be accessed via http://datamining.xmu.edu.cn:8080/PredictE/.

In the application of SVM to a fault diagnosis problem, typically a discrete decision function with discrete output values is utilized in order to solely define the label of the fault. However, for incipient faults in which fault steadily progresses over time and there is a changeover from normal operation to faulty operation, using discrete decision function does not reveal any evidence about the progress and depth of the fault. Numerous process faults, such as the reactor fouling and degradation of catalyst, progress slowly and can be categorized as incipient faults. In this work a continuous decision function is anticipated. The decision function values not only define the fault label, but also give qualitative evidence about the depth of the fault. The suggested method is applied to incipient fault diagnosis of a continuous binary mixture distillation column and the result proves the practicability of the proposed approach. In incipient fault diagnosis tasks, the proposed approach outperformed some of the conventional techniques. Moreover, the performance of the proposed approach is better than typical discrete based classification techniques employing some monitoring indexes such as the false alarm rate, detection time and diagnosis time.

J	Idris, I; Selamat, A; Omatu, S				Idris, Ismaila; Selamat, Ali; Omatu, Sigeru			Hybrid email spam detection model with negative selection algorithm and differential evolution	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Negative selection algorithm; Differential evolution; email; Spam; Non-spam; Detector generation	ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE-SYSTEMS; DESIGN; OPTIMIZATION; MALWARE	Email spam is an increasing problem that not only affects normal users of internet but also causes a major problem for companies and organizations. Earlier techniques have been impaired by the adaptive nature of unsolicited email spam. Inspired by adaptive algorithm, this paper introduces a modified machine learning technique of the human immune system called negative selection algorithm (NSA). A local selection differential evolution (DE) generates detectors at the random detector generation phase of NSA; code named NSA-DE. Local outlier factor (LOF) is implemented as fitness function to maximize the distance of generated spam detectors from the non-spam space. The problem of overlapping detectors is also solved by calculating the minimum and maximum distance of two overlapped detectors in the spam space. From the experiments, the results show that the detection accuracy of NSA-DE is 83.06% while the standard negative selection algorithm is 68.86% at 7000 generated detectors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Othman, AA; Tizhoosh, HR; Khalvati, F				Othman, Ahmed A.; Tizhoosh, Hamid R.; Khalvati, Farzad			EFIS-Evolving Fuzzy Image Segmentation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Evolving fuzzy systems; fuzzy inference; image segmentation	C-MEANS; NEURAL-NETWORK; CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS; GENE-EXPRESSION; IDENTIFICATION; MODEL; CLASSIFIERS; SYSTEMS; INFORMATION; WATERSHEDS	Despite the large number of techniques proposed in recent years, accurate segmentation of digital images remains a challenging task for automated computer algorithms. Approaches based on machine learning hold particular promise in this regard, because in many applications, e. g., medical image analysis, frequent user intervention can be assumed to correct the results, thereby generating valuable feedback for algorithmic learning. In order to learn segmentation of new (unseen) images, such user feedback (correction of current or past results) seems indispensable. In this paper, we propose the formation and evolution of fuzzy rules for user-oriented environments in which feedback is captured by design. The evolving fuzzy image segmentation (EFIS) can be used to adjust the parameters of existing segmentation methods, switch between their results, or fuse their results. Specifically, we propose a single-parametric EFIS (SEFIS), apply its rule evolution to breast ultrasound images, and evaluate the results using three segmentation methods, namely, global thresholding, region growing, and statistical region merging. The results show increased accuracy across all tests and for all methods. For instance, the accuracy of statistical region merging can be improved from 59% +/- 30% to 71% +/- 22%. We also propose a multiparametric EFIS (MEFIS) for switching between or fusing the results of multiple segmentation methods. Preliminary results indicate that MEFIS can further increase overall segmentation accuracy. Three thresholding methods with accuracies of 62% +/- 11%, 64% +/- 16%, and 61% +/- 9% were combined to reach an overall accuracy of 66% +/- 15%. Finally, we compare our SEFIS scheme with five other thresholding methods to evaluate its overall performance.

This paper proposes a new symmetrical SURF descriptor to enrich the power of SURF to detect all possible symmetrical matching pairs through a mirroring transformation. A vehicle make and model recognition (MMR) application is then adopted to prove the practicability and feasibility of the method. To detect vehicles from the road, the proposed symmetrical descriptor is first applied to determine the region of interest of each vehicle from the road without using any motion features. This scheme provides two advantages: there is no need for background subtraction and it is extremely efficient for real-time applications. Two MMR challenges, namely multiplicity and ambiguity problems, are then addressed. The multiplicity problem stems from one vehicle model often having different model shapes on the road. The ambiguity problem results from vehicles from different companies often sharing similar shapes. To address these two problems, a grid division scheme is proposed to separate a vehicle into several grids; different weak classifiers that are trained on these grids are then integrated to build a strong ensemble classifier. The histogram of gradient and SURF descriptors are adopted to train the weak classifiers through a support vector machine learning algorithm. Because of the rich representation power of the grid-based method and the high accuracy of vehicle detection, the ensemble classifier can accurately recognize each vehicle.

The purpose of this study was to separate bony structures such as ribs and clavicles from soft tissue in CXRs. To achieve this, we developed anatomically specific multiple massive-training artificial neural networks (MTANNs) combined with total variation (TV) minimization smoothing and a histogram-matching-based consistency improvement method. The anatomically specific multiple MTANNs were designed to separate bones from soft tissue in different anatomic segments of the lungs. Each of the MTANNs was trained with the corresponding anatomic segment in the teaching bone images. The output segmental images from the multiple MTANNs were merged to produce an entire bone image. TV minimization smoothing was applied to the bone image for reduction of noise while preserving edges. This bone image was then subtracted from the original CXR to produce a soft-tissue image where bones were separated out. This new method was compared with conventional MTANNs with a database of 110 CXRs with nodules. Our new anatomically specific MTANNs separated rib edges, ribs close to the lung wall, and the clavicles from soft tissue in CXRs to a substantially higher level than did the conventional MTANNs, while the conspicuity of lung nodules and vessels was maintained. Thus, our technique for bone-soft-tissue separation by means of our new MTANNs would be potentially useful for radiologists as well as CADe schemes in detection of lung nodules on CXRs.

However, despite such an effort, the problem is still acknowledged to be challenging, with much room for improvements in regard to accuracy. Furthermore, most of the existing techniques are labor intensive, requiring delineations of the endo- and/or epi-cardial boundaries in all frames of a cardiac sequence. The purpose of this study is to investigate a real-time machine-learning approach which uses some image features that can be easily computed, but that nevertheless correlate well with the segmental cardiac function. Starting from a minimum user input in only one frame in a subject dataset, we build for all the regional segments and all subsequent frames a set of statistical MRI features based on a measure of similarity between distributions. We demonstrate that, over a cardiac cycle, the statistical features are related to the proportion of blood within each segment. Therefore, they can characterize segmental contraction without the need for delineating the LV boundaries in all the frames. We first seek the optimal direction along which the proposed image features are most descriptive via a linear discriminant analysis. Then, using the results as inputs to a linear support vector machine classifier, we obtain an abnormality assessment of each of the standard cardiac segments in real-time. We report a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm over 928 cardiac segments obtained from 58 subjects. Compared against ground-truth evaluations by experienced radiologists, the proposed algorithm performed competitively, with an overall classification accuracy of 86.09% and a kappa measure of 0.73.

J	Gao, YZ; Zhan, YQ; Shen, D				Gao, Yaozong; Zhan, Yiqiang; Shen, Dinggang			Incremental Learning With Selective Memory (ILSM): Towards Fast Prostate Localization for Image Guided Radiotherapy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article						Anatomy detection; image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT); incremental learning; machine learning; prostate segmentation	AUTOMATIC SEGMENTATION; RADIATION-THERAPY; CT IMAGES; DEFORMABLE SEGMENTATION; SPARSE REPRESENTATION; MATCHING METHOD; MR-IMAGES; REGISTRATION; ROBUST; BIOPSY	Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) requires fast and accurate localization of the prostate in 3-D treatment-guided radiotherapy, which is challenging due to low tissue contrast and large anatomical variation across patients. On the other hand, the IGRT workflow involves collecting a series of computed tomography (CT) images from the same patient under treatment. These images contain valuable patient-specific information yet are often neglected by previous works. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework, namely incremental learning with selective memory (ILSM), to effectively learn the patient-specific appearance characteristics from these patient-specific images. Specifically, starting with a population-based discriminative appearance model, ILSM aims to "personalize" the model to fit patient-specific appearance characteristics. The model is personalized with two steps: backward pruning that discards obsolete population-based knowledge and forward learning that incorporates patient-specific characteristics. By effectively combining the patient-specific characteristics with the general population statistics, the incrementally learned appearance model can localize the prostate of a specific patient much more accurately. This work has three contributions: 1) the proposed incremental learning framework can capture patient-specific characteristics more effectively, compared to traditional learning schemes, such as pure patient-specific learning, population-based learning, and mixture learning with patient-specific and population data; 2) this learning framework does not have any parametric model assumption, hence, allowing the adoption of any discriminative classifier; and 3) using ILSM, we can localize the prostate in treatment CTs accurately (DSC similar to 0.89) and fast (similar to 4 s), which satisfies the real-world clinical requirements of IGRT.

Early techniques of web page segmentation are mainly based on machine learning algorithms and rule-based heuristics, which cannot be used for large-scale page segmentation. In this paper, we propose a formulated page segmentation method using visual semantics. Instead of analyzing the visual cues of web pages, this method utilizes three measures to formulate the visual semantics: layout tree is used to recognize the visual similar blocks; seam degree is used to describe how neatly the blocks are arranged; content similarity is used to describe the content coherent degree between blocks. A comparison experiment was done using the VIPS algorithm as a baseline. Experiment results show that the proposed method can divide a Web page into appropriate semantic segments.

Organelle-centric proteomics enables localization of thousands of proteins simultaneously. Although such techniques have successfully allowed organelle protein catalogues to be achieved, they rely on the purification or significant enrichment of the organelle of interest, which is not achievable for many organelles. Incomplete separation of organelles leads to false discoveries, with erroneous assignments. Proteomics methods that measure the distribution patterns of specific organelle markers along density gradients are able to assign proteins of unknown localization based on comigration with known organelle markers, without the need for organelle purification. These methods are greatly enhanced when coupled to sophisticated computational tools. Here we apply and compare multiple approaches to establish a high-confidence data set of Arabidopsis root tissue trans-Golgi network (TCN) proteins. The method employed involves immunoisolations of the TGN, coupled to probability-based organelle proteomics techniques. Specifically, the technique known as LOPIT (localization of organelle protein by isotope tagging), couples density centrifugation with quantitative mass-spectometry-based proteomics using isobaric labeling and targeted methods with semisupervised machine learning methods. We demonstrate that while the immunoisolation method gives rise to a significant data set, the approach is unable to distinguish cargo proteins and persistent contaminants from full-time residents of the TGN. The LOPIT approach, however, returns information about many subcellular niches simultaneously and the steady-state location of proteins. Importantly, therefore, it is able to dissect proteins present in more than one organelle and cargo proteins en route to other cellular destinations from proteins whose steady-state location favors the TGN. Using this approach, we present a robust list of Arabidopsis TGN proteins.

Frequently, one also runs post-processors such as Percolator to assess the confidence, infer unique peptides, and increase the number of identifications. A recent search engine, MS-GF+, has shown promising results, due to a new and efficient scoring algorithm. However, MS-GF+ provides few statistical estimates about the peptide-spectrum matches, hence limiting the biological interpretation. Here, we enabled Percolator processing for MS-GF+ output and observed an increased number of identified peptides for a wide variety of data sets. In addition, Percolator directly reports p values and false discovery rate estimates, such as q values and posterior error probabilities, for peptide-spectrum matches, peptides, and proteins, functions that are useful for the whole proteomics community.

The essence of rough set approach to feature selection is to find a subset of the original features. It is, however, an NP-hard problem finding a minimal subset of the features, and it is necessary to investigate effective and efficient heuristic algorithms. This paper presents a novel rough set approach to feature selection based on scatter search metaheuristic. The proposed method, called scatter search rough set attribute reduction (SSAR), is illustrated by 13 well known datasets from UCI machine learning repository. The proposed heuristic strategy is compared with typical attribute reduction methods including genetic algorithm, ant colony, simulated annealing, and Tabu search. Computational results demonstrate that our algorithm can provide efficient solution to find a minimal subset of the features and show promising and competitive performance on the considered datasets.

In this paper, the data imbalance problem in semantic extraction under massive video dataset is exploited, and enhanced and hierarchical structure (called EHS) algorithm is proposed. In proposed algorithm, data sampling, filtering and model training are considered and integrated together compactly via hierarchical structure algorithm, thus, the performance of model can be improved step by step, and is robust and stability with the change of features and datasets. Experiments on TRECVID2010 Semantic Indexing demonstrate that our proposed algorithm has much more powerful performance than that of traditional machine learning algorithms, and keeps stable and robust when different kinds of features are employed. Extended experiments on TRECVID2010 Surveillance Event Detection also prove that our EHS algorithm is efficient and effective, and reaches top performance in four of seven events.

Discovery of directional and nondirectional pioneer transcription factors by modeling DNase profile magnitude and shape	NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							EMBRYONIC STEM-CELLS; IN-VIVO; COMPACTED CHROMATIN; HUMAN GENOME; BINDING; NETWORK; GENES; PLURIPOTENCY; REPRESSION; RESOLUTION	We describe protein interaction quantitation (PIQ), a computational method for modeling the magnitude and shape of genome-wide DNase I hypersensitivity profiles to identify transcription factor (TF) binding sites. Through the use of machine-learning techniques, PIQ identified binding sites for >700 TFs from one DNase I hypersensitivity analysis followed by sequencing (DNase-seq) experiment with accuracy comparable to that of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq). We applied PIQ to analyze DNase-seq data from mouse embryonic stem cells differentiating into prepancreatic and intestinal endoderm. We identified 120 and experimentally validated eight 'pioneer' TF families that dynamically open chromatin. Four pioneer TF families only opened chromatin in one direction from their motifs. Furthermore, we identified 'settler' TFs whose genomic binding is principally governed by proximity to open chromatin. Our results support a model of hierarchical TF binding in which directional and nondirectional pioneer activity shapes the chromatin landscape for population by settler TFs.

Previous neuroimaging studies have investigated the brain at the voxel level using mass-univariate methods which do not enable detection of more complex patterns of activity and structural alterations that may separate SAD from healthy individuals. Support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning method that capitalizes on brain activation and structural patterns to classify individuals. The aim of this study was to investigate if it is possible to discriminate SAD patients (n = 14) from healthy controls (n = 12) using SVM based on (1) functional magnetic resonance imaging during fearful face processing and (2) regional gray matter volume. Whole brain and region of interest (fear network) SVM analyses were performed for both modalities. For functional scans, significant classifications were obtained both at whole brain level and when restricting the analysis to the fear network while gray matter SVM analyses correctly classified participants only when using the whole brain search volume. These results support that SAD is characterized by aberrant neural activation to affective stimuli in the fear network, while disorder-related alterations in regional gray matter volume are more diffusely distributed over the whole brain. SVM may thus be useful for identifying imaging biomarkers of SAD. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The spread of the oil spill and its consequences thereof had various environmental impacts. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the American Statistical Association (ASA) have made available a few datasets containing information of the oil spill. In this paper, we analyzed four of these datasets in order to explore the use of applied statistics and machine learning methods to understand the spread of the oil spill. In particular, we analysed the "gliders, floats, boats" and "birds" data. The former contains various measurements on sea water such as salinity, temperature, spacial locations, depth and time. The latter contains information on the living conditions of birds, such as living status, oil conditions, locations and time. A varying-coefficients logistic regression was fitted to the birds data. The result indicated that the oil was spreading more quickly along the East-West direction. Analysis via boosted trees and logistic regression showed similar results based on the information provided by the above data.

Generating fuzzy rules by learning from olive tree transpiration measurement - An algorithm to automatize Granier sap flow data analysis	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Fuzzy rule; Machine learning; Sap flow measurement; Plant transpiration; Granier method	NATURAL TEMPERATURE-GRADIENTS; THERMAL DISSIPATION PROBES; SAPFLOW MEASUREMENTS; FLUX-DENSITY; HEAT-BALANCE; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; OPTIMIZATION; CALIBRATION; EXAMPLES; SYSTEM	The present study aims at developing an intelligent system of automating data analysis and prediction embedded in a fuzzy logic algorithm (FAUSY) to capture the relationship between environmental variables and sap flow measurements (Granier method). Environmental thermal gradients often interfere with Granier sap flow measurements since this method uses heat as a tracer, thus introducing a bias in transpiration flux calculation. The FAUSY algorithm is applied to solve measurement problems and provides an approximate and yet effective way of finding the relationship between the environmental variables and the natural temperature gradient (NTG), which is too complex or too ill-defined for precise mathematical analysis. In the process, FAUSY extracts the relationships from a set of input-output environmental observations, thus general directions for algorithm-based machine learning in fuzzy systems are outlined. Through an iterative procedure, the algorithm plays with the learning or forecasting via a simulated model. After a series of error control iterations, the outcome of the algorithm may become highly refined and be able to evolve into a more formal structure of rules, facilitating the automation of Granier sap flow data analysis. The system presented herein simulates the occurrence of NTG with reasonable accuracy, with an average residual error of 2.53% for sap flux rate, when compared to data processing performed in the usual way. For practical applications, this is an acceptable margin of error given that FAUSY could correct NTG errors up to an average of 76% of the normal manual correction process. In this sense, FAUSY provides a powerful and flexible way of establishing the relationships between the environment and NTG occurrences. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Silvestre, J.

A machine learning approach to automatic stroke segmentation	COMPUTERS & GRAPHICS-UK			English	Article						Pen stroke segmentation; Sketch understanding; Pen-based user interfaces; Machine learning		We present ClassySeg, a technique for segmenting hand-drawn pen strokes into lines and arcs. ClassySeg employs machine learning techniques to infer the segmentation intended by the drawer. The technique begins by identifying a set of candidate segment windows, each comprising a curvature maximum and its neighboring points. Features are computed for each point in each window based on curvature and other geometric properties. Most of these features are adapted from numerous prior segmentation approaches, effectively combining their strengths. These features are used to train a statistical classifier to identify which candidate windows contain true segment points. ClassySeg is more accurate than previous techniques for both user-independent and user-optimized training conditions. More importantly, ClassySeg represents a movement away from prior, heuristic-based approaches, toward a more general and extensible technique. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Development and Validation of an Improved Neurological Hemifield Test to Identify Chiasmal and Postchiasmal Lesions by Automated Perimetry	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article						glaucoma; visual field; neurological disease; neuro-ophthalmology; chiasm; homonymous; bitemporal; algorithm	FUNCTIONAL MEASUREMENTS; GLAUCOMA DIAGNOSIS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; PROGRESSION; CLASSIFIERS; ALGORITHMS; REGRESSION; EYES	PURPOSE. To improve the neurological hemifield test (NHT) using visual field data from both eyes to detect and classify visual field loss caused by chiasmal or postchiasmal lesions. METHODS. Visual field and clinical data for 633 patients were divided into a training set (474 cases) and a validation set (159 cases). Each set had equal numbers of neurological, glaucoma, or glaucoma suspect cases, matched for age and for mean deviation between neurological and glaucoma cases. NHT scores as previously described and a new NHT laterality score were calculated. The ability of these scores to distinguish neurological from other fields was assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Three machine classifier algorithms were also evaluated: decision tree, random forest, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We also evaluated the ability of NHT to identify the type of neurological field defect (homonymous or bitemporal). RESULTS. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the maximum NHT score was 0.92 (confidence interval [CI]: 0.87, 0.97). Using NHT laterality scores from each eye combined with the sum of NHT scores, the AUC improved to 0.93 (CI: 0.88, 0.98). The largest AUC for machine learning algorithms was for the LASSO method (0.96, CI: 0.92, 0.99). The NHT scores identified the type of neurological defect in 96% (158/164) of patients. CONCLUSIONS. The new NHT distinguished neurological field defects from those of glaucoma and glaucoma suspects, providing accurate categorization of defect type. Its implementation may identify unsuspected neurological disease in clinical visual field testing.

The large variation in call types of these species makes it challenging to categorize them. In this study, sounds recorded by audio sensors carried by ten killer whales and eight pilot whales close to the coasts of Norway, Iceland, and the Bahamas were analyzed using computer methods and citizen scientists as part of the Whale FM project. Results show that the computer analysis automatically separated the killer whales into Icelandic and Norwegian whales, and the pilot whales were separated into Norwegian long-finned and Bahamas short-finned pilot whales, showing that at least some whales from these two locations have different acoustic repertoires that can be sensed by the computer analysis. The citizen science analysis was also able to separate the whales to locations by their sounds, but the separation was somewhat less accurate compared to the computer method.

J	Danger, R; Pla, F; Molina, A; Rosso, P				Danger, Roxana; Pla, Ferran; Molina, Antonio; Rosso, Paolo			Towards a Protein-Protein Interaction information extraction system: Recognizing named entities	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Biomedical named entity recognition; Protein-Protein Interaction; Dictionary look-up; Conditional random field; Support vector machine	RECOGNITION; DATABASE; UPDATE	The majority of biological functions of any living being are related to Protein-Protein Interactions (PPI). PPI discoveries are reported in form of research publications whose volume grows day after day. Consequently, automatic PPI information extraction systems are a pressing need for biologists. In this paper we are mainly concerned with the named entity detection module of PPIES (the PPI information extraction system we are implementing) which recognizes twelve entity types relevant in PPI context. It is composed of two sub-modules: a dictionary look-up with extensive normalization and acronym detection, and a Conditional Random Field classifier. The dictionary look-up module has been tested with Interaction Method Task (IMT), and it improves by approximately 10% the current solutions that do not use Machine Learning (ML). The second module has been used to create a classifier using the Joint Workshop on Natural Language Processing in Biomedicine and its Applications (JNLPBA'04) data set. It does not use any external resources, or complex or ad hoc post-processing, and obtains 77.25%, 75.04% and 76.13 for precision, recall, and F1-measure, respectively, improving all previous results obtained for this data set.

The goal of this paper is to propose a method for hypermotor seizure detection based on accelerometers that are attached to the extremities. Methods: Supervised methods that are commonly used in literature need annotation of data and hence require expert (neurologist) interaction resulting in a substantial cost. In this paper an unsupervised method is proposed that uses extreme value statistics and seizure detection based on a model of normal behavior that is estimated using all recorded and unlabeled data. In this way the expensive interaction can be avoided. Results: When applying this method to a labeled dataset, acquired from 7 patients, all hypermotor seizures are detected in 5 of the 7 patients with an average positive predictive value (PPV) of 53%. For evaluating the performance on an unlabeled dataset, seizure events are presented to the system as normal movement events. Since hypermotor seizures are rare compared to normal movements, the very few abnormal events have a negligible effect on the quality of the model. In this way, it was possible to evaluate the system for 3 of the 7 patients when 3% of the training set was composed of seizure events. This resulted in sensitivity scores of 80%, 22% and 90% and a PPV of 89%, 21% and 44% respectively. These scores are comparable with a state-of-the-art supervisal machine learning based approach which requires a labeled dataset. Conclusions: A person-dependent epileptic seizure detection method has been designed that requires little human interaction. In contrast to traditional machine learning approaches, the imbalance of the dataset does not cause substantial difficulties. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This approach uses concentrations of methyl mercaptan in mouth air as an indicator of oral malodor, and peak areas of terminal restriction fragment (T-RF) length polyrnorphisms (T-RFLPs) of the 16S rRNA gene as data for supervised machine-learning methods, without identifying specific species producing oral malodorous compounds. Methods: 1 6S rRNA genes were amplified from saliva samples from 309 subjects, and T-RFLP analysis was carried out with the DNA fragments. T-RFLP analysis provides information on microbiota consisting of fragment lengths and peak areas corresponding to bacterial strains. The peak area is equivalent to the frequency of a specific fragment when one molecule is selected from terminal fragments. Another frequency is obtained by dividing the number of species-containing samples by the total number of samples. An SVM, an ANN, and a decision tree were trained based on these two frequencies in 308 samples and classified the presence or absence of methyl mercaptan in mouth air from the remaining subject. Results: The proportion that trained SVM expressed as entropy achieved the highest classification accuracy, with a sensitivity of 51.1% and specificity of 95.0%. The ANN and decision tree provided lower classification accuracies, and only classification by the ANN was improved by weighting with entropy from the frequency of appearance in samples, which increased the accuracy to 81.9% with a sensitivity of 60.2% and a specificity of 90.5%. The decision tree showed low classification accuracy under all conditions. Conclusions: Using T-RF proportions and frequencies, models to classify the presence of methyl mercaptan, a volatile sulfur-containing compound that causes oral malodor, were developed. SVM classifiers successfully classified the presence of methyl mercaptan with high specificity, and this classification is expected to be useful for screening saliva for oral malodor before visits to specialist clinics. Classification by a SVM and an ANN does not require the identification of the oral microbiota species responsible for the malodor, and the ANN also does not require the proportions of T-RFs.

In particular, we investigate whether it is possible to extract useful information from tests that would be normally discarded because they are considered unreliable. Methods: We set up a predictive modelling framework to predict glaucoma severity from visual field (VF) tests sensitivities in different reliability scenarios. Three quality indicators were considered in this study: false positives rate, false negatives rate and fixation losses. Glaucoma severity was evaluated by considering a 3-levels version of the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study scoring metric. A bootstrapping and class balancing technique was designed to overcome problems related to small sample size and unbalanced classes. As a classification model we selected Naive Bayes. We also evaluated Bayesian networks to understand the relationships between the different anatomical sectors on the VF map. Results: The methods were tested on a data set of 28,778 VF tests collected at Moorfields Eye Hospital between 1986 and 2010. Applying Friedman test followed by the post hoc Tukey's honestly significant difference test, we observed that the classifiers trained on any kind of test, regardless of its reliability, showed comparable performance with respect to the classifier trained only considering totally reliable tests (p-value >0.01). Moreover, we showed that different quality indicators gave different effects on prediction results. Training classifiers using tests that exceeded the fixation losses threshold did not have a deteriorating impact on classification results (p-value >0.01). On the contrary, using only tests that fail to comply with the constraint on false negatives significantly decreased the accuracy of the results (p-value <0.01). Meaningful patterns related to glaucoma evolution were also extracted. Conclusions: Results showed that classification modelling is not negatively affected by the inclusion of less reliable tests in the training process. This means that less reliable tests do not subtract useful information from a model trained using only completely reliable data. Future work will be devoted to exploring new quantitative thresholds to ensure high quality testing and low re-test rates. This could assist doctors in tuning patient follow-up and therapeutic plans, possibly slowing down disease progression. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Boosting Techniques for Physics-Based Vortex Detection	COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM			English	Article						flow visualization; methods and applications; scientific visualization; visualization; machine learning	NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; COHERENT STRUCTURES; BOUNDARY-LAYER; IDENTIFICATION; FLOW; VISUALIZATION; TURBULENCE	Robust automated vortex detection algorithms are needed to facilitate the exploration of large-scale turbulent fluid flow simulations. Unfortunately, robust non-local vortex detection algorithms are computationally intractable for large data sets and local algorithms, while computationally tractable, lack robustness. We argue that the deficiencies inherent to the local definitions occur because of two fundamental issues: the lack of a rigorous definition of a vortex and the fact that a vortex is an intrinsically non-local phenomenon. As a first step towards addressing this problem, we demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques to enhance the robustness of local vortex detection algorithms. We motivate the presence of an expert-in-the-loop using empirical results based on machine learning techniques. We employ adaptive boosting to combine a suite of widely used, local vortex detection algorithms, which we term weak classifiers, into a robust compound classifier. Fundamentally, the training phase of the algorithm, in which an expert manually labels small, spatially contiguous regions of the data, incorporates non-local information into the resulting compound classifier. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by applying the compound classifier to two data sets obtained from computational fluid dynamical simulations. Our results demonstrate that the compound classifier has a reduced misclassification rate relative to the component classifiers.

Application of machine learning techniques to analyse the effects of physical exercise in ventricular fibrillation	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Machine learning; Classification; Knowledge extraction; Logistic regression; Multilayer perceptron; Extreme learning machine; Ventricular fibrillation; Physical exercise	ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; REGULARITY; HUMANS; HEART	This work presents the application of machine learning techniques to analyse the influence of physical exercise in the physiological properties of the heart, during ventricular fibrillation. To this end, different kinds of classifiers (linear and neural models) are used to classify between trained and sedentary rabbit hearts. The use of those classifiers in combination with a wrapper feature selection algorithm allows to extract knowledge about the most relevant features in the problem. The obtained results show that neural models outperform linear classifiers (better performance indices and a better dimensionality reduction).

Normally, members from the same miRNA family have similar physiological functions; however, they are not always conserved in primary sequence or secondary structure. Proper family prediction from primary sequence will be helpful for accurate identification and further functional annotation of novel miRNA. Therefore, we introduced a novel machine learning-based web server, the miRCIassify, which can rapidly identify miRNA from the primary sequence and classify it into a miRNA family regardless of similarity in sequence and structure. Additionally, the medical implication of the miRNA family is also provided when it is available in PubMed.

Sentiment analysis in Facebook and its application to e-learning	COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Sentiment analysis; Social networks; User modeling; Adaptive e-learning		This paper presents a new method for sentiment analysis in Facebook that, starting from messages written by users, supports: (i) to extract information about the users' sentiment polarity (positive, neutral or negative), as transmitted in the messages they write; and (ii) to model the users' usual sentiment polarity and to detect significant emotional changes. We have implemented this method in SentBuk, a Facebook application also presented in this paper. SentBuk retrieves messages written by users in Facebook and classifies them according to their polarity, showing the results to the users through an interactive interface. It also supports emotional change detection, friend's emotion finding, user classification according to their messages, and statistics, among others. The classification method implemented in SentBuk follows a hybrid approach: it combines lexical-based and machine-learning techniques. The results obtained through this approach show that it is feasible to perform sentiment analysis in Facebook with high accuracy (83.27%). In the context of e-learning, it is very useful to have information about the users' sentiments available. On one hand, this information can be used by adaptive e-learning systems to support personalized learning, by considering the user's emotional state when recommending him/her the most suitable activities to be tackled at each time. On the other hand, the students' sentiments towards a course can serve as feedback for teachers, especially in the case of online learning, where face-to-face contact is less frequent. The usefulness of this work in the context of e-learning, both for teachers and for adaptive systems, is described too. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The grey stage is the final stage which leads to almost complete defoliation resulting in dead standing trees or snags. Dead standing pine trees however, could also be due to the lightning damage. Hence, the objective of the present study was to distinguish amongst healthy, sirex grey-attacked and lightning-damaged pine trees using AISA Eagle hyperspectral data, random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) classifiers. Our study also presents an opportunity to look at the possibility of separating amongst the previously mentioned pine trees damage classes and other landscape classes on the study area. The results of the present study revealed the robustness of the two machine learning classifiers with an overall accuracy of 74.50% (total disagreement = 26%) for RF and 73.50% (total disagreement = 27%) for SVM using all the remaining AISA Eagle spectral bands after removing the noisy ones. When the most useful spectral bands as measured by RF were exploited, the overall accuracy was considerably improved; 78% (total disagreement = 22%) for RF and 76.50% (total disagreement = 24%) for SVM. There was no significant difference between the performances of the two classifiers as demonstrated by the results of McNemar's test (chi-squared; x(2) = 0.14, and 0.03 when all the remaining ASIA Eagle wavebands, after removing the noisy ones and the most important wavebands were used, respectively). This study concludes that AISA Eagle data classified using RF and SVM algorithms provide relatively accurate information that is important to the forest industry for making informed decision regarding pine plantations health protocols.

The prediction of QSAR models in these domains is reliable, and potential subsequent investigations of such compounds would find that the predictions closely match the experimental values. Standard approaches in QSAR assume that predictions are more reliable for compounds that are "similar" to those in subspaces with denser experimental data. Here, we report on a study of an alternative set of techniques recently proposed in the machine learning community. These methods quantify prediction confidence through estimation of the prediction error at the point of interest. Our study includes 20 public QSAR data sets with continuous response and assesses the quality of 10 reliability scoring methods by observing their correlation with prediction error. We show that these new alternative approaches can outperform standard reliability scores that rely only on similarity to compounds in the training set. The results also indicate that the quality of reliability scoring methods in sensitive to data set characteristics and to the regression method used in QSAR. We demonstrate that at the cost of increased computational complexity these dependencies can be leveraged by integration of scores from various reliability estimation approaches. The reliability estimation techniques described in this paper have been implemented in an open source add-on package (https://bitbucket.org/biolab/orange-reliability) to the Orange data mining suite.

Code-Assisted Discovery of TAL Effector Targets in Bacterial Leaf Streak of Rice Reveals Contrast with Bacterial Blight and a Novel Susceptibility Gene	PLOS PATHOGENS			English	Article							ORYZAE PV.-ORYZAE; XANTHOMONAS-ORYZAE; RESISTANCE GENE; PATHOGEN INTERACTIONS; SULFATE TRANSPORTER; CELL-DEATH; HOST; DNA; EXPRESSION; RECOGNITION	Bacterial leaf streak of rice, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) is an increasingly important yield constraint in this staple crop. A mesophyll colonizer, Xoc differs from X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which invades xylem to cause bacterial blight of rice. Both produce multiple distinct TAL effectors, type III-delivered proteins that transactivate effector-specific host genes. A TAL effector finds its target(s) via a partially degenerate code whereby the modular effector amino acid sequence identifies nucleotide sequences to which the protein binds. Virulence contributions of some Xoo TAL effectors have been shown, and their relevant targets, susceptibility (S) genes, identified, but the role of TAL effectors in leaf streak is uncharacterized. We used host transcript profiling to compare leaf streak to blight and to probe functions of Xoc TAL effectors. We found that Xoc and Xoo induce almost completely different host transcriptional changes. Roughly one in three genes upregulated by the pathogens is preceded by a candidate TAL effector binding element. Experimental analysis of the 44 such genes predicted to be Xoc TAL effector targets verified nearly half, and identified most others as false predictions. None of the Xoc targets is a known bacterial blight S gene. Mutational analysis revealed that Tal2g, which activates two genes, contributes to lesion expansion and bacterial exudation. Use of designer TAL effectors discriminated a sulfate transporter gene as the S gene. Across all targets, basal expression tended to be higher than genome-average, and induction moderate. Finally, machine learning applied to real vs. falsely predicted targets yielded a classifier that recalled 92% of the real targets with 88% precision, providing a tool for better target prediction in the future. Our study expands the number of known TAL effector targets, identifies a new class of S gene, and improves our ability to predict functional targeting. Author Summary Many crop and ornamental plants suffer losses due to bacterial pathogens in the genus Xanthomonas. Pathogen manipulation of host gene expression by injected proteins called TAL effectors is important in many of these diseases. A TAL effector finds its gene target(s) by virtue of structural repeats in the protein that differ one from another at two amino acids that together identify one DNA base. The number of repeats and those amino acids thereby code for the DNA sequence the protein binds. This code allows target prediction and engineering TAL effectors for custom gene activation. By combining genome-wide analysis of gene expression with TAL effector binding site prediction and verification using designer TAL effectors, we identified 19 targets of TAL effectors in bacterial leaf streak of rice, a disease of growing importance worldwide caused by X. oryzae pv. oryzicola. Among these was a sulfate transport gene that plays a major role. Comparison of true vs. false predictions using machine learning yielded a classifier that will streamline TAL effector target identification in the future. Probing the diversity and functions of such plant genes is critical to expand our knowledge of disease and defense mechanisms, and open new avenues for effective disease control.

Cycling mood disorders are characterized by intermittent episodes (or events) of the disease. Objective: Using anonymized Web search logs, we identify a population of people with significant interest in mood stabilizing drugs (MSD) and seek evidence of mood swings in this population. Methods: We extracted queries to the Microsoft Bing search engine made by 20,046 Web searchers over six months, separately explored searcher demographics using data from a large external panel of users, and sought supporting information from people with mood disorders via a survey. We analyzed changes in information needs over time relative to searches on MSD. Results: Queries for MSD focused on side effects and their relation to the disease. We found evidence of significant changes in search behavior and interests coinciding with days that MSD queries are made. These include large increases (>100%) in the access of nutrition information, commercial information, and adult materials. A survey of patients diagnosed with mood disorders provided evidence that repeated queries on MSD may come with exacerbations of mood disorder. A classifier predicting the occurrence of such queries one day before they are observed obtains strong performance (AUC=0.78). Conclusions: Observed patterns in search behavior align with known behaviors and those highlighted by survey respondents. These observations suggest that searchers showing intensive interest in MSD may be patients who have been prescribed these drugs. Given behavioral dynamics, we surmise that the days on which MSD queries are made may coincide with commencement of mania or depression. Although we do not have data on mood changes and whether users have been diagnosed with bipolar illness, we see evidence of cycling in people who show interest in MSD and further show that we can predict impending shifts in behavior and interest.

The issues with this method are that the performance of these rules depends on the state the system is in at each moment and also that no ideal single rule exists for all the possible states that the system may be in. Therefore, it would be interesting to use the most appropriate dispatching rule for each instance. To achieve this goal, a scheduling approach that uses machine learning can be used. Analyzing the previous performance of the system (training examples) by means of this technique, knowledge is obtained that can be used to decide which is the most appropriate dispatching rule at each moment in time. In this paper, a literature review of the main machine learning based scheduling approaches from the last decade is presented.

Despite this valiant effort, there are still many languages left that have only small amounts of such resources. The goal of this article is to present and investigate a method of propagating information (specifically mentions) from a resource-rich language such as English into a relatively less-resource language such as Arabic. We compare also this approach to its equivalent counterpart using monolingual resources. Part of the investigation is to quantify the contribution of propagating information in different conditions - based on the availability of resources in the target language. Experiments on the language pair Arabic-English show that one can achieve relatively decent performance by propagating information from a language with richer resources such as English into Arabic alone (no resources or models in the source language Arabic). Furthermore, results show that propagated features from English do help improve the Arabic system performance even when used in conjunction with all feature types built from the source language. Experiments also show that using propagated features in conjunction with lexically-derived features only (as can be obtained directly from a mention annotated corpus) brings the system performance at the one obtained in the target language by using feature derived from many linguistic resources, therefore improving the system when such resources are not available.

Suppose we have the traffic data of an entire city that are incomplete because some road data are unobserved. The problem is to reconstruct the unobserved parts of the data. In this paper, we propose a new method to reconstruct incomplete traffic data collected from various sensors. Our approach is based on Markov random field modeling of road traffic. The reconstruction is achieved by using a mean-field method and amachine learning method. We numerically verify the performance of our method using realistic simulated traffic data for the real road network of Sendai, Japan.

J	Dogan, RI; Leaman, R; Lu, ZY				Dogan, Rezarta Islamaj; Leaman, Robert; Lu, Zhiyong			NCBI disease corpus: A resource for disease name recognition and concept normalization	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Disease name recognition; Named entity recognition; Disease name normalization; Corpus annotation; Disease name corpus	ANNOTATED CORPUS; INFORMATION EXTRACTION; BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE; ENTITY RECOGNITION; GENE NORMALIZATION; TEXT; SYSTEM; ONTOLOGY; UMLS; TASK	Information encoded in natural language in biomedical literature publications is only useful if efficient and reliable ways of accessing and analyzing that information are available. Natural language processing and text mining tools are therefore essential for extracting valuable information, however, the development of powerful, highly effective tools to automatically detect central biomedical concepts such as diseases is conditional on the availability of annotated corpora. This paper presents the disease name and concept annotations of the NCBI disease corpus, a collection of 793 PubMed abstracts fully annotated at the mention and concept level to serve as a research resource for the biomedical natural language processing community. Each PubMed abstract was manually annotated by two annotators with disease mentions and their corresponding concepts in Medical Subject Headings (MeSH(R)) or Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM(R)). Manual curation was performed using PubTator, which allowed the use of pre-annotations as a pre-step to manual annotations. Fourteen annotators were randomly paired and differing annotations were discussed for reaching a consensus in two annotation phases. In this setting, a high inter-annotator agreement was observed. Finally, all results were checked against annotations of the rest of the corpus to assure corpus-wide consistency. The public release of the NCBI disease corpus contains 6892 disease mentions, which are mapped to 790 unique disease concepts. Of these, 88% link to a MeSH identifier, while the rest contain an OMIM identifier. We were able to link 91% of the mentions to a single disease concept, while the rest are described as a combination of concepts. In order to help researchers use the corpus to design and test disease identification methods, we have prepared the corpus as training, testing and development sets. To demonstrate its utility, we conducted a benchmarking experiment where we compared three different knowledge-based disease normalization methods with a best performance in F-measure of 63.7%. These results show that the NCBI disease corpus has the potential to significantly improve the state-of-the-art in disease name recognition and normalization research, by providing a high-quality gold standard thus enabling the development of machine-learning based approaches for such tasks.

These records contain abundant knowledge and reflect the clinical experience of TCM doctors. In recent years, with the modernization of TCM clinical practice, these clinical records have begun to be digitized. Data mining (DM) and machine learning (ML) methods provide an opportunity for researchers to discover TCM regularities buried in the large volume of clinical records. There has been some work on this problem. Existing methods have been validated on a limited amount of manually well-structured data. However, the contents of most fields in the clinical records are unstructured. As a result, the previous methods verified on the well-structured data will not work effectively on the free-text clinical records (FCRs), and the FCRs are, consequently, required to be structured in advance. Manually structuring the large volume of TCM FCRs is time-consuming and labor-intensive, but the development of automatic methods for the structuring task is at an early stage. Therefore, in this paper, symptom name recognition (SNR) in the chief complaints, which is one of the important tasks to structure the FCRs of TCM, is carefully studied. The SNR task is reasonably treated as a sequence labeling problem, and several fundamental and practical problems in the SNR task are studied, such as how to adapt a general sequence labeling strategy for the SNR task according to the domain-specific characteristics of the chief complaints and which sequence classifier is more appropriate to solve the SNR task. To answer these questions, a series of elaborate experiments were performed, and the results are explained in detail. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Kim, S; Choi, J				Kim, Seunghee; Choi, Jinwook			An SVM-based high-quality article classifier for systematic reviews	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Review						Classification; Artificial intelligence; Evidence-based medicine; Review literature as topic	ALGORITHM; WORKLOAD; MEDICINE	Objective: To determine whether SVM-based classifiers, which are trained on a combination of inclusion and common exclusion articles, are useful to experts reviewing journal articles for inclusion during new systematic reviews. Methods: Test collections were built using the annotated reference files from 19 procedure and 4 drug systematic reviews. The classifiers were trained by balanced data sets, which were sampled using random sampling. This approach compared two balanced data sets, one with a combination of included and commonly excluded articles and one with a combination of included and excluded articles. AUCs were used as evaluation metrics. Results: The AUCs of the classifiers, which were trained on the balanced data set with included and commonly excluded articles, were significantly higher than those of the classifiers, which were trained on the balanced data set with included and excluded articles. Conclusion: Automatic, high-quality article classifiers using machine learning could reduce the workload of experts performing systematic reviews when topic-specific data are scarce. In particular, when used as training data, a combination of included and commonly excluded articles is more helpful than a combination of included and excluded articles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

MethodsAllergen-IgE screening using ImmunoCAP ISAC((R)) assay was performed at age 11yrs in children participating a population-based birth cohort. Logistic regression (LR) and nonlinear statistical learning models, including random forests (RF) and Bayesian networks (BN), coupled with feature selection approaches, were used to identify patterns of allergen responses associated with asthma, rhino-conjunctivitis, wheeze, eczema and airway hyper-reactivity (AHR, positive methacholine challenge). Sensitivity/specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) were used to assess model performance via repeated validation. ResultsSerum sample for IgE measurement was obtained from 461 of 822 (56.1%) participants. Two hundred and thirty-eight of 461 (51.6%) children had at least one of 112 allergen components IgE>0ISU. The binary threshold >0.3ISU performed less well than using continuous IgE values, discretizing data or using other data transformations, but not significantly (p=0.1). With the exception of eczema (AUROC0.5), LR, RF and BN achieved comparable AUROC, ranging from 0.76 to 0.82. Dust mite, pollens and pet allergens were highly associated with asthma, whilst pollens and dust mite with rhino-conjunctivitis. Egg/bovine allergens were associated with eczema. ConclusionsAfter validation, LR, RF and BN demonstrated reasonable discrimination ability for asthma, rhino-conjunctivitis, wheeze and AHR, but not for eczema. However, further improvements in threshold ascertainment and/or value transformation for different components, and better interpretation algorithms are needed to fully capitalize on the potential of the technology.

However, such networks are not apparent from surveillance data because P. vivax transmission can be affected by many factors, such as the biological characteristics of mosquitoes and the mobility of human beings. Here, we pay special attention to the problem of how to infer the underlying transmission networks of P. vivax based on available tempo-spatial patterns of reported cases. Methodology We first define a spatial transmission model, which involves representing both the heterogeneous transmission potential of P. vivax at individual locations and the mobility of infected populations among different locations. Based on the proposed transmission model, we further introduce a recurrent neural network model to infer the transmission networks from surveillance data. Specifically, in this model, we take into account multiple real-world factors, including the length of P. vivax incubation period, the impact of malaria control at different locations, and the total number of imported cases. Principal Findings We implement our proposed models by focusing on the P. vivax transmission among 62 towns in Yunnan province, People's Republic China, which have been experiencing high malaria transmission in the past years. By conducting scenario analysis with respect to different numbers of imported cases, we can (i) infer the underlying P. vivax transmission networks, (ii) estimate the number of imported cases for each individual town, and (iii) quantify the roles of individual towns in the geographical spread of P. vivax. Conclusion The demonstrated models have presented a general means for inferring the underlying transmission networks from surveillance data. The inferred networks will offer new insights into how to improve the predictability of P. vivax transmission. Author Summary The transmission of Plasmodium vivax has induced enormous public health problems at the global level. Natural transmission of P. vivax depends on interactions between anopheles mosquitoes and human beings. There are two important factors that influence its geographical spread. First, different locations may have different risks of infection due to their heterogeneous environmental and demographical profiles. Second, human mobility may bring pathogens from high-transmission locations to low-transmission locations. In view of this, to effectively and efficiently control the geographical spread of P. vivax, it would be desirable for us to characterize how it transmits from one location to another. To achieve this, we first build a spatial transmission model to characterize both the heterogeneous infection risks at individual locations and the underlying mobility of infected populations. By doing so, we can further infer the underlying P. vivax transmission networks from tempo-spatial surveillance data by using a machine learning method (i.e., based on a recurrent neural network model). Our study offers new insights into malaria surveillance and control from the viewpoint of both system modeling and machine learning.

Aldo; Rhode, Kawal; Razavi, Reza; Delingette, Herve; Ayache, Nicholas			Cardiac Electrophysiological Activation Pattern Estimation From Images Using a Patient-Specific Database of Synthetic Image Sequences	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Cardiac electrophysiology; computer model; inverse problem; machine learning; non-invasive mapping; synthetic images	MODEL; VALIDATION; TISSUE; HEART; REGISTRATION; CRT	While abnormal patterns of cardiac electrophysiological activation are at the origin of important cardiovascular diseases (e. g., arrhythmia, asynchrony), the only clinically available method to observe detailed left ventricular endocardial surface activation pattern is through invasive catheter mapping. However, this electrophysiological activation controls the onset of the mechanical contraction; therefore, important information about the electrophysiology could be deduced from the detailed observation of the resulting motion patterns. In this paper, we present the study of this inverse cardiac electrokinematic relationship. The objective is to predict the activation pattern knowing the cardiac motion from the analysis of cardiac image sequences. To achieve this, we propose to create a rich patient-specific database of synthetic time series of the cardiac images using simulations of a personalized cardiac electromechanical model, in order to study this complex relationship between electrical activity and kinematic patterns in the context of this specific patient. We use this database to train a machine-learning algorithm which estimates the depolarization times of each cardiac segment from global and regional kinematic descriptors based on displacements or strains and their derivatives. Finally, we use this learning to estimate the patient's electrical activation times using the acquired clinical images. Experiments on the inverse electrokinematic learning are demonstrated on synthetic sequences and are evaluated on clinical data with promising results. The error calculated between our prediction and the invasive intracardiac mapping ground truth is relatively small (around 10 ms for ischemic patients and 20 ms for nonischemic patient). This approach suggests the possibility of noninvasive electrophysiological pattern estimation using cardiac motion imaging.

Quantitative measurement of abnormality of brain connectivity in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), have also been widely reported, especially at a group level. Recently, machine learning techniques have been applied to the study of AD and MCI, i.e., to identify the individuals with AD/MCI from the healthy controls (HCs). However, most existing methods focus on using only a single property of a connectivity network, although multiple network properties, such as local connectivity and global topological properties, can potentially be used. In this paper, by employing multikernel based approach, we propose a novel connectivity based framework to integrate multiple properties of connectivity network for improving the classification performance. Specifically, two different types of kernels (i.e., vector-based kernel and graph kernel) are used to quantify two different yet complementary properties of the network, i.e., local connectivity and global topological properties. Then, multikernel learning (MKL) technique is adopted to fuse these heterogeneous kernels for neuroimaging classification. We test the performance of our proposed method on two different data sets. First, we test it on the functional connectivity networks of 12 MCI and 25 HC subjects. The results show that our method achieves significant performance improvement over those using only one type of network property. Specifically, our method achieves a classification accuracy of 91.9%, which is 10.8% better than those by single network-property-based methods. Then, we test our method for gender classification on a large set of functional connectivity networks with 133 infants scanned at birth, 1 year, and 2 years, also demonstrating very promising results.

Gain ratio based fuzzy weighted association rule mining classifier for medical diagnostic interface	SADHANA-ACADEMY PROCEEDINGS IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						Feature selection; gain ratio; ranking based weight; medical data mining; fuzzy weighted support and confidence; UCI repository		The health care environment still needs knowledge based discovery for handling wealth of data. Extraction of the potential causes of the diseases is the most important factor for medical data mining. Fuzzy association rule mining is well-performed better than traditional classifiers but it suffers from the exponential growth of the rules produced. In the past, we have proposed an information gain based fuzzy association rule mining algorithm for extracting both association rules and member-ship functions of medical data to reduce the rules. It used a ranking based weight value to identify the potential attribute. When we take a large number of distinct values, the computation of information gain value is not feasible. In this paper, an enhanced approach, called gain ratio based fuzzy weighted association rule mining, is thus proposed for distinct diseases and also increase the learning time of the previous one. Experimental results show that there is a marginal improvement in the attribute selection process and also improvement in the classifier accuracy. The system has been implemented in Java platform and verified by using benchmark data from the UCI machine learning repository.	[Nithya, N.

Social networking sites allow users to manually categorize their friends into social circles (e.g., "circles" on Google+, and "lists" on Facebook and Twitter). However, circles are laborious to construct and must be manually updated whenever a user's network grows. In this article, we study the novel task of automatically identifying users' social circles. We pose this task as a multimembership node clustering problem on a user's ego network, a network of connections between her friends. We develop a model for detecting circles that combines network structure as well as user profile information. For each circle, we learn its members and the circle-specific user profile similarity metric. Modeling node membership to multiple circles allows us to detect overlapping as well as hierarchically nested circles. Experiments show that our model accurately identifies circles on a diverse set of data from Facebook, Google+, and Twitter, for all of which we obtain hand-labeled ground truth.

DEVELOPING FUZZY MODELS FOR ESTIMATING THE QUALITY OF VOIP	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						VoIP; Voice quality; Non-intrusive prediction; PESQ; Neuro-fuzzy; GA; KEEL	MULTIPLE DATA SETS; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; PACKET LOSS; CLASSIFIERS; SYSTEM; RULES	This paper presents a novel method for modeling the one-way quality prediction of VoIP, non-intrusively. Intrusive measures of voice quality suffer from common deficiency that is the need of reference signal for evaluating the quality of voice. Owing to this lack, a great deal of effort has been recently devoted for modeling voice quality prediction non-intrusively according to quality degradation parameters, while among the past proposed methods, intelligent techniques have been remarkably successful due to their abilities for modeling the non-linear processes. The present study introduces a procedure for developing fuzzy models, employing Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The proposed method is able to generate optimized fuzzy models in terms of accuracy and complexity. The efficiency of this procedure is compared with and contrasted against 13 regression methods implemented in KEEL as one machine learning tool. Moreover, several experimental results are performed over voice data from 10 different languages. In order to complete the experiment, a comprehensive statistical comparison is also drawn between our proposed method and other previous ones. The results apparently show the efficiency and applicability of this novel method in terms of generating accurate and simple fuzzy models for estimating the VoIP quality.

We present an ML-based methodology for transcriptome analysis via comparison of gene coexpression networks, implemented as an R package called machine learning-based differential network analysis (mlDNA) and apply this method to reanalyze a set of abiotic stress expression data in Arabidopsis thaliana. The mlDNA first used a ML-based filtering process to remove nonexpressed, constitutively expressed, or non-stress-responsive "noninformative" genes prior to network construction, through learning the patterns of 32 expression characteristics of known stress-related genes. The retained "informative" genes were subsequently analyzed by ML-based network comparison to predict candidate stress-related genes showing expression and network differences between control and stress networks, based on 33 network topological characteristics. Comparative evaluation of the network-centric and gene-centric analytic methods showed that mlDNA substantially outperformed traditional statistical testing-based differential expression analysis at identifying stress-related genes, with markedly improved prediction accuracy. To experimentally validate the mlDNA predictions, we selected 89 candidates out of the 1784 predicted salt stress-related genes with available SALK T-DNA mutagenesis lines for phenotypic screening and identified two previously unreported genes, mutants of which showed salt-sensitive phenotypes.

Modelling and predicting the biological effects of nanomaterials	SAR AND QSAR IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						modelling and prediction; nanomaterials; Bayesian methods; adverse biological effects; QSAR; neural network	REGULARIZED NEURAL-NETWORKS; ROBUST QSAR MODELS; DESCRIPTOR SELECTION; NANOPARTICLES	The commercial applications of nanoparticles are growing rapidly, but we know relatively little about how nanoparticles interact with biological systems. Their value - but also their risk - is related to their nanophase properties being markedly different to those of the same material in bulk. Experiments to determine how nanoparticles are taken up, distributed, modified, and elicit any adverse effects are essential. However, cost and time considerations mean that predictive models would also be extremely valuable, particularly assisting regulators to minimize health and environmental risks. We used novel sparse machine learning methods that employ Bayesian neural networks to model three nanoparticle data sets using both linear and nonlinear machine learning methods. The first data comprised iron oxide nanoparticles decorated with 108 different molecules tested against five cell lines, HUVEC, pancreatic cancer, and three macrophage or macrophage-like lines. The second data set comprised 52 nanoparticles with various core compositions, coatings, and surface attachments. The nanoparticles were characterized using four descriptors (size, relaxivities, and zeta potential), and their biological effects on four cells lines assessed using four biological assays per cell line and four concentrations per assay. The third data set involved the biological responses to gold nanoparticles functionalized by 80 different small molecules. Nonspecific binding and binding to AChE were the biological endpoints modelled. The biological effects of nanoparticles were modelled using molecular descriptors for the molecules that decorated the nanoparticle surface. Models with good statistical quality were constructed for most biological endpoints. These proof-of-concept models show that modelling biological effects of nanomaterials is possible using modern modelling methods.	[Winkler, D. A.; Burden, F.

Central to such an approach is that machine learning techniques typically rely upon summaries or features of the program. The quality of these features is critical to the accuracy of the resulting machine learned algorithm; no machine learning method will work well with poorly chosen features. However, due to the size and complexity of programs, theoretically there are an infinite number of potential features to choose from. The compiler writer now has to expend effort in choosing the best features from this space. This article develops a novel mechanism to automatically find those features that most improve the quality of the machine learned heuristic. The feature space is described by a grammar and is then searched with genetic programming and predictive modelling. We apply this technique to loop unrolling in GCC 4.3.1 and evaluate our approach on a Pentium 6. On a benchmark suite of 57 programs, GCCs hard-coded heuristic achieves only 3% of the maximum performance available, whereas a state-of-the-art machine learning approach with hand-coded features obtains 59%. Our feature generation technique is able to achieve 76% of the maximum available speedup, outperforming existing approaches.

This is largely due to the poor identification and exploitation of application parallelism, resulting in disappointing performance far below that which a skilled expert programmer could achieve. We have identified two weaknesses in traditional parallelizing compilers and propose a novel, integrated approach resulting in significant performance improvements of the generated parallel code. Using profile-driven parallelism detection, we overcome the limitations of static analysis, enabling the identification of more application parallelism, and only rely on the user for final approval. We then replace the traditional target-specific and inflexible mapping heuristics with a machine-learning-based prediction mechanism, resulting in better mapping decisions while automating adaptation to different target architectures. We have evaluated our parallelization strategy on the NAS and SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks and two different multicore platforms (dual quad-core Intel Xeon SMP and dual-socket QS20 Cell blade). We demonstrate that our approach not only yields significant improvements when compared with state-of-the-art parallelizing compilers but also comes close to and sometimes exceeds the performance of manually parallelized codes. On average, our methodology achieves 96% of the performance of the hand-tuned OpenMP NAS and SPEC parallel benchmarks on the Intel Xeon platform and gains a significant speedup for the IBM Cell platform, demonstrating the potential of profile-guided and machine-learning-based parallelization for complex multicore platforms.

There are mainly two classes of discrepancy measures: distance measures based on the density difference, such as the L-p-distances, and divergence measures based on the density ratio, such as the phi-divergences. The intersection of these two classes is the L-1-distance measure, and thus, it can be estimated either based on the density difference or the density ratio. In this paper, we first show that the Bregman scores, which are widely employed for the estimation of probability densities in statistical data analysis, allows us to estimate the density difference and the density ratio directly without separately estimating each probability distribution. We then theoretically elucidate the robustness of these estimators and present numerical experiments.

However, while it seems intuitively obvious that unlabelled data can aid the learning process, in practise its performance has often been disappointing. We investigate this by examining generative maximum likelihood semi-supervised learning and derive novel upper and lower bounds on the degree of bias introduced by the unlabelled data. These bounds improve upon those provided in previous work, and are specifically applicable to the challenging case where the model is unable to exactly fit to the underlying distribution a situation which is common in practise, but for which fewer guarantees of semi-supervised performance have been found. Inspired by this new framework for analysing bounds, we propose a new, simple reweighing scheme which provides a provably unbiased estimator for arbitrary model/distribution pairs-an unusual property for a semi-supervised algorithm. This reweighing introduces no additional computational complexity and can be applied to very many models. Additionally, we provide specific conditions demonstrating the circumstance under which the unlabelled data will lower the estimator variance, thereby improving convergence.

Our package efficiently implements the parametric simplex algorithm, which provides a scalable and sophisticated tool for solving large-scale linear programs. As an illustrative example, one use of our LP solver is to implement an important sparse precision matrix estimation method called CLIME (Constrained L-1 Minimization Estimator). Compared with existing packages for this problem such as CLIME and FLARE, our package has three advantages: (1) it efficiently calculates the full piecewise-linear regularization path; (2) it provides an accurate dual certificate as stopping criterion; (3) it is completely coded in C and is highly portable. This package is designed to be useful to statisticians and machine learning researchers for solving a wide range of problems.

J	Cuturi, M; Avis, D				Cuturi, Marco; Avis, Davis			Ground Metric Learning	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						optimal transport distance; earth mover's distance; metric learning; metric nearness	CLASSIFICATION; TABLE	Optimal transport distances have been used for more than a decade in machine learning to compare histograms of features. They have one parameter: the ground metric, which can be any metric between the features themselves. As is the case for all parameterized distances, optimal transport distances can only prove useful in practice when this parameter is carefully chosen. To date, the only option available to practitioners to set the ground metric parameter was to rely on a priori knowledge of the features, which limited considerably the scope of application of optimal transport distances. We propose to lift this limitation and consider instead algorithms that can learn the ground metric using only a training set of labeled histograms. We call this approach ground metric learning. We formulate the problem of learning the ground metric as the minimization of the difference of two convex polyhedral functions over a convex set of metric matrices. We follow the presentation of our algorithms with promising experimental results which show that this approach is useful both for retrieval and binary/multiclass classification tasks.

Bare soil line parameters (slope and intercept) are used in calculating several vegetation indices. Previous studies have proposed both manual and empirical procedures in estimating the bare soil parameters. Manual procedures introduce some amount of subjectivity in identifying the soil line. Empirical methods often suffer because of variations caused by soil type, moisture, and organic matter contents. The existence of non-bare soil pixels also affects these procedures. In this study, we proposed an automated supervised learning algorithm using relevance vector machine (RVM) for extracting the soil line from Landsat images. The 10-fold cross validation (10-fold CV) indicated 92% accuracy for distinguishing bare soil and other non-bare soil pixels from an image. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve reached a value of 0.98, indicating a significant predicting power of the proposed procedure. Additionally, this procedure was evaluated using data from 10 bare soil fields in the Texas High Plains region in 2008 and 2009. Statistical analysis indicated no significant difference between the observed and estimated bare soil line parameters. The proposed RVM-based procedure successfully incorporated machine-learning algorithms into agricultural remote sensing and eliminated the dependency on empiricism and minimized subjectivity.

Interestingly, in the business domain, the text mining and machine learning community has minimally explored company annual reports with their mandatory disclosures. In this study, we explore the question "How can annual reports be used to predict change in company performance from one year to the next?" from a text mining perspective. Our article contributes a systematic study of the potential of company mandatory disclosures using a computational viewpoint in the following aspects: (a) We characterize our research problem along distinct dimensions to gain a reasonably comprehensive understanding of the capacity of supervised learning methods in predicting change in company performance using annual reports, and (b) our findings from unbiased systematic experiments provide further evidence about the economic incentives faced by analysts in their stock recommendations and speculations on analysts having access to more information in producing earnings forecast.

In this research, with the same Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data set and the same classification scheme over Guangzhou City, China, we tested two unsupervised and 13 supervised classification algorithms, including a number of machine learning algorithms that became popular in remote sensing during the past 20 years. Our analysis focused primarily on the spectral information provided by the TM data. We assessed all algorithms in a per-pixel classification decision experiment and all supervised algorithms in a segment-based experiment. We found that when sufficiently representative training samples were used, most algorithms performed reasonably well. Lack of training samples led to greater classification accuracy discrepancies than classification algorithms themselves. Some algorithms were more tolerable to insufficient (less representative) training samples than others. Many algorithms improved the overall accuracy marginally with per-segment decision making.

Vibration Analysis Based Interturn Fault Diagnosis in Induction Machines	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Complex wavelets; fault diagnosis; orthogonal least squares regression; triaxial vibrations; probabilistic neural network	PATTERN-RECOGNITION; MOTOR DRIVES; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEMS; BAR	A vibration analysis based interturn fault diagnosis of induction machines is proposed in this paper, using a neural-network-based scheme, constituting of two parts. The first part finds out the optimum network size of the probabilistic neural network (PNN) using the Orthogonal Least Squares Regression algorithm. This judges the size of the PNN, with an effort to reduce the computation. The feature extraction to model the PNN is made meaningful using dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT), which is nearly shift invariant analytical wavelet transform, giving a true representation of the input space. In the second part, preprocessing using principal component analysis is suggested as an effective way to further reduce the dimension of the feature set and size of the PNN without compromising the performance. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy show that the vibration signatures capture the fault more effectively (especially by the axial and radial ones), under varying supply-frequency and load conditions. A comparison with traditional discrete wavelet transform proves the applicability of the proposed scheme. A comparative evaluation with feedforward neural network and naive Bayes scheme brings out the advantage of the proposed optimized DTCWT-PNN based technique over other machine learning approaches.

In CR, an unlicensed network user (secondary user) is enabled to dynamically/adaptively access the frequency channels considering the current state of the external radio environment. In this article, we investigate the medium access control protocol identification for applications in cognitive MAC. MAC protocol identification enables CR users to sense and identify the MAC protocol types of any existing transmissions (primary or secondary users). The identification results will be used by CR users to adaptively change their transmission parameters in order to improve spectrum utilization, as well as to minimize potential interference to primary and other secondary users. MAC protocol identification also facilitates the implementation of communications among heterogeneous CR networks. In this article, we consider four MAC protocols, including TDMA, CSMA/CA, pure ALOHA, and slotted ALOHA, and propose a MAC identification method based on machine learning techniques. Computer simulations are performed to evaluate the MAC identification performance.

Drawing upon machine learning techniques, software fault prediction tries to identify upfront software modules that are most likely to contain faults, thereby streamlining testing efforts and improving overall software quality. When deploying fault prediction models in a production environment, both prediction performance and model comprehensibility are typically taken into consideration, although the latter is commonly overlooked in the academic literature. Many classification methods have been suggested to conduct fault prediction; yet associative classification methods remain uninvestigated in this context. This paper proposes an associative classification (AC)-based fault prediction method, building upon the CBA2 algorithm. In an empirical comparison on 12 real-world datasets, the AC-based classifier is shown to achieve a predictive performance competitive to those of models induced by five other tree/rule-based classification techniques. In addition, our findings also highlight the comprehensibility of the AC-based models, while achieving similar prediction performance. Furthermore, the possibilities of cross project prediction are investigated, strengthening earlier findings on the feasibility of such approach when insufficient data on the target project is available.

Barton; Wilson, Ira B.; Rose, Carolyn Penstein			Automating annotation of information-giving for analysis of clinical conversation	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							PATIENT ADHERENCE; PHYSICIAN COMMUNICATION; MEDICAL ENCOUNTERS; DECISION-MAKING; SUPPORT GROUPS; CARE; OUTCOMES; RELIABILITY; EXTRACTION; FRAMEWORK	Objective Coding of clinical communication for fine-grained features such as speech acts has produced a substantial literature. However, annotation by humans is laborious and expensive, limiting application of these methods. We aimed to show that through machine learning, computers could code certain categories of speech acts with sufficient reliability to make useful distinctions among clinical encounters. Materials and methods The data were transcripts of 415 routine outpatient visits of HIV patients which had previously been coded for speech acts using the Generalized Medical Interaction Analysis System (GMIAS); 50 had also been coded for larger scale features using the Comprehensive Analysis of the Structure of Encounters System (CASES). We aggregated selected speech acts into information-giving and requesting, then trained the machine to automatically annotate using logistic regression classification. We evaluated reliability by per-speech act accuracy. We used multiple regression to predict patient reports of communication quality from post-visit surveys using the patient and provider information-giving to information-requesting ratio (briefly, information-giving ratio) and patient gender. Results Automated coding produces moderate reliability with human coding (accuracy 71.2%, kappa=0.57), with high correlation between machine and human prediction of the information-giving ratio (r=0.96). The regression significantly predicted four of five patient-reported measures of communication quality (r=0.263-0.344). Discussion The information-giving ratio is a useful and intuitive measure for predicting patient perception of provider-patient communication quality. These predictions can be made with automated annotation, which is a practical option for studying large collections of clinical encounters with objectivity, consistency, and low cost, providing greater opportunity for training and reflection for care providers.

This report is a summary of the discussions during the second day of the workshop. Collectively, the workshop presenters and participants emphasized the need for unstructured clinical notes to be included in the decision making workflow and the need for individualized longitudinal data tracking. The workshop also discussed the need to: (1) combine evidence-based literature and patient records with machine-learning and prediction models; (2) provide trusted and reproducible clinical advice; (3) prioritize evidence and test results; and (4) engage healthcare professionals, caregivers, and patients. The overall consensus of the NLP-CDS workshop was that there are promising opportunities for NLP and CDS to deliver cognitive support for healthcare professionals, caregivers, and patients.

However, many traditional machine learning methods fail to simultaneously integrate textual data into the prediction process because of its high dimensionality. In this paper, we present a supervised method using Laplacian Eigenmaps to enable existing machine learning methods to estimate both low-dimensional representations of textual data and accurate predictors based on these low-dimensional representations at the same time. Materials and methods We present a supervised Laplacian Eigenmap method to enhance predictive models by embedding textual predictors into a low-dimensional latent space, which preserves the local similarities among textual data in high-dimensional space. The proposed implementation performs alternating optimization using gradient descent. For the evaluation, we applied our method to over 2000 patient records from a large single-center pediatric cardiology practice to predict if patients were diagnosed with cardiac disease. In our experiments, we consider relatively short textual descriptions because of data availability. We compared our method with latent semantic indexing, latent Dirichlet allocation, and local Fisher discriminant analysis. The results were assessed using four metrics: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), specificity, and sensitivity. Results and discussion The results indicate that supervised Laplacian Eigenmaps was the highest performing method in our study, achieving 0.782 and 0.374 for AUC and MCC, respectively. Supervised Laplacian Eigenmaps showed an increase of 8.16% in AUC and 20.6% in MCC over the baseline that excluded textual data and a 2.69% and 5.35% increase in AUC and MCC, respectively, over unsupervised Laplacian Eigenmaps. Conclusions As a solution, we present a supervised Laplacian Eigenmap method to embed textual predictors into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. This method allows many existing machine learning predictors to effectively and efficiently capture the potential of textual predictors, especially those based on short texts.

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop and validate two novel machine-learning methods (Sojourn-1 Axis [soj-1x] and Sojourn-3 Axis [soj-3x]) in a free-living setting. Methods: Participants were directly observed in their natural environment for 10 consecutive hours on three separate occasions. Physical activity and SB estimated from soj-1x, soj-3x, and a neural network previously calibrated in the laboratory (lab-nnet) were compared with direct observation. Results: Compared with lab-nnet, soj-1x and soj-3x improved estimates of MET-hours (lab-nnet: % bias [95% confidence interval] = 33.1 [25.9 to 40.4], root-mean-square error [RMSE] = 5.4 [4.6-6.2]; soj-1x: % bias = 1.9 [-2.0 to 5.9], RMSE = 1.0 [0.6 to 1.3]; soj-3x:% bias = 3.4 [0.0 to 6.7], RMSE = 1.0 [0.6 to 1.5]) and minutes in different intensity categories {lab-nnet: % bias = -8.2 (sedentary), -8.2 (light), and 72.8 (moderate-to-vigorous PA [MVPA]); soj-1x: % bias = 8.8 (sedentary), -18.5 (light), and -1.0 (MVPA); soj-3x: % bias = 0.5 (sedentary), -0.8 (light), and -1.0 (MVPA)}. Soj-1x and soj-3x also produced accurate estimates of guideline minutes and breaks from sedentary time. Conclusions: Compared with the lab-nnet algorithm, soj-1x and soj-3x improved the accuracy and precision in estimating free-living MET-hours, sedentary time, and time spent in light-intensity activity and MVPA. In addition, soj-3x is superior to soj-1x in differentiating SB from light-intensity activity.

In developing this architecture, which is very useful for agricultural decision support systems, we considered web based large-scale dynamic data mining, contextual knowledge extraction, and integrated knowledge representation methods. Five different environmental data sources were considered to develop and test the proposed knowledge recommendation framework called Intelligent Environmental Knowledgebase (i-EKbase); including Bureau of Meteorology SILO, Australian Water Availability Project, Australian Soil Resource Information System, Australian National Cosmic Ray Soil Moisture Monitoring Facility, and NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Unsupervised clustering techniques based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Fuzzy-C-Means (FCM) and Self-organizing map (SOM) were used to create a 2D colour knowledge map representing the dynamics of the i-EKbase to provide "prior knowledge" about the integrated knowledgebase. Prior availability of recommendations from the knowledge base could potentially optimize the accessibility and usability issues related to big data sets and minimize the overall application costs. RDF representation has made i-EKbase flexible enough to publish and integrate on the Linked Open Data cloud. This newly developed system was evaluated as an expert agricultural decision support for sustainable water resource management case study in Australia at Tasmania with promising results.

Machine Learning Techniques Accurately Classify Microbial Communities by Bacterial Vaginosis Characteristics	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VAGINAL MICROBIOME; ASSOCIATIONS; CULTIVATION; PERSPECTIVE; INFECTIONS; SEQUENCES; OBESITY; MODELS; WOMEN; TREE	Microbial communities are important to human health. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a disease associated with the vagina microbiome. While the causes of BV are unknown, the microbial community in the vagina appears to play a role. We use three different machine-learning techniques to classify microbial communities into BV categories. These three techniques include genetic programming (GP), random forests (RF), and logistic regression (LR). We evaluate the classification accuracy of each of these techniques on two different datasets. We then deconstruct the classification models to identify important features of the microbial community. We found that the classification models produced by the machine learning techniques obtained accuracies above 90% for Nugent score BV and above 80% for Amsel criteria BV. While the classification models identify largely different sets of important features, the shared features often agree with past research.

However, the level of acceptance and success of prediction models are still below expectation due to some difficulties such as the low performance of prediction models when they are applied in different environments. Such a problem has been addressed by many researchers, mainly from the machine learning community. A second problem, principally raised by model users in different communities, such as managers, economists, engineers, biologists, and medical practitioners, etc., is the prediction models' interpretability. The latter is the ability of a model to explain its predictions and exhibit the causality relationships between the inputs and the outputs. In the case of classification, a successful way to alleviate the low performance is to use ensemble classiers. It is an intuitive strategy to activate collaboration between different classifiers towards a better performance than individual classier. Unfortunately, ensemble classifiers method do not take into account the interpretability of the final classification outcome. It even worsens the original interpretability of the individual classifiers. In this paper we propose a novel implementation of classifiers combination approach that does not only promote the overall performance but also preserves the interpretability of the resulting model. We propose a solution based on Ant Colony Optimization and tailored for the case of Bayesian classifiers. We validate our proposed solution with case studies from medical domain namely, heart disease and Cardiotography-based predictions, problems where interpretability is critical to make appropriate clinical decisions.

J	Xu, LL; Li, J; Brenning, A				Xu, Linlin; Li, Jonathan; Brenning, Alexander			A comparative study of different classification techniques for marine oil spill identification using RADARSAT-1 imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Marine oil-spill detection; SAR; Classifier comparison; Bootstrap-aggregated tree-based methods; Support vector machine; Artificial neural network; Generalized additive model; Penalized linear discriminant analysis	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; ERS SAR IMAGES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; AUTOMATIC DETECTION; FEATURE-SELECTION; IKONOS IMAGERY; ROC ANALYSIS; ALGORITHMS; CLASSIFIERS; ENVISAT	The discrimination of oil spills and look-alike phenomena (e.g., low wind area, wind front area and natural slicks) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is a crucial task in marine oil spill detection. Many classification techniques can be employed for this purpose. In order to make the best use of the large variety of statistical and machine learning classification methods, it is necessary to assess their performance differences and make recommendations for classifier selection and improvement. The objective of this paper is to compare different classification techniques for oil-spill detection in RADARSAT-1 imagery. The data of this study consists of 15 features of 192 oil spills and look-alikes identified by Canadian Ice Service between 2004 and 2008 off Canada's east and west coastal areas. The studied classifiers include the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), tree-based ensemble classifiers (bagging, bundling and boosting), Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Penalized Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA). Two performance measures, the specificity at fixed sensitivity (80%) and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), were estimated using cross-validation to evaluate the performance of classifiers at a high sensitivity. Overall, the bundling technique which achieved a median specificity of 90.7%, at sensitivity of 80%, significantly outperformed the second best (i.e. bagging) by 1.5 percentage points, and the worst (i.e. ANN) by 15 percentage points. The median values of AUC measure indicated consistent results. Bundling and bagging achieved comparable median AUC values of about 92%, followed by GAM and PLDA, with ANN yielding the smallest. Most classifiers (SVM, bundling and especially PLDA and ANN) performed significantly better on datasets pre-processed by log-transformation and standardization than on the original dataset. These results demonstrate the importance and benefit of selecting the optimal classifiers for oil spill classification, and configuring the classifiers by proper feature construction techniques.

Random forests (RF) models contain a combination of characteristics that make them well suited for its application in precipitation remote sensing. One of the key advantages is the ability to capture non-linear association of patterns between predictors and response which becomes important when dealing with complex non-linear events like precipitation. Due to the deficiencies of existing optical rainfall retrievals, the focus of this study is on assigning rainfall rates to precipitating cloud areas in connection with extra-tropical cyclones in mid-latitudes including both convective and advective-stratiform precipitating cloud areas. Hence, the rainfall rates are assigned to rain areas previously identified and classified according to the precipitation formation processes. As predictor variables water vapor-IR differences and IR cloud top temperature are used to incorporate information on cloud top height. Delta T8.7-10.8 and Delta T10.8-12.1 are considered to supply information about the cloud phase. Furthermore, spectral SEVIRI channels (VIS0.6, VIS0.8, NIR1.6) and cloud properties (cloud effective radius, cloud optical thickness) are used to include information about the cloud water path during daytime, while suitable combinations of temperature differences (Delta T3.9-10.8, Delta T3.9-7.3) are considered during night-time. The development of the rainfall rate retrieval technique is realised in three steps. First, an extensive tuning study is carried out to customise each of the RE models. The daytime, night-time and twilight precipitation events have to be treated separately due to differing information content about the cloud properties between the different times of day. Secondly, the RF models are trained using the optimum values for the number of trees and number of randomly chosen predictor variables found in the tuning study. Finally, the final RF models are used to predict rainfall rates using an independent validation data set and the results are validated against co-located rainfall rates observed by a ground radar network. To train and validate the model, the radar-based RADOLAN RW product from the German Weather Service (DWD) is used which provides area-wide gauge-adjusted hourly precipitation information. Regarding the overall performance, as indicated by the coefficient of determination (Rsq), hourly rainfall rates show already a good correlation with Rsq = 0.5 (day and night) and Rsq = 0.48 (twilight) between the satellite and radar based observations. Higher temporal aggregation leads to better agreement. Rsq rises to 0.78 (day), 0.77 (night) and 0.75 (twilight) for 8-h interval. By comparing day, night and twilight performance it becomes evident that daytime precipitation is generally predicted best by the model. Twilight and night-time predictions are generally less accurate but only by a small margin. This may due to the smaller number of predictor variables during twilight and night-time conditions as well as less favourable radiative transfer conditions to obtain the cloud parameters during these periods. However, the results show that with the newly developed method it is possible to assign rainfall rates with good accuracy even on an hourly basis. Furthermore, the rainfall rates can be assigned during day, night and twilight conditions which enables the estimation of rainfall rates 24 h day. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The aimof reverse engineering is to infer, analyse and understand, through this interplay, the functional and regulatory mechanisms of biological systems. Reverse engineering is not exclusive of systems biology and has been studied in different areas, such as inverse problem theory, machine learning, nonlinear physics, (bio) chemical kinetics, control theory and optimization, among others. However, it seems that many of these areas have been relatively closed to outsiders. In this contribution, we aim to compare and highlight the different perspectives and contributions from these fields, with emphasis on two key questions: (i) why are reverse engineering problems so hard to solve, and (ii) what methods are available for the particular problems arising from systems biology?

Previous studies adopted simple measurements, such as plant-height, stem-diameter and branching-intensity for QTL mapping of plant architecture. Many of these quantitative traits were generally correlated to each other, which give rise to statistical problem in the detection of QTL. We aim to test the applicability of kernel methods to phenotyping inflorescence architecture and its QTL mapping. We first test Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) over an artificial dataset of simulated inflorescences with different types of flower distribution, which is coded as a sequence of flower-number per node along a shoot. The ability of discriminating the different inflorescence types by SVM and KPCA is illustrated. We then apply the KPCA representation to the real dataset of rose inflorescence shoots (n=1460) obtained from a 98 F-1 hybrid mapping population. We find kernel principal components with high heritability ( > 0.7), and the QTL analysis identifies a new QTL, which was not detected by a trait-by-trait analysis of simple architectural measurements. The main tools developed in this paper could be use to tackle the general problem of QTL mapping of complex (sequences, 3D structure, graphs) phenotypic traits. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Assisting in search heuristics selection through multidimensional supervised classification: A case study on software testing	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Algorithm selection; Multidimensional classification; Dominance relation; Search based software testing	HARD OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS; TEST DATA GENERATION; MULTIPLE DATA SETS; ALGORITHM SELECTION; EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; LEARNING TECHNIQUES; PROBLEM DIFFICULTY; CLASSIFIERS	A fundamental question in the field of approximation algorithms, for a given problem instance, is the selection of the best (or a suitable) algorithm with regard to some performance criteria. A practical strategy for facing this problem is the application of machine learning techniques. However, limited support has been given in the literature to the case of more than one performance criteria, which is the natural scenario for approximation algorithms. We propose multidimensional Bayesian network (mBN) classifiers as a relatively simple, yet well-principled, approach for helping to solve this problem. Precisely, we relax the algorithm selection decision problem into the elucidation of the nondominated subset of algorithms, which contains the best. This formulation can be used in different ways to elucidate the main problem, each of which can be tackled with an mBN classifier. Namely, we deal with two of them: the prediction of the whole nondominated set and whether an algorithm is nondominated or not. We illustrate the feasibility of the approach for real-life scenarios with a case study in the context of Search Based Software Test Data Generation (SBSTDG). A set of five SBSTDG generators is considered and the aim is to assist a hypothetical test engineer in elucidating good generators to fulfil the branch testing of a given programme.

Evolving decision trees with beam search-based initialization and lexicographic multi-objective evaluation	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Decision tree; Lexicographic optimization; Machine learning; Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm	EVOLUTIONARY INDUCTION; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; DESIGN; CLASSIFICATION; MINIMIZATION; INFERENCE	Decision tree induction algorithms represent one of the most popular techniques for dealing with classification problems. However, traditional decision-tree induction algorithms implement a greedy approach for node splitting that is inherently susceptible to local optima convergence. Evolutionary algorithms can avoid the problems associated with a greedy search and have been successfully employed to the induction of decision trees. Previously, we proposed a lexicographic multi-objective genetic algorithm for decision-tree induction, named LEGAL-Tree. In this work, we propose extending this approach substantially, particularly w.r.t. two important evolutionary aspects: the initialization of the population and the fitness function. We carry out a comprehensive set of experiments to validate our extended algorithm. The experimental results suggest that it is able to outperform both traditional algorithms for decision-tree induction and another evolutionary algorithm in a variety of application domains.

Accurately predicting stroke outcome from a set of predictive variables may identify high-risk patients and guide treatment approaches, leading to decreased morbidity. Logistic regression models allow for the identification and validation of predictive variables. However, advanced machine learning algorithms offer an alternative, in particular, for large-scale multi-institutional data, with the advantage of easily incorporating newly available data to improve prediction performance. Our aim was to design and compare different machine learning methods, capable of predicting the outcome of endovascular intervention in acute anterior circulation ischaemic stroke. Method: We conducted a retrospective study of a prospectively collected database of acute ischaemic stroke treated by endovascular intervention. Using SPSSH, MATLABH, and RapidminerH, classical statistics as well as artificial neural network and support vector algorithms were applied to design a supervised machine capable of classifying these predictors into potential good and poor outcomes. These algorithms were trained, validated and tested using randomly divided data. Results: We included 107 consecutive acute anterior circulation ischaemic stroke patients treated by endovascular technique. Sixty-six were male and the mean age of 65.3. All the available demographic, procedural and clinical factors were included into the models. The final confusion matrix of the neural network, demonstrated an overall congruency of similar to 80% between the target and output classes, with favourable receiving operative characteristics. However, after optimisation, the support vector machine had a relatively better performance, with a root mean squared error of 2.064 (SD: +/- 0.408). Discussion: We showed promising accuracy of outcome prediction, using supervised machine learning algorithms, with potential for incorporation of larger multicenter datasets, likely further improving prediction. Finally, we propose that a robust machine learning system can potentially optimise the selection process for endovascular versus medical treatment in the management of acute stroke.

This paper introduces a new approach to computing we call AHaH computing where memory and processing are combined. The idea is based on the attractor dynamics of volatile dissipative electronics inspired by biological systems, presenting an attractive alternative architecture that is able to adapt, self-repair, and learn from interactions with the environment. We envision that both von Neumann and AHaH computing architectures will operate together on the same machine, but that the AHaH computing processor may reduce the power consumption and processing time for certain adaptive learning tasks by orders of magnitude. The paper begins by drawing a connection between the properties of volatility, thermodynamics, and Anti-Hebbian and Hebbian (AHaH) plasticity. We show how AHaH synaptic plasticity leads to attractor states that extract the independent components of applied data streams and how they form a computationally complete set of logic functions. After introducing a general memristive device model based on collections of metastable switches, we show how adaptive synaptic weights can be formed from differential pairs of incremental memristors. We also disclose how arrays of synaptic weights can be used to build a neural node circuit operating AHaH plasticity. By configuring the attractor states of the AHaH node in different ways, high level machine learning functions are demonstrated. This includes unsupervised clustering, supervised and unsupervised classification, complex signal prediction, unsupervised robotic actuation and combinatorial optimization of procedures-all key capabilities of biological nervous systems and modern machine learning algorithms with real world application.

Here we propose a method based on the concept of data mining. We demonstrate that the proposed method can more accurately detect small erroneous deviations in reconstructed density matrices, which contain intrinsic fluctuations due to the limited number of samples, than a naive method of checking the trace distance from the average of the given density matrices. This method has the potential to be a key tool in broad areas of physics where the detection of small deviations of quantum states reconstructed using a limited number of samples is essential.

It contains 1873 sources, of which 576 remain unassociated. Machine-learning algorithms can be trained on the gamma-ray properties of known active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to find objects with AGN-like properties in the unassociated sample. This analysis finds 231 high-confidence AGN candidates, with increased robustness provided by intersecting two complementary algorithms. A method to estimate the performance of the classification algorithm is also presented, that takes into account the differences between associated and unassociated gamma-ray sources. Follow-up observations targeting AGN candidates, or studies of multiwavelength archival data, will reduce the number of unassociated gamma-ray sources and contribute to a more complete characterization of the population of gamma-ray emitting AGNs.

K.; Yao, Xin			Multiobjective genetic programming for maximizing ROC performance	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Classification; ROC analysis; AUC; ROCCH; Genetic programming; Evolutionary multiobjective algorithm; Memetic algorithm; Decision tree	CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	In binary classification problems, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) graphs are commonly used for visualizing, organizing and selecting classifiers based on their performances. An important issue in the ROC literature is to obtain the ROC convex hull (ROCCH) that covers potentially optima for a given set of classifiers [1]. Maximizing the ROCCH means to maximize the true positive rate (tpr) and minimize the false positive rate (fpr) for every classifier in ROC space, while tpr and fpr are conflicting with each other. In this paper, we propose multiobjective genetic programming (MOGP) to obtain a group of nondominated classifiers, with which the maximum ROCCH can be achieved. Four different multiobjective frameworks, including Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms Based on Decomposition (MOEA/D), Multiobjective selection based on dominated hypervolume (SMS-EMOA), and Approximation-Guided Evolutionary Multi-Objective (AG-EMOA) are adopted into GP, because all of them are successfully applied into many problems and have their own characters. To improve the performance of each individual in GP, we further propose a memetic approach into GP by defining two local search strategies specifically designed for classification problems. Experimental results based on 27 well-known UCI data sets show that MOGP performs significantly better than single objective algorithms such as FGP, GGP, EGP, and MGP, and other traditional machine learning algorithms such as C4.5, Naive Bayes, and PRIE. The experiments also demonstrate the efficacy of the local search operator in the MOGP framework. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Automated quantitative histology reveals vascular morphodynamics during Arabidopsis hypocotyl secondary growth	ELIFE			English	Article							XYLEM DEVELOPMENT; PROLIFERATION; ORGANIZATION; EXPANSION; PLANTS; CELLS; MODEL; WEED; WOOD; ROOT	Among various advantages, their small size makes model organisms preferred subjects of investigation. Yet, even in model systems detailed analysis of numerous developmental processes at cellular level is severely hampered by their scale. For instance, secondary growth of Arabidopsis hypocotyls creates a radial pattern of highly specialized tissues that comprises several thousand cells starting from a few dozen. This dynamic process is difficult to follow because of its scale and because it can only be investigated invasively, precluding comprehensive understanding of the cell proliferation, differentiation, and patterning events involved. To overcome such limitation, we established an automated quantitative histology approach. We acquired hypocotyl cross-sections from tiled high-resolution images and extracted their information content using custom high-throughput image processing and segmentation. Coupled with automated cell type recognition through machine learning, we could establish a cellular resolution atlas that reveals vascular morphodynamics during secondary growth, for example equidistant phloem pole formation.

J	Schmuker, M; Pfeil, T; Nawrot, MP				Schmuker, Michael; Pfeil, Thomas; Nawrot, Martin Paul			A neuromorphic network for generic multivariate data classification	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						bioinspired computing; spiking networks; machine learning; multivariate classification	SELF-ORGANIZATION; OLFACTORY SYSTEM; SPIKING NEURONS; NEURAL-NETWORK; DYNAMICS	Computational neuroscience has uncovered a number of computational principles used by nervous systems. At the same time, neuromorphic hardware has matured to a state where fast silicon implementations of complex neural networks have become feasible. En route to future technical applications of neuromorphic computing the current challenge lies in the identification and implementation of functional brain algorithms. Taking inspiration from the olfactory system of insects, we constructed a spiking neural network for the classification of multivariate data, a common problem in signal and data analysis. In this model, real-valued multivariate data are converted into spike trains using "virtual receptors" (VRs). Their output is processed by lateral inhibition and drives a winner-take-all circuit that supports supervised learning. VRs are conveniently implemented in software, whereas the lateral inhibition and classification stages run on accelerated neuromorphic hardware. When trained and tested on real-world datasets, we find that the classification performance is on par with a naive Bayes classifier. An analysis of the network dynamics shows that stable decisions in output neuron populations are reached within less than 100 ms of biological time, matching the time-to-decision reported for the insect nervous system. Through leveraging a population code, the network tolerates the variability of neuronal transfer functions and trial-totrial variation that is inevitably present on the hardware system. Our work provides a proof of principle for the successful implementation of a functional spiking neural network on a configurable neuromorphic hardware system that can readily be applied to realworld computing problems.

However, imperfect in silico models-even at the secondary structure level-hinder the design of new RNAs that function properly when synthesized. Here, we present a unique and potentially general approach to such empirical problems: the Massive Open Laboratory. The EteRNA project connects 37,000 enthusiasts to RNA design puzzles through an online interface. Uniquely, EteRNA participants not only manipulate simulated molecules but also control a remote experimental pipeline for high-throughput RNA synthesis and structure mapping. We show herein that the EteRNA community leveraged dozens of cycles of continuous wet laboratory feedback to learn strategies for solving in vitro RNA design problems on which automated methods fail. The top strategies-including several previously unrecognized negative design rules-were distilled by machine learning into an algorithm, EteRNABot. Over a rigorous 1-y testing phase, both the EteRNA community and EteRNABot significantly outperformed prior algorithms in a dozen RNA secondary structure design tests, including the creation of dendrimer-like structures and scaffolds for small molecule sensors. These results show that an online community can carry out large-scale experiments, hypothesis generation, and algorithm design to create practical advances in empirical science.

J	Ouyang, T; Ray, S; Allman, M; Rabinovich, M				Ouyang, Tu; Ray, Soumya; Allman, Mark; Rabinovich, Michael			A large-scale empirical analysis of email spam detection through network characteristics in a stand-alone enterprise	COMPUTER NETWORKS			English	Article						Spam; Network-level characteristics; Longitudinal analysis		Spam is a never-ending issue that constantly consumes resources to no useful end. In this paper, we envision spam filtering as a pipeline consisting of DNS blacklists, filters based on SYN packet features, filters based on traffic characteristics and filters based on message content. Each stage of the pipeline examines more information in the message but is more computationally expensive. A message is rejected as spam once any layer is sufficiently confident. We analyze this pipeline, focusing on the first three layers, from a single-enterprise perspective. To do this we use a large email dataset collected over two years. We devise a novel ground truth determination system to allow us to label this large dataset accurately. Using two machine learning algorithms, we study (i) how the different pipeline layers interact with each other and the value added by each layer, (ii) the utility of individual features in each layer, (iii) stability of the layers across time and network events and (iv) an operational use case investigating whether this architecture can be practically useful. We find that (i) the pipeline architecture is generally useful in terms of accuracy as well as in an operational setting, (ii) it generally ages gracefully across long time periods and (iii) in some cases, later layers can compensate for poor performance in the earlier layers. Among the caveats we find are that (i) the utility of network features is not as high in the single enterprise viewpoint as reported in other prior work, (ii) major network events can sharply affect the detection rate, and (iii) the operational (computational) benefit of the pipeline may depend on the efficiency of the final content filter.

However, despite its importance, little is known about the neural processes that underlie material perception in nonhuman primates. Here we conducted an fMRI experiment in awake macaque monkeys to explore how information about various real-world materials is represented in the visual areas of monkeys, how these neural representations correlate with perceptual material properties, and how they correspond to those in human visual areas that have been studied previously. Using a machine-learning technique, the representation in each visual area was read out from multivoxel patterns of regional activity elicited in response to images of nine real-world material categories (metal, wood, fur, etc.). The congruence of the neural representations with either a measure of low-level image properties, such as spatial frequency content, or with the visuotactile properties of materials, such as roughness, hardness, and warmness, were tested. We show that monkey V1 shares a common representation with human early visual areas reflecting low-level image properties. By contrast, monkey V4 and the posterior inferior temporal cortex represent the visuotactile properties of material, as in human ventral higher visual areas, although there were some interspecies differences in the representational structures. We suggest that, in monkeys, V4 and the posterior inferior temporal cortex are important stages for constructing information about the material properties of objects from their low-level image features.

This strategy is often difficult to study because the exact boundaries of a group can be unclear. Weaverbirds present an ideal model for the study of group living, because their colonies occupy a space with discrete boundaries: a single tree. We examined one aspect of group living. nest placement, in three Kenyan weaverbird species: the Black-capped Weaver (Pseudonigrita cabanisi), Grey-capped Weaver (P. arnaudi) and White-browed Sparrow Weaver (Ploceropasser mahali). We asked which environmental, biological, and/or abiotic factors influenced their nest arrangement and location in a given tree. We used machine learning to analyze measurements taken from 16 trees and 516 nests outside the breeding season at the Mpala Research Station in Laikipia Kenya, along with climate data for the area. We found that tree architecture, number of nests per tree, and nest-specific characteristics were the main variables driving nest placement. Our results suggest that different Kenyan weaverbird species have similar priorities driving the selection of where a nest is placed within a given tree. Our work illustrates the advantage of using machine learning techniques to investigate biological questions.

J	Latino, DARS; Aires-de-Sousa, J				Latino, Diogo A. R. S.; Aires-de-Sousa, Joao			Automatic NMR-Based Identification of Chemical Reaction Types in Mixtures of Co-Occurring Reactions	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; H-1-NMR SPECTROSCOPY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; ELUCIDATION; PREDICTION; SPECTRA; SHIFTS	The combination of chemoinformatics approaches with NMR techniques and the increasing availability of data allow the resolution of problems far beyond the original application of NMR in structure elucidation/verification. The diversity of applications can range from process monitoring, metabolic profiling, authentication of products, to quality control. An application related to the automatic analysis of complex mixtures concerns mixtures of chemical reactions. We encoded mixtures of chemical reactions with the difference between the 1 H NMR spectra of the products and the reactants. All the signals arising from all the reactants of the co-occurring reactions were taken together (a simulated spectrum of the mixture of reactants) and the same was done for products. The difference spectrum is taken as the representation of the mixture of chemical reactions. A data set of 181 chemical reactions was used, each reaction manually assigned to one of 6 types. From this dataset, we simulated mixtures where two reactions of different types would occur simultaneously. Automatic learning methods were trained to classify the reactions occurring in a mixture from the 1 H NMR-based descriptor of the mixture. Unsupervised learning methods (self-organizing maps) produced a reasonable clustering of the mixtures by reaction type, and allowed the correct classification of 80% and 63% of the mixtures in two independent test sets of different similarity to the training set. With random forests (RF), the percentage of correct classifications was increased to 99% and 80% for the same test sets. The RF probability associated to the predictions yielded a robust indication of their reliability. This study demonstrates the possibility of applying machine learning methods to automatically identify types of co-occurring chemical reactions from NMR data. Using no explicit structural information about the reactions participants, reaction elucidation is performed without structure elucidation of the molecules in the mixtures.	[Latino, Diogo A. R.

Some of these systems analyze neurological brain images by means of machine learning algorithms in order to find the patterns that characterize the disorder, and a few combine several imaging modalities to improve the diagnostic accuracy. However, they usually do not use neuropsychological testing data in that analysis. The purpose of this work is to measure the advantages of using not only neuroimages as data source in CAD systems for dementia but also neuropsychological scores. To this aim, we compared the accuracy rates achieved by systems that use neuropsychological scores beside the imaging data in the classification step and systems that use only one of these data sources. In order to address the small sample size problem and facilitate the data combination, a dimensionality reduction step (implemented using three different algorithms) was also applied on the imaging data. After each image is summarized in a reduced set of image features, the data sources were combined and classified using three different data combination approaches and a Support Vector Machine classifier. That way, by testing different dimensionality reduction methods and several data combination approaches, we aim not only highlighting the advantages of using neuropsychological scores in the classification, but also implementing the most accurate computer system for early dementia detention. The accuracy of the CAD systems were estimated using a database with records from 46 subjects, diagnosed with MCI or AD. A peak accuracy rate of 89% was obtained. In all cases the accuracy achieved using both, neuropsychological scores and imaging data, was substantially higher than the one obtained using only the imaging data.

J	Danthi, N; Wu, CO; Shi, PB; Lauer, M				Danthi, Narasimhan; Wu, Colin O.; Shi, Peibei; Lauer, Michael			Percentile Ranking and Citation Impact of a Large Cohort of National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-Funded Cardiovascular R01 Grants	CIRCULATION RESEARCH			English	Article						bibliometrics; National Heart; Lung; and Blood Institute (U; S; )	SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTIVITY	Rationale: Funding decisions for cardiovascular R01 grant applications at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) largely hinge on percentile rankings. It is not known whether this approach enables the highest impact science. Objective: Our aim was to conduct an observational analysis of percentile rankings and bibliometric outcomes for a contemporary set of funded NHLBI cardiovascular R01 grants. Methods and Results: We identified 1492 investigator-initiated de novo R01 grant applications that were funded between 2001 and 2008 and followed their progress for linked publications and citations to those publications. Our coprimary end points were citations received per million dollars of funding, citations obtained <2 years of publication, and 2-year citations for each grant's maximally cited paper. In 7654 grant-years of funding that generated $3004 million of total National Institutes of Health awards, the portfolio yielded 16 793 publications that appeared between 2001 and 2012 (median per grant, 8; 25th and 75th percentiles, 4 and 14; range, 0-123), which received 2 224 255 citations (median per grant, 1048; 25th and 75th percentiles, 492 and 1932; range, 0-16 295). We found no association between percentile rankings and citation metrics; the absence of association persisted even after accounting for calendar time, grant duration, number of grants acknowledged per paper, number of authors per paper, early investigator status, human versus nonhuman focus, and institutional funding. An exploratory machine learning analysis suggested that grants with the best percentile rankings did yield more maximally cited papers.

Although antiviral drugs are not able to eradicate the HIV, they are designed to inhibit the function of three essential proteins in the virus replication process: protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase. However, due to a high mutation rate, this virus is capable to develop resistance to existing drugs causing the treatment failure. Several machine learning techniques have been proposed for predicting HIV drugs resistance, but most of them are difficult to interpret. Actually, in last years the protein modeling of this virus has become, from diverse points of view, an open problem for researchers. In this paper we propose a model based on Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) for analyzing the behavior of the HIV-1 protease protein. With this goal in mind, a two-steps learning algorithm using Swarm Intelligence for optimizing the modeling parameters is introduced. The first step is oriented to estimate the biological causality among amino acids describing the sequence through a continuous search method. While resulting adjusted maps are combined into a single one through an aggregation procedure for obtaining an initial prototype map. The second step optimizes the prototype by finding those amino acids directly associated with resistance using a discrete meta-heuristic. At the end, a fully optimized prototype map is obtained allowing predicting HIV-1 drug resistance and also discovering relevant knowledge on causal influences directly associated with resistance, for seven well-known protease inhibitors.

Sn-grams differ from traditional n-grams in the manner how we construct them, i.e., what elements are considered neighbors. In case of sn-grams, the neighbors are taken by following syntactic relations in syntactic trees, and not by taking words as they appear in a text, i.e., sn-grams are constructed by following paths in syntactic trees. In this manner, sn-grams allow bringing syntactic knowledge into machine learning methods; still, previous parsing is necessary for their construction. Sn-grams can be applied in any natural language processing (NLP) task where traditional n-grams are used. We describe how sn-grams were applied to authorship attribution. We used as baseline traditional n-grams of words, part of speech (PUS) tags and characters; three classifiers were applied: support vector machines (SVM), naive Bayes (NB), and tree classifier J48. Sn-grams give better results with SVM classifier. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A multiple kernel learning approach to perform classification of groups from complex-valued fMRI data analysis: Application to schizophrenia	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Complex-valued fMRI data; Multiple kernel learning; Feature selection; Independent component analysis; Support vector machines; Schizophrenia	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; RESONANCE-IMAGING DATA; TALAIRACH ATLAS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; DATA FUSION; BRAIN; PHASE; BOLD; ALGORITHMS; SELECTION	FMRI data are acquired as complex-valued spatiotemporal images. Despite the fact that several studies have identified the presence of novel information in the phase images, they are usually discarded due to their noisy nature. Several approaches have been devised to incorporate magnitude and phase data, but none of them has performed between-group inference or classification. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) is a powerful field of machine learning that finds an automatic combination of kernel functions that can be applied to multiple data sources. By analyzing this combination of kernels, the most informative data sources can be found, hence providing a better understanding of the analyzed learning task. This paper presents a methodology based on a new MKL algorithm (v-MKL) capable of achieving a tunable sparse selection of features' sets (brain regions' patterns) that improves the classification accuracy rate of healthy controls and schizophrenia patients by 5% when phase data is included. In addition, the proposed method achieves accuracy rates that are equivalent to those obtained by the state of the art lrnorm MKL algorithm on the schizophrenia dataset and we argue that it better identifies the brain regions that show discriminative activation between groups. This claim is supported by the more accurate detection achieved by v-MKL of the degree of information present on regions of spatial maps extracted from a simulated fMRI dataset. In summary, we present an MKL-based methodology that improves schizophrenia characterization by using both magnitude and phase fMRI data and is also capable of detecting the brain regions that convey most of the discriminative information between patients and controls.

Machine learning classification of cell-specific cardiac enhancers uncovers developmental subnetworks regulating progenitor cell division and cell fate specification	DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Machine learning; Gene regulation; Transcription factors; Progenitor specification; Cell division; Organogenesis; Drosophila	FORKHEAD TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; GENOME-WIDE DISCOVERY; GENE-EXPRESSION; DROSOPHILA-MYB; NOTCH PATHWAY; HEART; NETWORKS; TARGET; TINMAN; HEMATOPOIESIS	The Drosophila heart is composed of two distinct cell types, the contractile cardial cells (CCs) and the surrounding non-muscle pericardial cells (PCs), development of which is regulated by a network of conserved signaling molecules and transcription factors (TFs). Here, we used machine learning with array-based chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data and TF sequence motifs to computationally classify cell type-specific cardiac enhancers. Extensive testing of predicted enhancers at single-cell resolution revealed the added value of ChIP data for modeling cell type-specific activities. Furthermore, clustering the top-scoring classifier sequence features identified novel cardiac and cell type-specific regulatory motifs. For example, we found that the Myb motif learned by the classifier is crucial for CC activity, and the Myb TF acts in concert with two forkhead domain TFs and Polo kinase to regulate cardiac progenitor cell divisions. In addition, differential motif enrichment and cis-trans genetic studies revealed that the Notch signaling pathway TF Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] discriminates PC from CC enhancer activities. Collectively, these studies elucidate molecular pathways used in the regulatory decisions for proliferation and differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells, implicate Su(H) in regulating cell fate decisions of these progenitors, and document the utility of enhancer modeling in uncovering developmental regulatory subnetworks.

As a supplementary of this consideration, this paper focuses on construction of feature space related to fuzzy similarity relations as indefinite kernels. First we generalize the Mercer Theorem from positive definite kernels to fuzzy similarity relations. With this generalization we construct the feature space related to a fuzzy similarity relation as a particular Krein space. The proposed feature space is a naturally generalization of the existing Pseudo-Euclidean space from finite to infinite universe of discourses. At the end of this paper we develop an open problem to set up the connection between transitivity and the positive definiteness of a fuzzy similarity relation. Results in this paper complete the mathematical foundation for further applications of fuzzy similarity relations under the framework of kernel tricks. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The WB-MTE algorithm was firstly trained by combining monthly WB-estimated basin ET with the potential drivers (e.g., radiation, temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and vegetation index) across 95 large river basins (5824 basin-months) and then applied to establish global monthly ET maps at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees from 1982 to 2009. The global land ET estimated from WB-MTE has an annual mean of 59317mm for 1982-2009, with a spatial distribution consistent with previous studies in all latitudes but the tropics. The ET estimated by WB-MTE also shows significant linear trends in both annual and seasonal global ET during 1982-2009, though the trends seem to have stalled after 1998. Moreover, our study presents a striking difference from the previous ones primarily in the magnitude of ET estimates during the wet season particularly in the tropics, where ET is highly uncertain due to lack of direct measurements. This may be tied to their lack of proper consideration to solar radiation and/or the rainfall interception process. By contrast, in the dry season, our estimate of ET compares well with the previous ones, both for the mean state and the variability. If we are to reduce the uncertainties in estimating ET, these results emphasize the necessity of deploying more observations during the wet season, particularly in the tropics.

J	Szymanski, J				Szymanski, Julian			Comparative Analysis of Text Representation Methods Using Classification	CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						text classification; documents categorization; information retrieval; Wikipedia; text representation		In our work, we review and empirically evaluate five different raw methods of text representation that allow automatic processing of Wikipedia articles. The main contribution of the article-evaluation of approaches to text representation for machine learning tasks-indicates that the text representation is fundamental for achieving good categorization results. The analysis of the representation methods creates a baseline that cannot be compensated for even by sophisticated machine learning algorithms. It confirms the thesis that proper data representation is a prerequisite for achieving high-quality results of data analysis. Evaluation of the text representations was performed within the Wikipedia repository by examination of classification parameters observed during automatic reconstruction of human-made categories. For that purpose, we use a classifier based on a support vector machines method, extended with multilabel and multiclass functionalities. During classifier construction we observed parameters such as learning time, representation size, and classification quality that allow us to draw conclusions about text representations. For the experiments presented in the article, we use data sets created from Wikipedia dumps. We describe our software, called Matrix'u, which allows a user to build computational representations of Wikipedia articles. The software is the second contribution of our research, because it is a universal tool for converting Wikipedia from a human-readable form to a form that can be processed by a machine. Results generated using Matrix'u can be used in a wide range of applications that involve usage of Wikipedia data.

Mapping geology and volcanic-hosted massive sulfide alteration in the Hellyer-Mt Charter region, Tasmania, using Random Forests (TM) and Self-Organising Maps	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Tasmania; Random Forests; machine learning; Self-Organising Maps; geological mapping; volcanic-hosted massive sulfide	LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; IMAGING SPECTROMETER DATA; AIRBORNE GEOPHYSICS; EXPLORATION; DEPOSITS; IDENTIFICATION; AUSTRALIA; LITHOLOGY; TM	The Hellyer-Mt Charter region of western Tasmania includes three known and economically significant volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) deposits. Thick vegetation and poor outcrop present a considerable challenge to ongoing detailed geological field mapping in this area. Numerous geophysical and soil geochemical datasets covering the Hellyer-Mt Charter region have been collected in recent years. These data provide a rich source of geological information that can assist in defining the spatial distribution of lithologies. The integration and analysis of many layers of data in order to derive meaningful geological interpretations is a non-trivial task; however, machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests and Self-Organising Maps offer geologists methods for indentifying patterns in high-dimensional (many layered) data. In this study, we validate an interpreted geological map of the Hellyer-Mt Charter region by employing Random Forests (TM) to classify geophysical and geochemical data into 21 discrete lithological units. Our comparison of Random Forests supervised classification predictions to the interpreted geological map highlights the efficacy of this algorithm to map complex geological terranes. Furthermore, Random Forests identifies new geological details regarding the spatial distributions of key lithologies within the economically important Que-Hellyer Volcanics (QHV). We then infer distinct but spatially contiguous sub-classes within footwall and hangingwall, basalts and andesites of the QHV using Self-Organising Maps, an unsupervised clustering algorithm. Insight into compositional variability within volcanic units is gained by visualising the spatial distributions of sub-classes and associated statistical distributions of key geochemical data. Compositional differences in volcanic units are interpreted to reflect contrasting primary composition and VHMS alteration styles. We conclude that combining supervised and unsupervised machine-learning algorithms provides a widely applicable, robust means, of analysing complex and disparate data for machine-assisted geological mapping in challenging terranes.

Predicting risky choices from brain activity patterns	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						fMRI; machine learning; decision-making	TAKING DECISION-MAKING; TASK BART; ACTIVATION; PROPENSITY; INSULA; CORTEX; REWARD; FMRI	Previous research has implicated a large network of brain regions in the processing of risk during decision making. However, it has not yet been determined if activity in these regions is predictive of choices on future risky decisions. Here, we examined functional MRI data from a large sample of healthy subjects performing a naturalistic risk-taking task and used a classification analysis approach to predict whether individuals would choose risky or safe options on upcoming trials. We were able to predict choice category successfully in 71.8% of cases. Searchlight analysis revealed a network of brain regions where activity patterns were reliably predictive of subsequent risk-taking behavior, including a number of regions known to play a role in control processes. Searchlights with significant predictive accuracy were primarily located in regions more active when preparing to avoid a risk than when preparing to engage in one, suggesting that risk taking may be due, in part, to a failure of the control systems necessary to initiate a safe choice. Additional analyses revealed that subject choice can be successfully predicted with minimal decrements in accuracy using highly condensed data, suggesting that information relevant for risky choice behavior is encoded in coarse global patterns of activation as well as within highly local activation within searchlights.

This study presents an application of the combination of systematic DFT calculations and regression techniques to the prediction of the melting temperature for single and binary compounds. Here we adopt the ordinary least-squares regression, partial least-squares regression, support vector regression, and Gaussian process regression. Among the four kinds of regression techniques, SVR provides the best prediction. The inclusion of physical properties computed by the DFT calculation to a set of predictor variables makes the prediction better. In addition, limitation of the predictive power is shown when extrapolation from the training dataset is required. Finally, a simulation to find the highest melting temperature toward the efficient materials design using kriging is demonstrated. The kriging design finds the compound with the highest melting temperature much faster than random designs. This result may stimulate the application of kriging to efficient materials design for a broad range of applications.

Discovery of materials with very low or high kappa(omega) remains an experimental challenge due to high costs and time-consuming synthesis procedures. High-throughput computational prescreening is a valuable approach for significantly reducing the set of candidate compounds. In this article, we introduce efficient methods for reliably estimating the bulk kappa(omega) for a large number of compounds. The algorithms are based on a combination of machine-learning algorithms, physical insights, and automatic ab initio calculations. We scanned approximately 79,000 half-Heusler entries in the AFLOWLIB.org database. Among the 450 mechanically stable ordered semiconductors identified, we find that kappa(omega) spans more than 2 orders of magnitude-a much larger range than that previously thought. kappa(omega) is lowest for compounds whose elements in equivalent positions have large atomic radii. We then perform a thorough screening of thermodynamical stability that allows us to reduce the list to 75 systems. We then provide a quantitative estimate of kappa(omega) for this selected range of systems. Three semiconductors having kappa(omega) < 5 Wm(-1) K-1 are proposed for further experimental study.

Recent vehicular communication technologies allow for remote access to extensive amount of vehicle data in a cost-effective way, which enables in-depth field issue analysis. However, practical solutions are still lacking to effectively turn the massive amount of raw data into actionable design enhancement suggestions. In this paper, we propose a general framework, named Automatic Field Data Analyzer (AFDA), and related algorithms that analyze large volumes of field data, and identify root causes of faults by systematically making use of signal processing, machine learning, and statistical analysis approaches. AFDA evaluates vehicle system performance, generates feature vectors that represent different root causes of faults, and identifies the features that are most relevant to system performance fluctuation, which eventually reveals the underlying reasons for the faults. This paper presents a case study of AFDA in the application of vehicle battery, where gigabytes of real vehicle data are sifted through, and the root causes of field issues are identified. The results well match the findings from experts with years of experiences. The proposed data-based scheme and approaches can be generally applied to any vehicle systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Significance analysis applied to manufacturing process parameters can be a useful tool in fault diagnosis for various types of manufacturing processes. It can also be applied to building models that are used in process control. The relative significances of input variables can be determined by various data mining methods, including relatively simple statistical procedures as well as more advanced machine learning systems. Several methodologies suitable for carrying out classification tasks which are characteristic of fault diagnosis were evaluated and compared from the viewpoint of their accuracy, robustness of results and applicability. Two types of testing data were used: synthetic data with assumed dependencies and real data obtained from the foundry industry. The simple statistical method based on contingency tables revealed the best overall performance, whereas advanced machine learning models, such as ANNs and SVMs, appeared to be of less value.

Despite the important benefits this paradigm provides, current approaches for service-enabling applications still lead to high costs for outsourcing services with regard to two phases of the software life cycle. During the implementation phase, developers have to invest much effort into manually discovering services and then providing code to invoke them. Mostly, the outcome of the second task is software containing service-aware code, therefore it is more difficult to modify and to test during the maintenance phase. This paper describes EasySOC, an approach that aims to decrease the costs of creating and maintaining service-oriented applications. EasySOC combines text mining, machine learning, and best practices from component-based software development to allow developers to quickly discover and non-invasively invoke services. We evaluated the performance of the EasySOC discovery mechanism using 391 services. In addition, through a case study, we conducted a comparative analysis of the software technical quality achieved by employing EasySOC versus not using it. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Quite often, the DSS solutions are not fully accepted by users because DSSs work as a black box so that the users cannot fully understand where the results came from and how they were derived. Explanations of the generated DSSs solutions are expected to mitigate this situation. In this paper, two machine-learning techniques, called rough set analysis (RSA) and dependency network analysis (DNA), are proposed for mining DSS solutions. The mining results are provided to the users as explanations for those solutions. Two parts of research results are described. First, a framework applying RSA and DNA for generating explanations for DSS solutions is presented. This framework is generic and applicable to many other DSSs. Second, as a proof-of-concept, the applications of RSA and DNA techniques are demonstrated through a case study of mining patterns from input-output pairs of ReleasePlanner (TM), a specific DSS for product release planning. Our evaluation indicates that the explanations generated by RSA and DNA improve the overall user acceptance of results provided by this specific DSS. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Mahalingam, R; Peng, HP; Yang, AS				Mahalingam, Rajasekaran; Peng, Hung-Pin; Yang, An-Suei			Prediction of FMN-binding residues with three-dimensional probability distributions of interacting atoms on protein surfaces	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Structure-based; Computational method; Machine learning; Drug discovery; Functional annotation	CHORISMATE SYNTHASE; SITES	Flavin mono-nucleotide (FMN) is a cofactor which is involved in many biological reactions. The insights on protein-FMN interactions aid the protein functional annotation and also facilitate in drug design. In this study, we have established a new method, making use of an encoding scheme of the three-dimensional probability density maps that describe the distributions of 40 non-covalent interacting atom types around protein surfaces, to predict FMN-binding sites on protein surfaces. One machine learning model was trained for each of the 30 protein atom types to predict tentative FMN-binding sites on protein structures. The method's capability was evaluated by five-fold cross-validation on a dataset containing 81 non-redundant FMN-binding protein structures and further tested on independent datasets of 30 and 15 non-redundant protein structures respectively. These predictions achieved an accuracy of 0.94, 0.94 and 0.96 with the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.53, 0.53 and 0.65 respectively for the three protein structure sets. The prediction capability is superior to the existing method. This is the first structure-based approach that does not rely on evolutionary information for predicting FMN-interacting residues.

Love Thy Neighbour: Automatic Animal Behavioural Classification of Acceleration Data Using the K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BODY ACCELERATION; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; ADELIE PENGUINS; LOCOMOTION; ECOLOGY; ACCELEROMETER; SYSTEM; SPEED	Researchers hoping to elucidate the behaviour of species that aren't readily observed are able to do so using biotelemetry methods. Accelerometers in particular are proving particularly effective and have been used on terrestrial, aquatic and volant species with success. In the past, behavioural modes were detected in accelerometer data through manual inspection, but with developments in technology, modern accelerometers now record at frequencies that make this impractical. In light of this, some researchers have suggested the use of various machine learning approaches as a means to classify accelerometer data automatically. We feel uptake of this approach by the scientific community is inhibited for two reasons; 1) Most machine learning algorithms require selection of summary statistics which obscure the decision mechanisms by which classifications are arrived, and 2) they are difficult to implement without appreciable computational skill. We present a method which allows researchers to classify accelerometer data into behavioural classes automatically using a primitive machine learning algorithm, k-nearest neighbour (KNN). Raw acceleration data may be used in KNN without selection of summary statistics, and it is easily implemented using the freeware program R. The method is evaluated by detecting 5 behavioural modes in 8 species, with examples of quadrupedal, bipedal and volant species. Accuracy and Precision were found to be comparable with other, more complex methods. In order to assist in the application of this method, the script required to run KNN analysis in R is provided. We envisage that the KNN method may be coupled with methods for investigating animal position, such as GPS telemetry or dead-reckoning, in order to implement an integrated approach to movement ecology research.

We report here findings that extend existing knowledge and show that a modified reinforcement learning model, which has separate parameters according to whether the previous trial gave a reward or a punishment, can provide the best fit to human behavior in decision making under uncertainty. More specifically, we examined the fit of our modified reinforcement learning model to human behavioral data in a probabilistic two-alternative decision making task with rule reversals. Our results demonstrate that this model predicted human behavior better than a series of other models based on reinforcement learning or Bayesian reasoning. Unlike the Bayesian models, our modified reinforcement learning model does not include any representation of rule switches. When our task is considered purely as a machine learning task, to gain as many rewards as possible without trying to describe human behavior, the performance of modified reinforcement learning and Bayesian methods is similar. Others have used various computational models to describe human behavior in similar tasks, however, we are not aware of any who have compared Bayesian reasoning with reinforcement learning modified to differentiate rewards and punishments.

Their main virtue is their ability to model high-dimensional datasets, e.g., multivariate analysis of activation images or resting-state time series. Supervised learning is typically used in decoding or encoding settings to relate brain images to behavioral or clinical observations, while unsupervised learning can uncover hidden structures in sets of images (e.g., resting state functional MRI) or find sub-populations in large cohorts. By considering different functional neuroimaging applications, we illustrate how scikit-learn, a Python machine learning library, can be used to perform some key analysis steps. Scikit-learn contains a very large set of statistical learning algorithms, both supervised and unsupervised, and its application to neuroimaging data provides a versatile tool to study the brain.

A Semi-Automated Pipeline for the Segmentation of Rhesus Macaque Hippocampus: Validation across a Wide Age Range	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MESIAL TEMPORAL SCLEROSIS; DEFORMATION-BASED SEGMENTATION; AUTOMATED SEGMENTATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; COGNITIVE DECLINE; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; MACACA-MULATTA; SHAPE-ANALYSIS; LOBE EPILEPSY; AMYGDALA	This report outlines a neuroimaging pipeline that allows a robust, high-throughput, semi-automated, template-based protocol for segmenting the hippocampus in rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) monkeys ranging from 1 week to 260 weeks of age. The semiautomated component of this approach minimizes user effort while concurrently maximizing the benefit of human expertise by requiring as few as 10 landmarks to be placed on images of each hippocampus to guide registration. Any systematic errors in the normalization process are corrected using a machine-learning algorithm that has been trained by comparing manual and automated segmentations to identify systematic errors. These methods result in high spatial overlap and reliability when compared with the results of manual tracing protocols. They also dramatically reduce the time to acquire data, an important consideration in large-scale neuroradiological studies involving hundreds of MRI scans. Importantly, other than the initial generation of the unbiased template, this approach requires only modest neuroanatomical training. It has been validated for high-throughput studies of rhesus macaque hippocampal anatomy across a broad age range.

J	Gasior, P; Kotulska, M				Gasior, Pawel; Kotulska, Malgorzata			FISH Amyloid - a new method for finding amyloidogenic segments in proteins based on site specific co-occurence of aminoacids	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Machine learning; Amyloid; Intramolecular contact sites; Hot spot	PHOENIX-DACTYLIFERA L.; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; SAUDI-ARABIA; CULTIVARS; DIFFERENTIATION; ELECTROPHORESIS; IDENTIFICATION; PHENOMICS; DIVERSITY	Background: Amyloids are proteins capable of forming fibrils whose intramolecular contact sites assume densely packed zipper pattern. Their oligomers can underlie serious diseases, e. g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Recent studies show that short segments of aminoacids can be responsible for amyloidogenic properties of a protein. A few hundreds of such peptides have been experimentally found but experimental testing of all candidates is currently not feasible. Here we propose an original machine learning method for classification of aminoacid sequences, based on discovering a segment with a discriminative pattern of site-specific co-occurrences between sequence elements. The pattern is based on the positions of residues with correlated occurrence over a sliding window of a specified length. The algorithm first recognizes the most relevant training segment in each positive training instance. Then the classification is based on maximal distances between co-occurrence matrix of the relevant segments in positive training sequences and the matrix from negative training segments. The method was applied for studying sequences of aminoacids with regard to their amyloidogenic properties. Results: Our method was first trained on available datasets of hexapeptides with the amyloidogenic classification, using 5 or 6-residue sliding windows. Depending on the choice of training and testing datasets, the area under ROC curve obtained the value up to 0.80 for experimental, and 0.95 for computationally generated (with 3D profile method) datasets. Importantly, the results on 5-residue segments were not significantly worse, although the classification required that algorithm first recognized the most relevant training segments. The dataset of long sequences, such as sup35 prion and a few other amyloid proteins, were applied to test the method and gave encouraging results. Our web tool FISH Amyloid was trained on all available experimental data 4-10 residues long, offers prediction of amyloidogenic segments in protein sequences. Conclusions: We proposed a new original classification method which recognizes co-occurrence patterns in sequences. The method reveals characteristic classification pattern of the data and finds the segments where its scoring is the strongest, also in long training sequences. Applied to the problem of amyloidogenic segments recognition, it showed a good potential for classification problems in bioinformatics.

The only successful human machine interface is surface electromyography, typically allowing control of a few degrees of freedom. Machine learning techniques may have the potential to remove these limitations, but their performance is thus far inadequate: myoelectric signals change over time under the influence of various factors, deteriorating control performance. It is therefore necessary, in the standard approach, to regularly retrain a new model from scratch. We hereby propose a non-linear incremental learning method in which occasional updates with a modest amount of novel training data allow continual adaptation to the changes in the signals. In particular, Incremental Ridge Regression and an approximation of the Gaussian Kernel known as Random Fourier Features are combined to predict finger forces from myoelectric signals, both finger-by-finger and grouped in grasping patterns. We show that the approach is effective and practically applicable to this problem by first analyzing its performance while predicting single-finger forces. Surface electromyography and finger forces were collected from 10 intact subjects during four sessions spread over two different days; the results of the analysis show that small incremental updates are indeed effective to maintain a stable level of performance. Subsequently, we employed the same method on-line to teleoperate a humanoid robotic arm equipped with a state-of-the-art commercial prosthetic hand. The subject could reliably grasp, carry and release everyday-life objects, enforcing stable grasping irrespective of the signal changes, hand/arm movements and wrist pronation and supination.

The multiple classifier system (MCS) based on the dynamic ensemble selection scheme was constructed using both developed measures. Two different optimization problems of ensemble selection are defined and a solution based on the simulated annealing algorithm is presented. The influence of minimum value of competence and diversity in the ensemble on classification performance was investigated. The effectiveness of the proposed dynamic selection methods and the influence of both measures were tested using seven databases taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and the StatLib statistical dataset. Two types of ensembles were used: homogeneous or heterogeneous. The results show that the use of diversity positively affects the quality of classification. In addition, cases have been identified in which the use of this measure has the greatest impact on quality. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This is the case of Parkinsonian Syndrome (PS) or Parkinsonism, which is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, where I-123-ioflupane (better known by its tradename, DaTSCAN) images have been of great help. Recently, new developments in machine learning methods and statistics have been applied to the analysis of medical images, yielding to a more operator-independent, objective analysis of them, and thus, setting the Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) paradigm. In this work, a new CAD system based on preprocessing, voxel selection, feature extraction and classification of the images is proposed. After preprocessing the images, voxels are ranked by means of their significance in class discrimination, and the first N are selected. Then, these voxels are modelled using Independent Component Analysis (ICA), obtaining a few components that represent each image, which will be used later to train a classifier. The proposed system has been tested on two databases: a 208-DaTSCAN image database from the "Virgen de la Victoria" Hospital in Malaga (VV), Spain and a 289-DaTSCAN image database from the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Values of accuracy up to 94.7% and 91.3% for W and PPMI databases are achieved by the proposed system, which has proved its robustness in PS pattern detection, and significantly improves the baseline Voxels-as-Features (VAF) approach, used as an approximation of the visual analysis.

Motivated by the importance of these themes which are generally interrelated, we propose a statistical framework for simultaneous online clustering and feature selection using finite generalized Dirichlet mixture model. The proposed framework allows to control overfitting by, dynamically and simultaneously, adjusting the mixture model's parameters, number of components and the features weights. We describe a principled variational approach for learning the parameters of the proposed statistical model. Results on both synthetic data and real applications involving online documents and images clustering show the merits of the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

During learning with this method a near-minimal network architecture is found. MLP learning is conducted separately by individual layers and neurons. The algorithm is tested in computer simulation with simple learning patterns (XOR and triangles image), with traditional learning patterns (Iris and Pen-Based Recognition of Handwritten Digits) and with noisy learning patterns. During the learning process we observed the following behaviour of BPM: capability to focus on global minima, good generalisation, no problems in learning with noisy, multi-dimensional and numerous learning patterns. The Border Pairs Method also supports incremental and online learning. Both are realized with or without MLP reconstruction and with or without forgetting (unlearning). The learning results with the BPM method are comparable with results from other methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A Data-Driven Algorithm Integrating Clinical and Laboratory Features for the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Necrotizing Enterocolitis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BIRTH-WEIGHT INFANTS; ISOLATED INTESTINAL PERFORATION; NEONATAL-RESEARCH-NETWORK; OUTCOMES; COHORT	Background: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a major source of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Since there is no specific diagnostic test or risk of progression model available for NEC, the diagnosis and outcome prediction of NEC is made on clinical grounds. The objective in this study was to develop and validate new NEC scoring systems for automated staging and prognostic forecasting. Study design: A six-center consortium of university based pediatric teaching hospitals prospectively collected data on infants under suspicion of having NEC over a 7-year period. A database comprised of 520 infants was utilized to develop the NEC diagnostic and prognostic models by dividing the entire dataset into training and testing cohorts of demographically matched subjects. Developed on the training cohort and validated on the blind testing cohort, our multivariate analyses led to NEC scoring metrics integrating clinical data. Results: Machine learning using clinical and laboratory results at the time of clinical presentation led to two NEC models: (1) an automated diagnostic classification scheme; (2) a dynamic prognostic method for risk-stratifying patients into low, intermediate and high NEC scores to determine the risk for disease progression. We submit that dynamic risk stratification of infants with NEC will assist clinicians in determining the need for additional diagnostic testing and guide potential therapies in a dynamic manner.

In this article, we propose a dynamically growing contrast pattern tree (DGCP-tree) structure to store grown patterns and their path codes arrays with 1-bit counts, which are from the constructed bit string compression tree. A method of mining SJEPs based on DGCP-tree is developed. In order to reduce the pattern search space, we introduce a novel pattern pruning method, which dramatically reduces non-minimal jumping emerging patterns (JEPs) during the mining process. Experiments are performed on three real cancer datasets and three datasets from the University of California, Irvine machine-learning repository. Compared with the well-known CP-tree method, the results show that the proposed method is substantially faster, able to handle higher-dimensional datasets and to prune more non-minimal JEPs.

Incorrect decision-making in financial institutions is very likely to cause financial crises and distress. Bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring are two important problems facing financial decision support. As many related studies develop financial distress models by some machine learning techniques, more advanced machine learning techniques, such as classifier ensembles and hybrid classifiers, have not been fully assessed. The aim of this paper is to develop a novel hybrid financial distress model based on combining the clustering technique and classifier ensembles. In addition, single baseline classifiers, hybrid classifiers, and classifier ensembles are developed for comparisons. In particular, two clustering techniques, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) and k-means and three classification techniques, logistic regression, multilayer-perceptron (MLP) neural network, and decision trees, are used to develop these four different types of bankruptcy prediction models. As a result, 21 different models are compared in terms of average prediction accuracy and Type I & II errors. By using five related datasets, combining Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) with MLP classifier ensembles performs the best, which provides higher predication accuracy and lower Type I & II errors.

Based on the features of the tendon reflex response, a clinician may establish preliminary perspective regarding the global condition of the nervous system. Current techniques for quantifying the observations of the reflex response involve the application of ordinal scales, requiring the expertise of a highly skilled clinician. However, the reliability of the ordinal scale approach is debatable. Highly skilled clinicians have even disputed the presence of asymmetric reflex pairs. An alternative strategy was the implementation of an iPod wireless accelerometer application to quantify the reflex response acceleration waveform. An application enabled the recording of the acceleration waveform and later wireless transmission as an email attachment by connectivity to the Internet. A potential energy impact pendulum enabled the patellar tendon reflex to be evoked in a predetermined and targeted manner. Three feature categories of the reflex response acceleration waveform (global parameters, temporal organization, and spectral features) were incorporated into machine learning to distinguish a subject's hemiplegic and healthy reflex pair. Machine learning attained perfect classification of the hemiplegic and healthy reflex pair. The research findings implicate the promise of machine learning for providing increased diagnostic acuity regarding the acceleration waveform of the tendon reflex response.

J	Kim, M				Kim, Minyoung			Conditional ordinal random fields for structured ordinal-valued label prediction	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Conditional random fields; Structured label prediction; Ordinal regression; Probabilistic models	FACIAL EXPRESSION; REGRESSION	Predicting labels of structured data such as sequences or images is a very important problem in statistical machine learning and data mining. The conditional random field (CRF) is perhaps one of the most successful approaches for structured label prediction via conditional probabilistic modeling. In such models, it is traditionally assumed that each label is a random variable from a nominal category set (e.g., class categories) where all categories are symmetric and unrelated from one another. In this paper we consider a different situation of ordinal-valued labels where each label category bears a particular meaning of preference or order. This setup fits many interesting problems/datasets for which one is interested in predicting labels that represent certain degrees of intensity or relevance. We propose a fairly intuitive and principled CRF-like model that can effectively deal with the ordinal-scale labels within an underlying correlation structure. Unlike standard log-linear CRFs, learning the proposed model incurs non-convex optimization. However, the new model can be learned accurately using efficient gradient search. We demonstrate the improved prediction performance achieved by the proposed model on several intriguing sequence/image label prediction tasks.

We evaluate these strategies in the context of stochastic network design by analyzing the behavior and performance of a new progressive hedging-based meta-heuristic for stochastic network design that solves subproblems comprising multiple scenarios. We compare the proposed strategies not only among themselves, but also against the strategy of grouping scenarios randomly and the lower bound provided by a state-of-the-art MIP solver. The results show that, by solving multi-scenario subproblems generated by the strategies we propose, the meta-heuristic produces better results in terms of solution quality and computing efficiency than when either single-scenario subproblems or multiple-scenario subproblems that are generated by picking scenarios at random are solved. The results also show that, considering all the strategies tested, the covering strategy with respect to commodity demands leads to the highest quality solutions and the quickest convergence.

J	Du, JF; Xu, H; Huang, XQ				Du, Jingfei; Xu, Hua; Huang, Xiaoqiu			Box office prediction based on microblog	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Box office; Microblog; Social media; Prediction model		As the importance and popularity of online social media has become more obvious, there are more researches aiming at making use of information from them. One important topic of this is predicting the future with social media. This paper focuses on predicting box offices using microblog. Compared with previous work which makes use of the count of related microblogs simply, the information from social media has been utilized more deeply in this paper. Two sets of features have been extracted: count based features and content based features. For the former, the information in the aspect of users, which decrease the influence of garbage microblogs, has been exploited. For content based features, a new box office oriented semantic classification method has been provided to make the features more relative with box offices. Meanwhile, more complex machine learning models such as SVM and neutral network have been applied to the prediction method. Our prediction model is more accurate and reliable. With our prediction method, the data in Tencent microblog has been utilized to predict box offices of certain movies in China. With the results, the strength of our method and predictive power of online social media can be completely demonstrated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

On the other hand, graph-based data mining techniques are increasingly applied to handle large datasets due to their capability of modeling various non-traditional domains representing real-life complex scenarios such as social/computer networks, map/spatial databases, chemical-informatics domain, bio-informatics, image processing and machine learning. To extract useful knowledge from large amount of spurious patterns, correlation measures are used. Nonetheless, existing graph based correlation mining approaches are unable to capture effective correlations in graph databases. Hence, we have concentrated on graph correlation mining and proposed a new graph correlation measure, gConfidence, to discover more useful graph patterns. Moreover, we have developed an efficient algorithm, CGM (Correlated Graph Mining), to find the correlated graphs in graph databases. The performance of our scheme was extensively analyzed in several real-life and synthetic databases based on runtime and memory consumption, then compared with existing graph correlation mining algorithms, which proved that CGM is scalable with respect to required processing time and memory consumption and outperforms existing approaches by a factor of two in speed of mining correlations.

A.; Strachan, Rebecca			Hybrid decision tree and naive Bayes classifiers for multi-class classification tasks	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Classification; Hybrid; Decision tree; Naive Bayes classifier	DATA MINING TECHNIQUES; PERFORMANCE; SELECTION	In this paper, we introduce two independent hybrid mining algorithms to improve the classification accuracy rates of decision tree (DT) and nave Bayes (NB) classifiers for the classification of multi-class problems. Both DT and NB classifiers are useful, efficient and commonly used for solving classification problems in data mining. Since the presence of noisy contradictory instances in the training set may cause the generated decision tree suffers from overfitting and its accuracy may decrease, in our first proposed hybrid DT algorithm, we employ a nave Bayes (NB) classifier to remove the noisy troublesome instances from the training set before the DT induction. Moreover, it is extremely computationally expensive for a NB classifier to compute class conditional independence for a dataset with high dimensional attributes. Thus, in the second proposed hybrid NB classifier, we employ a DT induction to select a comparatively more important subset of attributes for the production of nave assumption of class conditional independence. We tested the performances of the two proposed hybrid algorithms against those of the existing DT and NB classifiers respectively using the classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity-specificity analysis, and 10-fold cross validation on 10 real benchmark datasets from UCI (University of California, Irvine) machine learning repository. The experimental results indicate that the proposed methods have produced impressive results in the classification of real life challenging multi-class problems. They are also able to automatically extract the most valuable training datasets and identify the most effective attributes for the description of instances from noisy complex training databases with large dimensions of attributes.

The top ranks are important, especially if user feedback is used to train the system. Analysis of hit lists revealed counter-intuitive instances in the top ranks for good classifiers. In this study, we propose that two functions need to be optimised: (a) in order to reduce a massive set of instances to a likely subset among ten thousand or more classes, separability is required. However, the results need to be intuitive after ranking, reflecting (b) the prototypicality of instances. By optimising these requirements sequentially, the number of distracting images is strongly reduced, followed by nearest-centroid based instance ranking that retains an intuitive (low-edit distance) ranking. We show that in handwritten word-image retrieval, precision improvements of up to 35 percentage points can be achieved, yielding up to 100% top hit precision and 99% top-7 precision in data sets with 84 000 instances, while maintaining high recall performances. The method is conveniently implemented in a massive scale, continuously trainable retrieval engine, Monk. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

They have advantage over the standard linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in large sample size problems, since both of them divide the samples in each class into subclasses which keep locality but LDA does not. However, since the current MDA and SDA algorithms perform subclass division in just one step in the original data space before solving the generalized eigenvalue problem, two problems are exposed: (1) they ignore the relation among classes since subclass division is performed in each isolated class; (2) they cannot guarantee good performance of classifiers in the transformed space, because locality in the original data space may not be kept in the transformed space. To address these problems, this paper presents a new approach for subclass division based on k-means clustering in the projected space, class by class using the iterative steps under EM-alike framework. Experiments are performed on the artificial data set, the UCI machine learning data sets, the CENPARMI handwritten numeral database, the NUST603 handwritten Chinese character database, and the terrain cover database. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Chiang, WC; Lin, HH; Huang, CS; Lo, LJ; Wan, SY				Chiang, Wen-Chung; Lin, Hsiu-Hsia; Huang, Chiung-Shing; Lo, Lun-Jou; Wan, Shu-Yen			The cluster assessment of facial attractiveness using fuzzy neural network classifier based on 3D Moire features	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Facial attractiveness; Feature; Machine learning; Fuzzy neural network; Classification; Moire	NEOCLASSICAL CANONS; BEAUTY; FACES; PROPORTIONS; JUDGMENTS; ASYMMETRY; SYMMETRY; MACHINE; AVERAGE; SLEEP	Facial attractiveness has long been argued upon varied emphases by philosophers, artists, psychologists and biologists. A number of studies empirically investigated how facial attractiveness was influenced by 2D facial characteristics, such as symmetry, averageness and golden ratio. However, few implementations of facial beauty assessment were based on 3D facial features. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel cluster assessment system for facial attractiveness that is characterized by the incorporation of 3D geometric Moire features with an adjusted fuzzy neural network (FNN). We first extract 3D facial features from images acquired by a 3dMD scanner. Seven Moire features are employed to represent a 3D facial image. The FNN classifier, taking the Moire features as the parameters, is then trained and validated against independently conducted attractiveness ratings. A number of diverse referees were invited and offered their attractiveness ratings over a five-item Likert scale for 100 female facial images. The proposed assessment presents a high accuracy rate of 90%, and the area under curve (AUC) computed from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is 0.95. The results show that the perceptions of facial attractiveness are essentially consensus among raters, and can be mathematically modeled through supervised learning techniques. The high accuracy achieved proves that the proposed FNN classifier can serve as a general, automated and human-like judgment tool for objective classification of female facial attractiveness, and thus has potential applications to the entertainment industry, cosmetic industry, virtual media, and plastic surgery.

Methods based on existing work are reliant on extracting information from video sequences and employ either some form of subjective thresholding of dynamic information or attempt to identify the particular individual frames in which the expected behaviour occurs. These methods are inefficient as they require either additional subjective information, tedious manual work or fail to take advantage of the information contained in the dynamic signature from facial movements for the task of expression recognition. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed for automatic facial expression analysis which extracts salient information from video sequences but does not rely on any subjective preprocessing or additional user-supplied information to select frames with peak expressions. The experimental framework demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms static expression recognition systems in terms of recognition rate. The approach does not rely on action units (AUs), and therefore, eliminates errors which are otherwise propagated to the final result due to incorrect initial identification of AUs. The proposed framework explores a parametric space of over 300 dimensions and is tested with six state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Such robust and extensive experimentation provides an important foundation for the assessment of the performance for future work. A further contribution of the paper is offered in the form of a user study. This was conducted in order to investigate the correlation between human cognitive systems and the proposed framework for the understanding of human emotion classification and the reliability of public databases.

However, due to the complexity of real-world image systems, effective and efficient image annotation is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we present an annotation technique based on the use of image content and word correlations. Clusters of images with manually tagged words are used as training instances. Images within each cluster are modeled using a kernel method, in which the image vectors are mapped to a higher-dimensional space and the vectors identified as support vectors are used to describe the cluster. To measure the extent of the association between an image and a model described by support vectors, the distance from the image to the model is computed. A closer distance indicates a stronger association. Moreover, word-to-word correlations are also considered in the annotation framework. To tag an image, the system predicts the annotation words by using the distances from the image to the models and the word-to-word correlations in a unified probabilistic framework. Simulated experiments were conducted on three benchmark image data sets. The results demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique, and compare it to the performance of other recently reported techniques. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, LDA only captures global geometrical structure information of the data and ignores the geometrical structure information of local data points. Though many articles have been published to address this issue, most of them are incomplete in the sense that only part of the local information is used. We show here that there are total three kinds of local information, namely, local similarity information, local intra-class pattern variation, and local interclass pattern variation. We first propose a new method called enhanced within-class LDA (EWLDA) algorithm to incorporate the local similarity information, and then propose a complete framework called complete global-local LDA (CGLDA) algorithm to incorporate all these three kinds of local information. Experimental results on two image databases demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Detecting changes in time series: A product partition model with across-cluster correlation	SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Cluster estimation; Random partition; RJMCMC method; Time series	CHANGE-POINT PROBLEMS; MULTIPLE CHANGE-POINTS; BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS; DEPENDENCE; SEGMENTS; MCMC	The identification of multiple clusters and/or change points is a problem encountered in many subject areas, ranging from machine learning, pattern recognition, genetics, criminality and disease mapping to finance and industrial control. We present a product partition model that, for the first time, includes dependence between clusters or segments. The across-cluster dependence is introduced into the model through the prior distributions of the parameters. We adopt a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to sample from the posterior distributions. We compare the partition model with across-cluster correlation to two other models previously introduced in the literature, which includes the original product partition model (PPM). These models assume independence among the clusters. We illustrate the use of the proposed model with three case studies and we perform a Monte Carlo study. We show that the inclusion of correlation between clusters is a competitive model for change-point identification. By accounting for this correlation, we achieve substantial improvements in the parameter estimates. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For the purpose of linear static modeling, the matrix is unstructured and the corresponding modeling problem is an approximation of the matrix by another matrix of a lower rank. In the context of linear time-invariant dynamic models, the appropriate data matrix is Hankel and the corresponding modeling problems becomes structured low-rank approximation. Low-rank approximation has applications in: system identification; signal processing, machine learning, and computer algebra, where different types of structure and constraints occur. This paper gives an overview of recent progress in efficient local optimization algorithms for solving weighted mosaic-Hankel structured low-rank approximation problems. In addition, the data matrix may have missing elements and elements may be specified as exact. The described algorithms are implemented in a publicly available software package. Their application to system identification, approximate common divisor, and data-driven simulation problems is described in this paper and is illustrated by reproducible simulation examples. As a data modeling paradigm the low-rank approximation setting is closely related to the behavioral approach in systems and control, total least squares, errors-in-variables modeling, principal component analysis, and rank minimization.

Ensemble methods for advanced skier days prediction	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Ensemble learning; Data mining; Forecasting; Skier days	NEURAL-NETWORK; TIME-SERIES; STACKED GENERALIZATION; TOURISM; WEATHER	The tourism industry has long utilized statistical and time series analysis, as well as machine learning techniques to forecast leisure activity demand. However, there has been limited research and application of ensemble methods with respect to leisure demand prediction. The research presented in this paper appears to be the first to compare the predictive power of ensemble models developed from multiple linear regression (MLR), classification and regression trees (CART) and artificial neural networks (ANN), utilizing local, regional, and national data to model skier days. This research also concentrates on skier days prediction at a micro as opposed to a macro level where most of the tourism applications of machine learning techniques have occurred. While the ANN model accuracy improvements over the MLR and CART models were expected, the significant accuracy improvements attained by the ensemble models are notable. This research extends and generalizes previous ensemble methods research by developing new models for skier days prediction using data from a ski resort in the state of Utah, United States.

In this context, we present a method of software component reuse as a model (or methodology), which facilitates the semi-automatic reuse of web services on a cloud computing environment, leading to business process composition. The proposal is based on web service technology, including: (i) Automatic discovery of web services; (ii) Semantics description of web services; (iii) Automatic composition of existing web services to generate new ones; (iv) Automatic invocation of web services. As a result of this proposal, we have presented its implementation (as a tool) on a real case study. The evaluation of the case study and its results are proof of the reliability of IPCASCI.

Breast cancer diagnosis based on feature extraction using a hybrid of K-means and support vector machine algorithms	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; K-means; Support vector machine; Cancer diagnosis	FEATURE-SELECTION	With the development of clinical technologies, different tumor features have been collected for breast cancer diagnosis. Filtering all the pertinent feature information to support the clinical disease diagnosis is a challenging and time consuming task. The objective of this research is to diagnose breast cancer based on the extracted tumor features. Feature extraction and selection are critical to the quality of classifiers founded through data mining methods. To extract useful information and diagnose the tumor, a hybrid of K-means and support vector machine (K-SVM) algorithms is developed. The K-means algorithm is utilized to recognize the hidden patterns of the benign and malignant tumors separately. The membership of each tumor to these patterns is calculated and treated as a new feature in the training model. Then, a support vector machine (SVM) is used to obtain the new classifier to differentiate the incoming tumors. Based on 10-fold cross validation, the proposed methodology improves the accuracy to 97.38%, when tested on the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) data set from the University of California - Irvine machine learning repository. Six abstract tumor features are extracted from the 32 original features for the training phase. The results not only illustrate the capability of the proposed approach on breast cancer diagnosis, but also shows time savings during the training phase. Physicians can also benefit from the mined abstract tumor features by better understanding the properties of different types of tumors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Automatic text classification to support systematic reviews in medicine	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Review						Medical systematic reviews; Machine learning; Text mining; Text classification	CATEGORIZATION; RETRIEVAL; MACHINES	Medical systematic reviews answer particular questions within a very specific domain of expertise by selecting and analysing the current pertinent literature. As part of this process, the phase of screening articles usually requires a long time and significant effort as it involves a group of domain experts evaluating thousands of articles in order to find the relevant instances. Our goal is to support this process through automatic tools. There is a recent trend of applying text classification methods to semi-automate the screening phase by providing decision support to the group of experts, hence helping reduce the required time and effort. In this work, we contribute to this line of work by performing a comprehensive set of text classification experiments on a corpus resulting from an actual systematic review in the area of Internet-Based Randomised Controlled Trials. These experiments involved applying multiple machine learning algorithms combined with several feature selection techniques to different parts of the articles (i.e., titles, abstract, or both). Results are generally positive in terms of overall precision and recall measurements, reaching values of up to 84%. It is also revealing in terms of how using only article titles provides virtually as good results as when adding article abstracts. Based on the positive results, it is clear that text classification can support the screening stage of medical systematic reviews.

For instance, in medical imaging, radiologists often delineate malignant and benign tissues without access to the histological ground truth, leading to uncertain data sets. This paper addresses the pattern classification problem arising when available target data include some uncertainty information. Target data considered here are both qualitative (a class label) or quantitative (an estimation of the posterior probability). In this context, usual discriminative methods, such as the support vector machine (SVM), fail either to learn a robust classifier or to predict accurate probability estimates. We generalize the regular SVM by introducing a new formulation of the learning problem to take into account class labels as well as class probability estimates. This original reformulation into a probabilistic SVM (P-SVM) can be efficiently solved by adapting existing flexible SVM solvers. Furthermore, this framework allows deriving a unique learned prediction function for both decision and posterior probability estimation providing qualitative and quantitative predictions. The method is first tested on synthetic data sets to evaluate its properties as compared with the classical SVM and fuzzy-SVM. It is then evaluated on a clinical data set of multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance images to assess its performances in discriminating benign from malignant tissues. P-SVM is shown to outperform classical SVM as well as the fuzzy-SVM in terms of probability predictions and classification performances, and demonstrates its potential for the design of an efficient computer-aided decision system for prostate cancer diagnosis based on multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.

The theoretically calculated molecular descriptors were used for modeling and best set of descriptors selected by correlation based feature selection (CFS) method. The performance and predictive capability of linear method was investigated and compared with nonlinear method. The ANN gave better model with an average fold error of 1.66.

These components offer specific functionalities such as image recognition, time series analysis, and forecasting but may not satisfy the non-functional constraints of the software products. It is difficult to identify suitable learning algorithms for a particular task and software product because the non-functional requirements of the product affect algorithm suitability. A particular suitability evaluation may thus require the assessment of multiple criteria to analyse trade-offs between functional and non-functional requirements. For this purpose, we present a method for APPlication-Oriented Validation and Evaluation (APPrOVE). This method comprises four sequential steps that address the stated evaluation problem. The method provides a common ground for different stakeholders and enables a multi-expert and multi-criteria evaluation of machine learning algorithms prior to inclusion in software products. Essentially, the problem addressed in this article concerns how to choose the appropriate machine learning component for a particular software product.

Recent work in both fields shares a common goal, that of automating as much of the algorithm design process as possible. In this paper we first provide a historical perspective on automated algorithm design, and then we discuss similarities and differences between meta-learning in the field of supervised machine learning (classification) and hyper-heuristics in the field of optimisation. This discussion focuses on the dimensions of the problem space, the algorithm space and the performance measure, as well as clarifying important issues related to different levels of automation and generality in both fields. We also discuss important research directions, challenges and foundational issues in meta-learning and hyper-heuristic research. It is important to emphasize that this paper is not a survey, as several surveys on the areas of meta-learning and hyper-heuristics (separately) have been previously published. The main contribution of the paper is to contrast meta-learning and hyper-heuristics methods and concepts, in order to promote awareness and cross-fertilisation of ideas across the (by and large, non-overlapping) different communities of meta-learning and hyper-heuristic researchers. We hope that this cross-fertilisation of ideas can inspire interesting new research in both fields and in the new emerging research area which consists of integrating those fields.

Sparse Label-Indicator Optimization Methods for Image Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						Graph; multi-class; image classification; sparsity; random walk with restart; semi-supervised learning	ANNOTATION	Image label prediction is a critical issue in computer vision and machine learning. In this paper, we propose and develop sparse label-indicator optimization methods for image classification problems. Sparsity is introduced in the label-indicator such that relevant and irrelevant images with respect to a given class can be distinguished. Also, when we deal with multi-class image classification problems, the number of possible classes of a given image can also be constrained to be small in which it is valid for natural images. The resulting sparsity model can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, and it can be solved very efficiently. Experimental results are reported to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, and demonstrate that the classification performance of the proposed method is better than the other testing methods in this paper.

These methods form a field, known as fuzzy nearest neighbor classification, which is the source of many proposals for the enhancement of the k nearest neighbor classifier. Fuzzy sets theory and several extensions, including fuzzy rough sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets, type-2 fuzzy sets and possibilistic theory are the foundations of these hybrid techniques, designed to tackle some of the drawbacks of the nearest neighbor rule. In this paper the most relevant approaches to fuzzy nearest neighbor classification are reviewed, as are applications and theoretical works. Several descriptive properties are defined to build a full taxonomy, which should be useful as a future reference for new developments. An experimental framework, including implementations of the methods, datasets, and a suggestion of a statistical methodology for results assessment is provided. A case of study is included, featuring a comparison of the best techniques with several state of the art crisp nearest neighbor classifiers. The work concludes with the suggestion of some open challenges and ways to improve fuzzy nearest neighbor classification as a machine learning technique. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This is achieved by using image descriptors that interpret these variations as shifts in the feature vector. We model these variations as a covariate shift in the data. This shift is then reduced by minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true and estimated distributions using importance weights (IW). These IWs are used in support vector machines (SVMs) to formulate the IW-SVMs. The experimental results show that IW-SVMs exhibit good invariance characteristics and outperform other state-of-the-art classification methods. The proposed methodology gives a generic solution that can be applied to any texture descriptor that models the transformations as a shift in the feature vector.

J	Guo, ZC; Ying, YM				Guo, Zheng-Chu; Ying, Yiming			Guaranteed Classification via Regularized Similarity Learning	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Letter							MARGIN CLASSIFIERS; RANKING; KERNELS	Learning an appropriate (dis)similarity function from the available data is a central problem in machine learning, since the success of many machine learning algorithms critically depends on the choice of a similarity function to compare examples. Despite many approaches to similarity metric learning that have been proposed, there has been little theoretical study on the links between similarity metric learning and the classification performance of the resulting classifier. In this letter, we propose a regularized similarity learning formulation associated with general matrix norms and establish their generalization bounds. We show that the generalization error of the resulting linear classifier can be bounded by the derived generalization bound of similarity learning. This shows that a good generalization of the learned similarity function guarantees a good classification of the resulting linear classifier. Our results extend and improve those obtained by Bellet, Habrard, and Sebban (2012). Due to the techniques dependent on the notion of uniform stability (Bousquet & Elisseeff, 2002), the bound obtained there holds true only for the Frobenius matrix-norm regularization. Our techniques using the Rademacher complexity (Bartlett & Mendelson, 2002) and its related Khinchin-type inequality enable us to establish bounds for regularized similarity learning formulations associated with general matrix norms, including sparse L-1-norm and mixed (2,1)-norm.

In this manuscript, we propose a distance order preserving manifold learning algorithm that extends the basic mean-squared error cost function used mainly in multidimensional scaling (MDS)-based methods. We develop a constrained optimization problem by assuming explicit constraints on the order of distances in the low-dimensional space. In this optimization problem, as a generalization of MDS, instead of forcing a linear relationship between the distances in the high-dimensional original and low-dimensional projection space, we learn a non-decreasing relation approximated by radial basis functions.

However, the probability distributions of system variables and the conditional probability relationships between components or subsystems may be unknown or incomplete. Useful information for such systems may be available from multiple sources and in varying formats such as operational and laboratory data, mathematical models, reliability data, or expert opinion. Conventional modeling techniques do not generally include all such information. This paper presents a methodology for constructing a system model for use in diagnosis and prognosis in the presence of such heterogeneous information. An attractive modeling paradigm for this methodology is the dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). A systematic approach is developed to incorporate various types of data in the DBN and to learn the probability distributions of the system variables as well as the conditional probability relationships between them. The structure and distribution parameters of the DBN are obtained via established learning methods. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for a hydraulic actuator system.

Bayesian models for screening and TB Mobile for target inference with Mycobacterium tuberculosis	TUBERCULOSIS			English	Article						Bayesian models; Collaborative drug discovery tuberculosis database; Function class fingerprints; Virtual screening; Mycobacterium tuberculosis	DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; IN-SILICO PHARMACOLOGY; DISCOVERY; CHEMINFORMATICS; IDENTIFICATION; METABOLISM; ABSORPTION; CHALLENGES; PREDICTION; INHIBITORS	The search for compounds active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis is reliant upon high-throughput screening (HTS) in whole cells. We have used Bayesian machine learning models which can predict antitubercular activity to filter an internal library of over 150,000 compounds prior to in vitro testing. We used this to select and test 48 compounds in vitro; 11 were active with MIC values ranging from 0.4 mu M to 10.2 mu M, giving a high hit rate of 22.9%. Among the hits, we identified several compounds belonging to the same series including five quinolones (including ciprofloxacin), three molecules with long aliphatic linkers and three singletons. This approach represents a rapid method to prioritize compounds for testing that can be used alongside medicinal chemistry insight and other filters to identify active molecules. Such models can significantly increase the hit rate of HTS, above the usual 1% or lower rates seen. In addition, the potential targets for the 11 molecules were predicted using TB Mobile and clustering alongside a set of over 740 molecules with known M. tuberculosis target annotations. These predictions may serve as a mechanism for prioritizing compounds for further optimization. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Game playing	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-COGNITIVE SCIENCE			English	Article							CARLO TREE-SEARCH; COMPUTER GO; WORLD-CHAMPION; TD-GAMMON; PROGRAM	Game playing has been a core domain of artificial intelligence research since the beginnings of the field. Game playing provides clearly defined arenas within which computational approaches can be readily compared to human expertise through head-to-head competition and other benchmarks. Game playing research has identified several simple core algorithms that provide successful foundations, with development focused on the challenges of defeating human experts in specific games. Key developments include minimax search in chess, machine learning from self-play in backgammon, and Monte Carlo tree search in Go. These approaches have generalized successfully to additional games. While computers have surpassed human expertise in a wide variety of games, open challenges remain and research focuses on identifying and developing new successful algorithmic foundations.

ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY			English	Article						CT angiography; image postprocessing; computer aided diagnosis; free-floating thrombus; stroke	MULTIDETECTOR COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; TEXTURE ANALYSIS; SURFACE-MORPHOLOGY; ULTRASONIC IMAGES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MR-IMAGES; ENDARTERECTOMY; ANGIOGRAPHY; PREDICT; SEGMENTATION	Rationale and Objectives: Patients presenting with transient ischemic attack or stroke may have symptom-related lesions on acute computed tomography angiography (CTA) such as free-floating intraluminal thrombus (FFT). It is difficult to distinguish FFT from carotid plaque, but the distinction is critical as management differs. By contouring the shape of these vascular lesions ("virtual endarterectomy"), advanced morphometric analysis can be performed. The objective of our study is to determine whether quantitative shape analysis can accurately differentiate FFT from atherosclerotic plaque. Materials and Methods: We collected 23 consecutive cases of suspected carotid FFT seen on CTA (13 men, 65 +/- 10 years; 10 women, 65.5 +/- 8.8 years). True-positive FFT cases (FFT+) were defined as filling defects resolving with anticoagulant therapy versus false-positives (FFT-), which remained unchanged. Lesion volumes were extracted from CIA images and quantitative shape descriptors were computed. The five most discriminative features were used to construct receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and to generate three machine-learning classifiers. Average classification accuracy was determined by cross-validation. Results: Follow-up imaging confirmed sixteen FFT+ and seven FFT- cases. Five shape descriptors delineated FFT+ from FFT- cases. The logistic regression model produced from combining all five shape features demonstrated a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 71.4% with an area under the ROC curve = 0.85 +/- 0.09. Average accuracy for each-classifier ranged from 65.2%-76.4%. Conclusions: We identified five quantitative shape descriptors of carotid FFT. This shape "signature" shows potential for supplementing conventional lesion characterization in-cases of suspected FFT.

Interactive classification using data envelopment analysis	ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article						Data envelopment analysis; Interactive classification; Linear programming; Data mining	2-GROUP CLASSIFICATION; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; POTENTIAL USE; MODELS; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM; PRINCIPLE; DEA	In this paper, we illustrate how data envelopment analysis (DEA) can be used to aid interactive classification. We assume that the scoring function for the classification problem is known. We use DEA to identify difficult to classify cases from a database and present them to the decision-maker one at a time. The decision-maker assigns a class to the presented case and based on the decision-maker class assignment, a tradeoff cutting plane is drawn using the scoring function and decision-maker's input. The procedure continues for finite number of iterations and terminates with the final discriminant function. We also show how a hybrid DEA and mathematical programming approach can be used when user interaction is not desired. For non-interactive case, we compare a hybrid DEA and mathematical programming based approach with several statistical and machine learning approaches, and show that the hybrid approach provides competitive performance when compared to the other machine learning approaches.

J	Sakar, CO; Kursun, O; Gurgen, F				Sakar, C. Okan; Kursun, Olcay; Gurgen, Fikret			Ensemble canonical correlation analysis	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for feature extraction; CCA with resampling; Bagging weak covariates; Ensemble learning; Ensemble dimensionality reduction	PREDICTORS; SETS	Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) aims at identifying linear dependencies between two different but related multivariate views of the same underlying semantics. Ignoring its various extensions to more than two views, CCA uses these two views as complex labels to guide the search of maximally correlated projection vectors (covariates). Therefore, CCA can overfit the training data, meaning that different correlated projections can be found when the two-view training dataset is resampled. Although, to avoid such overfitting, ensemble approaches that utilize resampling techniques have been effectively used for improving generalization of many machine learning methods, an ensemble approach has not yet been formulated for CCA. In this paper, we propose an ensemble method for obtaining a final set of covariates by combining multiple sets of covariates extracted from subsamples. In comparison to those obtained by the application of the classical CCA on the whole set of training data, combining covariates with weaker correlations extracted from a number of subsamples of the training data produces stronger correlations that generalize to unseen test examples. Experimental results on emotion recognition, digit recognition, content-based retrieval, and multiple view object recognition have shown that ensemble CCA has better generalization for both the test set correlations of the covariates and the test set accuracy of classification performed on these covariates.
