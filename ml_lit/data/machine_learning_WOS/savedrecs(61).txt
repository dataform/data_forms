In this paper, a mutual information-based constructive criterion under arbitrary information distributions of input features is presented for feature selection. This criterion can capture both the relevance to the output classes and the redundancy with respect to the already,-selected features without any parameters like 8 in MIFS or MIFS-U methods to be preset. Furthermore, a modified greedy feature selection algorithm called MICC is proposed, and experimental results demonstrate the good performance of MICC on both synthetic and benchmark data sets.

The goal of model selection is to select from a set of competing explanations the best one that capture the underlying regularities of given observations. The criterion of a good model is generalizability. We must make balance between the goodness of fit and the complexity of the model to obtain good generalization. Most of present methods are consistent in goodness of fit and differ in complexity. But they only focus on the free parameters of the model; hence they cannot describe the intrinsic complexity of the model and they are not invariant under re-parameterization of the model. This paper uses a new geometrical method to study the complexity of the model selection problem. We propose that the integral of the Gauss-Kronecker curvature of the statistical manifold is the natural measurement of the non-linearity of the manifold of the model. This approach provides a clear intuitive understanding of the intrinsic complexity of the model. We use an experiment to verify the criterion based on this method.

Markov logic network (MLN), one of SRL,methods, is a first-order knowledge base with a weight attached to each formula, and could be viewed as a template for ground Markov logic networks. In this paper, a posterior-based parameters learning approach for Markov logic net-works, maximum pseudo-posterior estimation is proposed Mean Gaussian distribution is used as prior of each weight, likelihood is replaced by pseudo-likelihood, and the pseudo-posterior distribution is maximized to learn the weights. Experiments show maximum pseudo-pogterior estimation could learn MLNs model effectively, which performs inference better compared to maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation.

A system built based on this method is able to achieve reasonable performance with minimal training data and gazetteers. The hybrid machine learning approach differs from previous machine learning-based systems in that it uses Maximum Entropy Model (MEM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) successively. We report on the performance of our proposed NER system using British National Corpus (BNC). In the recognition process, we first use MEM to identify the named entities in the corpus by imposing some temporary tagging as references. The MEM walkthrough can be regarded as a training process for HMM, as we then use HMM for the final tagging. We show that with enough training data and appropriate error correction mechanism, this approach can achieve higher precision and recall than using a single statistical model. We conclude with our experimental results that indicate the flexibility of our system in different domains.

Based on the intrinsic assembling feature of the multidimensional data, we present a method to select the training samples for machine learning. Firstly, we calculate each dimension's probability density estimating(PDE) to find the easily separable dimensions of the multidimensional data, then gain the smallest representative sample sets of all objects through intersecting the data of the same object of each easily separable dimensions, and get the object's number and the training data sources for the machine learning at the same time; secondly, train the neural network ensembles using the data selected from the representative sample sets to label the other data. Lastly, we analyzed the hyper-spectral images to detect red tide using this method, which proved this method could recognize the red tide effectively.

Experimental determination of the structure of a protein-DNA complex is an expensive process. Reliable computational methods that utilize the sequence of a DNA-binding protein to predict its DNA-binding interface are needed. Results: We present an application of three machine learning methods: support vector machine, kernel logistic regression, and penalized logistic regression to predict DNA-binding sites on a DNA-binding protein using its amino acid sequence as an input. Prediction is performed using either single sequence or a profile of evolutionary conservation. The performance of our predictors is better than that of other existing sequence-based methods. The outputs of all three individual methods are combined to obtain a consensus prediction. This further improves performance and results in accuracy of 82.4%, sensitivity of 84.9% and specificity of 83.1% for the strict consensus prediction. Availability: http://lcg.rit.albany.edu/dp-bind.

Those characteristic factors that react sensitive to product type designing chosen among the technical requirements of product designed and the different weight are given. All types of structure of product designed are determined by the case-based reasoning (CBR) method. The inference machine searches the case base, extracts all cases of each type of structure in order to set up standard model base according to each type of structure. Then after calculating the. degree of membership of product designed to each standard model. the model whose degree of membership is the maximum is the structure of product designed. This method can realize the mapping from technical parameter domain to product structure domain, accordingly accomplish the design of the type of structure. In the meantime, by case-based reasoning, the system can automatically establish the standard model base containing information of each type of product structures and thus obtain the machine learning ability.

The former is responsible for the system's behavior analysis, the latter controls the actual diagnosis process. Especially when pursuing qualitative simulation, it makes sense to realize the Simulation machinery with a logic calculus as well. Say, a qualitatively described hypothesis call directly be mapped onto an instance of the well-known SAT problem. Likewise. all entire diagnosis process. i. e., a sequence of hypothesis refinements, represents a set of SAT problems. This paper reports on the operationalization of such a SAT-based diagnosis approach. A specific characteristic here is the idea to exploit an ordering of the logical formulas according to their likeliness of being satisfiable. This idea is new in the context of qualitative reasoning, and it leads to a considerable speed up of the diagnosis process. Its applicability has been evaluated in the domain of hydraulic circuit diagnosis.

It is important to reduce retrieval time in CBR systems, in order to give better response time to the final user. In this paper, we present a novel approach to reduce the retrieval time in CBR systems. The approach that we show in this paper is a combination of cluster and decision tree techniques. This combination makes possible to build indexing structures in an automatic way. Our experimental results, based on two public domain datasets, show that employing our new approach improves retrieval time in CBR systems without losing significant accuracy degree in large case bases.

This approach is well proven in many small-scale domains. The true potential of this technique cannot be fully realised until it can adequately deal with the large domain sizes that typically describe real world problems. RL with function approximation is one method of dealing with the domain size problem. This paper investigates two different function approximation approaches to RL Fuzzy Sarsa and gradient descent Sarsa(lambda) with tile coding. It presents detailed experiments in two different simulation environments on the effectiveness of the two approaches. Initial experiments indicated that the tile coding approach had greater modelling capabilities in both testbed domains. However, experimentation in a coevolutionary scenario has indicated that Fuzzy Sarsa has greater flexibility.

Our method is able to obtain very useful policies observing just a few state action transitions. It considers the Reinforcement Learning problem as a regression task for which any appropriate technique may be applied. The use of kernel methods, e.g. the Support Vector Machine, enables the user to incorporate different types of structural prior knowledge about the state space by redefining the inner product. Furthermore KRR is a completely Off-policy method. The observations may be constructed by any sufficiently exploring policy, even the fully random one. We tested the algorithm on three typical Reinforcement Learning benchmarks. Moreover we give a proof for the correctness of our model and an error bound for estimating the Q-functions.

Neural Networks offer a solution at the expense of representation, among other things. Yet if we analyze the learning task in terms of the goal arity, we can approach problems of larger state spaces with Discretized Q-learning algorithm, by dramatically reducing memory requirements for the Q table. This paper demonstrates the methodology using the well-known LightsOut puzzle. While analytical methods of solving some variants of this puzzle are known, we proceed under a different premise of putting the learning agent in a much more difficult position of having virtually no initial information about the rules of the puzzle and often not being able to perceive the symmetries inherent in the two-dimensional puzzle grid. Without the described savings a standard and already thrifty Q-learning solution to a 5x5 variant of the puzzle would require over 3 gigabytes of RAM with 4 bytes per table entry, while our Discretized Q-learning solution required only 5 bits per table entry, allowing us to solve the puzzle on a 1 gigabyte machine. Finally, we also consider a variant of this puzzle for which no analytical solutions are known. The Discretized Q-learning algorithm is equally applicable to the new puzzle and can solve it with exactly the same effort.

We focus on how to present web image retrieval results to users. Most retrieval results contain multiple topics. To offset this complexity, many papers have discussed text retrieval result clustering [11][14]. In result clustering, we cluster the documents according to their topics by using the distance of text similarity. To group web image retrieval results, we have to consider the differences between image retrieval and text retrieval. First, most images on the Web do not have any textual information, so we have to automatically extract textual information if we are to index web images by semantic information. Second, text retrieval shows users text snippets as results which may not contain the information that user wants; however, thumbnail images are direct reduced-size versions of the originals, so the user can clearly figure out if the original image is desired or not. So, we think that how to present retrieval results is an important task in web image retrieval. In this paper, we describe how to semantically classify image retrieval results for making web image retrieval more effective. Text classification based on machine learning is used to generate basic semantic information, and image features and textual features are used for cluster presentation. We propose methods for presenting the results of image retrieval through the application of clustering. Experiments show that our procedure is effective.

As more Grids are deployed worldwide, the number of multi-institutional collaborations is rapidly growing. However, for Grid computing to realize its full potential. it is expected that Grid participants are able to use one another resources. Resource negotiation (i.e. exchange or trading of resources between Grids) enables Grid participants to face an unstable request environment. The aim of this position paper is to present a survey of the current state and challenges of resource negotiation research, with a Machine Learning perspective. We support the view that negotiation and learning are intrinsically linked. In particular, we show the expected benefits of integrating Machine Learning techniques with resource negotiation.

Existing feature selection methods including information gain and X chi(2)-test focus on those features that are useful for all topics, and consequently lack the power of selecting those features that are truly the representatives of a particular topic (or class). Also, these methods assume that the distribution of documents for each class is balanced. However, this assumption affects negatively to the classification accuracy because real-world document collections rarely have a balanced distribution, and also it is difficult to prepare a set of training documents with even number of documents for each class. To resolve this problem, we propose a new feature selection method for text classification that focuses on the purity of a word that emphasizes its representativeness for a particular class. Also our method assumes unbalanced distribution of documents over multiple classes, and combines feature values with the weight factors that,reflect the number of training documents in each class. In summary, we can obtain feature candidates using the word purity and then select the features with the unbalanced distribution of documents. Via some experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

Training and extraction of fuzzy finite state automata in recurrent neural networks	Proceedings of the Second IASTED International Conference on Computational Intelligence			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd IASTED International Conference on Computational Intelligence	NOV 20-22, 2006	San Francisco, CA	Int Assoc Sci & Technol Dev		recurrent neural network; knowledge extraction; fuzzy finite-state automata; Trakhtenbrot-Barzdin algorithm	SYSTEMS	We present a machine learning approach for the extraction of fuzzy finite-state automata (FFAs) from recurrent neural networks. After successful training on strings with fuzzy membership t c [0,I], we apply a generalisation of the Trakhtenbrot-Barzdin algorithm to extract FFAs in symbolic form from the trained network using the string labelling assigned by the trained network. Our results demonstrate that the approach successfully extracts the correct deterministic equivalent automata for strings much shorter than the longest string in the training set.

Unfortunately though its theoretical basis appears slightly shaky. Here under a weak assumption a shorter proof of a known result is given. This leads to the discovery of a gap in the proof of the mentioned algorithm. Also for the case of a simple feature map non-negligible CPU times are required as tests with a larger number of samples show. Hence and because of its practical significance an explicit dual of a slightly modified version, the Large Margin Pocket Algorithm, is given which provides superior run times for simple feature maps. In spite of there being no guarantee for optimal solutions it should be of practical relevance in view of preliminary test results.

The idea consists of finding appropriate representations of candidate compounds in terms of their chemical formulae and try to apply a particular machine learning method able to appropriately characterize certain desired properties or kinds of pharmacological activity. In this particular work antibacterial activity has been considered. Several classic pattern classification methods have already been applied to this problem with promising results. In this work, the support vector machine model is considered and compared to multilayer perceptrons in this particular context. The natural and unpredictable imbalance and the fact that only relatively small samples can be used for learning make this a challenging and interesting problem.

An approach to learning from structured data using a graph based propositionalization method, called finger printing, is introduced that addresses the limitations of current methods. The method is implemented in a system called DIFFER, which is demonstrated to compare favorable to existing state-of-art methods on some benchmark data sets. It is shown that further improvements can be obtained by combining the features generated by finger printing with features generated by previous methods.

Routing-the process of setting up a travel path for an AGV-is essential for utilizing AGVs efficiently. In this paper, we apply machine learning algorithms to routing in order to improve the efficiency of AGV operation. The proposed method uses a route evaluation model obtained by learning from the AGV travel data, evaluates candidate routes using the evaluation model, and finally selects the best route. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated by a simulation test. An analysis of the result showed that the routes selected bypassed the congestion areas and were short in length.

The described approach distinguishes itself by means of a special post-processing technique: On the so called Second Layer, multiple post-processing problems are solved with one single mechanism, namely dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNS). While the actual classification aspect - the First Layer - is merely summarized, this paper focuses on the description of the Second Layer. Particularly, examples are provided on how DBNS can be used for: explicitely modeling the classification inherent uncertainty, incorporating top down knowledge into the decision making process, and fusing the results of multiple classifiers. The paper finishes with a summary as well as an outlook to future extensions.

In this paper, a Covariance-preserving Projection Method (CPM for short) is proposed for dimension reduction. CPM maximizes the class discrimination and also preserves approximately the class covariance. The optimization involved in CPM can be formulated as low rank approximations of a collection of matrices, which can be solved iteratively. Our theoretical and empirical analysis reveals the relationship between CPM and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Sliced Average Variance Estimator (SAVE), and Heteroscedastic Discriminant Analysis (HDA). This gives us new insights into the nature of these different algorithms. We use both synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

One of the tasks in the analysis is the classification of orbits in Poincare plots generated by the particles in a fusion reactor as they move within the toroidal device. In this paper, we describe the use of graph-based methods to extract features from orbits. These features are then used to classify the orbits into several categories. Our results show that existing machine learning algorithms are successful in classifying orbits with few points, a situation which can arise in data from experiments.

The immune system has provided a rich source of inspiration for pattern recognition, machine learning and data mining analyses. One of the properties of the immune system which proves particularly useful for novelty detection is that of self/non-self discrimination and this forms the basis of the negative selection algorithm which has previously been applied by other researchers to the problem of time-series novelty detection. The object of the current paper is to apply the negative selection algorithm to more general feature sets and also to consider the case of novelty detection where the normal condition set is significantly non-Gaussian or varies with operational or environmental conditions.

The representation and quality of the instance data is first and foremost. If there is much irrelevant and redundant information present or noisy and unreliable data, then knowledge discovery during the training phase is more difficult. It is well known that data preparation and filtering steps take considerable amount of processing time in ML problems. Data pre-processing includes data cleaning, normalization, transformation, feature extraction and selection, etc. The product of data pre-processing is the final training set. It would be nice if a single sequence of data pre-processing algorithms had the best performance for each data set but this is not happened.

To this end, a number of experiments have been conducted using representative learning algorithms, which were trained using a data set of 164 fraud and non-fraud Greek firms in the recent period 2001-2002. The decision of which particular method to choose is a complicated problem. A good alternative to choosing only one method is to create a hybrid forecasting system incorporating a number of possible solution methods as components (an ensemble of classifiers). For this purpose, we have implemented a hybrid decision support system that combines the representative algorithms using a stacking variant methodology and achieves better performance than any examined simple and ensemble method. To sum up, this study indicates that the investigation of financial information can be used in the identification of FFS and underline the importance of financial ratios.

Learning Classifier Systems Approach for Automated Discovery of Censored Production Rules	PROCEEDINGS OF WORLD ACADEMY OF SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY, VOL 14	Proceedings of World Academy of Science Engineering and Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference of the World-Academy-of-Science-Engineering-and-Technology	AUG 25-27, 2006	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	World Acad Sci Engn & Technol		Censored Production Rule; Data Mining; Genetic Algorithm; Learning Classifier System; Machine Learning; Pittsburg Approach; Reinforcement learning		In the recent past Learning Classifier Systems have been successfully used for data mining. Learning Classifier System (LCS) is basically a machine learning technique which combines evolutionary computing, reinforcement learning, supervised or unsupervised learning and heuristics to produce adaptive systems. A LCS learns by interacting with an environment from which it receives feedback in the form of numerical reward. Learning is achieved by trying to maximize the amount of reward received. All LCSs models more or less, comprise four main components; a finite population of condition-action rules, called classifiers; the performance component, which governs the interaction with the environment; the credit assignment component, which distributes the reward received from the environment to the classifiers accountable for the rewards obtained; the discovery component, which is responsible for discovering better rules and improving existing ones through a genetic algorithm. The concatenate of the production rules in the LCS form the genotype, and therefore the GA should operate on a population of classifier systems. This approach is known as the 'Pittsburgh' Classifier Systems. Other LCS that perform their GA at the rule level within a population are known as 'Mitchigan' Classifier Systems. The most predominant representation of the discovered knowledge is the standard production rules (PRs) in the form of IF P THEN D. The PRs, however, are unable to handle exceptions and do not exhibit variable precision. The Censored Production Rules (CPRs), an extension of PRs, were proposed by Michalski and Winston that exhibit variable precision and supports an efficient mechanism for handling exceptions, A CPR is an augmented production rule of the form: IF P THEN D UNLESS C, where Censor C is an exception to the rule. Such rules are employed in situations, in which conditional statement IF P THEN D holds frequently and the assertion C holds rarely. By using a rule of this type we are free to ignore the exception conditions, when the resources needed to establish its presence are tight or there is simply no information available as to whether it holds or not. Thus, the IF P THEN D part of CPR expresses important information, while the UNLESS C part acts only as a switch and changes the polarity of D to similar to D. In this paper Pittsburgh style LCSs approach is used for automated discovery of CPRs. An appropriate encoding scheme is suggested to represent a chromosome consisting of fixed size set of CPRs. Suitable genetic operators are designed for the set of CPRs and individual CPRs and also appropriate fitness function is proposed that incorporates basic constraints on CPR. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed learning classifier system.

A novel approach to learning from structured data is introduced that employs a structure transformation method, called finger printing, for addressing these limitations. The method, which generates features corresponding to arbitrarily complex substructures, is implemented in a system, called DIFFER. The method is demonstrated to perform comparably to an existing state-of-art method on some benchmark data sets without requiring restrictions on the search space. Furthermore, learning from the union of features generated by finger printing and the previous method outperforms learning from each individual set of features on all benchmark data sets, demonstrating the benefit of developing complementary, rather than competing, methods for structure classification.

Machine learning techniques are therefore often used to obtain the desired sensor-motor competences. In this paper we present an alternative to established machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks, that is very fast, easy to implement. and has the distinct advantage that it generates transparent, analysable sensor-motor couplings: system identification through nonlinear polynomial mapping. This work, which is part of the RobotMODIC project at the universities of Essex and Sheffield, aims to develop a theoretical understanding of the interaction between the robot and its environment. One of the purposes of this research is to enable the principled design of robot control programs. As a first step towards this aim we model the behaviour of the robot. as this emerges from its interaction with the environment, with the NARMAX modelling method (Nonlinear, Auto-Regressive, Moving Average models with eXogenous inputs). This method produces explicit polynomial functions that can be subsequently analysed using established mathematical methods. In this paper we demonstrate the fidelity of the obtained NARMAX models in the challenging task of robot route learning; we present a set of experiments in which a Magellan Pro mobile robot was taught to follow four different routes, always using the same mechanism to obtain the required control law.

As an ancestor of data mining, machine learning has concerned itself with discovery of new knowledge on its own. This paper presents experiment results produced by genetic algorithms in the domains of model construction and event predictions, the areas where data mining systems have been focusing on. The experiment results. have shown that genetic algorithms are able to discover useful patterns and regularities in large sets of data, and to construct models that conceptualize input data.

In this paper, we extend the two-class Chernoff-based LDR method to deal with multiple classes. We introduce the criterion, as well as the algorithm that maximizes such a criterion. The proof of convergence of the algorithm and a formal procedure to initialize the parameters of the algorithm are also given. We present empirical simulations on standard well-known multi-class datasets drawn from the UCI machine learning repository. The results show that the proposed LDR coupled with a quadratic classifier outperforms the traditional LDR schemes.

In order to overcome the main drawbacks associated with this technique -mainly related to the large amount of visualization time required-, our efforts have been focused on the development of a machine learning system, built up in sequential stages, which provides the specialists with the useful part of the video, rejecting those parts not valid for analysis. We successfully used Self Organized Maps in a general semi-supervised framework with the aim of tackling the different learning stages of our system. The analysis of the diverse types of images and the automatic detection of intestinal contractions is performed under the perspective of intestinal motility assessment in a clinical environment.

We have developed a method to discriminate thermophilic and mesophilic proteins based on support vector machines. Using self-consistency validation, 5-fold cross-validation and independent testing procedure with other datasets, this module achieved overall accuracy of 94.2%, 90.5% and 92.4%, respectively. The performance of this SVM-based module was better than the classifiers built using alternative machine learning and statistical algorithms including artificial neural networks, Bayesian statistics, and decision trees, when evaluated using these three validation methods. The influence of protein size on prediction accuracy was also addressed.

J	Lin, HH; Han, LY; Cai, CZ; Ji, ZL; Chen, YZ				Lin, HH; Han, LY; Cai, CZ; Ji, ZL; Chen, YZ			Prediction of transporter family from protein sequence by support vector machine approach	PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						channel; transporter; support vector machine	DOMAIN K+ CHANNEL; SOLUTE TRANSPORTERS; CLASSIFICATION; DATABASE; TARGET; RECOGNITION; SIMILARITY; EVOLUTION; ACCURACY; SYSTEM	Transporters play key roles in cellular transport and metabolic processes, and in facilitating drug delivery and excretion. These proteins are classified into families based on the transporter classification (TC) system. Determination of the TC family of transporters facilitates the study of their cellular and pharmacological functions. Methods for predicting TC family without sequence alignments or clustering are particularly useful for studying novel transporters whose function cannot be determined by sequence similarity. This work explores the use of a machine learning method, support vector machines (SVMs), for predicting the family of transporters from their sequence without the use of sequence similarity. A total of 10,636 transporters in 13 TC subclasses, 1914 transporters in eight TC families, and 168,341 nontransporter proteins are used to train and test the SVM prediction system. Testing results by using a separate set of 4351 transporters and 83,151 nontransporter proteins show that the overall accuracy for predicting members of these TC subclasses and families is 83.4% and 88.0%, respectively, and that of nonmembers is 99.3% and 96.6%, respectively. The accuracies for predicting members and nonmembers of individual TC subclasses are in the range of 70.7-96.1% and 97.6-99.9%, respectively, and those of individual TC families are in the range of 60.6-97.1% and 91.5-99.4%, respectively. A further test by using 26,139 transmembrane proteins outside each of the 13 TC subclasses shows that 90.4-99.6% of these are correctly predicted. Our study suggests that the SVM is potentially useful for facilitating functional study of transporters irrespective of sequence similarity.

We illustrate our method on SELDI-TOF MS prostate cancer data (http:// home.ccr.cancer.gov/ncifdaproteomics/ppatterns.asp). Our method identified 11 proteomic biomarkers and gave significantly improved predictions over previous analyses with these data. We were able to distinguish cancer from non-cancer cases with a sensitivity of 90.31% and a specificity of 98.81%. The proposed method can be generalized to multi-phenotype prediction and other types of data (e.g., microarray data).

Mathematical Morphology: Star/galaxy differentiation & galaxy morphology classification	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF AUSTRALIA			English	Article						techniques : image processing; methods : data analysis; methods : miscellaneous	SUPERCOSMOS SKY SURVEY; NEURAL NETWORKS; PHOTOMETRY; SEPARATION; IMAGES; LIGHT; DISTRIBUTIONS; SIMULATIONS; CLUSTERS; CATALOG	We present an application of Mathematical Morphology (MM) for the classification of astronomical objects, both for star/galaxy differentiation and galaxy morphology classification. We demonstrate that, for CCD images, 99.3 +/- 3.8% of galaxies can be separated from stars using MM, with 19.4 +/- 7.9% of the stars being misclassified. We demonstrate that, for photographic plate images, the number of galaxies correctly separated from the stars can be increased using our MM diffraction spike tool, which allows 51.0 +/- 6.0% of the high-brightness galaxies that are inseparable in current techniques to be correctly classified, with only 1.4 +/- 0.5% of the high-brightness stars contaminating the population. We demonstrate that elliptical (E) and late-type spiral (Sc-Sd) galaxies can be classified using MM with an accuracy of 91.4 +/- 7.8%. It is a method involving fewer 'free parameters' than current techniques, especially automated machine learning algorithms. The limitation of MM galaxy morphology classification based on seeing and distance is also presented. We examine various star/galaxy differentiation and galaxy morphology classification techniques commonly used today, and show that our MM techniques compare very favourably.

Even search engines, based on the Information Retrieval approach, with their huge indexes show many drawbacks, which force users to sift through long lists of results or reformulate queries several times. Recently, an important research activity effort has been focusing on this vast amount of machine-accessible knowledge and on how it can be exploited in order to match the user needs. The personalization and adaptation of the human-computer interaction in information seeking by means of machine learning techniques and in AI-based representations of the information help users to address the overload problem. This chapter illustrates the most important approaches proposed to personalize the access to information, in terms of gathering resources related to given topics of interest and ranking them as a function of the current user needs and activities, as well as examples of prototypes and Web systems.

Allergy attack against automatic signature generation	RECENT ADVANCES IN INTRUSION DETECTION, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection	SEP 20-22, 2006	Hamburg, GERMANY	Tech Univ Hamburg Harburg		automatic signature generation; adaptive response; intrusion prevention		Research in systems that automatically generate signatures to filter out zero-day worm instances at perimeter defense has received a lot of attention recently. While a well known problem with these systems is that the signatures generated are usually not very useful against polymorphic worms, we shall in this paper investigate a different, and potentially more serious problem facing automatic signature generation systems: attacks that manipulate the signature generation system and turn it into an active agent for DoS attack against the protected system. We call this new attack the "allergy attack". This type of attack should be anticipated and has in fact been an issue in the context of "detraining" in machine learning.

In both cases, a stream of samples arrives, and a classifier must automatically determine whether each sample falls into a malicious target class (e.g., worm network traffic, or spam email). A learner typically generates a classifier automatically by analyzing two labeled training pools: one of innocuous samples, and one of samples that fall in the malicious target class. Learning techniques have previously found success in settings where the content of the labeled samples used in training is either random, or even constructed by a helpful teacher, who aims to speed learning of an accurate classifier. In the case of learning classifiers for worms and spam, however, an adversary controls the content of the labeled samples to a great extent. In this paper, we describe practical attacks against learning, in which an adversary constructs labeled samples that, when used to train a learner, prevent or severely delay generation of an accurate classifier. We show that even a delusive adversary, whose samples are all correctly labeled, can obstruct learning. We simulate and implement highly effective instances of these attacks against the Polygraph [15] automatic polymorphic worm signature generation algorithms.

Different machine learning techniques-classification trees, support vector machines and Bayesian networks-were used with a view to evaluating and comparing interpretability, prediction capacity, and facility for incorporating a priori information in the model. The three techniques contribute in complementary ways as a result of their different internal configurations and characters (discriminative or generative). The Bayesian networks produced the most satisfactory results for our slate problem, given that they combine both predictive and descriptive capacities.	[Matias, J.

The potentiall of such "theory-thin" approaches is illustrated with the application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to global prediction of nuclear properties as functions of proton and neutron numbers Z and N across the. nuclidic chart. Based on the principle of structural-risk minimization, SVMs learn from examples in the existing database of a given property Y, automatically and optimally identify a set of ",support vectors" corresponding to representative nuclei in the training set, and approximate the mapping (Z, N) -> Y in terms of these nuclei. Results are. reported for nuclear masses, beta-decay lifetimes, and spins/parities of nuclear ground states. These results indicate that SVM models can match or even surpass the predictive. performance of the best conventional "theory-thick" global models based on nuclear phenomenology.

The former approach was based on an SVM algorithm, while the latter comprised string-matching between a controlled vocabulary and words in the text to be classified. Data collection consisted of a subset from Compendex, classified into six different classes. It was shown that SVM on average outperforms the string-matching approach: our hypothesis that SVM yields better recall and string-matching better precision was confirmed only on one of the classes. The two approaches being complementary, we investigated different combinations of the two based on combining their vocabularies. The results have shown that the original approaches, i.e. machine-learning approach without using background knowledge from the controlled vocabulary, and string-matching approach based on controlled vocabulary, outperform approaches in which combinations of automatically and manually obtained terms were used. Reasons for these results need further investigation, including a larger data collection and combining the two using predictions.

As new data are obtained the concept description has to be updated regularly to include the new data. In this case we can face the problem that the concept changes over time. Hence the old data become irrelevant to the current concept and have to be removed from the training dataset. This problem is known in the area of machine learning as concept drift. We develop a mechanism that tracks changing concepts using an adaptive time window. The method uses a significance test to detect concept drift and then optimizes the size of the time window, aiming to maximise the classification accuracy on recent data. The method presented is general in nature and can be used with any learning algorithm. The method is tested with three standard learning algorithms (kNN, ID3 and NBC). Three datasets have been used in these experiments. The experimental results provide evidence that the suggested forgetting mechanism is able significantly to improve predictive accuracy on changing concepts.

We start by observing that a data set consisting of single residues as examples is affected by autocorrelation and we propose an ad-hoc remedy in which sequentially close pairs of candidate residues are classified as being jointly involved in the coordination of a zinc ion. We develop a kernel for this particular type of data that can handle variable length gaps between candidate coordinating residues. Our empirical evaluation on a data set of non redundant protein chains shows that explicit modeling the correlation between residues close in sequence allows us to gain a significant improvement in the prediction performance.

Although multiple researchers have used it successfully for machine learning experiments, doing so has required a good deal of domain expertise. This paper introduces a set of programs, tools, and resources designed to make the domain easily usable for experimentation without any prior knowledge of RoboCup or the Soccer Server. In addition, we report on new experiments in the Keepaway domain, along with performance results designed to be directly comparable with future experimental results. Combined, the new infrastructure and our concrete demonstration of its use in comparative experiments elevate the domain to a machine learning benchmark, suitable for use by researchers across the field.

A single rule is treated as a specific subsidiary, base classifier in the ensemble that indicates only one of the decision classes. Experimental results have shown that the ensemble of decision rules is as efficient as other machine learning methods. In this paper we concentrate on a common problem appearing in real-life data that is a presence of missing attributes values. To deal with this problem, we experimented with different approaches inspired by rough set approach to knowledge discovery. Results of those experiments are presented and discussed in the paper.

Its successful applications draw attentions from researchers in areas such as artificial intelligence, computational intelligence, data mining and machine learning. The classical rough set model is based on an equivalence relation on a set, but it is extended to generalized model based on binary relations and coverings. This paper reviews and summarizes the axiomatic systems for classical rough sets, generalized rough sets based on binary relations, and generalized rough sets based on coverings.

As these approaches are good at dealing with discrete values, a discretizer is required when the approaches are applied to continuous attributes. In this paper, a novel adaptive discretizer based on a statistical distribution index is proposed to preprocess continuous valued attributes in an instance information system, so that the knowledge discovery approaches based on rough sets can reach a high decision accuracy. The experimental results on benchmark data sets show that the proposed discretizer is able to improve the decision accuracy.

From the Rough Set theory point of view, in the process of inducing decision trees, some methods, such as information entropy based methods, emphasize the effect of class distribution. The more unbalanced the class distribution is, the more favorable it is. Whereas the Rough Set based approaches for inducing decision trees emphasize the effect of certainty. The more certain it is, the better it is. Two main concepts, i.e. variable precision explicit region, variable precision implicit region, and the process for inducing decision trees are introduced and discussed in the paper. The comparison between the presented approach and C4.5 on some data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is also reported.

This note mainly focuses on a theoretical analysis of learning machine with negatively associated dependent input sequence. The explicit bound on the rate of uniform convergence of the empirical errors to their expected error based on negatively associated dependent input sequence is obtained by the inequality of Joag-dev and Proschan. The uniform convergence approach is used to estimate the convergence rate of the sample error of learning machine that minimize empirical risk with negatively associated dependent input sequence. In the end, we compare these bounds with previous results.

For rough set based methods, finding reducts is an essential step, yet it is of high complexity. In this paper, based on particle swarm optimization (PS 0) which is an optimization algorithm inspired by social behavior of flocks of birds when they are searching for food, a novel method is proposed for finding useful features instead of reducts in rough set theory. Subsequent experiments on UCI show that this method performs well on whole convergence, and can retrieve useful subsets effectively while retaining attributes of high importance as possible.

In this paper, we propose a new strategy to use adaptive kernel parameters in the recursive feature elimination algorithm implemented with Gaussian kernel SVMs as a better alternatives to the aforementioned algorithm for pragmatic reasons. The proposed method performs well in selecting genes and achieves high classification accuracies with these genes on two cancer datasets.

Classification accuracy and, by implication, tree structure, are sensitive to changes in the training data. Successful approaches to counteract this effect include multiple classifiers, e.g. boosting, bogging or windowing. The downside o(c) these multiple classification models, however, is the plethora of trees that result, often making it difficult to extract the classifier in a meaningful manner. We show that, by using some very weak knowledge in the sampling stage, when the data set is partitioned into the training and test sets, a more consistent and improved performance is achieved by a single decision tree classifier. The reductions in error rate attained are comparable with those attained using boosting. In addition, we demonstrate that the combination of such sampling, combined with boosting, yields significant reductions in error rates.

Unfortunately, current anomaly based intrusion detection systems are also unable to detect all kinds of new attacks because they are designed to restricted applications on limited environment. Current hackers are using new attacks where neither access control systems nor current signature based systems can prevent the devastating results of these attacks against information systems. We enhance the notion of anomaly detection, introduce necessary conditions that should be taken into account by the building detection models and propose a new machine learning algorithm based on decision trees to discover known and unknown attacks in real time. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is highly successful in detecting new attacks and significantly outperforms previous work.

We study the statistics of the full-frame two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) coefficients of natural images and show that the independently and identically distributed model with unit exponential distribution is not a sufficiently accurate description of the statistics of normalized image periodograms. Consequently, the stochastic quantization index modulation (QIM) algorithm that aims at preserving this model is detectable in principle. To discriminate the resulted stegoimages from cover images, we train a learning system on them. Building upon a state-of-the-art steganalysis method using the statistical moments of wavelet characteristic functions, we propose new features that are more sensitive to data embedding. The addition of these features significantly improves the steganalyzer's receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

Users are able to submit any image from a local or an online source to the system and get classification results with confidence scores. Our system has implemented three different algorithms from the state of the art based on the geometry, the wavelet, and the cartoon features. We describe the important algorithmic issues involved for achieving satisfactory performances in both speed and accuracy as well as the capability to handle diverse types of input images. We studied the effects of image size reduction on classification accuracy and speed, and found different size reduction methods worked best for different classification methods. In addition, we incorporated machine learning techniques, such as fusion and subclass-based bagging, in order to counter the effect of performance degradation caused by image size reduction. With all these improvements, we are able to speed up the classification speed by more than two times while keeping the classification accuracy almost intact at about 82%.

Semantic annotation is a task of annotating web pages with ontological information. As information on a web page is usually two-dimensionally laid out, previous semantic annotation methods that view a web page as an 'object' sequence have limitations. In this paper, to better incorporate the two-dimensional contexts, semantic annotation is formalized as a problem of block detection and text annotation. Block detection is aimed at detecting the text block by making use of context in one dimension and text annotation is aimed at detecting the 'targeted instance' in the identified blocks using the other dimensional context. A two-stage method for semantic annotation using machine learning has been proposed. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can significantly outperform the baseline method as well as the sequence-based method for semantic annotation.

We define the measure for two-hop relations as a factor to influence activities, and check the correlation between them or with users' behavior by using blog data including visiting behavior. Attempting to determine the relations on which users read the blogs with interest as a helpful information for page recommendation, we conduct the experiments with a machine learning. As a result, even though the performance is not very high, we get the effective factors for prediction.

We propose to define this task as a three steps process, namely resource selection, query reformulation/ontology alignment and rank aggregation/data fusion. For the second problem, we have implemented oMAP, a formal framework for automatically aligning OWL ontologies. In oMAP, different components are combined for finding suitable mapping candidates (together with their weights), and the set of rules with maximum matching probability is selected. Among these components, traditional terminological-based classifiers, machine learning-based classifiers and a new classifier using the structure and the semantics of the OWL ontologies; are proposed. oMAP has been evaluated on international test sets.

To assure that the specified polices reflect the expected ones, recent research has developed policy verification tools; however, their applications in practice are still limited, being constrained by the limited set of supported policy language features and the unavailability of policy properties. This paper presents a data-mining approach to the problem of verifying that expressed access-control policies reflect the true desires of the policy author We developed a tool to investigate this approach by automatically generating requests, evaluating those requests to get responses, and applying machine learning on the request-response pairs to infer policy properties. These inferred properties facilitate the inspection of the policy behavior We applied our tool on an access-control policy of a central grades repository system for a university. Our results show that machine learning algorithms can provide valuable insight into basic policy properties and help identify specific bug-exposing requests.

Our algorithm is based on the re-measurement idea for the correction of erroneous observations and is able to discriminate between noisy and noiseless observations by using kernel methods. We apply our noise-aware algorithms to several domains including: astronomy, face recognition and ten machine learning benchmark datasets. Experimental results adding noise and useful anomalies to the data show that our algorithm improves data quality, without having to eliminate any observation from the original dataset.

This paper studies on the technology of text independent writer identification based on texture analysis. At first in the preprocessing stage the uniform texture images are created from the input document. An approach for improved characters segmentation is presented based on analysis for the character elements and their topological relations. Then the 32-channel Gabor filter is utilized to extract 64 texture features of writing image by calculating the mean values and the standard deviations of filtering output images. Finally, multi-class support vector machines (SVM) classifier is adopted to fulfill the identification task. The experiment result shows that the scheme is effective and promising.

XCS is a prominent LCS that uses genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning techniques. In traditional machine learning (ML), early stopping has been investigated extensively to the extent that it is now a default mechanism in many systems. However, there has been a belief that EC methods are more resilient to overfitting. Therefore, this topic is underinvestigated in the evolutionary computation literature and has not been investigated in LCS.

Current approaches often rely on an environment expert to correlate the situations that occur with the available sensor data, while other machine learning based approaches require long training periods before the system can be used. This paper presents a novel approach to situation determination that attempts to overcome these issues by providing a reusable library of general situation specifications that can be easily extended to create new specific situations, and immediately deployed without the need of an environment expert. The architecture of an accompanying situation determination infrastructure is provided, which autonomously optimises and repairs itself in reaction to changes or failures in the environment.

Although prediction models obtained using machine learning techniques has proven to be suitable for predictions, they do not explicitly provide means for determining input-output variable relevance. We investigated the issue of relevance assignment for multiple machine learning models applied to remote sensing variables in the context of terrestrial hydrology. The relevance is defined as the influence of an input variable with respect to predicting the output result. We introduce a methodology for assigning relevance using various machine learning methods. The learning methods we use include Regression Tree, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbor. We derive the relevance computation scheme for each learning method and propose a method for fusing relevance assignment results from multiple learning techniques by averaging and voting mechanism. All methods are evaluated in terms of relevance accuracy estimation with synthetic and measured data.

To tackle this problem, we have studied anomaly detection and fault diagnosis methods for spacecraft systems based on machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM) technology. In these methods, the knowledge or model which is necessary for monitoring a spacecraft system is (semi-)automatically acquired from the spacecraft telemetry data. In this paper we first overview the anomaly detection diagnosis problem in the spacecraft systems and conventional techniques such as limit-check, expert systems and model-based diagnosis. Then we explain the concept of ML/DM-based approach to this problem, and introduce several anomaly detection / diagnosis methods which have been developed by us.

The platform has built in capabilities of monitoring and recording user's actions. For a user, all executed actions on the platform represent his activity. The activity of all users makes up platform's activity. Based on platform's activity data, we introduce an attribute for our e-Learning platform called Quality of Service (QoS). Two parameters define the QoS: learning proficiency of students and classification capability of the platform. Machine learning and modeling techniques evaluate the parameters for our platform or any other e-Learning system.

Evaluation of reinforcement learning for optimal control of building active and passive thermal storage inventory	Solar Engineering 2005			English	Proceedings Paper	International Solar Energy Conference	AUG 06-12, 2005	Orlando, FL	Sharp, Kycera Solar Inc, Univ Florida, Dept Environm, ACCESS, Innovat Design, ASME, Solar Energy Div			SYSTEM	This paper describes an investigation of machine-learning control for the supervisory control of building active and passive thermal storage inventory. Previous studies show that the utilization of either active or passive, or both can yield significant peak cooling load reduction and associated electrical demand and operational cost savings. In this study, a model-free learning control is investigated for the operation of electrically driven chilled water systems in heavy-mass commercial buildings. The reinforcement learning controller learns to operate the building and cooling plant optimally based on the feedback it receives from past control actions. The learning agent interacts with its environment by commanding the global zone temperature setpoints and TES charging/discharging rate. The controller extracts cues about the environment solely based on the reinforcement feedback it receives, which in this study is the monetary cost of each control action. No prediction or system model is required. Over time and by exploring the environment, the reinforcement learning controller establishes a statistical summary of plant operation, which is continuously updated as operation continues. This presented analysis revealed that learning control is a feasible methodology to find a near-optimal control strategy for exploiting the active and passive building thermal storage capacity, and also shows that the teaming performance is affected by the dimensionality of the action and state space, the learning rate and several other factors. Moreover learning speed proved to be relatively low when dealing with tasks associated with large state and action spaces.

Parameterized inputs allow the algorithms to be readily adapted to any sensor of opportunity. The cornerstone of our approach is the ability to simulate realistic range data that may be tailored to the specifications of any sensor. We were able to modify an open-source raytracing package to produce point cloud information from which high-fidelity simulated range images are generated. The assumptions made in our experimentation are as follows: 1) we have access to a CAD model of the target including information about the surface scattering and reflection characteristics of the components; 2) the satellite of interest may appear at any 3-D attitude; 3) the target is not necessarily rigid, but does have a limited number of configurations; and, 4) the target is not obscured in any way and is the only object in the field of view of the sensor. Our pose estimation approach then involves rendering a large number of exemplars (100k to 5M), extracting 2-D (silhouette- and projection-based) and 3-D (surface-based) features, and then training ensembles of decision trees to predict: a) the 4-D regions on a unit hypersphere into which the unit quaternion that represents the vehicle [Q(X), Q(Y), Q(Z), Q(W)] is pointing, and, b) the components of that unit quaternion. Results have been quite promising and the tools and simulation environment developed for this application may also be applied to non-cooperative spacecraft operations, Autonomous Hazard Detection and Avoidance (AHDA) for landing craft, terrain mapping, vehicle guidance, path planning and obstacle avoidance.

However, the latter is one of the most distinctive attributes of cognitive behaviour. The paper proposes an approach of self-reinforcement cognitive learning combining unsupervised goal acquisition, active Markov-based goal attaining and spatial-semantic hierarchical representation within an open-ended system architecture. The novelty of the method consists in division of goals into the classes of parameter goal, invariant goal and context goal. The system exhibits incremental learning in such a manner as to allow effective transferable representation of high-level concepts.

The descriptions are represented by means of relational features; extracted from publicly available gene ontology information, and are straightforwardly interpretable by the medical experts. We applied the proposed method to two known data sets: (i) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) vs. acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and (ii) classification of fourteen types of cancer. Significant number of discovered groups of genes had a. description; confirmed by the medical expert, which highlighted the underlying biological process that is responsible for distinguishing one class from the other classes. We view our methodology not just as a prototypical example of applying more sophisticated machine learning algorithms to gene expression analysis; but also as a motivation for developing increasingly more sophisticated functional annotations and ontologies, that can be processed by such learning algorithms.

Using machine learning and large databases it is possible to develop detectors for visual categories that have a very high hit-rate, with low false positive rates. In this paper we investigate a general probabilistic framework for context based scene interpretation using multiple detectors. Methods for finding maximum likelihood estimates of scenes given detection results are presented. Although we have investigated how the method works for a specific case, namely for face detection, it is a general method. We show how to combine the results of a number of detectors i.e. face, eye, nose and mouth detectors. The methods have been tested using detectors trained on real images, with promising results.

A method that expands polynomial terms on principal subspace has yielded superior performance. In this paper, we aim to further improve the performance of the subspace-feature-based PNC. In the framework of discriminative feature extraction (DFE), we adjust the subspace parameters together with the network weights in supervised learning. Under the objective of minimum squared error, the parameters can be efficiently updated by stochastic gradient descent. In experiments on 13 datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we show that DFE can either improve the classification accuracy or reduce the network complexity. On seven datasets, the accuracy of PNC is competitive with support vector classifiers.

In the context of machine learning, it can provide insight into questions such as "why is a learning problem easier if data is separable by a large margin?" and "in what sense is choosing a kernel much like choosing a set of features?" This talk is intended to provide an introduction to random projection and to survey some simple learning algorithms and other applications to learning based on it. I will also discuss how, given a kernel as a black-box function, we can use various forms of random projection to extract an explicit small feature space that captures much of what the kernel is doing. This talk is based in large part on work in [BB05, BBV04] joint with Nina Balcan and Santosh Vempala.

The original feature space is mapped onto a new, reduced dimensionally space. The dimensionality reduction is usually performed either by selecting a subset of the original dimensions or/and by constructing new dimensions. This paper deals with feature subset selection for dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We provide a brief overview of the feature subset selection techniques that are commonly used in machine learning. Detailed description is provided for feature subset selection as commonly used on text data. For illustration, we show performance of several methods on document categorization of real-world data.

In this work we focus on the problem of "structure from motion" in which one wishes to recover the camera motion and the 3D coordinates of certain points given their 2D locations. This problem may be reduced to a low rank factorization problem. When all the 2D locations are known, singular value decomposition yields a least squares factorization of the measurements matrix. In realistic scenarios this assumption does not hold: some of the data is missing, the measurements have correlated noise, and the scene may contain multiple objects. Under these conditions, most existing factorization algorithms fail while human perception is relatively unchanged. In this work we present an EM algorithm for matrix factorization that takes advantage of prior information and imposes strict constraints on the resulting matrix factors. We present results on challenging sequences.

Here we consider feature selection within a Random Forest framework. A feature selection technique is introduced that combines hypothesis testing with an approximation to the expected performance of an irrelevant feature during Random Forest construction. It is demonstrated that the lack of implicit feature selection within Random Forest has an adverse effect on the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. It is also shown that irrelevant features can slow the rate of error convergence and a theoretical justification of this effect is given.

The method focuses on two major problems that should be pursued to realize natural human-machine conversation: a scalable grounded symbol system and belief sharing. The learning is performed in the process of joint perception and joint action with a user. The method enables the robot to learn beliefs for communication by combining speech, visual, and behavioral reinforcement information in a probabilistic framework. The beliefs learned include speech units like phonemes or syllables, a lexicon, grammar, and pragmatic knowledge, and they are integrated in a system represented by a dynamical graphical model. The method also enables the user and the robot to infer the state of each other's beliefs related to communication. To facilitate such inference, the belief system held by the robot possesses a structure that represents the assumption of shared beliefs and allows for fast and robust adaptation of it through communication with the user. This adaptive behavior of the belief systems is modeled by the structural coupling of the belief systems held by the robot and the user, and it is performed through incremental online optimization in the process of interaction. Experimental results reveal that through a practical, small number of learning episodes with a user, the robot was eventually able to understand even fragmental and ambiguous utterances, act upon them, and generate utterances appropriate for the given situation. This work discusses the importance of properly handling the risk of being misunderstood in order to facilitate mutual understanding and to keep the coupling effective.

We are collecting audio and video recordings for the first three years of one child's life, in its near entirety, as it unfolds in the child's home. A network of ceiling-mounted video cameras and microphones are generating approximately 300 giga-bytes of observational data each day from the home. One of the worlds largest single-volume disk arrays is under construction to house approximately 400,000 hours of audio and video recordings that will accumulate over the three year study. To analyze the massive data set, we are developing new data mining technologies to help human analysts rapidly annotate and transcribe recordings using semi-automatic methods, and to detect and visualize salient patterns of behavior and interaction. To make sense of large-scale patterns,that span across months or even years of observations, we are developing computational models of language acquisition that are able to learn from the childs experiential record. By creating and evaluating machine learning systems that step into the shoes of the child and sequentially process long stretches of perceptual experience, we will investigate possible language learning strategies used by children with an emphasis on early word learning.

When components come from third party sources, their internal structure is usually unknown and the documentation is insufficient. Therefore, the system integrator faces the problem of providing a required system assembling COTS whose behaviour is barely specified and for which no model is usually available. In this paper, we address the problem of integration testing of COTS. It combines test generation techniques with machine learning algorithms. State-based models of components are built from observed behaviours. The models are alternatively used to generate tests and extended to take into account observed behaviour. This process is iterated until a satisfactory level of confidence in testing is achieved.	CNRS, LSR IMAG, F-75700 Paris, France	Li, KQ (reprint author), CNRS, LSR IMAG, F-75700 Paris, France.

Gene selection and classification of human lymphoma from microarray data	TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE REGION 10 CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-5	TENCON-IEEE Region 10 Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON 2005)	NOV 21-24, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA	IEEE			EXPRESSION; PREDICTION; TUMOR	Experiments in DNA microarray provide information of thousands of genes, and bioinformatics researchers have analyzed them with various machine learning techniques to diagnose diseases. Recently Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been demonstrated as an effective tool in analyzing microarray data. Previous work involving SVM used every gene in the microarray to classify normal and malignant lymphoid tissue [21]. This paper shows that, using gene selection techniques that selected only 10% of the genes in "Lymphochip" (a DNA microarray developed at Stanford University School of Medicine), a classification accuracy of about 98% is achieved which is a comparable performance to using every gene. This paper thus demonstrates the usefulness of feature selection techniques in conjunction with SVM to improve its performance in analyzing Lymphochip microarray data. The improved performance was evident in terms of better accuracy, ROC (receiver operating characteristics) analysis and faster training. Using the subsets of Lymphochip, this paper then compared the performance of SVM against two other well-known classifiers: multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Experimental results show that SVM outperforms the other two classifiers.

Over this period, certain degree of success has been achieved in domain-oriented systems for applications such as facial recognition and medical diagnosis. However, the machine learning techniques used in these systems mostly assume that all the targeted images belong to a single group. Thus, most of the research efforts so far have been trying to search for one or a combination of global image features that can be used to differentiate the targeted images from the rest. This is not the case for a generic image database. Quite often, images that are similar semantically may be completely different with the visual context. In this paper, the authors propose a local grouping strategy together with a multiple Gaussian distributions distance ranking approach in an attempt to address the retrieval and ranking of images that belong to multiple disjoint groups.

Applying machine learning techniques to improve linux process scheduling	TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE REGION 10 CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-5	TENCON-IEEE Region 10 Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON 2005)	NOV 21-24, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA	IEEE				In this work we use Machine Learning (ML) techniques to learn the CPU time-slice utilization behavior of known programs in a Linux system. Learning is done by an analysis of certain static and dynamic attributes of the processes while they are being run. Our objective was to discover the most important static and dynamic attributes of the processes that can help best in prediction of CPU burst times which minimize the process TaT (Turn-around-Time). In our experimentation we modify the Linux Kernel scheduler (version 2.4.20-8) to allow scheduling with customized time slices. The "Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis" (Weka), an open source machine-learning tool is used to find the most suitable ML method to characterize our programs. We experimentally find that the C4.5 Decision Tree algorithm most effectively solved the problem. We find that predictive scheduling could reduce TaT in the range of 1.4% to 5.8%. This was due to a reduction in the number of context switches needed to complete the process execution.

It is shown here that the machine learning technique achieves very fast computation of accurate solutions to the problem of placing Label Switched Paths in order to maximise the performance of the network. Results are presented which compare the accuracy of the Neural Network solutions with the optimal solutions produced by the standard Mixed Integer Linear Programming technique, and the time taken to produce the solutions. As well, network simulation results are presented which show the improvement in network performance, in terms of packet loss, that can be achieved when using such a technique.

Achieving Advanced Device self-Managing (ADsM) capabilities in end to end reconfigurable mobile phone systems and networks is a central goal of E(2)R2 [2], which is considered an inevitable next step in the evolution of today's management tools like the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) [3] Device Management (DM). This framework is so far predominantly targeted towards the update of already sold mobiles by the device manufacturer. Another main aspect is the provisioning of operator dependent settings. Given the incredible rapid growth in network-size, complexity and considering desired abilities like dynamic spectrum management for spectrum-trading, moving the management plane to a higher abstraction layer is essential to keep track. This paper focuses on the enabling Peer to Peer (P2P) routing and collaborating basis as a common knowledge foundation.

This framework originates in work on developing a sufficient completeness checker for specifications with rewriting modulo an equational theory. Propositional tree automata recognize regular equational tree languages. However, unlike regular equational tree automata, the class of propositional tree automata is closed under Boolean operations. This extra expressiveness does not affect the decidability of the membership problem. This paper also analyzes in detail the emptiness problem for propositional tree automata with associative theories. Though undecidable in general, we present a semi-algorithm for checking emptiness based on machine learning that we have found useful in practice.

Moreover, using machine-learning technique makes our tool almost independent of the language being processed. This paper gives details of the algorithm and the tool.

However, successful combination of hand-written rules and a stochastic approach to Czech, as well, as some initial experiments in acquisition of tagging rules for Polish revealed potential capabilities of a rule based approach. The goals are: to define a language of tagging constraints, to construct a set of reduction rules for Polish and to apply Machine Learning to extraction of tagging rules. A language of functional tagging constraints called JOSKIPI is proposed. An extension to the C4.5 algorithm based on introducing complex JOSKIPI operators into decision trees is presented. Construction of a preliminary hand-written tagging rules for Polish is discussed. Finally, the results of the comparison of different versions of the tagger are given.

Focusing on automatic emotion recognition, work is being performed in order to achieve good results particularly in speech and facial gesture recognition. In this paper we present a study performed to analyze different Machine Learning techniques validity in automatic speech emotion recognition area. Using a bilingual affective database, different speech parameters have been calculated for each audio recording. Then, several Machine Learning techniques have been applied to evaluate their usefulness in speech emotion recognition. In this particular case, techniques based on evolutive algorithms (EDA) have been used to select speech feature subsets that optimize automatic emotion recognition success rate. Achieved experimental results show a representative increase in the abovementioned success rate.

S	Ozturk, O; Ciloglu, T		Sojka, P; Kopecek, I; Pala, K		Ozturk, Ozlem; Ciloglu, Tolga			Segmental duration modelling in Turkish	TEXT, SPEECH AND DIALOGUE, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Text, Speech and Dialogue	SEP 11-15, 2006	Brno, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Speech Commun Assoc, S Moravia Gas Co, Masaryk Univ, Fac Informat, Univ West Bohemia, Fac Appl Sci				Naturalness of synthetic speech highly depends on appropriate modelling of prosodic aspects. Mostly, three prosody components are modelled: segmental duration, pitch contour and intensity. In this study, we present our work on modelling segmental duration in Turkish using machine-learning algorithms, especially Classification and Regression Trees. The models predict phone durations based on attributes such as current, preceding and following phones' identities, stress, part-of-speech, word length in number of syllables, and position of word in utterance extracted from a speech corpus. Obtained models predict segment durations better than mean duration approximations (similar to 0.77 Correlation Coefficient, and 20.4 ms Root-Mean Squared Error). In order to improve prediction performance further, attributes used to develop segmental duration are optimized by means of Sequential Forward Selection method. As a result of Sequential Forward Selection method, phone identity, neighboring phone identities, lexical stress, syllable type, part-of-speech, phrase break information, and location of word in the phrase constitute optimum attribute set for phoneme duration modelling.

J	Rosenberg, AL				Rosenberg, AL			State	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article							AUTOMATA; MACHINES	The notion of state is fundamental to the design and analysis of virtually all computational systems. The Myhill-Nerode Theorem of Finite Automata theory-and the concepts underlying the Theorem-is a source of sophisticated fundamental insights about a large class of state-based systems, both finite-state and infinite-state systems. The Theorem's elegant algebraic characterization of the notion of state often allows one to analyze the behaviors and resource requirements of such systems. This paper reviews the Theorem and illustrates its application to a variety of formal computational systems and problems, ranging from the design of circuits, to the analysis of data structures, to the study of state-based formalisms for machine-learning systems. It is hoped that this survey will awaken many to, and remind others of, the importance of the Theorem and its fundamental insights.

While being the best known measure and enjoying the support of a rich and elegant theory, worst-case complexity seems gives rise to over-pessimistic complexity values. Many standard task, that are being carried out routinely in machine learning applications, are NP-hard, that is, infeasible from the worst-case-complexity perspective. In this work we offer an alternative measure of complexity for approximations-optimization tasks. Our approach is to define a hierarchy on the set of inputs to a learning task, so that natural ('real data') inputs occupy only bounded levels of this hierarchy and that there are algorithms that handle in polynomial time each such bounded level.

In this paper the classification system is constructed by an integrated feedforward neural network through incorporating the expert judgements and existing classification schemes into the learning procedure. Since different aspects of a protein structure may be relevant to various biological problems, the protein structure is represented by the convex hull of its backbone and geometric features are extracted. The training and prediction tests for different training sets in the class level of CATH indicate that the new automatic classification scheme is effective and efficient. Also the neural network model outperforms hidden markov model and support vector machine in the comparison experiment.

Resolving the ambiguity in biological terms in these texts is an important step for developing efficient knowledge discovery techniques. In this paper, we present a new method for biomedical term disambiguation in biomedical texts. The method is based on machine learning and can be viewed as a word classification task. We evaluated the method on gene-protein name disambiguation using Medline abstracts from years 1999-2003 containing about 3000 to 6000 gene and protein names. The technique is effective in disambiguating gene and protein names, achieving impressive accuracy, precision, and recall, with accuracy approaching about 90%, and outperforming the recently published results on this problem. Our technique is also applicable for the general problem of named entity disambiguation.	Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77004 USA	Al-Mubaid, H (reprint author), Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77004 USA.

Besides offering valuable insight into traffic stream flows, such relationships are widely used in dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) systems. In this research, an alternative paradigm for traffic dynamics models, appropriate for traffic simulation models and based on machine-learning approaches such as k-means clustering, k-nearest-neighborhood classification, and locally weighted regression is proposed. Although these models may not provide as much insight into traffic flow theory as speed-density relationships do, they allow for easy incorporation of additional information to speed estimation and hence may be more appropriate for use in DTA models, especially simulation-based models. This paper (with data from a network in Irvine, California) demonstrates that such machine-learning methods can considerably improve the accuracy of speed estimation.

In this paper we propose an SVM classification approach to predict the anti-parallel coiled coils structure based on the primary amino acid sequence. The training dataset for the machine learning are collected from SOCKET database which is a SOCKET algorithm predicted coiled coils database. Total 41 sequences of at least two heptad repeats of the anti-parallel coiled coils motif are extracted from 12 proteins as the positive datasets. Total 37 of non coiled coils sequences and parallel coiled coils motif are extracted from 5 proteins as negative datasets. The normalized positional weight matrix on each heptad register a, b, c, d, e, f and g is from SOCKET database and is used to generate the positional weight on each entry. We performed SVM classification using the cross-validated datasets as training and testing groups. Our result shows 73% accuracy on the prediction of anti-parallel coiled coils based on the cross-validated data.

The biochemical abstract machine BIOCHAM is based on two formal languages, one rule-based language used for modeling biochemical networks, at three abstraction levels corresponding to three semantics: boolean, concentration and population; and one temporal logic language used for formalizing the biological properties of the system. In this paper, we show how the temporal logic language can be turned into a specification language. We describe two algorithms for inferring reaction rules and kinetic parameter values from a temporal specification formalizing the biological data. Then, with an example of the cell cycle control, we illustrate how these machine learning techniques may be useful to the modeler.

J	Li, JY; Cercone, N				Li, Jiye; Cercone, Nick			Introducing a rule importance measure	TRANSACTIONS ON ROUGH SETS V	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article						rough sets; rule importance measure; association rules	SYSTEMS; SETS	Association rule algorithms often generate an excessive number of rules, many of which are not significant. It is difficult to determine which rules are more useful, interesting and important. We introduce a rough set based Rule Importance Measure to select the most important rules. We use ROSETTA software to generate multiple reducts. Apriori association rule algorithm is then applied to generate rule sets for each data set based on each reduct. Some rules are generated more frequently than the others among the total rule sets. We consider such rules as more important. We define rule importance as the frequency of an association rule generated across all the rule sets. Rule importance is different from either rule interestingness measures or rule quality measures because of their application tasks, the processes where the measures are applied and the contents they measure. The experimental results from an artificial data set, UCI machine learning datasets and an actual geriatric care medical data set show that our method reduces the computational cost for rule generation and provides an effective measure of how important is a rule.

The Boolean reasoning approach has manifestly become a powerful tool for designing effective and accurate solutions for many problems in decision-making and approximate reasoning optimization. In recent years, Boolean reasoning has become a recognized technique for developing many interesting concept approximation methods in rough set theory. The problem considered in this paper is the creation of a general framework for concept approximation. The need for such a general framework arises in machine learning and data mining. This paper presents a solution to this problem by introducing a general framework for concept approximation which combines rough set theory, Boolean reasoning methodology and data mining. This general framework for approximate reasoning is called Rough Sets and Approximate Boolean Reasoning (RSABR). The contribution of this paper is the presentation of the theoretical foundation of RSABR as well as its application in solving many data mining problems and knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) such as feature selection, feature extraction, data preprocessing, classification of decision rules and decision trees, association analysis.

The approach is characterized by the integration of data coming from static and dynamic experiments, exploiting also prior knowledge on the biological process under analysis. A starting network topology is built by analyzing gene expression data measured during knockout experiments. The analysis of time series expression profiles allows to derive the complete network structure and to learn a model of the gene expression dynamics: to this aim a genetic algorithm search coupled with a regression model of the gene interactions is exploited. The method has been applied to the reconstruction of a network of genes involved into the Saccharomyces Cerevisiae cell cycle. The proposed approach was able to reconstruct known relationships among genes and to provide meaningful biological results.

One solution to facilitate the utilization of narrative data could be to classify them according to their content. In this paper, we addressed two issues related to designing an automated classifier: domain experts' agreement on the content of the classes into which the data are to be classified, and the ability of the machine-learning algorithm to perform the classification on an acceptable level. The data we used were a set of Finnish intensive care nursing narratives. By using Cohen's kappa, we assessed the agreement of three nurses on the content of the classes Breathing, Blood Circulation and Pain, and by using the area under ROC curve (AUC), we measured the ability of the Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) algorithm to learn the classification patterns of the nurses. On average, the values of kappa were around 0.8. The agreement was highest in the class Blood Circulation, and lowest in the class Breathing. The LS-SVM algorithm was able to learn the classification patterns of the three nurses on an acceptable level; the values of AUC were generally around 0.85. Our results indicate that one way to develop electronic patient records could be tools that handle the free text in nursing documentation.

The algorithm identifies a set of image chips (or exemplars) in the training images that span the range of terrain appearance. It then uses the exemplars to segment novel images and assign a Go/NoGo classification. System parameters adapt to new inputs, providing a mechanism for learning. System performance is compared to that obtained via offline fuzzy c-means clustering and support vector machine classification.

It is an ideal facility for modeling of various nonlinear systems. Hysteresis phenomena are common in actuators and sensors, such as gears and saturation, which would undermine the stability of system and the accuracy of control badly. In this paper, a support vector machine based approach for modeling of systems with hysteresis is proposed, and an improved version is developed. The developed identification approaches are numerically implemented in Matlab simulation program, and the improved version is proved to be effective and more accurate than BP neural networks when being used for modeling of systems with hysteresis.

The main ideas included in DGNN are Growing, Resonance, and Post-prune. DGNN is called Dynamic Growing because it is based on the Hebbian learning rule and adds new neurons under certain conditions. When DGNN performs supervised learning, resonance will happen if the winner can't match the training example; this rule combines the ART/ARTMAP neural network and WTA learning rule. When DGNN performs unsupervised learning, post-prune is carried out to prevent over fitting the training data just like decision tree learning. DGNN's prune rule is based on the distance threshold. DGNN has some advantages: learning not only is stable because it grows under certain conditions; but also it is faster than back-propagation rules and favorable learned predictive accuracy in small, noisy, online or offline data sets. Three classes of simulations are performed on the primary benchmarks: Circle-in-the-Square and Two-spirals-apart benchmarks are used to check DGNN's supervised learning and compare it with ARTMAP and BP neural networks; DGN-N's unsupervised learning ability is checked on UCI Machine Learning Archive's Synthetic Control Chart Time Series data set.

Rough set theory has been a topic of general interest in the field of knowledge discovery. A new rough set-based greedy heuristic algorithm is proposed for attributes reduct and emphasized the role of basic constructs of rough set approach. The approach can select an optimal subset of attributes quickly and effectively from a large database with a lot of attributes. So the sensitivity of rough set to noise can be depressed and the system's robustness is to be improved. The validity of the proposed algorithms is verified by comparing with genetic algorithms, johnson's algorithm and dynamic reducts in using practical machine learning databases.

It attempts to solve the problems of lower classification rule quality, more redundancy rules after optimizing generations and classification accuracy using the traditional genetic algorithm in classification mining. A rule extraction approach to improve the classification accuracy and condense the classification rule set is also given. In order to further improve the efficiency of classification mining, the master-slave parallel computing mode is adopted in PC-HGA. Experiments of PC-HGA algorithm are carried out on two benchmark datasets: Iris and Dermatology from UCI machine-learning repository. The experimental results show that PC-HGA has good speedup performance and can discover a set of the succinct, efficient and understandable classification rules.

Liu, W.Wang and T.Y.Chai. IEEE Transaction on Systems, Man, Cybernetics, 2005) have be studied further by the improvement of the algorithm and the application of the algorithm to Iris data (reference ftp://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/machine-learning-databases/tris/). In stead of examples of less than 10 samples, we apply the improved algorithm to Iris data which has 150 samples and just the order relationship of the samples on the attributes are used. This study shows that the AFS Fuzzy logic clustering algorithm can obtain a high reclassification accuracy according to the order relationship. Thus the algorithm can be applied to the data sets in which the attributes are only described by order relationship.

Boosting is has proved to be effective method for improving learning quality of a weak learning algorithm with wide applications to classifications problems. However few successful applications were reported on improving regression quality by boosting. This paper presents a new algorithm for regression based on a boosted support vector machine (SVM) method. A regression problem is first converted to a binary classification problem upon the concept of E-insensitive loss. By applying the idea of AdaBoost algorithm, an optimal classification-plane ensemble is constructed with the converted classification data set. Based on this ensemble a regression estimate function is obtained with equivalence to the original regression problem. The analysis shows that for the regression data set, the number of samples with regression error exceeding 6 will decreased exponentially with the number of Boosting iterations. The testing results for an actual data set show that the new algorithm is effective.

In the literature, it is generally used for non-linear system identification and function estimation. This paper applies lazy learning to time series prediction. Unlike conventional time series similar analysis, the whole similarity and the individual similarity are discussed. A new similar criterion combined the two similar characters is advanced. Using this criterion and locally weighted learning, one-step-ahead predictors for time series forecasting is achieved. For each single one-step-ahead prediction, the best predictive value will be obtained based on leave-one-out cross validation. In order to show the effectiveness of our method, we present the results obtained on a real-world dataset from the Santa Fe competition and Henon map.

Our approach is a combination of dictionary based approach and machine learning based approach. Based on a gene name dictionary, an edit distance approximate string searching algorithm was used to improve the recall rate of gene recognition which is greatly lowered due to a lack of standard gene-naming conventions. Then the naive Bayes and SVM classifiers were adopted to filter out false recognitions, therefore improving the precision rate of gene recognition. The experiments show that classifiers greatly improve precision with slight loss of recall, resulting in a much better F-score (from 53.7% to 67.6%).

Incremental learning is a form of continuous ML wherein the knowledge acquisition can go on indefinitely for as long as there is some new knowledge to learn. In effect, a machine becomes smarter after gaining added knowledge from training. Our paper details the design of an incremental ML component of a ubiquitous multimodal multimedia computing system. Our system chooses the media and modalities that are appropriate for the user situation; the situation itself is based upon user's context, user's profile and the user's environment and hardware profile. The user context itself is dependent on the user's location, the noise level in the workplace and the presence or absence of other people in the vicinity, and the user's computing device. If applicable, the user's special need (i.e. handicap) is also taken into consideration in the media and modality selection. Incremental ML allows our system to become fault-tolerant, capable of finding replacement to a missing or defective component.

We start by introducing the machine learning framework for classification and some important related concepts. Then, a review of the main approaches in the literature is presented, focusing on the following issues: learning paradigms, corpora used, sense repositories, and feature representation. We also include a more detailed description of five statistical and machine learning algorithms, which are experimentally evaluated and compared on the DSO corpus. In the final part of the chapter, the current challenges of the supervised learning approach to WSD are briefly discussed.

Most approaches have employed manual heuristics that model the typical pattern of audio-visual features within particular sport events. To avoid manual observation and knowledge, machine-learning can be used as an alternative approach. To bridge the gaps between these two alternatives, an attempt is made to integrate statistics into heuristic models during highlight detection in our investigation. The models can be designed with a modest amount of domain-knowledge, making them less subjective and more robust for different sports. We have also successfully used a universal scope of detection and a standard set of features that can be applied for different sports that include soccer, basketball and Australian football. An experiment on a large dataset of sport videos, with a total of around 15 hours, has demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithms.

Given a marker indicating a rough location of a tumor, the proposed solution locates its boundary. Our approach consists of training process and locating process. In training process, we train AdaBoosted histogram classifiers to classify true boundary positions and false ones on the I-D intensity profiles of tumor regions. In locating process, we locate the boundaries by using the trained AdaBoosted histogram classifiers. The novelty of our approach is that we use AdaBoost in the training process to learn diverse intensity distributions of the tumor regions, and utilize the trained results successfully in locating process. Experimental results show our approach locates the boundaries successfully, despite the diverse intensity distributions of the tumor regions, marker location variability and tumor region shape variability. Our framework is also generic and can be applied for locating boundaries of blob-like targets with diverse intensity distributions in other applications.			li_yuanzhong@fujifilm.co.jp; shoji_hara@fujifilm.co.jp; kazuo_shimura@fujifilm.co.jp					Cootes T., 2004, STAT MODELS APPEARAN; KASS M, 1987, INT J COMPUT VISION, V1, P321; LI YZ, 2005, 10 IEEE INT C COMP V; QIAN Z, 2005, 1 INT WORKSH CVBIA; Schapire RE, 1998, ANN STAT, V26, P1651; Viola P., 2001, 2 INT WORKSH STAT CO; XU C, 2000, SPIE HDB MED IMAGING, V3	7	0	0	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA	1051-4651	0-7695-2521-0	INT C PATT RECOG			2006							400	403				4	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Computer Science	BFB27	WOS:000240678200099

In this paper, we propose a novel boosting method - boosting in random subspaces. Instead of boosting in original feature space, whose dimensionality is usually very high, multiple feature subspaces with lower dimensionality are randomly generated, and boosting is carried out in each random subspace. Then the trained classifiers are further combined with simple fusion method. Compared with boosting in original feature space, there are two advantages. The first is that the computation complexity of training is reduced, which is obvious. The second is that fusion further improves accuracy, which is verified by our extensive experiments on FERET database.

To analyze microarray datasets, methodology of machine learning has increasingly attracted bioinformatics researchers. Some approaches of machine learning are widely used to classify and mine biological datasets. However, many gene expression datasets are extremely high dimensionality, traditional machine learning methods can not be applied effectively and efficiently. This paper proposes a robust algorithm to find out rule groups to classify gene expression datasets. Unlike the most classification algorithms, which select dimensions (genes) heuristically to form rules groups to identify classes such as cancerous and normal tissues, our algorithm guarantees finding out best-k dimensions (genes), which are most discriminative to classify samples in different classes, to form rule groups for the classification of expression datasets. Our experiments show that the rule groups obtained by our algorithm have higher accuracy than that of other classification approaches.

This within-category variation makes highly distinctive local descriptors less appropriate for categorization. In this paper we propose a family of local image descriptors, called probabilistic patch descriptors (PPDs). PPDs encode the appearance of image fragments as well as their variability within a category. PPDs extend the usual local descriptors by modelling also the variance of the descriptors' elements, e.g. pixels or bins in a histogram. We apply PPDs to image categorization by using machine learning where the features are the matching scores between images and PPDs. We experiment with two variants of PPDs that are based on complementary local descriptors. An interesting observation is that combining the two PPD variants improves categorization accuracy. Experiments indicate benefits of modelling the within-category variation and show good robustness with respect to noise.

Parameter mining using the out-of-bootstrap generalisation error estimate for Stochastic Discrimination and Random Forests	18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Vol 2, Proceedings	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION		English	Proceedings Paper	18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2006)	AUG 20-24, 2006	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IAPR, CAA, Hong Kong Baptist Univ			CLASSIFIERS	Stochastic Discrimination is a machine learning algorithm with strong theoretical underpinnings and good published results on UCI datasets. However, it has not been popular amongst practitioners. We look at some of the issues involved in its use, propose the Out-of-Bootstrap error estimator as a means of tuning Stochastic Discrimination's and other classifiers' performance and contrast Stochastic Discrimination's utility with that of a related classification technique of Random Forests.

SVM is a typical optimization task that has attracted a lot of attention over the recent years in many Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning tasks. In this work, we exploit recent results in Reduced Convex Hulls (RCH) and apply them to a Nearest Point Algorithm (NPA) leading to an elegant and efficient solution to the general (linear and nonlinear, separable and non-separable) SVM classification task.

We suggest to explicitly estimate the potential improvement on the recognition rate achievable by splitting neurons in those regions of the feature space in which two or more classes overlap. We also suggest to compute the neuron splitting frequency, and to combine these information for selecting the most promising neuron to split. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data extracted from UCI Machine Learning Repository show substantial improvements of the proposed algorithm with respect to the state of the art.

In order to map a protein primary structure to its correct 3D fold, we introduce in this paper a machine learning paradigm that we entitled 11 structural hidden Markov model" (SHMM). We show how the concept of SHMM can efficiently use the protein secondary structure during the fold recognition task. Experimental results showed that the SHMM outperforms the SVM with a 6% improvement in the average accuracy. However, because in this application the two classifiers are not correlated, therefore their combination based on the highest rank criterion boosted the SHMM average accuracy with 10%.

In recent year, the use Of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Graph and its extension Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) in gauging classifier performance has attracted much attention from the machine learning community. This measure is especially useful when a data set is imbalanced or when operating characteristics are unknown. Some researchers have started investigating the optimization of existing learning model for this new performance criterion. In this paper, we proposed modifications to the well-known weight updating text classifier Sleeping-Experts (SE) for AUC optimization. Our experiments show that through our new sampling and updating strategy we can improve the classifier both in terms for AUC and the traditional performance for measures.

Precision-recall operating characteristic (P-ROC) curves in imprecise environments	18TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION, VOL 4, PROCEEDINGS	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION		English	Proceedings Paper	18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2006)	AUG 20-24, 2006	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IAPR, CAA, Hong Kong Baptist Univ				Traditionally, machine learning algorithms have been evaluated in applications where assumptions can be reliably made about class priors and/or misclassification costs. In this paper, we consider the case of imprecise environments, where little may be known about these factors and they may well vary significantly when the system is applied. Specifically, the use of precision-recall analysis is investigated and compared to the more well known performance measures such as error-rate and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). We argue that while ROC analysis is invariant to variations in class priors, this invariance in fact hides an important factor of the evaluation in imprecise environments. Therefore, we develop a generalised precision-recall analysis methodology in which variation due to prior class probabilities is incorporated into a multi-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The increased sensitivity and reliability of this approach is demonstrated in a remote sensing application.

Spectral Variation Function is a widely used measure of spectral distortion. However, SVF is a data-dependent measure. In order to make the measurement data-independent, a likelihood ratio is constructed to measure the spectral distortion. This ratio can be computed efficiently with a Bayesian predictive model. The prior of the Bayesian predictive model is estimated from unlabeled data via an unsupervised machine learning technique - Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM).

However, some studies show that the readability of health information presented on health web sites is difficult for many consumers. Readability formulas usually measure difficulty of writing style, instead of difficulty of content. In order to recommend health information with appropriate reading level to consumers, we investigate the feasibility of identifying text difficulty of health information using machine learning methods. Support Vector Machine is used to classify consumer health information into easy to read and reading level for the general public. Three feature sets: surface linguistic features, word difficulty features, unigrams and their combinations are compared in terms of classification accuracy. Unigram features alone reach an accuracy of 80.71%, and the combination of three feature sets is the most effective in classification with accuracy of 84.06%. They are significantly better than surface linguistic features, word difficulty features and their combination.

An innovative system that runs on a PDA for a continuous monitoring of people	19TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER-BASED MEDICAL SYSTEMS, PROCEEDINGS	COMPUTER-BASED MEDICAL SYSTEMS : PROCEEDINGS OF THE ANNUAL IEEE SYMPOSIUM		English	Proceedings Paper	19th IEEE Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems	JUN 22-23, 2006	Salt Lake City, UT	IEEE Comp Soc, TCCM, Texas Tech Univ Coll Engn, Brigham Young Univ			ECG	Continuous pervasive monitoring has the potential to improve the quality of life of many persons (for example those who suffer from heart arrhythmias or elderly people who suffer from chronic diseases). We show the three main steps related to the monitoring process and supported by our System. First, how data are captured by sensors which send those data using wireless communications to a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant). Second, how data are analyzed, locally on the PDA, using techniques proposed in the areas of the Semantic Web and Machine Learning. Finally, how data stored at the PDA can be queried remotely using web services. Those three steps are illustrated in two different scenarios that the system can deal with: tele-assistance and monitoring of arrhythmias. Moreover, through the paper we highlight the main advantages provided by the system: active monitoring which consists in reacting to anomalous situations without direct intervention of the user; universal assistance, i.e. irrespective of time or place through the use of wireless communications and PDAs; vital signs monitoring which consists in using sensors that capture the value of those vital signs, and subsequently feed them to a decision support system that analyses them and generates an alarm if necessary, and remote monitoring which allows authorized personal to consult data on monitored patients, using the Internet. Finally we present some performance results which demonstrate the feasibility of the system.

The understanding of molecular mechanisms regulating photoreceptor gene expression during retinal development may have important implications in clinical neuroscience. Using self-adaptive neural networks and pattern validation statistical tools, this paper explores large-scale analysis of photoreceptor gene expression. Based on the analysis of data generated by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) in the developing mouse retina, significant expression patterns for the in silico detection of photoreceptor-enriched genes were revealed. This study demonstrates how machine learning and statistical techniques may be effectively combined to detect key complex relationships encoded in SAGE data. Such approaches may support inexpensive functional predictions prior to the application of experimental methodologies.

Biomathematics oriented machine learning system for reconstructing temporal profiles of biological or clinical markers	19TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER-BASED MEDICAL SYSTEMS, PROCEEDINGS	COMPUTER-BASED MEDICAL SYSTEMS : PROCEEDINGS OF THE ANNUAL IEEE SYMPOSIUM		English	Proceedings Paper	19th IEEE Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems	JUN 22-23, 2006	Salt Lake City, UT	IEEE Comp Soc, TCCM, Texas Tech Univ Coll Engn, Brigham Young Univ			DYNAMICS IN-VIVO; INFECTION	Time series reconstruction algorithms are widely used to create temporal profiles from data series. However, in many clinical fields, e.g., viral kinetics, the data is noisy and sparse, making it difficult to use standard algorithms. We developed PROFILASE, which combines advanced multi-objective genetic algorithm search with machine learning architecture to harvest experts' decision-making considerations. Furthermore, PROFILASE implements additional scoring considerations, more biological in nature, thus further exploits domain expertise. We tested our system against a standard bottom-up algorithm by reconstruction of time series sparsely sampled with noise from simulated profiles. PROFILASE obtained RMS distance 2.5 fold lower (P < 0.0001) than the standard algorithm, 93% correct identification rate of segment number and 88% correct profile classification rate (versus 68%). The additional considerations were found to have a significant effect on the success of reconstruction. Finally, PROFILASE was generalized to evaluate additional considerations from different fields, thus allowing better understanding of other diseases.

This paper explores the possibility of extracting from these data relevant information and pertinent decision rules in order,to support the daily anesthesia procedures. In particular we focus on machine learning strategies to design a closed-loop. controller that, in a near future, could play the role of a decision support tool and, in a further perspective, the one of automatic pilot of the anesthesia procedure. Two strategies (direct and inverse) for learning a controller from observed data are assessed on the basis of a database of measurements collected in recent years by the ULB Erasme anaesthesiology group. The preliminary results of the learning approach applied to the regulation of hypnosis through the bispectral index (BIS) in a simulated framework appear to be promising and worthy of future investigation.

Therefore, a hybrid artificial neural network (ANN) -based scheduling knowledge acquisition algorithm is presented in this paper. We combined genetic algorithm (GA) with simulated annealing (SA) to develop a hybrid optimization method I in which GA was introduced to present parallel search architecture and SA was introduced to increase escaping probability from local optima and ability to neighbor search. The hybrid method was utilized to resolve the optimal attributes subset of manufacturing system and determine the optimal topology and parameters of ANN under different scheduling objectives; ANN was used to evaluate the fitness of chromosome in the method and generate the scheduling knowledge after obtaining the optimal attributes subset, optimal ANN's topology and parameters. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm produces significant performance improvements over other machine learning-based algorithms.

We apply machine learning methods to infer the sleep-awake condition during the time a user spends on the bed. This sleep-awake information would be useful for estimating critical factors including sleep latency, sleep duration, and habitual sleep efficiency related to sleep quality measurement Our experimental results show that the proposed approach could be a good alternative to the traditional motion sensor Actigraph, with competitive performance on the sleep-related activity monitoring. Furthermore, the distributed computation nature of our system also makes it favorable for practical health-care applications.

Achieving Advanced Device self-Managing (ADsM) capabilities in end to end reconfigurable mobile phone systems and networks is a central goal of E(2)R2 [2], which is considered an inevitable next step in the evolution of today's management tools like the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) [3] Device Management (DM). This framework is so far predominantly targeted towards the update of already sold mobiles by the device manufacturer. Another main aspect is the provisioning of operator dependent settings. Given the incredible rapid growth in network-size, complexity and considering desired abilities like dynamic spectrum management for spectrum-trading, moving the management plane to a higher abstraction layer is essential to keep track.

Ad-hoc methods are important ones, but how to utilize the expert experience efficiently, especially, store those in structured format and not to lose any information and interact under more user-friendly interface during handling exceptions, seem a mission impossible. Aiming at those, we proposed a question answering mechanism based approach for handling unexpected exceptions in collaborative design, which have some good characteristics, 1) unexpected exception handling is treated as a question answering mechanism so as to be more user-friendly, 2) in which exception handler can use natural language to define an exception; 3) expert experience are stored in natural language, there is no information loss; 4) higher efficiency, extendability and precision. In this paper, two approaches for mining similar records are proposed, and their performance comparison is shown.

In this paper, because of the adjustable resolution of the SVM algorithm, a new way to measure interharmonic is put forward, namely using wide analytical domain of frequency with low resolution at first and then using narrow analytical domain of frequency with high resolution to obtain the frequency spectrum of the signal. And based on this new method, the interharmonic detection system is designed and implemented with the prevailing and powerful software platform of LabVIEW with graphical nature.

As many as 106 datasets from the University of California, Irvine, Machine Learning Repository were used as comparison benchmarks. The framework provides a clear definition of the experimental setup so that it can be unambiguously reproduced or verified by others. Multiple runs of cross-validation and tuning were employed to minimize the possibility of random effects causing much biases in the results obtained. The metrics used to compare among different classifiers are based solely on simple readings obtained through classification tests. This allows future comparisons to be made readily adaptable for inclusion of new metrics.

In particular, we consider the problem of gas source declaration by a mobile robot equipped with metal oxide sensors in a turbulent indoor environment. While previous work has shown that machine learning classifiers can be trained to detect close proximity to a gas source, it is difficult to interpret the learned models. This paper investigates possible underlying indicators of gas source proximity, comparing three different statistics derived from the sensor measurements of the robot. A correlation analysis of 1056 trials showed that response variance (measured as standard deviation) was a better indicator than average response. An improved result was obtained when the standard deviation was normalized to the average response for each trial, a strategy that also reduces calibration problems.

The flexions of knees with different pathologies are tracked using an optical tracking system. The screw parameters which describe the transformation of the tibia with respect to the femur in each two successive observation are represented as the instantaneous screw axis of the motion given in its Plucker line coordinate, along with its corresponding pitch. The set of screw parameters associated with a particular knee with a given pathology is then identified and clustered in R 6 to form a "signature" of the motion for the given pathology. Bone model and two cadaver knees with different pathologies were tracked, and the resulting screws were used to train a classifier system. The system was then tested successfully with new, never trained before data. The classifier demonstrated a very high success rate in identifying the knee pathology.

However, research suggests that voluntary motor commands are issued in discrete-time submovements. There is also reasonable support for the hypothesis that human sensory experience is episodic as well. These facts have motivated the development of a learning algorithm that employs discrete-time sensory and motor control events, S-learning. We present this algorithm together with the results of simulated robot control. The results show that the learning that takes place is adaptive and is robust to a variety of conditions that many traditional controllers are not capable of handling, including random errors in the actuators and sensors, random transmission time delays, hard nonlinearities, time varying system behavior, and unknown structure of system dynamics. The performance of S-learning suggests that it may be an appropriate high-level control scheme for complex robotic systems, including walking, cooperative manipulation, and humanoid robots.

Recent researches have confirmed the utility of ensemble machine learning algorithms for gene expression data analysis. In this paper, a new ensemble machine learning algorithm is proposed for classification and prediction on gene expression data. The algorithm is tested and compared with three popular adopted ensembles, i.e. bagging, boosting and arcing.

Sensorimotor force and torque measurements from patients performing these standardized ADL tasks are hypothesized to give quantitative information about the recovery process. Parts of the force/torque measurements contain useful information, when related to the initia on of the movement during ADL tasks. Here we address the challenging problem of automatically extracting the movement initiation from these force/torque measurements. We will adopt a machine learning approach which relies on the statistically rigorous Maximal Information Redundancy (MIR) criterion. This assumes that movement initiation parts of the signals are characterized by an increased redundancy in the signal. A thorough evaluation of the criterion shows that the accuracy of the criterion in movement onset detection is close to that of clinical experts.

The system uses natural language processing to transform the report text, including identification of UMLS terms and detection of negated findings. The transformed report is then classified using statistical machine learning techniques. A support vector machine is trained for each stage category based on word occurrences in a corpus of histology reports for pathologically staged patients. New reports can be classified according to the most likely stage, allowing the collection of population stage data for analysis of outcomes. While the system could in principle be applied to stage different cancer types, the current work focuses on lung cancer due to data availability. The article presents initial experiments quantifying system performance for T and N staging on a corpus of gistology reports from more than 700 lung cancer patients.

Fourier-Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy has been shown to offer the potential for improving the accuracy (i.e. sensitivity and specificity) of these tests. This paper details the application of the machine learning methodology of Support Vector Machines (SVM) using FTIR data to enhance and improve upon the standard Pap test. A cohort of 53 subjects was used to test the veracity of both the Pap smear results and the FTIR based classifier against the findings of the colposcopists. The Pap test achieved an overall classification of 43%, whereas our method achieved a rate of 72%.

A non-wearable marker-based optoelectronic motion capture system was used to monitor seated posture for ten healthy subjects during a calibration exercise and a typing task. Machine learning techniques were used to select overall spinal sagittal flexion as the best indicator of posture front a set of marker and vector variables. Overall flexion data front the calibration exercise were used to define a threshold model designed to classify posture for each subject. which was then applied to the typing task data. Results of the model were anal) sed visually by qualified physiotherapists with experience in ergonomics and posture analysis to confirm the accuracy of the calibration. The calibration formula was found to be accurate on 100% subjects. This process will be used as a comparative measure in the evaluation of several wearable posture sensors, and to inform the design of the wearable system.

This paper presents a method of using both structural and functional MR images for brain disease diagnosis, by machine learning and high-dimensional template warping. First, a high-dimensional template warping technique is used to compute morphological and functional representations for each individual brain in a template space, within a mass preserving framework. Then, statistical regional features are extracted to reduce the dimensionality of morphological and functional representations, as well as to achieve the robustness to registration errors and inter-subject variations. Finally, the most discriminative regional features are selected by a hybrid feature selection method for brain classification, using a nonlinear support vector machine. The proposed method has been applied to classifying the brain images of prenatally cocaine-exposed young adults from those of socioeconomically matched controls, resulting in 91.8% correct classification rate using a leave-one-out cross-validation. Comparison results show the effectiveness of our method and also the importance of simultaneously using both structural and functional images for brain classification.

The proposed method is based on using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and wavelet transform to extract important features. Using the extracted features different machine learning classification schemas, MLP and RBF neural networks and K- nearest neighbor, are used to classify 274 instance signals from the MIT-BIH database. Simulations show that multilayer neural networks with Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) back propagation algorithm provide the optimal learning system. We were able to obtain 98.5% accuracy, which is an improvement in comparison with the similar works.

Critical voltage monitoring using sensitivity and optimal information machine learning	2006 38TH ANNUAL NORTH AMERICAN POWER SYMPOSIUM, NAPS-2006 PROCEEDINGS	North American Power Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual North American Power Symposium (NAPS)	SEP 17-19, 2006	Carbondale, IL	IEEE Power ENGN Soc, SIUC, Vice Chancellor Res, SIUC, Coll Engn, SIUC, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Mat Technol Ctr, Coal Res Ctr	So Illinois Univ Carbondale	sensitivity analysis; information theory; decision trees; electrical distance; event monitoring; abnormal conditions		This paper is motivated by the basic need to develop methods for on-line detection of abnormal conditions in large electric power systems. In order to implement truly effective near-automated tools for this purpose, it is necessary to overcome several problems such as: (1) excessive computational complexity; (b) unacceptable approximations; and, (3) dependence on full state measurements. In an attempt to overcome these major roadblocks, we combine tools capable of producing accurate results over broad ranges of conditions, such as off-line data mining and machine learning, with the approximate, well-understood deterministic methods, such as sensitivity-based methods. The resulting approach indirectly overcomes the dependence on full state measurements; the actual choice of the most relevant measurements becomes a result of such a combined approach. The proposed approach is illustrated on an example of detecting a given voltage threshold violation.

Furthermore, the lack of standard data sets and simulation tools makes the evaluation of machine learning algorithms in context-aware settings an even harder task. To ease the situation, we introduce a generic simulator that has been designed with the above mentioned purposes in mind. The simulator has also proven to be a good demonstration tool for mobile services and applications that are aimed at groups. The simulator is highly customizable and it can output context information of individual entities both through an interactive GUI and as data streams consisting of comma separated values. To support a wide range of tasks and scenarios, we have separated the three main information sources: behavior of agents, the scenario being simulated and the used context variable. The simulator has been implemented using Java, and the data streams have been made available through a web service interface.

Generally, different brain regions might need different types or sets of features for registration, which actually can be determined and learned from the brain samples by a machine learning method. In this paper, we focus on investigating the best geometric features required by different brain regions, to match the correspondences and manage the registration procedure hierarchically. Compared to other conventional registration methods where no learning method is employed, our learning-based registration method is able to produce not only more consistent registration on serial images of the same subject, but also more accurate registration on simulated dataset.

We present a complete system for high-precision computer-assisted image analysis of multispectral. MRI data based on a flexible machine learning approach. Careful quality evaluation shows that the system outperforms conventional threshold-based techniques w.r.t. inter-observer agreement levels for the quantification of relevant clinical parameters, such as white matter lesion load and brain parenchyma volume.

In this work, we explore a similarity measure for mammogram retrieval based on supervised learning from expert readers. This approach is evaluated using data collected from an observer study with a set of clinical mammograms. Our results demonstrate that the proposed machine learning approach can be used to model the notion of similarity as judged by expert readers in their interpretation of mammogram images and that it can outperform alternative similarity measures derived from unsupervised learning.

Knowledge-Engineering and Machine Learning approaches to intelligent vision systems also face learning bottlenecks. We have developed an approach to engineering vision systems, which allowed the user to make incremental changes to refine the performance of the system and address these limitations. A medical image segmentation system was built using this approach. In only a few hours of training, the system was able to exceed the performance of a similar hand-coded system built over a period of three months.

An efficient way to assist customers and companies is to reuse previous experience with similar agents. A formal representation of customer complaints and a machine learning technique for handling scenarios of interaction between conflicting human agents are proposed. It is shown that analysing the structure of communicative actions without context information is frequently sufficient to advise on complaint resolution strategies. Therefore, being domain-independent, the proposed machine learning technique is a good complement to a wide range of customer response management applications where formal treatment of inter-human interactions is required.

ESVMs were developed through hybridization between the strong learning paradigm of support vector machines (SVMs) and the optimization power of evolutionary computation. Hybridization is achieved at the level of solving the constrained optimization problem within the SVMs, which is a difficult task to perform in its standard manner. ESVMs have been so far applied to the binary classification of two-dimensional points. In this paper, experiments are conducted on the benchmark problem concerning diabetes of the UCI repository of machine learning data sets. Obtained results proved the correctness and promise of the new hybridized learning technique and demonstrated its ability to solve any case of binary standard classification.

Rough sets were employed as they have the capacity to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and also produce a set of readily understandable rules. A probabilistic neural network was also employed to classify this dataset, comparing the classification accuracy to that obtained with rough sets. We firstly evaluate the effectiveness of these machine learning algorithms on a real-life small biomedical dataset. The classification results indicate that both classifiers produce a high level of accuracy (87% or better). The rough sets algorithm produced a set of rules that are readily interpretable by a domain expert. The PNN algorithm produced a classifier that was robust to noise and missing values. These preliminary results indicate that the both rough sets and PNN machine learning approaches can be successfully applied synergistically to biomedical datasets that contain a variety of attribute types, missing values and multiple decision classes.

The causal factors of prostate cancer still remain to be determined. In this paper, we investigate a medical dataset containing clinical information on 502 prostate cancer patients using the machine learning technique of rough sets. Our preliminary results yield a classification accuracy of 90%, with high sensitivity and specificity (both at approximately 91%). Our results yield a predictive positive value (PPN) of 81% and a predictive negative value (PNV) of 95%. In addition to the high classification accuracy of our system, the rough set approach also provides a rule-based inference mechanism for information extraction that is suitable for integration into a rule-based system. The generated rules relate directly to the attributes and their values and provide a direct mapping between them.

The availability of comprehensive datasets and the limitations exhibited by previous forecasting analyses led us to integrate different predictive resources and models through statistical analysis and machine learning. Here we demonstrate the predictive ability of unsupervised and supervised learning approaches to detecting meaningful relationships between country cases, encoded by several socio-economic indicators, and the emergence of violent conflicts. Two clustering-based analyses (Kohonen maps and a network-based approach) provided the basis for exploratory analyses that confirmed hypotheses about the relevance of the data and the differences between state failure types. We also illustrate the potential of a novel network-based clustering approach for sub-class discovery in the area of political instability analysis. Furthermore, we show significant relationships between the emergence of violent conflicts and a dataset of quantitative indicators of good governance, which allows the design of effective supervised and unsupervised classifiers. This study contributes to the development of intelligent data analysis techniques for supporting hypothesis generation and testing in international conflict analyses.

Analysis of this data by business users often leads to discovery of valuable patterns and trends that otherwise would go unnoticed and that can lead to prioritization of decisions on future investments. The majority of tools currently available to business users are typically limited to computing summary statistics, simple visualization and reporting of data. More complex tools that could offer possible explanations for observations, discover knowledge, or allow making predictions are usually aimed at an academic audience or at users who are highly trained in analytics. However, it is business users with little experience in analytics who require access to tools that allow them to easily model customer behavior and build future scenarios. In this paper we present a tool we developed for business users to perform advanced analysis on customer data.

We dub this problem distributed ensemble classification, addressing e.g. when individual classifiers are trained on different (e.g. proprietary, legacy) databases or operate (perhaps remotely) on different sensing modalities. Typically, fixed, principled (untrained) rides of classifier combination such as voting methods are used in this case for aggregating decisions. Alternatively, we take a transductive approach, optimizing the combining rule for an objective function measured on the unlabeled batch of test data. We propose specific maximum likelihood (ML) objectives that are shown to yield well-known forms of aggregation, albeit with iterative, EM-based adjustment to account for possible mismatch between the class priors used by individual classifiers and those reflected in the new data batch. We also propose an information-theoretic method which outperforms the NIL methods and addresses some problem instances where the ML methods are not applicable. On benchmark data from the UC Irvine machine learning repository, all our methods give improvements in accuracy over the use of fixed rules when there is prior mismatch.

In this research, Multi-category SVMs (M-SVMs) is applied to traffic sign recognition and is compared with BP algorithm, which has been commonly used in Neural Network. 116 Chinese ideal signs and 23 Japanese signs are first chosen for training M-SVMs and BP intelligence classifiers. Next, noise signs, level twisted signs from Chinese and Japanese real signs are selected as testing set for the purpose of two networks testing. Experiment results indicate that, in approximated classification for traffic sign, SVM has achieved nearly 100% recognition rate and has certain advantages over BP algorithm. In fine classification, SVM shows its superiority to BP algorithm. Based on the analysis for the results, one may come to a conclusion that SVM algorithm is well worth the research effort and very promising in the area of traffic sign recognition.

We analyzed the image scanning method affect to the polynomial-approach method. Furthermore, we also researched the way of accumulation that can make the violent wobble of the curve became more gentle. Finally, We propose an approach, which has three steps: raster scanning of the image data, monotonizing data according to self-adapt parameter choice and polynomial-approach. This method achieved the image compression coding successfully. Experiments on traffic images showed our method is simple and high efficiency. It is high performance on the small complex traffic image, especially in middle and low signal-to-noise ratio.

If exams are performed online, how can the course provider guarantee that the student participating in the exam is the person enrolled? Without any Internet-based form of authenticating the student's identity, flexible delivery can break down at this point. As a consequence, traditional identity checks are introduced such as requiring the student to be physically present and to take the exam at a local institution, or requiring the student to sign documents that certify his/her identity. This paper discusses assessment in flexible delivery and how plagiarism can be detected. It presents a method for testing the identity of a student (or more generally, author) online, without any interference with the examination process. Recent advances in computational text analysis allow authorship identification with high reliability. That is, the original author of a document submitted for assessment can be determined successfully with an accuracy and precision of well above 90 percent. The computational methods include machine learning techniques such as "support vector machines", which are highly successful in text classification and a range of other practical applications.

In recent years, the focus in biological sciences has shifted from understanding single parts of larger systems, sort of vertical approach, to understanding complex systems at the cellular and molecular levels, horizontal approach. Thus the revolution of "omics" projects, genomics and now proteornics. Understanding complexity of biological systems is a task that requires acquisition, analysis and sharing of huge databases, and in particular, high-dimensional databases. For example, in the current project on location proteomics, the fluorescence microscopy data sets can have a dimension as high as 5: two spatial dimensions, z-stacks, time series and different-color channels (different color probes for different proteins). Processing such huge amount of bioimages visually by biologists is inefficient, time-consuming and effor-prone. Therefore, we would like to move towards automated, efficient and robust processing of such bioimage data sets. Moreover, some information hidden in the images may not be readily visually available. For example, in the same project, we use images of two proteins residing in the Golgi apparatus-giantin and gpp130. These two proteins cannot be distinguished better than randomly by humans, while when employing data mining methods, they can be told apart. Therefore, we do not only replace humans by machines for faster and more efficient processing but also because new knowledge is generated through use of sophisticated algorithms. The ultimate dream is to have distributed yet integrated large bioimage databases which would allow researchers to upload their data, have it processed, share the data, download. data as well as platform-optimized code, etc, and all this in a common format, something akin to the DICOM format for clinical imaging. To achieve this goal, we must draw upon a whole host of sophisticated tools from signal processing, machine learning and scientific computing. While such tools are widely present in clinical (medical) imaging, they are not as widespread in imaging of biological systems at cellular and molecular levels. This is a huge challenge and requires integration of interdisciplinary teams. I will address some of these issues in this presentation.

Anomaly detection by auto-association	2006 7th Nordic Signal Processing Symposium			English	Proceedings Paper	7th Nordic Signal Processing Symposium	JUN 07-09, 2006	Reykjavik, ICELAND				MULTILAYER PERCEPTRONS; NOVELTY DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; VERIFICATION; RECOGNITION	Anomaly detectors (or novelty detectors) are systems for detecting behaviour that deviates from "normality", and are useful in a wide range of surveillance, monitoring and diagnosis applications. Feed-forward auto-associative neural networks' have, in several studies, shown to be effective anomaly detectors although they have a tendency to produce false negatives. Existing methods rely on anomalous examples (counter-examples) during training to prevent this problem. However, counter-examples may be hard to obtain in practical anomaly detection scenarios. We therefore propose a training scheme based on regularisation, which both reduces the problem of false negatives and also speeds up the training process, without relying on counter-examples. Experimental results on benchmark machine learning problems verify the potential of the proposed approach.

We take the view that, for a particular class, the strategy of answering new questions can be learned from the already solved ones. To confirm the feasibility of this new approach, we use question answer pairs (QA pair) as our learning instances and Maximum Entropy Model (MEM) as a Machine Learning (ML) technique. The experiment conducted on the class-LOC_COUNTRY and OBJ LANGUAGE achieves good performance.

Kernel Fisher Discriminant (KFD), which is a machine learning method based on kernel function, is suitable for classification of high dimensional samples which couldn't be separated by linear classifier. In this paper, KFD were used for HRRP classification with KMOD kernel function. A multiple classifier was proposed, and better anti-noise performance was achieved with phase-subtraction alignment and a special rejecting method. The experimental results by three classes of measured HRRP data proved out the effectiveness of KFD.

Fault feature extract is the premise for the fault diagnosis. Wavelet packet transform (WPT) is a mathematical tool that has a special advantage over the traditional Fourier transform in analyzing non-stationary signals. It adopts redundant basis functions and hence can provide an arbitrary time-frequency resolution. The signals are decomposed into different frequency bands with the WPT, then, the energy percents of every frequency band components are calculated as the fault detection index. In this paper, the fault signals are sampled from one gear with pitting fault. According to the characteristic of the gear pitting signals, decompose the signals with the WPT and the changes of the energy percents in the frequency bands including the gear natural frequency will be used as the fault index. Fault style identification is the other vital issue of the fault diagnosis process. Support vector machines (SVM) is a new general machine-learning tool for classification, forecasting and estimation in small-sample cases. The principle and the process of gear pitting identification using SVM is presented. This paper only shows the availability for pitting fault diagnosis with the integration of the WPT and SVM, but the conclusion is also flexible for other machinery fault style classification.

However, they are less effective in solving narrow passages because feasible configurations in a thin space can rarely be sampled by random. Although some approaches have been proposed, they are either involved in complicated geometrical computations or requiring much information of obstacles. Moreover, if the configuration spaces are dynamic instead of fixed, some solutions may be failure in some unexpected situations. In this work, we provide a novel approach to replace the randomized sampler with the Gaussian PRM sampler. For dynamic configuration spaces, we also invite a machine learning technique to dynamically classify the pre-built samplers for different spaces.

Image quality measurement using sparse extreme learning machine classifier	2006 9th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision, Vols 1- 5			English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision	DEC 05-08, 2006	Singapore, SINGAPORE			image quality; JPEG; neural network; classification; extreme learning machine	NETWORKS	In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to measure the visual quality of JPEG-coded images. The features for predicting the perceived image quality are extracted by considering key human visual sensitivity factors such as edge amplitude, edge length, background activity and background luminance. Image quality estimation involves computation of functional relationship between HVS features and subjective test scores. The subjective test scores for modified images are obtained with-out referring to their original images (called 'No Reference'). Here, the problem of quality estimation is transformed to a sparse data classification problem using a sparse extreme learning machine (S-ELM). The S-ELM classifier estimate the posterior probability of a given image. Here, the mean opinion score ('visual quality') of an image is derived using the predicted class number and their estimated posterior probability. The experimental results prove that the estimated visual quality emulate the mean opinion score 'very well. The experimental results are compared with the existing JPEG no-reference image quality index and fullreference structural similarity image quality index. The result clearly shows the machine learning approach outperform the existing algorithms in the literature.

Core components of the classification system include music features, which need to be benchmarked with the ELM. Zero crossing rates, energy, root-mean-square, crest factor, spectral centroid, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and specific loudness sensation were features used in this study.

Over the years, the number of snake neurotoxin sequences identified is increasing at a very fast pace. However, only a small portion of them are experimentally characterized from more than 200,000 variants estimated to exist in nature. In this paper, we report a systematic functional analysis on snake neurotoxins using a statistical machine learning method - nearest neighbour approach for functional prediction together with a set of rules.

This type of problem has been widely studied in the soft computing community. In recent years, neural networks have been successfully applied to surface reconstruction and classification problems involving scattered data. However, due to the iterative nature of training a neural network, the resulting high cost in computational time limits the implementation of machine learning based methods in many real world applications (for example, navigation applications in unmanned aerial vehicles) that require fast generation of terrain models. A recently proposed machine learning method, the extreme learning machine (ELM), is able to train single-layer feed forward neural networks with excellent speed and good generalization. In this paper, we present terrain modeling using various machine learning methods, and we compare the performances of these methods with ELM. We also present a comparison of terrain modeling performances between ELM and the popular choice of terrain and surface modeling technique, the Delaunay triangulation with linear interpolation. Our results show that machine learning using ELM offers a potential solution to terrain modeling problems with good performances.

The proposed solution involves inverting a single matrix of small dimension. In the case of linear SVRs, the size of the matrix is independent of the number of data samples. Results involving benchmark data sets demonstrate the computational advantages of the proposal. In a recent publication, it has been highlighted that the margin in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is not scale invariant. This implies that an appropriate scaling can have an impact on the generalization performance of the SVM based regressor. Potential SVMs address this issue and suggest a new approach to regression.

Extraction of PD signals from an electro-optic modulator based PD measurement system	2006 Annual Report Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena			English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena	OCT 15-18, 2006	Kansas City, MO	IEEE Dielect & Elect Insulat Soc				Partial discharge (PD) measurement is an important technique for assessing the health of power apparatus. Previous published work [1] has shown that an electro-optic system can be used for PD measurement of oil-filled power transformers. The PD signal within an oil-filled power transformer may reach a winding, and then travel along the winding to the bushing core bar. The bushing, acting like a capacitor, can transfer the high frequency components of the partial discharge signal to its tap point. Therefore, an effective PD measurement can be implemented at the bushing tap by using a radio frequency current transducer around the bushing tap earth cable. The use of an optical transmission technique not only improves the noise immunity and provides the possibility of remote measurement but also realizes electrical isolation and enhances the safety for operators. The noise induced by the electro-optic modulator may influence the measurement sensitivity. This paper investigates the use of a machine learning technique to extract the useful PD signals from the noise signals.

SVM is a machine-learning method based on the principle of structural risk minimization, which performs well when applied to data outside the training set. The prediction whether or not the concentration of total phosphorus as P in the effluent will exceed the maximum allowable limit (1.0 mg/L) for a certain input is considered a supervised-learning problem. Least Squares Support vector machines (LS-SVMs) algorithm, which is a reformulation of standard SVMs, is used to design the classifier. Performance of radial basis function (RBF), polynomial and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) kernels has been evaluated and a high classification rate of 88.52% was achieved using radial basis function (RBF) kernel.

Such translations are important because they afford learners and educators with the opportunity to a survey a wide selection of learning and teaching material. For instance, university instructors are sometimes required to assess curriculum from courses delivered from other programs or universities, even internationally. Often, the only learning object available to do so is the course outline made available in HTML format on a web page. Generally there is an abundance of metadata available from such learning objects and this information can be used to generate useful components of the ontology. Other useful information can be derived from first establishing the domain of the object, Electricity and Computing for instance, or possibly History. Once extracted, the information representing learning objects can be stored as elements in an XML. template. The purpose of this work was to develop and implement a machine learning strategy for classifying course outlines into pre-defined domains and sub-domains in order to provide this information to an ontology repository designed to aid in the translation of such objects. First some typical domains were identified. Then, 20-30 course outlines were chosen to represent each sub-domain. Next, frequency tables of words common to the course outlines for a given sub-domain were generated in order to compile an ordered list of synonyms used to represent the sub-domains. Finally, a new set of course outlines were randomly selected for classification based on an analysis of the synonym content of each. Establishing the frequency tables and completing the synonym analysis was automated completely thereby constituting the machine learning strategy.

Novel approaches are suggested to tackle some of the challenges in this area. Protein-protein interaction data can provide a wealth of information to better understand the biology of a cell. The analysis of these interactions is also important for the discovery of disease-associated proteins. The data can also he used for the identification of novel cellular sites that are crucial for the development of new and improved pharmaceutical drugs. Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) is the process of extracting implicit information from large amounts of data using mathematical and statistical methods. It grows in synergy with computer technology, creating new analytical tools and using them for knowledge discovery in large volume of data. A multidisciplinary science and technology with links in statistics, machine learning, data base systems, and computer programming and visualization, KDD has proved to be a promising solution to various problems in molecular biology, and gene analysis. An overview of various data mining techniques is presented in this paper with specific examples of their applications in protein-protein interaction data analysis. While some of the most widely used data mining techniques for exploring protein interaction data sets are clustering (including supervised and unsupervised), classification and association rule discovery, others are based on methods for mining interaction information from scientific sources such as PubMed and MedLine. There are areas such as prediction and profiling that have not been explored much for mining information in protein-protein interactions. We propose methods to employ these novel techniques to analyze protein-protein interaction data.

SVM classifier approach to enumerate directional signals impinging on an array of sensors	2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, Vols 1-5			English	Proceedings Paper	19th Annual Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering	MAY 07-10, 2006	Ottawa, CANADA	IEEE		machine learning; enumeration; support vector machines; localization; sensitivity analysis		The support vector machine classification method is used for source enumeration; i.e., estimating the number of sources contributed in generation of the signals received by the sensors of a passive array. The main motivation comes from the problems where the data model is not completely known, or the model is subject to some changes due to mat environmental conditions, (i.e., the case of data model mismatch). With no model mismatch, because we know a-priori about the generative model of the data, the traditional statistical signal processing techniques yield better results compared to general machine learning techniques like SVM (which try to learn everything from training data samples, without any use of their generative data model, and also by employing a simple geometric structure). Monte-Carlo test results show the potential of the SVM to compete with statistical signal processing in this particular application. Specifically, the SVM has a slightly better performance in the case of model mismatch, (sensor gain perturbations, sensor phase perturbation, and for spatially correlated array noise), compared to traditional enumeration methods MDL and AIC, at very low SNR values.

Compared with the classical machine learning methods, the learning discipline of SVM is to minimize the structural risk instead of empirical risk used in the learning discipline of classical methods, and SVM gives better generative performance. Because SVM algorithm is a convex quadratic optimization problem, the local optimal solution is certainly the global optimal one. we often study two species problem, even we can classify two species correctly, but it doesn't mean we can classify many species. In this paper, we introduce SVM arithmetic and give a example how to classify many species problem by SVM arithmetic.

Such a system may be used to tune signal processing parameters, ideally in real-time, for such applications as intelligibility enhancement of high-pitched sung notes, and other musical systems which tune signal processing parameters according to detected performance parameters. Our falsetto detector uses a support vector classifier trained on Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) computed from a newly collected database of anechoic sung notes. It is shown to give correct classification with better than 95% accuracy.

In practice, however, bidders often exhibit unknown and variable behavior, making them difficult to model and complicating the design process. To address this challenge, we explore the use of an adaptive auction mechanism: one that learns to adjust its parameters in response to past empirical bidder behavior so as to maximize an objective function such as auctioneer revenue. In this paper, we give an overview of our general approach and then present an instantiation in a specific auction scenario. In addition, we show how predictions of possible bidder behavior can be incorporated into the adaptive mechanism through a metalearning process. The approach is fully implemented and tested. Results indicate that the adaptive mechanism is able to outperform any single fixed mechanism, and that the addition of metalearning improves performance substantially.

This may also be extended onto civilian grounds, and many of these attacks have led to priceless loss of life and social well-being. One of the common characteristics of many of these attacks is the element of surprise. Those who carry out the attacks normally try their best to ensure that no one knows what or where the attack is to take place in order to ensure the highest degree of damage. In this work, we propose a framework for developing a decision support tool for defence personnel in dealing with this kind of threats. The framework integrates three well-known machine learning concepts resulting from research in artificial intelligence and machine learning. By reasoning based on the historical attack patterns, the use of the proposed framework allows one to realise what may happen given a set of previous acts and a set of factors currently observed.

The GMM make a fuzzy procedure to do a soft discretization of continuous variables, when dealing with continuous inputs with fuzzy and uncertain nature. Based on the FBN, the fuzzy reasoning model for prediction and diagnosis can be designed. To validate the method, an intelligent model is built and used to classify the astrocytoma malignant degree. Experiment results show that the model achieves an accuracy of 83.33%. It outperforms the Bayesian network-based model using k-nearest neighbor classifiers (KNN) to make a crisp discretization. This study provides a novel objective method to quantitatively assess the astrocytoma malignant level that can be used to assist doctors to diagnose the tumor.

SLIQ algorithm was proposed (Mehta et al, 1996) as an improvement over ID3 and C4.5 algorithms (Quinlan, 1993). Elegant Decision Tree Algorithm was proposed (Chandra et al 2002) to improve the performance of SLIQ. In this paper a novel approach has been presented for the choice of split value of attributes. The issue of reducing the number of split points has been addressed. It has been shown on various datasets taken from UCI machine learning data repository that this approach gives better classification accuracy as compared to C4.5, SLIQ and Elegant Decision Tree Algorithm (EDTA) and at the same time the number of split points to be evaluated is much less compared to that of SLIQ and EDTA.

Real-time systems are no exception. However a significant issue is that the information needed is not always available. Often this information is derived using manual methods, which is costly in terms of time and money. In this paper we show how techniques taken from, other areas may provide more effective and efficient solutions. More specifically machine learning is applied to the problem of automatically deriving loop bonds. The paper shows how taking an, approach based on machine learning allows a difficult problem to be addressed with, relative ease.

Input vectors are projected onto a lower dimensional map space producing a visual representation of the input data in a manner similar to the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) artificial neural network. Particles in the map react to the input data by modifying their velocities using a standard Particle Swarm Optimization update function, and therefore organize themselves spatially within fixed neighborhoods in response to the input training vectors. SOSwarm is successfully applied to four benchmark classification problems from the UCI Machine Learning repository with the novel SOSwarm algorithm outperforming or equaling the best reported results on all four of the problems analyzed.

The aim of this research is to develop an intrusion detection system based on a novel concept in immunology, the Danger Theory. Dendritic Cells (DCs) are antigen presenting cells and key to the activation of the human immune system. DCs perform the vital role of combining signals from the host tissue and correlate these signals with proteins known as antigens. In algorithmic terms, individual DCs perform multi-sensor data fusion based on time-windows. The whole population of DCs asynchronously correlates the fused signals with a secondary data stream. The behaviour of human DCs is abstracted to form the DC Algorithm (DCA), which is implemented using an immune inspired framework, libtissue. This system is used to detect context switching for a basic machine learning dataset and to detect outgoing portscans in real-time.

Cultural evolution of ensemble learning for problem solving	2006 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOLS 1-6	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	JUL 16-21, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE		cultural algorithms; ensemble learning optimization; cultural evolution; evolutionary computation		As the complexity of problem spaces increases in terms of their inherent dimensionality and the interaction between the dimensions, it becomes increasing harder to rely on a small subset of dimensions to guide an evolutionary optimizer to a solution. In this paper we integrate a popular machine learning technique, ensemble learning, into the evolutionary process using the Cultural Algorithms framework. Each of five different knowledge sources in the Cultural Algorithms belief space is viewed as part of an ensemble where each interacts with the other to control the exploration of the population. We apply the prototype to the design of a tension compression spring and demonstrate the advantages of evolving such ensembles for optimization applications.

Particle swarm optimization in dynamic pricing	2006 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOLS 1-6	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	JUL 16-21, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE				Dynamic pricing is a real-time machine learning problem with scarce prior data and a concrete learning cost. While the Kalman Filter can be employed to track hidden demand parameters and extensions to it can facilitate exploration for faster learning, the exploratory nature of Particle Swarm Optimization makes it a natural choice for the dynamic pricing problem. We compare both the Kalman Filter and existing particle swarm adaptations for dynamic and/or noisy environments with a novel approach that time-decays each particle's previous best value; this new strategy provides more graceful and effective transitions between exploitation and exploration, a necessity in the dynamic and noisy environments inherent to the dynamic pricing problem.

B	Al-Mubaid, H			IEEE	Al-Mubaid, Hisham			Context-based technique for biomedical term classification	2006 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOLS 1-6	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	JUL 16-21, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE				The existing volumes of biomedical texts available online drive the increasing need for automated techniques to analyze and extract knowledge from these information repositories. Recognizing and classifying biomedical terms in these texts is an important step for developing efficient techniques for knowledge discovery and information extraction from the literature. This paper presents a new technique for biomedical term classification in biomedical texts. The method is based on combing successful feature selection techniques (MI, X(2)) with machine learning (SVM) for biomedical term classification. We utilize the advances in feature selection techniques in ER and use them to select the key features for term identification and classification. We evaluated the method using Genia 3.0 corpus with about 3,000 to more than 34,000 biomedical term instances. The technique is effective, achieving impressive accuracy, precision, and recall; and with F-score approaching similar to 90%, the method is superior or very competitive with the recently published results.

Multi-agent technology and Machine Learning are integrated into the same physical platform to provide innovative capabilities for carrying out the task. First, a new multi-agent architecture is developed. Second, two methods that facilitate optimized machine learning, Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Genetic Algorithms (GA), are integrated into the decision-making agent in the architecture. An arbitrator is incorporated into a probabilistic switching scheme for selecting the optimal strategy in a given state of the task. Finally, the robot force/motion control and local modeling are integrated into the architecture to implement a physical multi-robot system. Simulation and experimental studies are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the system.

AdaBoost is an excellent machine learning technique. Learning Gabor feature based classifier using AdaBoost is one of the best face recognition algorithms. However, dimensionality of Gabor feature space usually is very high, which makes the training program need huge memory or else take a very long time to run. In this paper, we propose a method which not only can solve the problem but also can improve recognition accuracy. Several subspaces with moderate size are randomly generated from original high dimensional Gabor feature space. Then strong classifier is trained in every random subspace [I] respectively and the outputs of multiple classifiers are combined in the final decision. Experimental results demonstrate that the method saves a great amount of training time, and achieves an exciting recognition rate of 97.91 % on the FERET Fb test set.

Although this is not generally a problem for low-level processing, higher-level understanding, such as object detection, demands novel solutions because the available information may, in some cases, be very local, e.g., only a partial view of the object could fit in the available memory size. In this paper, we propose a novel hardware-oriented overlaid text detection algorithm that can detect text with height as large as five times the memory size. The algorithm integrates a connected component (CC)-based algorithm with a texture-based machine learning approach. The CC-based algorithm uses character-level features in the horizontal direction whereas the texture-based algorithm extracts block-based features to integrate information from all directions. Furthermore, the texture-based algorithm employs a support vector machine (SVM) to benefit from the strength of machine learning tools. In order to detect text of large font size, we also propose a novel hardware-oriented, height-preserving multi-resolution analysis. Finally, the results of the two classifiers as well as color and edge cues are used for the final pixel-based text/non-text decision.

It is based on a criterion that has recently emerged from the machine learning literature: the kernel-target alignment. This criterion makes possible to find the optimal representation for a given classification problem without designing the classifier itself. Some possible applications of our framework are discussed. The first one provides a computationally attractive way of adjusting the free parameters of a distribution to improve classification performance. The second one is related to the selection, from a set of candidates, of the distribution that best facilitates a classification task.

To achieve model compactness and discriminability, we simultaneously perform feature dimension reduction and HMM parameter estimation via maximizing the confidence of accepting the hypothesis that observations are from target HMM states rather than competing HMM states. A new discriminative training criterion is derived using hypothesis test theory. Particularly, we develop the maximum confidence hidden Markov modeling (MCHMM) framework for face recognition. Using this framework, we incorporate a transformation matrix to extract discriminative facial features. The continuous-density HMM parameters are estimated using the extracted features. Importantly, we adopt a consistent criterion to build whole framework including feature extraction and model estimation. From the experiments on ORL facial databases, we find that the proposed method obtains robust image segmentation performance in presence of different variations of facial expressions, orientations, etc. In comparison of previous HMM approaches, the proposed MCHMM achieves better recognition accuracies and image segmentation.

The method is based on minimizing the leave-one-out error which is approximated by the radius-margin bound. A gradient descent method provides a learning rule for the basis in an outer loop of an iteration. The inner loop performs support vector machine training and provides support vector coefficients on which the gradient descent de ends. In this way, the derivation of a basis for feature extraction and the support vector machine are jointly optimized. The efficacy of the method is illustrated with examples from multi-dimensional synthetic data sets.

We present two contributions regarding this algorithm. (1) We show that, given a kernel density estimate of the data, minimising the overlap between cluster densities is equivalent to the mincut criterion. This gives a principled way to determine what affinities and scales to use in the typical-cut algorithm, and more generally in clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms based on pairwise affinities. (2) We introduce an iterated version of the typical-cut algorithm, where the estimated p(nm) are used to refine the affinities. We show this procedure is equivalent to finding stationary points of a certain objective function over clusterings; and that at the stationary points the value of p(nm), is 1 if it and m are in the same cluster and a small value otherwise. Thus, the iterated typical-cut algorithm sharpens the p(nm) matrix and makes the cluster structure more obvious.

In contrast to the conventional Mercer's theorem approach that implicitly defines kernels by an eigendecomposition, the functionals in this reproducing kernel Hilbert space are explicitly constructed and are not necessary orthonormal. We also point out an intriguing connection between this reproducing kernel Hilbert space and a Generalized Fock space. We give an experimental result on approximation of the constructed kernel to a Gaussian kernel.

In large state spaces, however, training can be expensive, because it often requires many iterations of forward-backward. Beam search is a standard heuristic for controlling complexity during Viterbi decoding, but during forward-backward, standard beam heuristics can be dangerous, as they can make training unstable. We introduce sparse forward-back-ward. a variational perspective on beam methods that uses an approximating mixture of Kronecker delta functions. This motivates a novel minimum-divergence beam criterion based on minimizing KL divergence between the respective marginal distributions. Our beam selection approach is not only more efficient for Viterbi decoding, but also more stable within sparse forward-backward training. For a standard text-to-speech problem, we reduce CRF training time fourfold-from over a day to six hours-with no loss in accuracy.

We focus specifically on the problem of training what we refer to as generalized linear kernels-that is, kernels of the form. k(x(1), x(2)) = x(1)(T)Rx(2), where R is a positive semidefinite matrix. Our approach for training k(xi, x(2)) involves first constructing a set of upper bounds on the rates of false positives and false negatives at a given score threshold. Under various conditions. minimizing, these bounds leads to the closed-form solution. R = W(-1). where W is the expected within-class covariance matrix of the data. We tested various parameterizations of R, including a diagonal parameterization that simply performs perfeature variance normalization, on the 1-conversation training condition of the SRE-2003 and SRE-2004 speaker recognition tasks. In experiments on a state-of-the-art MLLR-SVM speaker recognition system [1], the parameterization, (W) over cap (-1)(s), where (W) over cap (s) is a smoothed estimate of W, achieves relative reductions in the minimum decision cost function (DCF) [2] of up to 22% below the results obtained when R does per-feature variance normalization.

Specifically, given a user-specified level alpha epsilon (0: 1), how can we ensure a false alarm rate no greater than alpha while minimizing the miss rate? We examine two approaches, one based on shifting the offset of a conventionally trained SVM and the other based on the introduction of class-specific weights. Our contributions include a novel heuristic for improved error estimation and a strategy for efficiently searching the parameter space of the second method. We also provide a characterization of the feasible parameter set of the 2v-SVM on which the second approach is based. The proposed methods are compared on four benchmark datasets.

In numerous applications, these point processes are unobserved but actually drive an observation process. Here, we are interested in optimal sequential Bayesian estimation of such partially observed point processes. This class of filtering problems is non-standard as there is typically no underlying Markov structure and the likelihood function relating the observations to the point process has a complex form. Hence, except in very specific cases it is impossible to solve them in closed-form. We develop an original trans-dimensional Sequential Monte Carlo method to address this class of problems. An application to partially observed queues is presented.

In this challenging framework we are not able to evaluate the likelihood function directly, and instead we use a disctretized approximation to the likelihood. The parameters are then estimated from this approximating model using a Bayesian Monte Carlo scheme, and employing a Kalman filter to marginalize and sample the trajectory of the state process. An efficient exploration of the parameter space is achieved through a novel reparameterization in terms of an equivalent mechanical system. Simulations demonstrate the potential of the methods.

The setting of the regularization parameter is critical for deriving, a correct solution. In most existing methods, the scalar regularization parameter is often determined in a heuristic manner; in contrast, our approach infers the optimal regularization setting under a Bayesian framework. Furthermore, Bayesian inference enables an independent regularization scheme where each coefficient (or weight) is associated with an independent regularization parameter. Simulations illustrate the improvement using our method in discovering sparse structure from noisy data.

Unexpectedly, we obtained an algorithm that not only is insensitive to the power of the input, but is also faster than the MEE for the same misadjustment, and also that is less sensitive to the kernel size. We explain these results analytically, and through system identification simulations.

The classifier is responsible for selecting the features, to minimize the cost of observing features while also maximizing the classification performance. We propose a reward-directed Bayesian classifier (RDBC) to solve this problem. The RDBC features an internal state structure for preserving the feature dependence, and is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). The results on a diabetes dataset show the RDBC with a moderate number of states significantly improves over the naive Bayes classifier, both in prediction accuracy and observation parsimony. It is also demonstrated that the RDBC performs better by using more states to increase its memory.

We express the non-negativity constraints using a wide class of loss (cost) functions, which leads to an extended class of multiplicative algorithms with regularization. The proposed relaxed forms of the NMF algorithms have a higher convergence speed with the desired constraints. Moreover, the effects of various regularization and constraints are clearly shown. The scope of the results is vast since the discussed loss functions include quite a large number of useful cost functions such as weighted Euclidean distance, relative entropy, Kullback Leibler divergence, and generalized Hellinger, Pearson's, Neyman's distances, etc.	RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Wako, Saitama 35101, Japan	Cichocki, A (reprint author), RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Wako, Saitama 35101, Japan.

We propose an integrated method to estimate both the mixing coefficients and the spatial-shifts using a second-order statistics based algorithm, which uses specially parameterized approximate joint diagonalization of two-dimensional-spectra matrices. The accommodation of spatial shifts allows the exploitation of further diversity between snapshots, and thus enables to attain improved separation, especially when the static mixing coefficients are ill-conditioned - as we demonstrate using simulations results.

A novel approach to automated source separation in multispeaker environments	2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, Vol V, Proceedings: AUDIO AND ELECTROACOUSTICS, MULTIMEDIA SIGNAL PROCESSING, MACHINE LEARNING FOR SIGNAL PROCESSING SPECIAL SESSIONS	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)		English	Proceedings Paper	31st IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	MAY 14-19, 2006	Toulouse, FRANCE	IEEE Signal Proc Soc		machine learning for signal processing; blind signal separation; independent component analysis		We are proposing a new approach to the solution of the cocktail party problem (CPP). The goal of the CPP is to isolate the speech signals of individuals who are concurrently talking while being recorded with a properly positioned microphone array. The new approach provides a powerful yet simple alternative to commonly used methods for the separation of speakers. It is based on the observation that the estimation of the signal transfer matrix between speakers and microphones is significantly simplified if one can assure that during certain periods of the conversation only one speaker is active while all other speakers are silent. Methods to determine such exclusive activity periods are described and a procedure to estimate the signal transfer matrix is presented. A comparison of the proposed method with other popular source separation methods is drawn. The results show an improved performance of the proposed method over earlier approaches.

It is also shown that the algorithm converges to the principal component of the source distribution when studied in the estimation direction. In this paper, we study the local stability of the CMN algorithm and determine the conditions under which local stability is achieved by extending our previous work to all dimensions of the weight vector. We use these conditions of stability to quantify convergence performance for a number of complex nonlinear functions, and present simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of these functions.

This paper presents a computational approach to modelling monaural auditory scene analysis, where we attempt to account for perceptual and neuronal findings of receptive field selectivity and adaptation in the auditory cortex. The model introduces a biologically-inspired scheme of dynamic segregation of auditory streams, based on unsupervised clustering and the statistical theory of Kalman prediction. Our method demonstrates its ability to emulate known percepts reported by human subjects in auditory streaming and sound organization tests, and yields successful results in segregating speech from concurrent speaker and music interferences.

The proposed method is justified by rigorous analysis and supported by simulations.

Several methods have been developed to solve this problem. Independent component analysis (ICA) is certainly the most known method and the most used. ICA exploits the non-Gaussianity of the sources in the mixtures. In this study, we propose an improved signal separation algorithm where simultaneously we increase the non-Gaussian nature of signals and we initiate the preliminary separation. For this, the observations are transformed into an adequate representation using the wavelet packets decomposition. In this study, we consider the instantaneous mixture of two sources using two sensors. We validate our approach by using synthetic and recorded audio signals. Preliminary results show a strong improvement when compared to conventional ICA (FastICA), with specific signals.

Independent Factor Analysis (IFA) is a generalization of Mixtures of Factor Analyzers, where instead we learn nonlinear subspaces in data. IFA can also be considered a method for blind source separation. The IFA generative model is hierarchical, with each factor modeled as an independent Mixture of Gaussians, each mixture component representing a factor state. Computing expectations over factors quickly becomes intractable with increasing number of factors as this requires summation over exponentially many state configurations, making parameter estimation via Expectation Maximization (EM) with an exact E-step infeasible. Unlike the Variational method that has been proposed, we take a simulation based approach to obtain exact parameter estimates. We define prior distributions and use a Gibbs sampler to obtain samples from the parameter posterior. Application to synthetic data demonstrates effectiveness of the method in estimating model parameters and robustness to model permutation invariance.

However, in many cases two or more channels are available, in which case it would be advantageous to have a multichannel version of the algorithm. To this end, a shifted Non-negative Tensor Factorisation algorithm is derived, which extends shifted Non-negative Matrix Factorisation to the multi-channel case. The use of this algorithm for multi-channel sound source separation of harmonic instruments is demonstrated. Further, it is shown that the algorithm can be used to perform Non-negative Tensor Deconvolution, a multi-channel version of Non-negative Matrix Deconvolution, to separate sound sources which have time evolving spectra from multi-channel signals.

This a generalization of well-known robust algorithms that are suited for equal number of sources and sensors. It is assumed that the sources are non-stationary and sparsely distributed in the time-frequency plane. The mixture model is convolutive, i.e. acoustic setups such as the cocktail party problem are contained. The limits of identifiability are determined in the framework of the PARAFAC model. In the experimental section, it is demonstrated that real room recordings of 3 speakers by 2 microphones can be separated using the method.

The conventional SEiNls, however, have such a drawback that they are very sensitive to Gaussian noise. To overcome this drawback, the robust super-exponential method (RSEM) were proposed for single-input single-output infinite impulse response (SISO-IIR) channels and for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) static channels (instantaneous mixtures). While the conventional SEMs use the second- and higher-order cumulants of observations, the RSEM uses only the higher-order cumulants of observations. Since higher-order cumulants are insensitive to Gaussian noise, the RSEM is robust to Gaussian noise. We proposed an RSEM extended to the case of MIMO-IIR channels (convolutive mixtures). To show the validity of the proposed RSEM, some simulation results are presented.

If the sources are not sparse in the time-domain. in most cases, they can be mapped to a transformed domain (e.g., wavelets, time-frequency, Fourier) in which this assumption is verified. In this paper, we are solely interested in the estimation of the mixing matrix. As observed by Zibulevski and coauthors. the data represented in the scatter plot of the observations tend to cluster along the mixing matrix columns. Each column can be seen as one of the principal components of the data in a higher (possibly infinite) dimension space, and these comp ponents can be estimated with a Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) based approach. The theoretical framework is derived, and excellent performance is observed both on synthetic and audio signals.

In contrast to conventional algorithms that separate the sources independently in each frequency bin, we assume that dependencies exist between frequency bins in a source signal. In this manner, we can reduce or eliminate the well-known frequency permutation problem. We derive the teaming algorithm by defining a cost function as an extension of mutual information between multivariate random variables and by introducing a Source prior that models the inherent frequency dependencies. This results in a simple form of a multivariate score function. In simulations and real recording experiments, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method and compare it against other well-known algorithms under various conditions. Our results indicate that modeling dependencies yields improved performance and robust scaling to higher number of sources and mixtures.

We present a simple and efficient on-line algorithm for such identification and illustrate its performance by estimation of unknown matrix A and source signals S. The main feature of the proposed algorithm is its adaptivity to changing environment and robustness in respect to noise and outliers that do not satisfy sparseness conditions.

In this paper, we propose to use the Huber M-estimator cost function as the contrast function within the FastICA algorithm of Hyvarinen and Oja. The algorithm obtained from this cost is particularly simple to implement. We establish key properties regarding the local stability of the algorithm for general non-Gaussian source distributions, and its separating capabilities are shown through analysis to be largely insensitive to the cost function's threshold parameter. Simulations comparing the performance of this algorithm to standard FastICA implementations are given.

We define and use a novel formulation of algorithmic solution that is an extension of the empirical risk minimization method in the sense that it uses a generic notion of side information as opposed to the commonly used input/output observation of a system. Sufficient conditions for consistency as well as closed form expressions for exponential convergence rate and sample complexity of the identification algorithm are derived.

Recent object detection algorithms have achieved impressive results by using graphical models, such as Markov Random Field. These models, however, have only been applied to two dimensional images. In many scenarios, video is the directly available source rather than images, hence an important information for detecting objects has been omitted - the temporal information. To demonstrate the importance of temporal information, we apply graphical models to the task of text detection in video and compare the result of with and without temporal information. We also show the superiority of the proposed models over simple heuristics such as median filter over time.

For a K-class problem, it performs K binary SVMs designed to separate a class from all the others. All SVMs are performed over the full database which is, however, a time-consuming task especially for large scale problems. To overcome this limitation, we propose a mixture scheme to speed-up the training of OAA. Thus, each binary problem is divided into a set of sub-problems trained by different SVM modules whose outputs are subsequently combined throughout a gating network. The proposed mixture scheme is based on Sugeno's fuzzy integral in which the gater is expressed by fuzzy measures. Experiments were conducted on two benchmark databases which concern Handwritten Digit Recognition (ODR) and Face Recognition (FR). The results indicate that the proposed scheme allows a significant training and testing time improvement. In addition, it can be easily implemented in parallel.

The search for such sparse components within a data set commonly involves a linear or nonlinear projection step in order to fulfill the sparseness constraints. In addition to the proximity measure used for the projection, the result of course is also intimately connected with the actual definition of the sparseness criterion. In this work, we introduce a novel sparseness measure and apply it to the problem of finding a sparse projection of a given signal. Here, sparseness is defined as the fixed ratio of p- over 2-norm, and existence and uniqueness of the projection holds. This framework extends previous work by Hoyer in the case of p = 1, where it is easy to give a deterministic, more or less closed-form solution. This is not possible for p not equal 1. so we introduce an algorithm based on alternating projections onto spheres (POSH), which is similar to the projection onto convex sets (POCS). Although the assumption of convexity does not hold in our setting, we observe not only convergence of the algorithm, but also convergence to the correct minimal distance solution. Indications for a proof of this surprising property are given. Simulations confirm these results.

As is the case for belief propagation in loopy factor graphs, it is not well understood why the stationary points of expectation propagation can yield good estimates. In this paper, given a reciprocity condition which holds in most cases,. C we provide a constrained maximum likelihood estimation problem whose critical points yield the stationary points of expectation propagation. Expectation propagation may then be interpreted as a nonlinear block Gauss Seidel method seeking a critical point of this optimization problem.

SVM are discriminant classifiers, but they cannot easily deal with the dynamic time structure of sounds, since they are constrained to work with fixed-length vectors. Several methods that adapt SVM to sequence processing have been reported in the literature. In this paper, they are reviewed and applied to the classification of 16 types of sounds from the meeting room environment. With our database, we have observed that the dynamic time warping kernels work well for sounds that show a temporal structure, but the best average score is obtained with the Fisher kernel.

Such patterns form N clusters on the (N - 1)-dimensional simplex. We are interested in reducing the number of clusters to N - 1 in order to redistribute the features assigned to a particular class in the N - 1 simplex over the remaining N - 1 classes in an optimal manner by using a self-organizing map.

For example, in a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) setting, a modeling assumption is typically made first (e.g., a full or a diagonal covariance matrix can be chosen) and then with this model the feature subset providing the best prediction performance is selected. If limited training data is available, then the number of parameters of a model that can be reliably estimated will also be limited. In the context of LIDA, model selection basically entails simplifying the covariance matrix by setting to zero some of this components. This leads to different block diagonal matrix structures (e.g., full / diagonal) which involve different sets of features and require different parameters to be estimated. In this paper we argue that LDA feature and parameter selection should be done jointly; and we propose a greedy algorithm for joint selection of features and of a block diagonal structure for the covariance matrix. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time such a joint design has been proposed in the context of LDA. The choice of a block diagonal structure is motivated by microarray classification problems, where we have a very large amount of features, i.e., genes, that are expected to be corregulated in small groups. Results obtained with artificial datasets show that the algorithm can flexibly choose an adequate covariance matrix structure according to the size of the training set and the generating distribution. Our results consistently outperform those achieved with other LDA based techniques.

We present a novel algorithm for analyzing a multiproduct environment and identifying strategically important combinations of offerings with respect to a predefined criterion, such as revenue impact, profit impact, inventory turnover etc. In contrast to the traditional association rule and frequent item mining techniques, the goal of the new algorithm is to find segments of data, defined through combinations of products (rules), which satisfy certain conditions as a group. We present a novel algorithm to derive specialized partition threes, called High Yield Partition Trees, which lead to such segments, and investigate different splitting strategies. The algorithm has been tested on real-world data, and achieved very good performance.

The proposed model can be efficiently applied for modeling images, image sequences, 3-D object models and higher dimensional applications, due to the composite structure of Markov chains which reduces the complexity while retaining good properties for multi-dimensional data. In case of 2-D lattices, the proposed model performs an elastic matching in both horizontal and vertical directions; this makes it possible to model not only invariances to the size and location of an object but also nonlinear warping in each dimension. We present a training algorithm for separable lattice HMMs based on a variational approximation. Moreover, the deterministic annealing EM (DAEM) algorithm was applied to the variational algorithm for separable lattice HMMs. Face recognition experiments on the XM2VTS database show that the proposed model has good properties for face image modeling.

The method uses a training-based static estimate obtained by an adaptive kernel density estimator as the input into a Kalman Filter. Predictions from the filter are used during the next iteration to adaptively select a subset of training data, contained in a radio map, for the static estimator. Experimental results show that the combination of the Kalman filter and the adaptive radio map technique results in nearly 0.5m (20%) improvement in Root Mean Square location accuracy when compared to static localization.

Next, we perform simultaneous tracking and recognition using an appearance-model based particle filter. The tracking result is evaluated at each frame. Low confidence in tracking,performance initiates a new cycle of detection, tracking and classification. We demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method using, outdoor IR video sequences.

Continuous HMM-based volcano monitoring at Deception Island, Antarctica	2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, Vol V, Proceedings: AUDIO AND ELECTROACOUSTICS, MULTIMEDIA SIGNAL PROCESSING, MACHINE LEARNING FOR SIGNAL PROCESSING SPECIAL SESSIONS	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)		English	Proceedings Paper	31st IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	MAY 14-19, 2006	Toulouse, FRANCE	IEEE Signal Proc Soc		Machine Learning for Signal Processing	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SIGNALS	This paper shows a complete volcano monitoring system that has been developed on the basis of the seismicity observed during three summer Antarctic surveys at Deception Island Volcano (Antarctica). The system is based on the state of the art in hidden Markov modelling (HMM) techniques successfully applied to other scenarios. A database containing a representative set of different seismic events including volcano-tectonic earthquakes, long-period events, volcanic tremor and hybrid events recorded during the 1994-1995 and 1995-1996 seismic surveys was collected for training and testing. Simple left-to-right HMMs and multivariate Gaussian probability density functions (PDF) with diagonal covariance matrix were used. The feature vector consists of the log-energies of a filter-bank consisting, of 16 triangular weighting functions uniformly spaced between 0 and 20 Hz plus the first and second order derivatives. The system is suitable to operate in real-time and its accuracy is close to 90%. When the system was tested with a different data set including mainly long-period events registered during several seismic swarms during the 2001-2002 field survey, more than 95% of the recognized events were correctly marked by the recognition system.

A Chernoff-based approach to the estimation of transformation matrices for binary hypothesis testing	2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, Vol V, Proceedings: AUDIO AND ELECTROACOUSTICS, MULTIMEDIA SIGNAL PROCESSING, MACHINE LEARNING FOR SIGNAL PROCESSING SPECIAL SESSIONS	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)		English	Proceedings Paper	31st IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	MAY 14-19, 2006	Toulouse, FRANCE	IEEE Signal Proc Soc		Machine Learning for Signal Processing	RECOGNITION	We present a new method for improving the classificacation score in the problem of binary hypothesis testing where the classes are modeled by a Gaussian mixture. We define a cost function which is based on the Chernoff distance and from it a transformation matrix is estimated that maximizes the separation between the classes. Once defined the cost function we derive an iterative method for which we give a simplified version where one mixture component per class is previously selected to participate in the estimation. The initialization of the method is studied and we give two possibilities for this. One is based on the Bhattacharyya distance and the other is based on the average divergence measure. The experiments are carried out over a database of speech with and without pathology and show that our approach represents an improvement in classification scores over other methods also based on matrix transformation.

Previously this model has been applied to audiovisual recognition tasks. The main drawback of the concept is its rather high training and decoding complexity. In this work we show how the complexity can be reduced significantly with advanced running indices for the calculations. Yet, the AHMM characteristics and its advantages are preserved. The improvement also allows a scaling procedure to keep numerical values in a reasonable range. In an experimental section we compare the complexity of the original and the improved concept and validate the theoretical results. Then the model is tested on a bimodal speech and gesture user input fusion task: Compared to a late fusion HMM an improvement of more than 10% absolute recognition performance has been achieved.

In these methods, the WM signal embedded through a secret key is assumed as uncorrelated with the host signal. This is a hard restriction that can never be achieved and correlation between the received signal and the secret key becomes greater than zero even though the received signal is un-watermarked. Mostly a decision threshold specified semiautomatically is used at the decoding site. Since the audio watermarking is a nonlinear process that guarantees the inaudibility, there is no analytic way of determining an optimal threshold value that makes the WM decoding problem harder. This paper introduces a learning scheme followed by a nonlinear classification thus eliminates the threshold specification problem. The decoding process is modelled as a three-class classification problem and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used in the learning of the embedded data. The decoding and detection performances of the developed system are greater than 98% and 95%, respectively. When the Watermark-to-Sigal-Ratio (WSR) is higher than -30dB, system false alarm ratios remain less than 2%. It is shown that the introduced WM decoding method is robust to additive noise and most of add/remove and filter attacks of Stirmark.

The SDF is a well known 2D correlation filter for object recognition. The proposed nonlinear version of the SDF is derived from kernel-based learning. The kernel SDF is implemented in a nonlinear high dimensional space by using the kernel trick and it can improve the performance of the linear SDF by incorporating the image's class higher order moments. We show that this kernelized composite correlation filter has an intrinsic connection with the recently proposed correntropy function. We apply this kernel SDF to face recognition and simulations show that the kernel SDF significantly outperforms the traditional SDF as well as is robust in noisy data environments.

Estimating the number of marine mammals using recordings of clicks from one microphone	2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, Vol V, Proceedings: AUDIO AND ELECTROACOUSTICS, MULTIMEDIA SIGNAL PROCESSING, MACHINE LEARNING FOR SIGNAL PROCESSING SPECIAL SESSIONS	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)		English	Proceedings Paper	31st IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	MAY 14-19, 2006	Toulouse, FRANCE	IEEE Signal Proc Soc		Machine Learning for Signal Processing; appications		An important but challenging task is to extract information on the location and/or number of marine mammals present given recordings from an array of hydrophones. Systems such as the Marine Mammal Monitoring on Navy Ranges (M3R) attempt to localize marine mammals as well as to get an estimate of their number using cross-correlation techniques on all available hydrophones. Our methodology offers the possibility to extract an estimate of the number of marine mammals given recordings from a single hydrophone, thus providing information to a researcher who does not have access to a larger array. The algorithm is based on three steps: detection of the clicks in the spectro-gram using their energy, extraction of meaningful features, such as cepstral coefficients that are descriptive of the detected calls, and, lastly, choosing the appropriate number of clusters when using spectral clustering through the maximization of a given metric. The chosen number of clusters that best represents the data is an estimate of marine mammals present in the area. Informal analysis of the clustered clicks from example recordings shows that they are a good fit of the data, although a formal evaluation would require additional ground-truth. The algorithm was performed on several hydrophones in order to obtain some cross-validation of our results. Finally, the clusters were tracked in time using KL divergence. This algorithm could provide a first approximation on the number of vocalizing marine mammals using only one hydrophone.

Fast incremental techniques for learning production rule probabilities in radar electronic support	2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, Vol V, Proceedings: AUDIO AND ELECTROACOUSTICS, MULTIMEDIA SIGNAL PROCESSING, MACHINE LEARNING FOR SIGNAL PROCESSING SPECIAL SESSIONS	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)		English	Proceedings Paper	31st IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	MAY 14-19, 2006	Toulouse, FRANCE	IEEE Signal Proc Soc		Machine Learning for Signal Processing		Although Stochastic Context-Free Grammars appear promising for recognition of radar emitters, and for estimation of their respective level of threat in Radar Electronic Support systems, well-known techniques for learning their production rule probabilities are computationally demanding. In this paper, three fast incremental alternatives, called Graphical EM (gEM), Tree Scanning (TS), and HOLA, are compared from several perspectives - perplexity, generalization error. time and space complexity, and convergence time. Estimation of the execution time and storage requirements allows for the assessment of complexity, while computer simulation using a radar pulse data set allows to asses the other performance measures. Results indicate that gEM and TS may provide a greater level of accuracy than HOLA. and that computational complexity may be orders of magnitude lower with HOLA. Furthermore, HOLA is an on-line technique that allows for incremental learning of probabilities to reflect changes in operational environments.

Unlike other previous approaches, we combine a sliding-window approach (to fix the dimensions of the kernel matrix) with conventional L2-norm regularization (to improve generalization). The proposed kernel RLS algorithm is applied to a nonlinear channel identification problem (specifically, a linear filter followed by a memoryless nonlinearity), which typically appears in satellite communications or digital magnetic recording systems. We show that the proposed algorithm is able to operate in a time-varying environment and tracks abrupt changes in either the linear filter or the nonlinearity.

Knowledge of the production and perception of speech has guided the design of many useful algorithms, and automatic speech recognition has been at the forefront of the machine learning paradigm. g In contrast to the advances made in automatic speech processing, analysis of other bioacoustic signals, such as those from dolphins and bats, has lagged behind. In this paper, we demonstrate how techniques from automatic speech processing can significantly impact bioacoustic analysis, using echolocating bats as our model animal. Compared to conventional techniques, machine learning methods reduced detection and species classification error rates by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio of an audible monitoring signal was improved by 12 dB using techniques from noise-robust feature extraction and speech synthesis. The work demonstrates the impact that speech research can have across disciplines.

It overcomes drawbacks found in applying music signals directly to the envelope spectrum detector developed for the estimation of RT from speech signals. The octave band music signal is first separated into sub bands corresponding to notes on the equal temperament scale and the level of each note normalised before applying an envelope spectrum detector. A typical artificial neural network is then trained to map these envelope spectra onto RT or EDT. Significant improvements in estimation accuracy were found and further investigations confirmed that the non-stationary nature of music envelopes is a major technical challenge hindering accurate parameter extraction from music and the proposed method to some extent circumvents the difficulty.

In this paper, we proposed a new NMF algorithm with temporal smoothness constraint that aims to extract non-negative components that have meaningful physical or physiological interpretations. We propose two constraints and derive new multiplicative learning rules. Specifically, we apply the proposed algorithm, combined with advanced time-frequency analysis and machine learning techniques, to early detection of Alzheimer disease using clinical EEG recordings.

The spatial information of multiple EEG channels data is first used to create independent classifiers for different channels. A subset of these classifiers is then selected by a genetic algorithm to form a multiple classifier system (MCS) to decide whether a trial is an intended control or a no control signal. The analysis of the data from 4 subjects shows the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the performance of an ABI system compared to the results obtained using only the best performing channel.

In recent years, approaches have been proposed to handle VO extraction directly as a classification problem. This type of methods calls for state-of-the-art classifiers because the extraction performance is directly related to the accuracy of classification. Promising results have been reported for single object extraction using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and its extensions such as psi-learning. Multiple object extraction, on the other hand, still imposes great difficulty as multi-category classification is an ongoing research topic in machine learning. This paper introduces the newly developed multi-category psi-learning as the multiclass classifier for multiple VO extraction, and demonstrates its effectiveness and advantages by experiments.

More sophisticated 3D recognition systems employ specialist equipment (e.g. laser scanners) to measure the shape of the face, and they perform either pattern matching in three dimensions or they use pro-jections from 3D models to match against 2D images. It is shown here that optical images obtained with a pair of stereo cameras may be used to extract depth information in the form of disparity values. and thereby significantly enhance the performance of a face recognition system.

Cepstral features of each driver obtained through spectral analysis of driving signals are modeled with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). A GMM driver model based on cepstral features is evaluated in driver identification experiments using driving signals collected in a driving simulator and in a real vehicle on a city road. Experimental results show that the driver model based on cepstral features achieves a driver identification rate of 89.6 % for driving simulator and 76.8% for real vehicle, resulting in 61% and 55% error reduction, respectively, over a conventional driver model that uses raw driving signals without spectral analysis.

A new data selection approach for semi-supervised acoustic modeling	2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, Vols 1-13	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)		English	Proceedings Paper	31st IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	MAY 14-19, 2006	Toulouse, FRANCE	IEEE Signal Proc Soc				Current approaches to semi-supervised incremental learning prefer to select unlabeled examples predicted with high confidence for model re-training. However, this strategy can degrade the classification performance rather than improve it. We present an analysis for the reasons of this phenomenon, showing that only relying on high confidence for data selection can lead to an erroneous estimate to the true distribution when the confidence annotator is highly correlated with the classifier in the information they use. We propose a new data selection approach to address this problem and apply it to a variety of applications, including machine learning and speech recognition. Encouraging improvements in recognition accuracy are observed in our experiments.

We propose a machine learning approach to improve prosodic structure parsing in cases where full syntax parsing is neglected due to considerations concerning practicality. The novel aspect of our approach is the new attribute in the input vector, which is named connective degree and calculated from the occurrence rate of the punctuation marks between Chinese characters by referring to a large text corpus. The results of experiments show that connective degree yield makes a remarkable contribution to parsing of hierarchical Mandarin prosodic structure.

AdaBoost is an excellent machine learning technique. Learning Gabor feature based classifier using AdaBoost is one of the best face recognition algorithms. However, dimensionality of Gabor feature space usually is very high, which makes the training program need huge memory or else take a very long time to run. In this paper, we propose a method which not only can solve the problem but also can improve recognition accuracy. Several subspaces with moderate size are randomly generated from original high dimensional Gabor feature space. Then strong classifier is trained in every random subspace [1] respectively and the outputs of multiple classifiers are combined in the final decision. Experimental results demonstrate that the method saves a great amount of training time, and achieves an exciting recognition rate of 97.91% on the FERET Fb test set.

Although this is not generally a problem for low-level processing, higher-level understanding, such as object detection, demands novel solutions because the available information may, in some cases, be very local, e.g., only a partial view of the object could fit in the available memory size. In this paper, we propose a novel hardware-oriented overlaid text detection algorithm that can detect text with height as large as five times the memory size. The algorithm integrates a connected component (CC)-based algorithm with a texture-based machine learning approach. The CC-based algorithm uses character-level features in the horizontal direction whereas the texture-based algorithm extracts block-based features to integrate information from all directions. Furthermore, the texture-based algorithm employs a support vector machine (SVM) to benefit from the strength of machine learning tools. In order to detect text of large font size, we also propose a novel hardware-oriented, height-preserving multi-resolution analysis. Finally, the results of the two classifiers as well as color and edge cues are used for the final pixel-based text/non-text decision.

It is based on a criterion that has recently emerged from the machine learning literature: the kernel-target alignment. This criterion makes possible to find the optimal representation for a given classification problem without designing the classifier itself. Some possible applications of our framework are discussed. The first one provides a computationally attractive way of adjusting the free parameters of a distribution to improve classification performance. The second one is related to the selection, from a set of candidates, of the distribution that best facilitates a classification task. The last one addresses the problem of optimally combining several distributions.	Sonalyse, F-30319 Ales, France	Honeine, P (reprint author), Sonalyse, 131 Impasse Palmiers, F-30319 Ales, France.

In contrast to the advances made in automatic speech processing, analysis of other bioacoustic signals, such as those from dolphins and bats, has lagged behind. In this paper, we demonstrate how techniques from automatic speech processing can significantly impact bioacoustic analysis, using echolocating bats as our model animal. Compared to conventional techniques, machine learning methods reduced detection and species classification error rates by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio of an audible monitoring signal was improved by 12 dB using techniques from noise-robust feature extraction and speech synthesis. The work demonstrates the impact that speech research can have across disciplines.

Room acoustic parameter extraction from music signals	2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, Vols 1-13	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)		English	Proceedings Paper	31st IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	MAY 14-19, 2006	Toulouse, FRANCE	IEEE Signal Proc Soc				A new method, employing machine learning techniques and a modified low frequency envelope spectrum estimator, for estimating important room acoustic parameters including Reverberation Time (RT) and Early Decay Time (EDT) from received music signals has been developed. It overcomes drawbacks found in applying music signals directly to the envelope spectrum detector developed for the estimation of RT from speech signals. The octave band music signal is first separated into sub bands corresponding to notes on the equal temperament scale and the level of each note normalised before applying an envelope spectrum detector. A typical artificial neural network is then trained to map these envelope spectra onto RT or EDT. Significant improvements in estimation accuracy were found and further investigations confirmed that the non-stationary nature of music envelopes is a major technical challenge hindering accurate parameter extraction from music and the proposed method to some extent circumvents the difficulty.

Constrained non-negative matrix factorization method for EEG analysis in early detection of Alzheimer disease	2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, Vols 1-13	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)		English	Proceedings Paper	31st IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	MAY 14-19, 2006	Toulouse, FRANCE	IEEE Signal Proc Soc				Approximate non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is an emerging technique with a wide spectrum of potential applications in biomedical data analysis. In this paper, we proposed a new NMF algorithm with temporal smoothness constraint that aims to extract non-negative components that have meaningful physical or physiological interpretations. We propose two constraints and derive new multiplicative learning rules. Specifically, we apply the proposed algorithm, combined with advanced time-frequency analysis and machine learning techniques, to early detection of Alzheimer disease using clinical EEG recordings. Empirical results show promising performance.

In recent years, approaches have been proposed to handle VO extraction directly as a classification problem. This type of methods calls for state-of-the-art classifiers because the extraction performance is directly related to the accuracy of classification. Promising results have been reported for single object extraction using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and its extensions such as psi-learning. Multiple object extraction, on the other hand, still imposes great difficulty as multi-category classification is an ongoing research topic in machine learning. This paper introduces the newly developed multi-category psi-learning as the multiclass classifier for multiple VO extraction, and demonstrates its effectiveness and advantages by experiments.

In addition, it is assumed that the underlying task evolves in a repetitive, episodic manner, with each episode starting from a well-defined initial state and evolving over an acyclic state space. A novel efficient algorithm for this problem is proposed, and its convergence properties and computational complexity are rigorously characterized in the formal framework of computational learning theory.

RvC initially automatically discretizes the number of defects into a number of fault classes, then learns a model that predicts the fault class of a software system. Finally, RvC transforms the class output of the model back into a numeric prediction. This approach includes uncertainty in the models because apart from a certain number of faults, it also outputs an associated interval of values, within which this estimate lies, with a certain confidence. To evaluate this approach we perform a comparative experimental study of the effectiveness of several machine learning algorithms in a software dataset. The data was collected by Pekka Forselious and involves applications maintained by a bank of Finland.

This keynote paper will address both modelling and control of such systems and will consist of the following aspects: 1) Neural network based modelling of the stochastic distribution systems; 2) Control framework for the stochastic profile control of the systems; 3) Iterative learning of the space variables so as to achieve a batch-by-batch improvement of the closed loop performance. The above will include our originated research on complex stochastic systems in terms of probability density function (pdfs) control, where neural networks such as RBF will be used to approximate the output pdfs and the system dynamics. This will be followed by the iterative machine learning for the RBF basis functions on a batch-by-batch basis so as to improve the closed loop performance both in the time and in the space.

A predictor function is used to estimate the human user's score, thus reducing the amount of effort required by the human user during the evolution process. The fuzzy system and four machine learning classifier algorithms are presented. Their performance in a real-world application, the IEC-based design of a micromachine resonating mass, is evaluated. The fuzzy system was composed of four simple rules, but was able to accurately predict the user's score 77% of the time on average. This is equivalent to a 51% reduction of human effort compared to using EEC without the predictor. The four machine learning approaches tested were k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, Adaboosted decision tree, and support vector machines. These approaches achieved good accuracy on validation tests, but because of the great diversity in user scoring behavior, were unable to achieve equivalent results on the user test data.

A central question when applying a kernel-based method is the choice and the design of the kernel function. This paper provides a novel view on kernels based on fuzzy logical concepts that allows to incorporate prior knowledge in the design process. It is demonstrated that kernels that map to the unit interval and have constantly I in their diagonals can be represented by a commonly used fuzzy-logical formula for representing fuzzy relations. This means that a large and important class of kernels can be represented by fuzzy logical concepts. Beside this result which only guarantees the existence of such a representation, constructive examples are presented.

Control of predictive accuracy is achieved by allowing hedged predictions, with the possible sacrifice of precision. We use the Support Vector Machine learning algorithm to derive a decision rule for the classification of childhood acute leukaemia subtypes from a small training set of gene expression data. We then implement a Confidence Machine for the decision rule and test on an independent data set to demonstrate its error calibration properties. We show that the Confidence Machine can be used to derive reliable predictions, with control of the risk of error whilst maintaining the level of accuracy given by the Support Vector Machine, yielding useful and precise predictions of leukaemia subtypes. Predictions are reliable even in the context of training from small sample size.

However, a lot of practical problems require nonnegativity constraints. For example, pixels in digital images, term frequencies in text mining, and chemical concentrations in bioinformatics should be nonnegative. In this paper, we propose discriminant analysis using nonnegative matrix factorization (DA/NMF), which is a multiclass classifier that generates nonnegative basis vectors. It does not require any parameter optimization and it is intrinsically appropriate for multiclass classifications. It also provides us with the reliability of classification. DA/NMF can be considered as a novel nonnegative dimension reduction algorithm for supervised machine learning problems since it generates nonnegative low-rank representations as well as nonnegative basis vectors. In addition, it can be thought of as nonnegative LDA or the supervised version of NMF.

In order to solve this challenging class imbalance problem, a novel Granular Support Vector Machines - Repetitive Undersampling algorithm (GSVM-RU) is designed in this work. GSVM-RU creatively utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) themselves for undersampling to minimize the negative effect of information loss while maximizing the positive effect of data cleaning in the undersampling process. Consequently, an accurate and fast classifier can be modeled. GSVM-RU ranks as one of the best solutions in ACM KDDCUP 2004 competition for the extremely imbalanced protein homology prediction.

In fact, null data must be eliminated from major databases because it often causes bad effects on the quality of data mining processing. In this paper, we introduce a new point of view: null data processing can also be used in a recognition system to identify strange objects. Our work involves three operations - 'toNull', 'deNull' and 'fixNull' along with Data Fusion technique and a rule-based production inference algorithm. This process has been applied to our designed software called Machine Learning Anti-virus System (MAV) in security scope. The results from the experiment showed that the MAV-operated algorithm has the same performance as other anti-virus software whose algorithms require bigger viruses signature database.

Many IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) suffer from a high rate of false alarms and missed intrusions. We want to be able to improve the intrusion detection rate at a reduced false positive rate. The focus of this paper is rule-learning, using RIPPER, on highly imbalanced intrusion datasets with an objective to improve the true positive rate (intrusions) without significantly increasing the false positives. We use RIPPER as the underlying rule classifier. To counter imbalance in data, we implement a combination of oversampling (both by replication and synthetic generation) and undersampling techniques. We also propose a clustering based methodology for oversampling by generating synthetic instances. We evaluate our approaches on two intrusion datasets - destination and actual packets based - constructed from actual Notre Dame traffic, giving a flavor of real-world data with its idiosyncrasies. Using ROC analysis, we show that oversampling by synthetic generation of minority (intrusion) class outperforms oversampling by replication and RIPPER's loss ratio method. Additionally, we establish that our clustering based approach is more suitable for the detecting intrusions and is able to provide additional improvement over just synthetic generation of instances.

Applied to SFA, it leads to KSFA, a powerful new technique for the analysis of datasets with essential nonlinearities underlying their structures. For computational efficiency in the analysis of large datasets, we combine weak KSFA classifiers with multi-class boosting techniques.

To enable the solution of these problems the solution's search space has to be constrained. The question that arises is how to select/parameterize these constraints? In this paper several model selection criteria are extended for spectral data estimation and evaluated in the context of spectral sensitivity function estimation of CCD sensors.

However due to the presence of scanning noise, accumulative registration errors, and improper data fusion, the reconstructed surfaces from multiple registered range images captured from different viewpoints are often distorted with thick patches, false connections and blurred features. Moreover, the existing integration methods are often expensive in the sense of computational time and data storage. These shortcomings will hinder the wide applications of 3D modelling using the latest laser scanning systems. In this paper, the kappa-means clustering approach from the pattern recognition and machine learning literatures is employed to optimally fuse the overlapping areas between two range images captured from two neighbouring viewpoints and to iteratively minimize the integration error. The final fused point set is then triangulated using an improved Delaunay method, guaranteeing a watertight surface. The new method is theoretically guaranteed to converge. A comparative study based on real images shows that the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and significantly reduces the integration error, while desirably retaining geometric details of object surface.

First, we demonstrate that news shot sequences can be characterized by rhythms of alternation (due to dialogue), repetition (due to persistent background settings), or both. Thus a temporal model is necessarily third-order Markov. Second, we demonstrate that the output of feature detectors derived from machine learning methods (in particular, from SVMs) can be converted. into probabilities in a more effective way than two suggested existing methods. This is particularly true when detectors are errorful due to sparse training sets, as is common in this domain. Third, we demonstrate that a straightforward application of the Viterbi algorithm on a third-order FSM, constructed from observed transition probabilities and converted feature detector outputs, can refine feature label precision at little cost. We show that on a test corpus of TREC-VID 2005 news videos annotated with 39 LSCOM-lite features, the mean increase in the measure of Average Precision (AP) was 4%, with some of the rarer and more difficult features having relative increases in AP of as much as 67%.

It has become a well-known theory that the high-level semantics in sport video can be "computationally interpreted" based on the occurrences of specific audio and visual features which can be extracted automatically. State-of-the-art solutions for features-based event classification have only relied on either manual-knowledge based heuristics or machine learning. To bridge the gaps, we have successfully combined the two approaches by using learning-based heuristics. The heuristics are constructed automatically using decision tree while manual supervision is only required to check the features and highlight contained in each training segment. Thus, fully automated construction of classification system for sports video events has been achieved. A comprehensive experiment on 10 hours video dataset, with five full-match soccer and five full-match basketball videos, has demonstrated the effectiveness/robustness of our algorithms.

A computer program that can infer human activities from physiological recordings will be an valuable tool for physicians. In this paper we investigate to what extent current machine learning algorithms can correctly identify human activities from physiological sensors. We further identify two challenges that developers need to address. The first problem is that the labels of training data are inevitably noisy due to difficulties of annotating thousands hours of data. The second problem lies in the continuous nature of human activities, which violates the independence assumption made by many learning algorithms. We approach the first problem of noisy labeling in the multiple-label framework, and develop a conditional Markov Models to take temporal context into consideration. We evaluate the proposed methods on 12,000 hours of the physiological recordings. The results show that Support Vector Machines are effective to identify human activities from physiological signals, and efforts of disambiguating noisy labels are worthwhile.

Similar to traditional tandem-free solutions, PASS introduces a limit on the number of concurrent speakers in a conference. But in contrast to traditional solutions, PASS silence suppression and speaker selection are completely distributed, running on each client. No speaker selection is performed at the bridge at all. This configuration leads to better scalability, lower bandwidth occupation and jitter buffer delay, and higher compatibility with a wide variety of network topologies. The key component of PASS, distributed silence suppression and speaker selection, is realized through a robust approach proposed in this paper. Based on a voice activity measure derived using machine learning techniques, this approach is able to reliably suppress silence in complex environments, and perform accurate and transparent speaker selection as well.

Semi-automation is achieved through treating cell microinjection as a computer game. In this first phase, cell manipulation and microinjection is carried out using a joystick and an interactive graphical user interface (GUI). For this system to be developed further, to achieve full automation, this first phase had to succeed. The interactive GUI records and displays: real-time video images of the cells; processed images of cells; and the microinjection strategies adopted by operators during cell manipulation through a real-time video processing algorithm.

ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT; HUMAN JOINT KINEMATICS; HELICAL AXIS; ACCURACY; RECOGNITION; LANDMARK	We address the problem of knee pathology assessment by using screw theory to describe the knee motion and by using the screw representation of the motion as an input to a machine learning classifier. The flexions of knees with different pathologies are tracked using an optical tracking system. The screw parameters which describe the transformation of the tibia with respect to the femur in each two successive observation are represented as the instantaneous screw axis of the motion given in its Plucker line coordinate, along with its corresponding pitch. The set of screw parameters associated with a particular knee with a given pathology is then identified and clustered in R(6) to form a "signature" of the motion for the given pathology. Bone model and two cadaver knees with different pathologies were tracked, and the resulting screws were used to train a classifier system. The system was then tested successfully with new, never trained before data. The classifier demonstrated a very high success rate in identifying the knee pathology.

The imitation process is done by a self organizing neural network module. From several demonstrations of task operation, a vision system captures movement of the demonstrator mobile robot and associated objects in an operation field. Then, the movement features are extracted to present to an imitation engine. Finally, skill or decision policy from teacher's demonstration is extracted and embedded into a self organizing neural network without explicit external supervisory signals. A simple action selection algorithm for choosing action from learned network is proposed. The algorithm was implemented and tested on a simulated robot and a real mobile robot to imitate two simple robot soccer behaviors: approaching the target and obstacle avoidance. Furthermore, the concept of similarity measure is introduced to evaluate imitation performance from the demonstrator.

By using the perspective projection model, a series of multi-resolution image cells are generated to make better density estimation in the crowded scene. The cell size is normalized to obtain a uniform representation of texture features. In order to diminish the instability of texture feature measurements, a technique of searching the extrema in the Harris-Laplacian space is also applied. The texture feature vectors are extracted from each input image cell and the support vector machine (SVM) method is utilized to solve the regression problem of calculating the crowd density. Finally, based on the estimated density vectors, the SVM method is used again to solve the classification problem of detecting abnormal density distribution. Experiments on real crowd videos show the effectiveness of the proposed system.

In this paper we present an intelligent vehicle security system for handling the vehicle theft problem under the framework of modeling dynamic human behaviors. We propose to recognize the drivers through their driving performances and hope this can help reduce the number of car thefts significantly. Firstly we describe our experimental system-a real time graphic driving simulator-for collecting and modeling human driving behaviors. Using the proposed machine learning method hidden Markov model (HMM), the individual driving behavior model is derived and then we demonstrate the procedure for recognizing different drivers through analyzing the corresponding models. Then we define performance measures for evaluating our resultant learning models using a hidden-Markov-model-(HMM)-based similarity measure, which helps us to derive the similarity of individual behavior and corresponding model. The experimental results of learning algorithms and evaluations are described and finally verify that the proposed method is valid and useful against the vehicle thefts problem.

This redundancy manifests itself in the number of degrees of freedom of the robot exceeding the dimensionality of the task. Traditionally this redundancy has been utilised through optimal control in the null-space. Some cost function is defined that encodes secondary movement goals and movements are optimised with respect to this function, subject to fulfilment of task constraints. Until now design of cost functions has been carried out on an ad-hoc basis and has required time-consuming hand-tuning to ensure that the desired (or acceptable) behaviour is realised. Here we present a novel approach for designing cost functions for optimal control in the null-space by exploiting recent advances in statistical machine learning. The behaviour of a (kinematically or dynamically controlled) mechanical system performing some task is observed and separated into task- and null-space components. The null-space component is then modelled as a first order differential equation with the cost as the independent variable. Numerical solution of this equation provides training data for a statistical learning algorithm that is used to build an open-form model of the cost function. Results are presented in which the reconstructed function is used to replace that of the original control scheme and the resultant behaviour, for the same set of tasks, is compared.

It explicitly recognizes future decisions, and the exercise strategy is based on the optimal decisions in future periods. The real options approach has been applied to many economic and financial problems, but few are in computer science and engineering. The novelty of this work lies in applying real options to a computational problem. This paper proposes using the real options technique to find an optimal stopping decision for the compact genetic algorithm. The compact genetic algorithm, a kind of genetic algorithms, represents the population as a probability distribution over a set of solutions. This distribution automatically captures the underlying uncertainty of the problem, which can be simulated to obtain an evolutionary process of the algorithm. The experiments show preliminary results of employing the real options approach to determine the optimal stopping time for the compact genetic algorithm. The proposed technique can be applied to analyze other machine-learning algorithms, such as neural networks or other variations of genetic algorithms.

Web filtering based on content has become one of the important techniques to handle and filter inappropriate information on the web. We examine two machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes) for pornographic web filtering based on text content. We then focus initially on Thai-language and English-language web sites. In this paper, we aim to investigate whether machine learning algorithms are suitable for web sites classification. The empirical results show that the classifier based Support Vector Machines are more effective for pornographic web filtering than Naive Bayes classifier after testing, especially an effectiveness for the over-blocking problem.

The human brain, a significant intelligent system, works with a huge number of spiking neurons. Based on spiking neuron models a new generation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) has been developed for artificial intelligence systems. SNNs are computationally more powerful than conventional artificial neural networks. In this paper, the spiking neuron model is applied to represent logic rules and fuzzy rules. Based on the STDP (Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity) principle, a new SNN model is proposed for pattern recognition. An efficient learning rule derived from the STDP is applied for self-organizing the input training set efficiently. An example, Animal-Growth-Record, is used to explain the principle of the SNN model. Benchmark data sets are applied to compare the proposed approach with other approaches. As there are very efficient learning rules in the SNN model, the model can be applied not only for fusion of multi-sensory data, but also for data mining in large databases with large numbers of attributes.

Nevertheless, different problems may require different network architectures and parameters. Therefore, rule of thumb or "try and error" methods are usually used to determine them. However, these methods may lead worse network architectures and parameters. A dataset may contain many features; however, not all features are beneficial for classification in BPN. Therefore, a simulated annealing (SA) approach is proposed to select the beneficial subset of features and to obtain the better network architectures and parameters which result in a better classification. In order to verify the developed approach, three dataset, namely PIMA, IONOS, and CANCER from UCI (University of California, Irvine) machine learning database, are employed for evaluation, and the 10-fold cross-validation is applied to calculate the classification result. Compared with the MONNA (Multiple ordinate neural network architecture) structure developed by Leazoray and Cardot, the classification accurate rates of the developed approach are superior to those of the MONNA. When the feature selection is taken into consideration the classification accurate rates of three dataset are increased. Therefore, the developed approach can be utilized to find out the network architecture and parameters of BPN, and discover the useful attributes effectively.

The advent of network-based distributed computing environments has made it possible to handle this problem up to some level. Today, mostly centralized algorithms are being used for data modeling and knowledge discovery, which are based on statistical and machine learning algorithms. Many of these algorithms require collection of data from distributed sites. Although, it is possible to store a huge amount of data in some data storages, these data are only useful if the analysts can extract beneficial information in form of patterns or rules. This problem is covered by techniques from the area of Knowledge Discovery in Databases. The KDD process is the non-trivial process of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in data [1]. The process includes several steps, which are invoked and parameterized in an interactive and iterative manner. Existing knowledge discovery and machine learning algorithms are based on a rule-set or a rule-base, sometimes this rule information is expanded as the time passes and algorithm processes more data. However, this expansion process is limited because of the variety of the knowledge and initial status of the implementation. In this project, we have implemented a distributed knowledge discovery software called as, Di-Learn, offering a new approach. to this problem: human interaction.

We propose a machine learning method based on data mining for finding the best data path for certain exam types. Attribute relevance analysis helps us identify weakly relevant image parameters. The searching of frequent itemsets using Apriori algorithm offers the best combination of image functions and their associated parameters. A commercially available ultrasound scanner was modified for our data collection, algorithmic verification, and analysis. Test results show that our proposed data mining methods may help manufacturers identify the most useful clinical image functions and help doctors choose right parameters as default settings that increase patient's throughput.

Until now, in the most medical researches, the reasons for suffering from breast tumor are unclear. However, most medical researches proved that DNA viruses are the high-risk factors closely related to human cancers. In recent years, hospitals and health organizations have been furnished with modern computerized medical equipment for data collection, monitoring and diagnosis. Additionally, these data are stored in large medical information systems for analysis purpose. Developing truthful and reliable classifiers for diagnosis and prognosis has become an essential task in medical and healthcare. It was reported with increasing confirmation that the machine learning algorithms can generate more accurate and transparent classifiers and decision rules for physicians than traditional methodologies. In the machine learning algorithms, decision trees have been already successfully used in the areas of medicine and healthcare. In this paper, an algorithm of decision trees, Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID), is applied to build a classifier for predicting breast cancer and fibroadenoma. The results demonstrate that the decision tree technique is more favorably than logistic regression in terms of rule accuracy and knowledge transparency to physicians. Furthermore, the medical classifier can assist inexperienced physicians to prevent from misdiagnosis.

In this paper, we propose a cluster-based sampling approach for selecting the representative data as training data to improve the classification accuracy and investigate the effect of under-sampling methods in the imbalanced class distribution problem. In the experiments, we evaluate the performances for our cluster-based sampling approach and the other sampling methods in the previous studies.

To ensure realistic synthesis, the model must be learned to fit the real distribution of human motion. Usually the fitness is measured by likelihood. In this paper, we present a new HMM learning algorithm, which incorporates stochastic optimization technique within the Expectation-Maximization (EM) learning framework. This algorithm is less prone to be trapped in local optimal and converges faster than traditional Baum-Welch learning algorithm. We apply the new algorithm to learning 3D motion under control of a style variable, which encodes the mood or personality of the performer. Given new style value, motions with corresponding style can be generated from the learned model.

Most methods of texture classification, for the identification of different texture surfaces, are based on wavelet features, MRF models, STFT features, and geometric shape of texels and PCA analysis. Kernel Fisher discriminant (KFD) is a state-of-the-art nonlinear machine learning method, and it has great potential to identify image texture. Meanwhile, Texture analysis is also an important technique of SAR image classification. In this paper, a nonlinear discriminative texture feature extraction method based on kernel Fisher discriminant (KFD) is proposed for SAR image texture classification.

A hardware architecture for color image enhancement using a machine learning approach with adaptive parameterization	2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORK PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-10	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network	JUL 16-21, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE				A novel architecture for performing color image enhancement using a machine learning algorithm called Ratio Rule is proposed in this paper. The threshold width of the activation function is automatically determined from the image characteristics. The approach promotes log-domain computation to eliminate all multiplications and divisions, utilizing approximation techniques for efficient estimation of the log(2) and inverse-log(2). The design incorporates the dynamic thresholds of the activation functions and update rate. The improved quadrant symmetric architecture is also presented to provide very high throughput rate for homomorphic fitters which is part of the pixel intensity enhancement across RGB components in the system. The pipelined design of the filter features the flexibility in reloading a wide range of kernels for different frequency responses. A new approach for the design of the uniform filters is also presented to reduce the processing element arrays (PEAs) from W PEAs to 2 PEAs for W x W window. This new concept is applied to assist in training the synaptic weights of the neural network for color balancing to restore the intensity enhanced image to its natural color existed in the original image. The concept of uniform filter is further extended to design max/min filters. It is observed that the performance of the system with parallel and. pipelined architectures is able to achieve 139.3 million outputs per second (MOPS), or equivalently 54.7 billion operations per second on Xilinx's Virtex II XC2V2000-4ff896 FPGA at a clock frequency of 139.3 MHz.

Aggregation of reinforcement learning algorithms	2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORK PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-10	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network	JUL 16-21, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE			COMBINATION; CLASSIFIERS; FUSION	Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning method that can learn an optimal strategy for a system without knowing the mathematical model of the system. Many RL algorithms are successfully applied in various fields. However, each algorithm has its advantages and disadvantages. With the increasing complexity of environments and tasks, it is difficult for a single learning algorithm to cope with complicated learning problems with high performance. This motivated us to combine some learning algorithms to improve the learning quality. This paper proposes a new multiple learning architecture, "Aggregated Multiple Reinforcement Learning System (AMRLS)". AMRLS adopts three different learning algorithms to learn individually and then combines their results with aggregation methods. To evaluate its performance, AMRLS is tested on two different environments: a Cart-pole System and a Maze environment. The presented simulation results reveal that aggregation not only provides robustness and fault tolerance ability, but also produces more smooth learning curves and needs fewer learning steps than individual learning algorithms.

Stability and commitment are characteristics of human teamwork but must not prevent the detection of better opportunities. In addition, coordination proxy agents must be trained from examples as a single agent but must interact with multiple agents. We apply machine learning techniques to the task of learning team preferences from mixed-initiative interactions and compare the outcome results of different simulated user patterns. This paper introduces a novel approach for the adjustable autonomy of coordination proxies based on the reinforcement learning of abstract actions.

However, since its training time complexity is cubic, its use is limited in data mining involving problems with a huge pattern set with a cubic time complexity of its training time. In this paper, we propose a pattern selection method for Support Vector Regression (SVR), using notions of sparseness, variability and uniqueness. Two versions of algorithms, deterministic and stochastic, are presented, which are then applied to an artificial data set and two well known real world data sets. Preliminary results justify further investigation. The proposed method should work well with non-SVM function approximators such as neural networks.

However, such directories are generally constructed manually and have disadvantages of narrow coverage and inconsistency. In this work, we propose NaviSOM, a machine learning approach to automatically construct a navigational structure for the WWW. A self-organizing map is constructed to train the web pages and obtain two feature maps, which reveal the relationships among web pages and thematic keywords respectively. We then use these maps to develop a structure that may assist the users finding the information they need. We used a small set of web pages in the experiments and obtained promising result.

SVM was originally developed for pattern classification and later extended to regression. One of main features of SVM is that it generalizes the maximal margin linear classifiers into high dimensional feature spaces through nonlinear mappings defined implicitly by kernels in the Hilbert space so that it may produce nonlinear classifiers in the original data space. On the other hand, the authors developed a family of various SVMs using multi-objective programming and goal programming (MOP/GP) techniques. This paper extends the family of SVM for classification to regression, and discusses their performance through numerical experiments.

Spatial SVM for feature selection and fMRI activation detection	2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORK PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-10	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network	JUL 16-21, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE			BALLOON MODEL; PATTERNS	This paper describes application of Support Vector Machines (SVM) methodology for fMRI activation detection. Whereas SVM methods have been successfully used for standard predictive learning settings (i.e., classification and regression), the goal of activation detection, strictly speaking, is not achieving improved prediction accuracy. We relate the problem of activation detection in fMRI to the problem feature selection in machine learning, and describe various multivariate supervised-learning formulations for this application. Due to extreme ill-posedness of typical fMRI data sets, the quality of activation detection will be greatly affected by (a) incorporating a priori knowledge into SVM formulations, and (b) using proper encoding for training data. We analyze these issues separately, and introduce (a) novel spatial SVM formulation (reflecting a priori knowledge about local spatial correlations in fMRI data) and (b) two new encoding schemes for fMRI data that incorporate the effects of the brain dynamics (i.e., its Hemodynamic Response Function, or HRF). The effectiveness of these modifications is clearly demonstrated using benchmark simulated and real-life fMRI data sets.

Performance prediction challenge	2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORK PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-10	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network	JUL 16-21, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE				A major challenge for machine learning algorithms in real world applications is to predict their performance. We have approached this question by organizing a challenge in performance prediction for WCCI 2006. The class of problems addressed are classification problems encountered in pattern recognition (classification of images, speech recognition), medical diagnosis, marketing (customer categorization), text categorization (filtering of spam). Over 100 participants have been trying to build the best possible classifier from training data and guess their generalization error on a large unlabeled test set. The challenge scores indicate that cross-validation yields good results both for model selection and performance prediction. Alternative model selection strategies were also sometimes employed with success. The challenge web site keeps open for post-challenge submissions: http://www.modelselecLinf.ethz.ch/.

While cross validation is a commonly employed and widely accepted method for selecting these parameters, its implementation by a grid-search procedure in the parameter space effectively limits the desirable number of hyper-parameters in a model, due to the combinatorial explosion of grid points in high dimensions. This paper proposes a novel bilevel optimization approach to cross validation that provides a systematic search of the hyper-parameters. The bilevel approach enables the use of the state-of-the-art optimization methods and their well-supported softwares. After introducing the bilevel programming approach, we discuss computational methods for solving a bilevel cross-validation program, and present numerical results to substantiate the viability of this novel approach as a promising computational tool for model selection in machine learning.

This article reports a study aimed at providing effective solutions to these two challenges. For handling unbalanced datasets, we proposed that a different value of the cost parameter in Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed for each class of samples. For handling high-dimensional datasets, we resorted to Independent Components Analysis (ICA), which is a multivariate analysis algorithm, along with the conventional univariate analysis. Experimental results confirmed that the proposed approaches all together significantly improved the prediction accuracy delivered by SVM.

Resistance testing is an important factor in the continued success of viral therapy. We found that through combining a structural based computational docking method and a classic machine learning technique we could create a consensus system capable of improving the prediction accuracy by 5.56% over either method used individually. The result was the creation of a genotypic resistance testing approach capable of classifying a wider cross-section of strains, hence making it a more accurate resistance testing method.

In this context, an important regulatory mechanisms are the promoters regions, which promote the initialization of the gene expression process. In this paper, we present an empirical comparison of machine learning techniques such as Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks to the task of promoter prediction. In order to do so, we first build a hybrid dataset of promoter and nonpromoter sequences for six different species of Bacillus: subtilis, liqueniformis, cereus, megaterium, thurigiensis, and firmus.

An automated and adaptive defensive tool is imperative for computer networks. One of the emerging solutions for Network Security is the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). However, this technology still faces some challenges such as low detection rates, high false alarm rates and requirement of heavy computational power. To overcome these difficulties, this paper proposes an innovative Machine Learning algorithm called Boosted Modified Probabilistic Neural Network (BMPNN) which utilizes semi-parametric learning model and Adaptive boosting techniques to reduce learning bias and generalization variance in difficult classification. In this paper, BMPNN is implemented as a classifier to detect different types of network anomalies in the KDD-99 benchmark. Extensive experimental outcome indicates that the proposed BMPNN outperforms other state-of-the-art learning algorithms in terms of detection accuracy and model robustness at an affordable computational cost.

We propose the online skin tone sampling mechanism based on face detection. The object detection based on machine learning approach is used to locate the face region in the target image. According to the face color information, the skin chromatic distribution is extracted to detect the skin objects in the target image. The texture feature, coarseness, is also utilized to acquire the more accurate skin regions. Then, the back propagation neural network is used to integrate several low-level and reliable geometrical constraints into a classifier to inspect the skin regions further. Finally, the mug shot exclusion procedure is applied to promote the system performance. The experimental results show our method is satisfactory for adult image detection.

Any sensor that is designed to detect a certain physical variable is influenced to a certain degree by other physical variables. This suggests that any sensor is potentially capable of detecting multiple physical variables. In the present study, we consider sensing devices that are easily influenced by several physical variables and make full use of their multi-sensing characteristics through statistical signal processing and machine learning techniques with a wide variety of prior information. The proposed sensor design approach is completely different from the conventional approach with respect to system design and has advantages in terms of cost and system simplification compared to existing approaches. This new idea can be realized by developing a novel multiple-input/single-output sensor that can detect various variables such as pressure, acceleration, temperature and light emission by a single device. The sensor is applied to monitor the symptoms of fire, earthquake and break-in for the purpose of home security. The proposed security system consists of the following three steps: (1) Detection of disaster by a probabilistic outlier detection procedure using an auto-regressive model, (2) Disaster feature extraction by Kaiman filter on a state space model, and (3) Disaster classification by multiclass support vector machine.

We first analyze the relationship between values assigned to the hyperparameters, the on-line learning process, and the structure of the resulting classifier. Motivated by the results we then suggest an annealing method, where each hyperparameter is initially set to a large value and is then slowly decreased during learning. We apply the annealing method to the LVQ 2.1, SLVQ-LR, and RSLVQ methods, and we compare the generalization performance achieved with the new annealing method and with a standard hyperparameter selection using 10-fold cross validation. Benchmark results are provided for the datasets letter and pendigits from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The new selection method provides equally good or - for some data sets - even superior results when compared to standard selection methods. More importantly, however, the number of learning trials for different values of the hyperparameters is drastically reduced. The results are insensitive to the form and parameters of the annealing schedule.

From a more general point of view, catastrophic forgetting reflects the stability-plasticity dilemma, which is one of the several dilemmas to be addressed in learning systems: to retain the stored memory while learning new information. Different to the existing approaches, we introduce a Pareto-optimality based multi-objective learning framework for alleviating catastrophic learning.

In an increasingly globalized economy, bankruptcy results both in huge economic losses and tremendous social impact. While early prediction for a bankruptcy, if done appropriately, is of great importance to banks, insurance firms, creditors, and investors, the need of substantially more accurately predicting models becomes crucial. This problem has been approached by various methods ranging from statistics to machine learning, however they find a class decision estimate rather than a probabilistic confidence of the class distribution. In this paper we show that sparse Bayesian models also known as Relevance Vector Machine (RVMs) are superior to the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) therefore leading to predictors of choice. The advantage of RVM approach is that the classifier can yield a decision function that is much sparser than the SVM while maintaining its detection accuracy. This can lead to significant reduction in the computational complexity of the decision function, thereby making it more suitable for realtime applications. Preliminary experiments on Coface Data set (French credit risk provider) show that RVM classifiers outperform SVM, lead to more sparse and accurate prediction models.

The unknown signals are compared against known templates and their frequencies are recognized by simply comparing the biggest coefficients of their CCA coefficient vectors. This strategy is straightforward but may not give optimal results. To boost the accuracy of recognition we reformulate the approach in views of machine learning. In this paper, we propose a new strategy based on supervised learning. We also employ feature selection within this framework to adopt efficient coefficients which may not be the largest coefficients for the features vectors. The recognition method is validated by results with real world data.

Using parameters from a reaching and grasping task we create a representative three-dimensional motion. From this motion we extract features from the joint angle space. We believe that the physiological importance of these features makes them worth investigating as possible movemes. Machine learning techniques are employed to cluster similar features. The clusters are then used to recursively reconstruct the motion trajectory. Even with only twenty clusters, the average trajectory reconstruction error in Cartesian space is less than 1% of the dynamic range of motion. Our ability to create and analyze realistic motions may be crucial to both future BMI experiments where a desired signal is not available and our understanding of motor control.

Machine learning (ML) is an alternative approach to reduce the inaccuracies of sedimentation models. It utilizes available domain knowledge for selecting the input and output variables for the ML models and uses non-linear regression techniques to fit the measured data. Two ML methods, artificial neural networks (ANN) and model trees, are adopted to model bed-load and total-load transport using the measured data. Special effort was made to ensure that the empirical formulations known from the sedimentation research would be taken into account. ML models were found to be more accurate than the existing ones.

In this paper, we extend the single-agent Q-learning algorithm to a multi-robot box-pushing system in an unknown dynamic environment with random obstacle distribution. There are two kinds of extensions available: directly extending MDP (Markov Decision Process) based Q-learning to the multi-robot domain, and SG-based (Stochastic Game based) Q-learning. Here, we select the first kind of extension because of its simplicity. The learning space, the box dynamics, and the reward function etc. are presented in this paper. Furthermore, a simulation system is developed and its results show effectiveness, robustness and adaptivity of this learning-based multi-robot system. Our statistical analysis of the results also shows that the robots learned correct cooperative strategy even in a dynamic environment.

We apply it to the detection of associations between candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and volumetric MRI measurements in alcohol dependent patients and healthy controls.

However, an ensemble's accuracy cannot be easily determined as it involves several factors, e.g. individual model's accuracy, diversity between its member models, decision-making strategy and number of members and the relationships between them are unclear. This paper, taking random decision tree ensembles as testing platforms, investigates these relationships and the strategies for creating ensembles from randomly generated trees. Specifically, we devised three sets of procedures for conducting experiments using twelve data sets from the UCI repository to determine the importance of individual model accuracy and the diversity between decision tree models within an ensemble. The main findings of the investigations are presented and discussed in the paper.

This paper presents a new form of generalized support vector classifier that includes both the 1-norm and 2-norm SVCs as its special cases. We refer to this new SVC as the mixed-norm support vector classifier (or m-SVC). The dual form of the m-SVC optimization problem is explicitly derived. A decomposition-type algorithm is described to solve the large sample-size m-SVC problem. We give some examples to demonstrate the solvability of the m-SVC formulation and to illustrate the relations among the m-SVC and convectional 1-norm and 2-norm SVCs.

Sleep latency and sleep efficiency are critical to both sleep-related diseases and sleep quality measurements. We propose a system which consists of heart-rate, video, and audio sensors, and apply machine learning methods to infer the sleep-awake condition during the time a user spends on the bed. The sleep-awake conditions will be useful information for inferring the sleep quality. Our experimental results are promising and show the potential use of the proposed novel economical alternative to the traditional medical measurement equipment, with competitive performance on the sleep-related activity monitoring and the sleep quality measurements.

Instead, a machine could be trained to acquire knowledge so that it would do the work (i.e. calculation and decision making) itself and leaves human do something else that is more important. In a ubiquitous multimodal multimedia (MM) computing system, the selection of appropriate media and modalities (i.e. devices) is based on user's context, user profile, and user's environment (a.ka. pre-condition scenario). There are numerous possibilities of a pre-condition scenario and the available devices also changes depending on user's computing environment. Indeed, a machine learning (NIL) component could be trained to "remember" all pre-condition scenarios, and each one's device selection (a.ka. post-condition scenario). This ML component could also be trained to find a replacement to every missing or defective selected device. The ML component is integrated into a ubiquitous system making it available anytime, anywhere. This work is an original contribution in ML, one that permits automatic system adaptation based on user's environment.

Generalization evaluation of numerical observers for image quality assessment	2006 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOL 1-6	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X- and Gamma-Ray Detectors/ 2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium	OCT 29-NOV 04, 2006	San Diego, CA	IEEE			SPECT; RECONSTRUCTION	It is now widely accepted that image quality should be evaluated by using task-based criteria, such as human-observer (HO) performance in a lesion-detection task. Because a HO study is typically costly and time consuming, development of a numerical observer (NO) surrogate is highly desirable. Recently we proposed a supervised-learning approach for modeling HO with a numerical observer, where a machine-learning algorithm is used to model the relationship between measured image features and HO scores. In this work, we further develop and evaluate this approach. We develop a NO in a lesion-detection task using a channelized support vector machine (CSVM), and compare its performance against the widely used channelized Hotelling observer (CHO). In particular we employ a cross-validation procedure to quantify the generalization ability of a NO. It allows us to evaluate how well a NO can perform when it is trained on one set of images, but tested on a different set of images. Our evaluation results demonstrate that while both CHO and CSVM can generalize well when training and test images are both reconstructed in the same way, the CSVM can generalize better when the test images are reconstructed in a different way from that of training images.

Automating this task could greatly reduce total surgery time for patients. Current solutions to this problem replay manually programmed trajectories, but a more general and robust approach is to use supervised machine learning to smooth surgeon-given training trajectories and generalize from them. Since knot-tying generally requires a controller with internal memory to distinguish between identical inputs that require different actions at different points along a trajectory, it would be impossible to teach the system using traditional feedforward neural nets or support vector machines. Instead we exploit more powerful, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with adaptive internal states. Results obtained using LSTM RNNs trained by the recent Evolino algorithm show that this approach can significantly increase the efficiency of suture knot tying in MIS over preprogrammed control.

It is capable of segmenting the range data in clusters, estimate the straight segments parameters, and estimate the scale of inliers error noise successfully, despite of high level of spurious data. No prior knowledge about the sensor and object properties is given to the algorithm. The mode seeking is based on mean shift algorithm, which has been widely used and tested in 3D laser scan segmentation, machine learning and pattern recognition applications. We show the reliability of the technique with experimental indoor and outdoor manmade environment. Compared with classical methods, a good compromise between false positive, false negative, wrong segment split and wrong segment merge is achieved, with improved accuracy in the estimated parameters.

For safe maneuvering the vehicle needs to correctly identify the drivable surface. Our work is focused on the use of simple video cameras as the sensor devices. We describe a new machine learning approach to drivable surface detection that automatically combines a set of rectangular features and histogram back-projection based image segmentation algorithms to produce superior results. The machine learning algorithm is based on the AdaBoost method, one of a class of boosting techniques which are applicable to many image processing tasks such as object and face recognition or image segmentation. The algorithm is trained and tested on video data obtained from video cameras mounted on an autonomous tractor at our Queensland site. The algorithm approach, together with the simple feature-based weak classifiers used, produces significantly improved drivable surface detection results.

Even if any learning algorithms are used, evaluating the human-robot interaction is indispensable and difficult. To solve this problem, we installed a machine-learning algorithm called Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC) into a communication robot named WAMOEBA-3. IEC is a kind of evolutionary computation like a genetic algorithm. With EEC, the fitness function is performed by each user. We carried out experiments on the communication learning system using an advanced EEC system named HMHE. Before the experiments, we did not tell the subjects anything about the robot, so the interaction differed among the experimental subjects. We could observe mutual adaptation, because some subjects noticed the robot's functions and changed their interaction. From the results, we confirmed that, in spite of the changes of the preferences, the system can adapt to the interaction of multiple users.

A probabilistic graphical model for microphone array source separation using rich pre-trained source models	2006 IEEE SENSOR ARRAY AND MULTICHANNEL SIGNAL PROCESSING WORKSHOP PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1 AND 2	Proceedings of the IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop		English	Proceedings Paper	4th IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop	JUL 12-14, 2006	Waltham, MA	IEEE Signal Proc Soc, IEEE Boston Sect, Air Force Res Lab, Def Adv Res Projects Agcy, Air Force Off Sci Res, Off Naval Res			BLIND SEPARATION	Voice based computing applications, such as phone communication and speech recognition, use microphone arrays to capture voice from a human speaker. In many environments of interest, however, sounds from other sources interfere with the speaker's voice, posing severe problems for subsequent processing. This paper describes a new framework for treating this problem, and presents and demonstrates a new algorithm for the cancellation of interfering sounds. Our framework combines techniques from statistical machine learning with ideas from speech and audio processing. An important feature involves training rich probabilistic models on data from different types of relevant sound sources. nose source models are then incorporated into a larger probabilistic model of the observed microphone data. Using that model we derive our algorithm, which is of the expectation-maximization type and infers from data the clean sound of separate individual sources. We report very good results on data recorded in different environments.

Model Integration consists in the amalgamation of local models into a global, consistent one. In each subset, agents perform mining tasks locally and, afterwards, results are merged into a global model. In order to achieve that, agents cooperate by exchanging messages, aiming to improve the process of knowledge discover generating accurate results. The multiagent system for Distributed Data Mining proposed in this paper has been compared with classical machine learning algorithms which are based on model integration as well, simulating a distributed environment. The results obtained show that SMAMDD can produce highly accurate data models.

To evaluate a web page automatically, we have developed a client-side logging/analyzing tool: the GINIS Framework. We do not focus on clicking, scrolling, navigation, or duration of visit alone, but we propose integrating these patterns Of interaction to recognize and evaluate a user's response to a given web page. Unlike most previous web studies that have analyzed access seen at proxies or server, this work focuses primarily on client site user behavior using a customized web browser. First, GINIS unobtrusively gathers logs of user behavior through the user's natural interaction with the web browser. Then it analyses the logs and extracts effective rules to evaluate web pages using a machine-learning method Eventually, GINIS will be able to automatically evaluate web pages using these learned rules, after which the evaluation can be utilized in a variety of user profiling.

It is obvious that textual content-based filters cannot correctly categorize such access attempts. This paper describes a novel URL-based objectionable content categorization approach and its application to web filtering. In this approach, we break the URL into a sequence of n-grams with a range of n's and then a machine learning algorithm is applied to the n-gram representation of URLs to learn a classifier of pornographic websites. We showed empirically that the URL-based approach is able to correctly identify many of the objectionable web pages. We also demonstrated that the optimum web filtering results could be achieved when it was used with a content-based approach in a production environment.

The document collection consists of of a set of personal e-mail messages. Two distinct document representation formalisms are employed to characterize these messages, namely a standard word-based approach and a character n-gram document representation. Based on these document representations, the categorization performance of five machine learning approaches is assessed and a comparison is given. In principle, both document representation yielded comparable results with the various classifiers. However, the results for the n-gram-based document representation were definitely better in case of an aggressive feature selection strategy.

The goal of question classification is to accurately assign labels to question based on expected answer type. Recently, many machine learning algorithms are used for question classification. However many research results show that SVM perform best in this task, because it is well known to work well for nonlinear, sparse, high dimensional problems. In this experiment, we perform the One-against-One SVM algorithm and a feature extraction method of Chinese questions to get high classification accuracy.

Most research has been focused on the schema level, i.e., mapping/matching concepts and properties in different ontologies with each other However, the data level integration is equally important, especially in the decentralized Semantic Web environment. Noticing that ontology data (in the form of instances of concepts) from different sources often have different perspectives and may overlap with each other we develop a matching method that utilizes the features of ontology and employs the machine learning approach to integrate those instances. By exploring ontology features, this method performs better than other general methods, which is revealed in our experiments. Through the process that implements the matching method, ontology data can be integrated together to offer more sophisticated services.

Our system can extract, without any post-processing, tuples for all data structures including nested, rotated and cross tables. The wrapper induction algorithm we propose is based on two main ideas. It is incremental: partial tuples are extracted by increasing length. It is based on a representation-enrichment procedure: partial tuples of length i are encoded with the knowledge of extracted tuples of length i - 1. The algorithm is then set in a friendly interactive wrapper induction system for Web documents. We evaluate our system on several information extraction tasks over corporate Web sites. It achieves state-of-the-art results on simple data structures and succeeds on complex data structures where previous approaches fail. Experiments also show that our interactive framework significantly reduces the number of user interactions needed to build a wrapper			RemiGilleron@univ-lille3.fr; PatrickMarty@univ-lille3.fr; MarcTommasi@univ-lille3.fr; FabienTorre@univ-lille3.fr					ARASU A, 2003, ICDM, P337; ARME J, 2005, IJCAI WORKSH GRAMM I; Baumgartner Robert, 2001, 27 INT C VER LARG DA, P119; Chang C., 2001, WWW; COHEN W, 2003, WEB DOCUMENT ANAL CH; Crescenzi Valter, 2001, VLDB J, P109; FREITAG D, 2000, AAAI IAAI, P577; HAREL D, 1984, SIAM J COMPUT, V13, P338, DOI 10.1137/0213024; Hsu CN, 1998, INFORM SYST, V23, P521, DOI 10.1016/S0306-4379(98)00027-1; JENSEN LS, 2001, ATEM WORKSH IJCAI; Kushmerick N., 1997, THESIS U WASHINGTON; Laender AHF, 2002, SIGMOD REC, V31, P84; LERMAN K, 2001, ATEM WORKSH IJCAI; Muslea I., 2003, IJCAI 2003, P415; QUINLAN R, DATA MINING TOOLS SE; Raeymaekers S, 2005, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V3720, P305; THOMAS B, 2000, ECML PKDD; Zhai Y., 2005, WWW 05, P76; Zhai YH, 2005, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3806, P318; *ISI, 1998, RIS REP ONL INF SOUR	20	1	1	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA		978-0-7695-2747-5				2006							997	1004		10.1109/WI.2006.102		8	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems	Computer Science	BFY84	WOS:000245469500176

The proposed work aims to enhance this discovery process by employing machine learning and semantic modelling. We explore a framework for automatically discovering labeled clusters from a large collection of documents. The aim of this ftamework is to enable the extraction of concepts and to structure these into labeled concepts for use by text processing applications such as text summarization and text categorization. We have developed a mechanism for automatically inducing a set of words that captures the meaning of a collection of documents. The WordNet lexical database is used to extract root meanings and to determine relationships amongst these terms.

First part of the paper analyzes the estimation problem based on the assumption that there is no temporal correlation between link losses for different probes. We have applied Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to this problem. We compared the results of EM with a direct approach developed in [2]. The second part of the paper is based on the assumption of Markov temporal correlation between packet losses. We applied EM algorithm to this problem with E-step approximated by Gibbs sampling, completely factorized variational and structured variational approximation. We observed from simulation that the links closer to observed nodes give more accurate results and that structured variational approximation improves simple variational approximation results considerably.

Learning indirect acquisition of instrumental gestures using direct sensors	2006 IEEE Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing	OCT 03-06, 2006	Victoria, CANADA	IEEE				Sensing instrumental gestures is a common task in interactive electroacoustic music performances. The sensed gestures can then be mapped to sounds, synthesis algorithms, visuals etc. Two of the most common approaches for acquiring these gestures are 1) Hybrid Instruments which are "traditional" musical instruments enhanced with sensors that directly detect gestures 2) Indirect Acquisition in which the only measurement is the acoustic signal and signal processing techniques are used to acquire the gestures. Hybrid instruments require modification of existing instruments which is frequently undesirable. However they provide relatively straightforward and reliable measuring capability. On the other hand, indirect acquisition approaches typically require sophisticated signal processing and possibly machine learning algorithms in order to extract the relevant information from the audio signals. In this paper the idea of using direct sensors to train a machine learning model for indirect acquisition is explored. This approach has some nice advantages, mainly: 1) large amounts of training data can be collected with minimum effort 2) once the indirect acquisition system is trained no sensors or modifications to the playing instrument are required. Case studies described in paper include 1) strike position on a snare drum 2) strum direction on a sitar.

In this paper, we present a novel optimization technique using the Minimum Classification Error (MCE) criterion to optimize the HMM parameters. Unlike Maximum Mutual Information training where an Extended Baum-Welch (EBW) algorithm exists to optimize its objective function, for NICE training the original EBW algorithm cannot be directly applied. In this work, we extend the original EBW algorithm and derive a novel method for MCE-based model parameter estimation. Compared with conventional gradient descent methods for MCE learning, the proposed method gives a solid theoretical basis, stable convergence, and it is well suited for the large-scale batch-mode training process essential in large-scale speech recognition and other pattern recognition applications. Evaluation experiments, including model training and speech recognition, are reported on both a small vocabulary task (TI-Digits) and a large vocabulary task (WSJ), where the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated. We expect new future applications and success of this novel learning method in general pattern recognition and multimedia processing, in addition to speech and audio processing applications we present in this paper.

So a hybrid Backoropagation (BP)-based scheduling knowledge acquisition algorithm is presented in this paper. We combined genetic algorithm (GA) with simulated annealing (SA) to develop a hybrid optimization method, in which GA was introduced to present parallel search architecture and SA was introduced to increase escaping probability from local optima and ability to neighbor search. The hybrid method was utilized to resolve the optimal attributes subset of manufacturing system and determine the optimal topology and parameters of (BP) under different scheduling objectives; BP was used to evaluate the fitness of chromosome in the method and generate the scheduling knowledge after obtaining the optimal attributes subset, optimal BPs topology and parameters. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm produces significant performance improvements over other machine learning-based algorithms.

The precision and speed of the classification are important research issues in fault pattern recognition for this kind of intelligent fault diagnosis. Although many improved ANN (Artificial Neural Net) methods have been proposed for this purpose, most approaches focus only on the classification precision, instead of the computing speed. In this paper, a SVM model for fault diagnosis is introduced and analyzed about its limitation from sensibility to noisy data. To address this problem, we introduce the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) method to reduce the dimension of the sample set and de-noise data sampled from the machine. Furthermore, for the whole real-time data processing and fault pattern recognition, a kind of wavelet packet analysis is applied to translate the field sensor signal in time-spectrum into the energy value in frequency-spectrum corresponding frequency segments real-timely. Therefore we present a new machine learning method: PSVM (Primary component analysis Support Vector Machine) method based on wavelet packet analysis in the fault diagnosis field. And this improved method particularly betters the precision and computing speed of the classification then other typical networks. And also the whole processing workflow is illustrated in details. Finally the diagnosis result of the CNC grinding machine demonstrates this method with both high classification precision and quick computational speed. And the whole integration of wavelet packet analysis, PCA and SVM is proved a new, effective and practical approach especially for the real-time online fault diagnosis exactly.

In this paper, we present three face recognition methods based on kernel lsomap, which is a representative manifold learning method using kernel trick. Considering the class label by adjusting the Euclidean distance using weight factor w, both SK-Isomap-I and SK-Isomap-II are supervised and perform better than original K-Isomap. Unlike SK-Isomap-I, SK-Isomap-II utilizes nearest class center instead of KNN to determine class label of a test data. The experimental results showed that SK-Isomap-Il performed the best in three of them and the error rate of SK-Isomap-II was only about 50% of K-Isomap.

The word itself part-of-speech (POS) tag, syllable and context information are extracted as the features of the vectors. The experimental results show that this model is efficient for Chinese text chunking. The hybrid machine learning model based on ESVM and KNN can achieve better results than SVM. The recall, precision and F-measure are up to 84.11%, 83.01% and 83.56% respectively in open test. And the combined ESVM-KNN model can be generalized to the fields of machine learning with unbalanced class distribution.

The data sets consist of different kinds of attribute types including numerical, categorical, and mix types. In our experiments, the C4.5 pruned/unpruned tree algorithm is applied to four different kinds of data sets obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and pools of wells in the region of Saskatchewan, Canada. The result showed that the C4.5 algorithm performed well on categorical, numerical and mix-type data. The pruned C4.5 tree algorithm demonstrated having better performance than the unpruned one when these types of data are concerned It also discusses the limitations of this algorithm and possible extension when predicting future production performance of oil wells.

In this paper a keyphrase extraction approach based on the naive Bayesian classifier is proposed. To determine whether a phrase is a keyphrase, the following features of a phrase in a given document are adopted: its term frequency, whether to appear in the title, abstract and headings (subheadings), and its frequency appearing in the paragraphs of the given document. The approach is evaluated by the standard information retrieval metrics of precision and recall. Experiment results show that this approach is very practical: it can achieve high precision and recall; especially the recall it can achieve is over 80 percent.

The Archlog framework provides a high level of abstraction, enabling rapid system generation while supporting high performance. In this paper we present the Archlog language and its library-based compilation framework, which makes use of a customisable logic programming processor. The system generates multiple designs, with different trade-offs in the use of reconfigurable logic and embedded memories. An implementation of a multiprocessor for the machine learning system Progol on a 40MHz XC2V6000 FPGA is 10 times faster than a 2GHz Pentium 4 processor.

The activity of sunspots can give clues to the timing of solar flares and the solar weather in general. This paper describes a hybrid system for automatic sunspot recognition and classification. The system uses a combination of image processing and machine learning techniques to process and classify sunspot groups from digital satellite images. Sunspot data are extracted from daily images of the solar disk captured by the NASA SOHO/MDI satellite. The classification scheme attempted was the seven-class Modified Zurich scheme. The main components of the hybrid system are: 1) the image processor, 2) the feature extractor, 3) the clusterer 4) the classification learner. Furthermore, the paper compares two clustering algorithms: hierarchical average-link and a density-based DBSCAN and examines their usefulness in dealing with sunspot data. The aim is to create clusters that closely match "natural" sunspot groups. Clustering is an important step in the process as the classification performance is dependent on it. In previous papers we have shown that by combining clustering with classification the overall results can be substantially improved.

Up to now, the need for it was met by human knowledge that a domain expert or a system supervisor have contributed to a given application task. The advent of the Internet has drastically changed this state of affairs. Internet sources of visual information are diffused and dispersed over the whole Web, so the duty of information content evaluation must be relegated now to an image content understanding machine or a computer-based program capable to perform image content evaluation at a distant image location. Development of Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) technologies is a natural move in the right direction. However... In this paper I will argue that the basic assumptions underpinning the majority of CBIR designs are wrong and inappropriate, (like many other basic conceptions that computer vision community proudly holds at this time).

The strong relationship between AI, cognitive science, computer science and psychology emerged in learning domain. One of the tasks which are supported is computer supported learning. In learning, the learner's goal is to improve its knowledge. This conforms to the result of machine learning in AI, which is a knowledge representation form raw data. The new formal education model 18] is that responsibility to improve knowledge should be distributed among the teacher and the students, and not only the teacher's privilege. In other words, there is collective intention between teacher and students to improve knowledge by carrying out collaborative knowledge building. Researches in collaborative plan have proposed a planning model called SharedPlan Model, formulated in First-Order-Logic with some addition of meta-predicates. This paper argues that SharedPlan model can be exploited to model the collaborative knowledge building. For the future references, this model is expected to become a bridge in implementing any collaborative knowledge based tasks which has distributed participants.

Ways to evade spam filters and machine learning as a potential solution	2006 International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies,Vols 1-3			English	Proceedings Paper	International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies	OCT 18-20, 2006	Bangkok, THAILAND					The growth of unsolicited email or junk mail has become a major threat to information security today. Most of the commercial websites providing email facility today provide some form of programmable automatic filtration of junk mails, typically in the form of a set of rules to dispose of mails based on keywords detected in headers or message body. There are some other methods for the purpose as well, but an adaptive email filtering system based on Bayesian technique that can learn from its user's mail preferences appears to be a better solution. It not only considers the keywords that identify spam, but also words that denote innocent or legitimate mail which makes the filter more efficient. However direct marketers discover new ways to evade even the Bayesian filters, so as to reach the potential customers. The way most commonly adopted by the spammers to mislead the Bayesian filters is injection of out of context text in the email. This paper aims at presenting a critical analysis of the various ways adopted by spammers to dodge the spam filters. Further we explore the Bayesian Noise Reduction (BNR) technique which attempts to solve this problem by identifying and eliminating the 'out of context' data (so injected by spammers or otherwise) to provide a cleaner classification.

One is genetic rule selection and the other is genetics-based machine learning (GBML). In our genetic rule selection scheme, first a large number of promising fuzzy rules are extracted from numerical data in a heuristic manner as candidate rules. Then a genetic algorithm is used to select a small number of fuzzy rules. A rule set is represented by a binary string whose length is equal to the number of candidate rules. On the other hand, a fuzzy rule is denoted by its antecedent fuzzy sets as an integer substring in our GBML scheme. A rule set is represented by a concatenated integer string. In this paper, we compare these two schemes in terms of their search ability to efficiently find compact fuzzy rule-based classification systems with high accuracy. The main difference between these two schemes is that GBML has a huge search space consisting of all combinations of possible fuzzy rules while genetic rule selection has a much smaller search space with only candidate rules.

Towards a comprehensible and accurate credit management model: Application of four computational intelligence methodologies	2006 International Symposium on Evolving Fuzzy Systems, Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	International Symposium on Evolving Fuzzy Systems	SEP 07-09, 2006	Ambleside, ENGLAND	InfoLab21, Lancaster Univ, IEEE CIS FSTC, IEEE, EPSRC, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Int Fuzzy Syst Assoc, Syst Man & Cybemet Soc, European Soc Fuzzy Log & Technol			SCORING MODELS; ALGORITHMS; NETWORKS	The study presents methods for classification of applicants into different categories of credit risk using four different computational intelligence techniques. The selected methodologies involved in the rule-based categorization task are (1) feedforward neural networks trained with second order methods (2) inductive machine learning, (3) hierarchical decision trees produced by grammar-guided genetic programming and (4) fuzzy rule based systems produced by grammar-guided genetic programming. The data used are both numerical and linguistic in nature and they represent a real-world problem, that of deciding whether a loan should be granted or not, in respect to financial details of customers applying for that loan, to a specific private EU bank. We examine the proposed classification models with a sample of enterprises that applied for a loan, each of which is described by financial decision variables (ratios), and classified to one of the four predetermined classes. Attention is given to the comprehensibility and the ease of use for the acquired decision models. Results show that the application of the proposed methods can make the classification task easier and-in some cases-may minimize significantly the amount of required credit data. We consider that these methodologies may also give the chance for the extraction of a comprehensible credit management model or even the incorporation of a related decision support system in banking.

Most of the algorithms proposed in the past, for solving the VAD problem, have been based on some deterministic feature of the speech signal such as zero crossing rate. The speech/non-speech decisions are then taken using suitably. chosen thresholds. This paper presents the application of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classifying the voice activity. The speech signal has been divided into labeled overlapping frames and pattern classification has subsequently been performed by using a supervised learning algorithm. It has been observed that the SVM based solution is computationally efficient and provides around 90 % accuracy for speech signals directly recorded using a microphone and an accuracy of over 85 % for noisy speech.

Using appropriate performance indexes in the open-door task experiment, we acquired stiffness ellipse trajectory which optimizes dynamic movement of manipulator.

Machine Learning algorithms discover the relationships between the variables of a system (input, output and hidden) from direct samples of the system. Usually there is relatively small number of samples compared with the number of input features. Relatively small number of samples and large number of features would cause overfitting. The support vector machine (SVM) avoids overfitting by choosing a specific hyperplane among the many that can separate the data in the feature space. SVM realizes the structural risk minimization. In this study, the support vector machine is applied to predict catalytic activity of various libraries in a quaternary system of Pt, Cu, Fe, and Co supported on aluminium-containing SBA-15 using a self made 64-channel micro reactor. This method would help to discover the optimum composition of DeNOx catalysts.

We sample a virtual example from a Bayesian network constructed with the original training set. The usefulness of a sampled virtual example for learning is measured by the increment of the network's conditional likelihood. A qualified virtual example is saved and used to update the network for the next sampling. By repeating this process we can generate candidate virtual example sets of various sizes. Among these candidates, an appropriately sized virtual example set for a target learning algorithm is chosen through statistical significance tests.

Furthermore, the lack of standard data sets and simulation tools makes the evaluation of machine learning algorithms in context-aware settings an even harder task. To ease the situation, we introduce a generic simulator that has been designed with the above mentioned purposes in mind. The simulator has also proven to be a good demonstration tool for mobile services and applications that are aimed at groups. The simulator is highly customizable and it can output context information of individual entities both through an interactive GUI and as data streams consisting of comma separated values. To support a wide range of tasks and scenarios, we have separated the three main information sources: behavior of agents, the scenario being simulated and the used context variable. The simulator has been implemented using Java, and the data streams have been made available through a web service interface.

While the test error probability of these methods is rather low, it is still considered prohibitive for accurate production testing. In this paper, we demonstrate how to minimize this test error probability and, thus, how to bridge the accuracy of functional and machine-learning-based test methods. The underlying idea is to measure the confidence of the machine-learning-based test decision and retest the small fraction of circuits for which this confidence is low via standard functional test Through this approach, the majority of circuits are tested using fast machine-learning-based tests, which, nevertheless, are equivalent to the standard functional ones with regards to test error probability. By varying the acceptable confidence level, the proposed method enables exploration of the trade-off between test time and test accuracy.

Although anomaly intrusion detection systems (AIDSs) have the potential to discover novel attacks, AIDSs suffer from the lack of generalization capability and the presence of high false alarm rates. Many machine learning techniques have been proposed to overcome the lack of generalization in existing AIDSs. Unfortunately, the main stream of these techniques is static techniques that perform structural pattern recognition. Such techniques are not capable of efficiently modeling an essential property of the behaviors of the monitored objects. This property is the sequential relationship between the events of the patterns that constitute the normal and abnormal behaviors. In this research, we show that the sequential relationship between the events of the normal and abnormal behaviors is vital for anomaly detection. Moreover, the techniques that efficiently model this property can build robust AIDSs. To illustrate this reality, we investigate the performance of two different detection techniques: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), a sequential learning mechanism, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, a structural pattern recognition technique. We demonstrate that the detection of HMMs classifiers outperforms the detection of the MLP classifiers in a noticeable manner.

In contrast, many real-world scenarios require a classification decision well before a flow has finished even if the flow's beginning is lost. This implies classification must be achieved using statistics derived from the most recent N packets taken at any arbitrary point in a flow's lifetime. We propose training the classifier on a combination of short sub-flows (extracted from full-flow examples of the target application's traffic). We demonstrate this optimisation using the Naive Bayes ML algorithm, and show that our approach results in excellent performance even when classification is initiated mid-way through a flow with windows as small as 25 packets long. We suggest future use of unsupervised ML algorithms to identify optimal subflows for training.

Contrary to such approaches, we advocate proactively detecting and identifying botnets prior to their being used as part of a cyber-attack [12]. In this paper, we present our work on using machine learning-based classification techniques to identify the command and control (C2) traffic of IRC-based botnets - compromised hosts that are collectively commanded using Internet Relay Chat (IRC). We split this task into two stages: (I) distinguishing between IRC and non-IRC traffic, and (II) distinguishing between botnet and real IRC traffic. For Stage I, we compare the performance of J48, naive Bayes, and Bayesian network classifiers, identify the features that achieve good overall classification accuracy, and determine the classification sensitivity to the training set size. While sensitive to the training data and the attributes used to characterize communication flows, machine learning-based classifiers show promise in identifying IRC traffic. Using classification in Stage II is trickier, since accurately labeling IRC traffic as botnet and non-botnet is challenging. We are currently exploring labeling flows as suspicious and non-suspicious based on telltales of hosts being compromised.								DEWES C, 2003, IMC 03, P51; Duda R.

Delivering what customer wants involves minimizing the defects in the programs. Hence, it is important to establish quality measures early on in the project life cycle. The main objective of this research is to analyze problems in software code and propose a model that will help catching those problems earlier in the project life cycle. Our proposed model uses machine learning methods. Principal Component Analysis is used for dimensionality reduction, and Decision Tree, Multi Layer Perceptron and Radial Basis Functions are used for defect prediction. The experiments in this research are carried out with different software metric datasets that are obtained from real-life projects of three big software companies in Turkey. We can say that, the improved method that we proposed brings out satisfactory results in terms of defect prediction.

On the other hand, these development costs are lower than maintenance costs, which represent a major concern, specially, for systems designed with recent technologies. Systems modification should be taken rigorously, and change effects must be considered. In this paper, we propose an approach, both analytical and experimental; its objective is to analyze and predict changes impacts in Object-Oriented (00) systems. The method we follow consists first, to choose an existing impact model, and adapt it afterward An impact calculation technique based on a meta-model is developed. To evaluate our approach, an empirical study was led on a real system in which a correlation hypothesis between coupling and change impact was advanced. A concrete change was done in the target system and coupling metrics were extracted from it. The hypothesis was verified with machine-learning (ML) techniques. Obtained results are interesting; they are presented and commented.

Our work involves the development and testing of an adaptable framework for the presentation of core AI topics that emphasizes the relationship between AI and computer science. Several hands-on laboratory projects that can be closely integrated into an introductory AI course have been developed. We present an overview of one of the projects and describe the associated curricular materials that have been developed. The project uses machine learning as a theme to unify core AI topics in the context of the N-puzzle game. Games provide a rich framework to introduce students to search fundamentals and other core AI concepts. The paper presents several pedagogical possibilities for the N-puzzle game, the rich challenge it offers, and summarizes our experiences using it.

While many Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) courses teach ML and AT concepts by means of programming assignments, these assignments have usually no connection to how the student will apply the newly obtained knowledge to previously unseen, real-world problems. The pedagogy that we adopted here is computer-based active learning: teams of students are presented with well-defined assignments aimed at building intelligent agents for person identification and recognition of facial expressions and emotions from video recordings of their faces. Classroom experience indicates that the students found the specified programming assignments highly motivating. Objective evaluation studies suggest that students learn much more effectively when a contextualized, collaborative, constructive, and reflective approach is used than when an orthodox, objectivist approach to teaching ML and AI techniques is used alone.

Our 80 test subjects had an even mixture of both aforementioned disciplines. Each participant is asked to listen to a melody played on a piano and to repeat the melody himself verbally. Both the original melody and participants repetition is recorded and frequency and amplitude response is analyzed by using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This information is then used to train a neural network. Our results show that by using musical perception our neural network classifies students with positive and social science backgrounds at a success rate of 90% and 85%, respectively.

S	Guruswami, V; Raghavendra, P			IEEE COMPUTER SOC	Guruswami, Venkatesan; Raghavendra, Prasad			Hardness of learning halfspaces with noise	47th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, Proceedings	ANNUAL IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	47th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science	OCT 21-24, 2006	Berkeley, CA	IEEE				Learning an unknown halfspace (also called a perceptron) from labeled examples is one of the classic problems in machine learning. In the noise free case, when a halfspace consistent with all the training examples exists, the problem can be solved in polynomial time using linear programming. However, under the promise that a halfspace consistent with a fraction (1 - epsilon) of the examples exists (for some small constant epsilon > 0), it was not known how to efficiently find a halfspace that is correct on even 51% of the examples. Nor was a hardness result that ruled out getting agreement on more than 99.9% of the examples known. In this work, we close this gap in our understanding, and prove that even a tiny amount of worst-case noise makes the problem of learning halfspaces intractable in a strong sense. Specifically, for arbitrary epsilon, delta > 0, we prove that given a set of examples-label pairs from the hypercube a fraction (1 - E) of which can be explained by a halfspace, it is NP-hard to find a halfspace that correctly labels a fraction (1/2 + delta) of the examples. The hardness result is tight since it is trivial to get agreement on 1/2 the examples. In learning theory parlance, we prove that weak proper agnostic learning of halfspaces is hard. This settles a question that was raised by Blum et al in their work on learning halfspaces in the presence of random classification noise (7), and in some more recent works as well. Along the way, we also obtain a strong hardness for another basic computational problem: solving a linear system over the rationals.

This problem subsumes various classical graph partitioning problems, such as graph coloring, domatic partitioning, and MAX k-CUT, as well as machine learning problems like decision graph learning and model-based data clustering. Our algorithm runs in O* (2(n)) time, thus substantially improving on the usual O* (3(n))-time dynamic programming algorithm; the notation O* suppresses factors polynomial in n. This result improves, e.g., Byskov's recent record for graph coloring from O* (2.4023(n)) to O* (2(n)). We note that twenty five years ago, R. M. Karp used inclusion-exclusion in a similar fashion to reduce the space requirement of the usual dynamic programming algorithms from exponential to polynomial.

This is mainly due to the tacit property of knowledge, which makes it difficult to be explicated, and hence analysed. Past research has shown that visual interactive simulation (VIS) could effectively be used to elicit episodic knowledge that is appropriate for machine learning (an AI capability that includes inductive learning) purposes, with a view of building a KBS. Nonetheless, the VIS-based elicitation process still has much room for improvement. Based in the Ford Dagenham Engine Assembly Plant, a research project is being undertaken to investigate the individual/joint effects of visual display level and mode of problem case generation on the elicitation process. This paper looks at the methodology employed and some issues that have been encountered to date.

SVM is a very specific class of algorithms; it is characterized by the use of a maximal margin hyperplane I the absence of local minima, convex optimization the sparseness of the solution, Mercer's theorem and the capacity control obtained by acting on the margin. A large number of experiments have shown that SVM has not only simpler structure, but also better performance, especially its better generalization ability. The SVM approach was originally developed to solve binary classification problems. But in many fields, we need to solve multi-class classification problems. How to effectively extend it for multi-class classification is still an on-going research issue. This article uses the SVM theory and several kind of commonly used classified algorithms based on SVM to study the multi-class classification question, such as the LS-SVM algorithm, the SMO algorithm and the LIBSVM algorithm. The experiment indicated that the algorithms mentioned above have the good and bad points respectively; various algorithms have different efficiencies in different situations. But there is little parameter for users to choose in LIBSVM algorithm; when the size of training set is quite big, it is better to use the nimble SMO algorithm.

A conceptual framework for the optical property function elicitation process is proposed mid particularized for the use of attribute-value classifiers. The process is evaluated in terms of accuracy and speed using different off-the-shelf classifiers (Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Simple Logistic). The empirical results confirm the classification of high-resolution time-varying computerised tomography volume data as a challenging problem where an opportunity for further research emerges.

Using Grammatical Inference for structure induction	CIC 2006: 15th International Conference on Computing, Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Computing	NOV 21-24, 2006	Mexico City, MEXICO					Given the huge quantity of the current available textual information, Text Mining process tackles the task of searching useful knowledge in a natural language document. When dealing with a free format textual corpus (e.g. a Job announcement) where the linguistic rules are not respected, the time consuming morpho-syntactic analysis is not of a great help. However, text mining techniques process may exploit linguistic sub-structures in the text. In this paper, we present an applications of Grammatical Inference (GI) in a machine learning system applied to a text corpus. We specify and use the process of the Grammatical Inference as an instance of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem that instantiates automata in a (language inclusion) lattice.

Few works have been made to predict PPII with machine learning approaches. This paper predicted PPII secondary Structure with BP-model neural network based on preprocessing protein sequences, and compared two numerical sequence coding methods in PPII, the traditional binary vector sequence coding method and the modified binary vector sequence coding method allowing for neighboring amino-acid residues' effect. Results show that the modified sequence coding method is better than the traditional sequence coding method in predicting PPII the sensitivity can reach 82.5%.

It is more and more important to some practical applications in large state space control problems because of requiring an Agent to fit more complex environment, specially, in the area of studying for machine learning. We always regard the Markov Decision Processes (MDP) as the environment model of a reinforcement learning Agent. Bellman's optimal control equation is the base to solving this problem in simulating experiments and practical applications. We have introduced a kind of more complex and more practical environment for learning Agent in our previous work. Combining two concepts of risk-sensitive and multi-time scale, we have proposed a new conception which we refer it to multi-time scale risk-sensitive Markov Decision Processes. Under this new conception, we have, modeled the basic Bellman's optimal control equation. Our motivation in this paper is to investigate this problem continually and gives a set of basic results. These results are all cores for framework of solving multi-time scale risk-sensitive control problems.

Sub-area features are represented in a feature information system so that conventional machine learning or data mining approaches can be applied to identify the sub-areas. However, conventional representations with a single body of knowledge encounter many problems when the sub-axea features are changed. In order to deal with changing environments, the multi-knowledge approach is applied to the identification of environments. Multi-knowledge is extracted from a feature information system by means of multiple reducts (feature sets) so that a robot with multi-knowledge is capable of identifying an environment with some changing features. A case-study demonstrates that a robot with multi-knowledge can cope better with the identification of an environment with changing features than conventional single body of knowledge.

However, there has been relatively little work examining ROC for more than two classes. Here we present an extension of ROC curves which can be used for illustrating and analyzing the quality of multi-class classifiers. Instead of using one single curve, we deal with sets of curves which are calculated for each class separately. These are used for analyzing not only how exactly the classes are separated, but also how clearly the classifier is able to distinguish the given classes. Apart from making it possible to analyze the results graphically, several values describing the classifier's quality can be calculated.

If we computationally conduct inductive management, it is vital to collect a considerable number of examples to perform machine learning. In the Accident or Incident Report Database home page, we can review various types of accidents or incidents. However, since reports are written by various nurses, the granularity and quality of reports are not sufficient for machine learning. We, therefore, explain the importance of conducting dynamic nursing risk management that can be achieved by abduction, then illustrate cooperation between abductive and inductive, types of nursing risk management.

It is oriented towards pushing the use of Information Technology in supporting the improvement of both organization and people performances, by understanding employee needs and by designing customized incentives and rewards. Customization is very common in the area of e-commcrce, where application of profiling and recommendation techniques makes it possible to deliver personalized recommendations for users that explicitly accept the site to store personal information such as preferences or demographic data. Our work is focused on the application of User Profiling techniques in the Total Reward Management context. In the Team Advisor project we experimented the analogies Customer/Employee, Product, Portfolio/Reward Library and Shop/Employer, in order to provide personalized reward recommendations to line managers. We found that the adoption of a collaborative software platform delivering a preliminary reward plan to the managers fosters collaboration and actively supports the delegation of decision-making.

Regression modeling problems are to be solved in this context as well as classification problems, and also time series analysis methods are expected to become more and more important. In this paper we describe a multi-purpose machine learning approach based on various evolutionary computation concepts that is applicable for several medical data mining aspects in evidence based medicine. We show how regression, classification and time series problems can be attacked using this algorithm, and we also propose a hybrid approach combining time series analysis with regression and classification aspects.

The method of transposition is used to maintain a maximum size for the application as well as meta-rule bases. The "move to head" method is used by both the application and meta-rule bases for hypotheses formation. Whenever an application rule is fired, it is transposed on the transposition list and also moved to the head on the other list. If any meta-rule on a solution path individually leads to a contradiction on the application rule base, then the offending meta-rule is expunged. Then, when the system is idle enter dream mode, whereby rule i double right arrow rule j is generated by the 3-2-1 skewed twister as a candidate most-specific meta-rule. Candidate most-specific meta-rules are "cored" to create one generalization per candidate. These candidate meta-rules are tested for application to each rule in the application domain rule base. In order to he saved in the meta base, they may not map any existing rule in the application domain rule base to one having the same antecedent as another in this base, but a different consequent (as found by hashing). In addition, all candidate meta-rules must map at least one rule in the application base to another distinct one there, or be symmetrically induced from meta-rules that so map.

We adopt machine learning approach using decision tree to a coreference resolution of general noun phrases in unrestricted text based on well defined features. We also use approximate matching algorithms for a string match feature and databases of American last names and male and female first names for gender agreement and alias feature. For the evaluation we use MUC-6 coreference corpora. We show that pessimisitc error pruning method gives better generalization in a coreference resolution task than that reported in Soon et al.

We have known that this algorithm is the effect of robotic learning and that a lot of researchers have proposed the basic idea using this algorithm. A system in which the algorithm has been built is needs a lot of trials and errors. Moreover it requires a huge amount of calculation in order to achieve some effectiveness. This paper has proposed a method using reinforcement learning with hand-coded rules for a soccer agent in RoboCup Soccer Simulation League. We have analyzed a lot of scenes that agents have made scores in simulation soccer games and have extracted some rules. We have called them "hand coded rules". Moreover we have applied our method for an offensive soccer agent in RoboCup Soccer Simulation League and have done some experiments. From the results, we have confirmed that our team has improved its capability of getting scores.

It presents a scaffold for a statis tical glitch prediction system using a Neuro-Memetic model, which predicts to divide the circuit into a number of sub-circuits with minimum interconnections between them. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary time-series model for partitioning a circuit using neuro-Memetic algorithm owing to its local search capability. The experimental results show that the combination strategy (Neuro-Memetic) can quicken the learning speed of the network and improve the predicting precision compared to memetic approach. A comparative study is provided using the two machine learning approaches using memetic and Neuro-memetic to solve the problem of circuit partitioning pertaining to VLSI design. The performance of both approaches is compared using benchmark data provided by MCNC standard cell placement benchmark netlists. Analysis of the investigational results proved that the Neuro-memetic model achieves greater performance then memetic approach in recognizing sub-circuits with lowest amount of interconnections between them.

In contrast to languages such as English, there are few resources for Brazilian Portuguese (BP). Consequently, there are no publicly available scripts to design baseline BP systems. This work discusses some efforts towards decreasing this gap and presents results for two speech processing tasks for BP: phone classification and grapheme to phoneme (G2P) conversion. The former task used hidden Markov models to classify phones from the Spoltech and TIMIT corpora. The G2P module adopted machine learning methods such as decision trees and was tested on a new BP pronunciation dictionary and the following languages: British English, American English and French.

This paper presents work on developing a software system for predicting crop yield, for example oil-palm yield, from climate and plantation data. At the core of our system is a method for unsupervised partitioning of data for finding spatio-temporal patterns in climate data using kernel methods which offer strength to deal with complex data. This work gets inspiration from the notion that a non-linear data transformation into some high dimensional feature space increases the possibility of linear separability of the patterns in the transformed space. Therefore, it simplifies exploration of the associated structure in the data. Kernel methods implicitly perform a non-linear mapping of the input data into a high dimensional feature space by replacing the inner products with an appropriate positive definite function. In this paper we present a robust weighted kernel k-means algorithm incorporating spatial constraints for clustering the data. The proposed algorithm can effectively handle noise, outliers and auto-correlation in the spatial data, for effective and efficient data analysis by exploring patterns and structures in the data, and thus can be used for predicting oil-palm yield by analyzing various factors affecting the yield.

In this paper, machine learning techniques are adapted for keystroke authentication. Seven learning methods are used to build models to differentiate user keystroke patterns. The selected classification methods are Decision Tree, Naive Bayesian, Instance Based Learning, Decision Table, One Rule, Random Tree and K-star. Among these methods, three of them are studied in more details. The results show that machine learning is a feasible alternative for keystroke authentication. Compared to the conventional Nearest Neighbour method in the recent research, learning methods especially Decision Tree can be more accurate. In addition, the experiment results reveal that 3-Grams is more accurate than 2-Grams and 4-Grams for feature extraction. Also, combination of attributes tend to result higher accuracy.

In this paper, we develop a post-pruning method of belief decision trees in order to reduce size and improve classification accuracy on unseen cases. The pruning of decision tree has a considerable intention in the areas of machine learning.

Support Vector Machine based Intelligent Watermark Decoding for Anticipated Attack	PROCEEDINGS OF WORLD ACADEMY OF SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY, VOL 15	Proceedings of World Academy of Science Engineering and Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference of the World-Academy-of-Science-Engineering-and-Technology	OCT 22-24, 2006	Barcelona, SPAIN			Bit Correct Ratio (BCR); Grid Search; Intelligent Decoding; Jackknife Technique; Support Vector Machine (SVM); Watermarking	IMAGES	In this paper, we present an innovative scheme of blindly extracting message bits from an image distorted by an attack. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to nonlinearly classify the bits of the embedded message. Traditionally, a hard decoder is used with the assumption that the underlying modeling of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients does not appreciably change. In case of an attack, the distribution of the image coefficients is heavily altered. The distribution of the sufficient statistics at the receiving end corresponding to the antipodal signals overlap and a simple hard decoder fails to classify them properly. We are considering message retrieval of antipodal signal as a binary classification problem. Machine learning techniques like SVM is used to retrieve the message, when certain specific class of attacks is most probable. In order to validate SVM based decoding scheme, we have taken Gaussian noise as a test case. We generate a data set using 125 images and 25 different keys. Polynomial kernel of SVM has achieved 100 percent accuracy on test data.

In this approach, we divide the whole task into two ordinal subtasks: tagging and identifying. We regard BaseNP tagging as a decision+making process, which can be accomplished through rough set theory. What characterizes our tagging procedure is feature reduction and rule optimization. The focus of this paper lies in three aspects. First, we present a description of rough set-based rule learning mechanism and concerning algorithms. Next, we give a detailed account of the finite state transducer (FST) for BaseNP identification. Finally, we discussed the handling of instance collisions for improving system performance. Experimental procedures are described in detail and results indicate that rough set-based approach shows good prospects In natural language processing (NLP). At the end of the paper, we discussed the shortcomings of this approach and put forward suggestions as to its improvement.

This particular procedure will transform continuous variables into discrete ones when dealing with continuous inputs with probabilistic and uncertain nature. Moreover, it describes fuzzy features better than other methods. To validate our method, this paper applied the fuzzy Bayesian network to classification of astrocytoma malignant degree. We present a probabilistic model that employs FBN in fusing both continuous low-level features and discrete high-level semantics from MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). It realizes quantificational analysis in predicting astrocytoma malignant level and provides a novel assistant way for young doctors. An accuracy of 81.67% was achieved out of 60 test samples, which satisfies the basic requirement of neuroradiologists.

Their infections influence the data security of many computer systems. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the identifying method of an anti-virus system. We have set up a project named MAV-Machine Learning Approach to Rule-based Anti-virus System. The aim of our research is to recognize all known computer viruses and to predict various unknown virus infections. In this paper, we introduce an association model of knowledge base and database to identify unknown viruses. The database stores information of diagnosed objects. The knowledge base contains certain deduction rule sets that run on two rule classes. The first class, an event-learning model, is used for a virus auto-protect agent. The second once, an explanation-learning model, is used for a virus-scanning agent. The experimentation results show that MAV can recognize unknown F-virus infections in high speed.

In this paper we propose to instead apply the well-developed machinery of machine learning in order to support the optimization of existing video encoders and the creation of new ones. Exemplarily, we show how by machine learning we can improve one encoding step that is crucial for the performance of all current video standards: macroblock mode decision. By formulating the problem in a Bayesian setup, we show that macroblock mode decision can be reduced to a classification problem with a cost function for misclassification that is sample dependent. We demonstrate how to apply different machine learning techniques to obtain suitable classifiers and we show in detailed experiments that all of these perform better than the state-of-the-art heuristic method.

This challenge was specifically addressed in BCI Competition 2005 [3]. Moreover, an effective BCI system should be adaptive to tackle the dynamic variations in brain signal. One of the solutions is to have its parameters adjustable while the system is used online. In this paper we introduce a new semi-supervised support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm. In this method, the feature extraction and classification are jointly performed in iterations. This method allows us to use a small training set to train the classifier while maintaining high performance. Therefore, the tedious initial calibration process is shortened. This algorithm can be used online to make the BCI svstem robust to possible signal changes. We analyze two important issues of the proposed algorithm, the robustness of the features to noise and the convergence of algorithm. We applied our method to data from BCI competition 2005, and the results demonstrated the validity of the proposed algorithm.

As image sources are now producing more images that we can realistically cope with, the goal is to explore the limits of these approaches for ATD/ATR in order to optimally define the domains in which decisions can be left to automated processes or should require human intervention. With this objective in mind, this paper presents an assessment of the performances of the Holographic Neural Technology (AND Corporation) to support applications that would require incremental learning.

The output architecture satisfies not only that the functional requirements but also the important qualities the system must possess. In ADD, the secondary qualities are satisfied within the constraints of achieving the most important ones. In this paper, we detail the design of our system's machine learning (ML) component using ADD. Tactics and primitives to achieve system qualities (i.e. performance, security, availability, modifiability, and usability) are essayed in this paper. The ML component of our system is responsible for (1) determining the appropriate media and modalities based on user context, (2) finding the replacement to a failed/missing device or modality, and (3) providing the context suitability of newly-added media or modality. The A component's knowledge acquisition is incremental; it keeps its previously-earned knowledge in its knowledge database (KO) and appends newly-acquired ones onto it. The ML component makes the system intelligent, adaptive and fault-tolerant. This work on ML-based media and modality selection is our original contribution to the domain of intelligent pervasive human-machine interface.

The adaptive controller modifies its predistortion coefficient setting continually as the operating condition changes. The learning module recognizes when the adaptive controller has converged, correlates the coefficient setting with the measured operating condition, and stores both in memory. The learning module also monitors the present operating condition and, in response to abrupt changes, restores past coefficients that were successful under similar conditions. Successful coefficient settings are stored in a fist that is indexed using a multi-dimensional attribute vector derived from the measured operating condition. Unlike look-up-tables with array structures, the list generates elements automatically. The size of the list is dynamic, growing as more operating conditions are experienced and contracting as neighboring elements are recognized as redundant.

We argue that the main reason for this is that the services themselves are usually not designed to be managed by an automatic management algorithm, such as one based on machine learning or control theory. Many times, the services themselves expose hundreds of tunable parameters and measurements with obscure and highly unpredictable relationships between them. This have given rise to many complicated, error prone and specialized algorithms for each single management goal and system, mainly because these services were not designed with control in mind. This paper presents eight design rules for the implementation of computer services that are easy to control. These rules have been derived from practical experience with several computer services and from theoretical results. If these rules are followed in the design process of the service, it is easy to apply standard solutions from fields such as control theory and machine learning to control the service and reach the desired management goals. We show how to apply these rules by using examples from existing computer services.

When used for classification, the SVM algorithm creates a hyper plane that separates the data into two classes with the maximum-margin. Given positive and negative training examples a maximum-margin hyper plane is identified where it splits the positive from the negative examples, while maximizing the margin. Transductive Inference enhances the learning process by attempting to achieve the lowest error rate possible given a small sample of training examples. In this research we developed a set of software tools to convert scientific abstracts into support vectors that could be used with an implementation of Support Vector Machine called SVM-Light to classify the abstracts. Three distinct classification experiments were conducted: First, to classify abstracts about RNA research out of a set of randomly selected Abstracts. Second, to classify abstracts about specific types of RNA research out of a set of abstracts that all contain the expression "RNA." Third, to classify tRNA, mRNA, snRNA, and rRNA abstracts individually out of a set of abstracts pertaining to the four categories of RNA.

Machine learning systems using pattern recognition largely assume that the patterns under consideration for classification are good enough to start. However, in general, the patterns are not enough or unknown for hard problem domain, Automatically generating patterns become necessary in the process of learning in many situations. A functional approach to pattern recognition is introduced. A Monte Carlo functional pattern recognition inspired by Ulam's Monte Carlo principle is also introduced. Any training process in a learning system can apply the existed patterns together with those being derived patterns from functional pattern recognition techniques proposed in this paper. The functional pattern recognition (FPR) is based on the functions defined in well-founded Zermenlo-Fraenko set theory. FPR is not only good for automatically generating patterns but also good for largely reducing the complexity of a problem.		Huang, JK (reprint author), POB 3355, Alhambra, CA 91803 USA.

New combinations of signal processing techniques are used to extract relevant signal features, which are robust against random process variations, external chance disturbances and presence of outliers, from the acquired data. Relationship between the extracted features and the observed values of tool wear is built using the support vector regression technique. This machine learning algorithm is accurate and robust for estimation of complex and non-linear relationship among the process variables. Grid search method is adopted to select the optimum model parameters. The developed models are validated on unseen testing data for their predicting capabilities. Significant results are obtained using the proposed method for both laboratory and industrial data.

Rapid design and reusability of previous work is made very difficult. For these reasons, the application of machine learning methods to dialogue strategy optimization has become a leading subject of researches this last decade. Yet, techniques such as reinforcement learning are very demanding in training data while obtaining a substantial amount of data in the particular case of spoken dialogues is time-consuming and therefore expansive. In order to expand existing data sets, dialogue simulation techniques are becoming a standard solution. In this paper we describe a user modeling technique for realistic simulation of man-machine goal-directed spoken dialogues. This model, based on a stochastic description of man-machine communication, unlike previously proposed models, is consistent along the interaction according to its history and a predefined user goal.

The proposed forecasting system adopts an integrated architecture. Firstly, a BCD classifier is applied to cluster the input data set into several subsets in an unsupervised manner. Then, groups of 24 SVMs for the next day's electricity price profile are used to fit the training data of each subset in a supervised way. To demonstrate the effectiveness, the proposed model has been trained and tested on the data of the historical energy prices from the New England electricity market.

To satisfy these demands, planning of more complex and flexible problem-solving systems is required. In the last decades many new technologies and techniques were developed to handle these growing demands. Apparently the object-oriented modelling methodology was the most efficient among them. However, nowadays the growing demands of the market gradually outgrow the abilities of the pure object-oriented concepts. One of the main reasons of this is that the decomposition techniques can not handle efficiently the numerous sub-systems with varying objective functions and constraints. The common problems appear in the untreatable complexity and the missed deadlines. The use of artificial intelligence means new concepts in the field the development processes. The agent-based programming gives the possibility to describe the functionality of the required system not only by using action-reaction pairs but by defining the goals and constraints in the system. Machine-learning helps to determine the connections, relations and logical behaviour in the dynamism of the modelled system and helps to reveal the effects of the none-modelled systems in the modelled system. This paper shows a method for revealing and handling the effects of a none-modelled system according to the observed behaviour of the modelled system.

First, the properties of chi(2)-test for text categorization are studied. One of the advantages off-test is that its significance level a is the same as the miss rate that provides a foundation for theoretical performance guarantee. The chi(2)-classifier also considers term aggregation and selection methods to improve the categorization performance. Generally cosine similarity with TF*IDF weighting function performs reasonably well in text categorization. However the performance of cosine similarity depends on the given threshold value, and its categorization performance may fluctuate even near the optimal threshold value. To alleviate the problems, the chi(2)-classifier proposes a combination of chi(2)-test and cosine similarity. Extensive experiment results have verified the properties of chi(2)-test and performance of the combined classifier.

Recently, popular machine learning algorithms have successfully been applied to wireless communication problems, notably spread spectrum receiver design, channel equalization, and adaptive beam forming with direction of arrival. estimation (DOA). The capacity of communication systems has limitations due to co channel interference. In Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), users can share the same frequency at the same time, but the number of users is limited by the Multi-User Interference (MUI). This paper presents an implementation of determination of Angle of Arrival (AOA) estimation based on nonlinear SVM Regressors (SVR), an important component of CDMA communication systems.

This proposed system is applied to a dynamically changable, continuous and large-scaled environment. To deal with the learning in such environment, the proposed system partitions the state-space into regions of states, called cells. By using cells, the states of the system can be reduced in which the number of states grows dramatically increasing in proportion to the number and quality of inputs. Through a series of manipulations of cells, the avatar can adapt itself to the changable environment. By adjusting the peferences of the proposed global-cell, the tendancy of exploration behavior of the avatar can be controlled to explore the potential path caused by the changing environment.

A core suite of such signal processing methods that fuse spectral channels has been implemented in an operational system; more systems are planned. Stricter performance requirements for future remote sensing applications will be met by evolutionary improvements on these techniques. Here we first describe the operational methods and then the related next generation nonlinear methods, whose performance is currently being evaluated. Next we show how a "dual" representation of these algorithms can serve as a springboard to a radically new direction in algorithm research. Using nonlinear mathematics borrowed from Machine Learning concepts, we show how hyperspectral data from a high-dimensional spectral space can be transformed onto a manifold of even higher dimension, in which robust decision surfaces can be more easily generated. Such surfaces, when projected back into spectral space, appear as enveloping blankets that circumscribe clutter distributions in a way that the standard, covariance-based methods cannot. This property may permit the design of extremely low false-alarm rate solutions to remote detection problems.

In practice, it can be used to search a large hypothesis space to get an optimal or an approximate optimal solution. Beam search algorithm retains its advantage in efficiency while reducing the risk of converging to locally optimal hypotheses. Beam search algorithm is widely used in AI field. To k-size beam search, due to only k paths is maintained the key to optimize the accuracy of beam search is how to select the k paths. In most of search algorithms, the k candidates with the most high performance measure value are selected at each search step. In this paper, the author presented some methods of candidate selection of beam search approaches, and the thought of avoiding "full of blood brother nodes" is presented. The experiments were done on the UCI repository of machine learning databases.

Using information from the 12 binary phenotypes and sex as input and Kofendrerd Personality Disorder disease status as the outcome of ADTrees-based classifiers, we obtained a new quantitative trait based on average prediction scores, which was then used for genome-wide quantitative trait linkage (QTL) analysis. ADTrees are machine learning methods that combine boosting and decision trees algorithms to generate smaller and easier-to-interpret classification rules. In this application, we compared four modeling strategies from the combinations of two boosting iterations (log or exponential loss functions) coupled with two choices of tree generation types (a full alternating decision tree or a classic boosting decision tree). These four different strategies were applied to the founders in each population to construct four classifiers, which were then applied to each study participant. To compute average prediction score for each subject with a specific trait profile, such a process was repeated with 10 runs of 10-fold cross validation, and standardized prediction scores obtained from the 10 runs were averaged and used in subsequent expectation-maximization Haseman-Elston QTL analyses (implemented in GENEHUNTER) with the approximate 900 SNPs in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium provided for each population. Our QTL analyses on the basis of four models (a full alternating decision tree and a classic boosting decision tree paired with either log or exponential loss function) detected evidence for linkage (Z = 1.96, p < 0.01) on chromosomes 1, 3, 5, and 9. Moreover, using average iteration and abundance scores for the 12 phenotypes and sex as their relevancy measurements, we found all relevant phenotypes for all four populations except phenotype b for the Karangar population, with suggested subgroup structure consistent with latent traits used in the model. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the ADTrees method may offer a more accurate representation of the disease status that allows for better detection of linkage evidence.

The 154 year long, biweekly time series of the Great Salt Lake volume has been analyzed by many researchers from this perspective. In this study, we present the application of a powerful state space reconstruction methodology using the method of support vector machines (SVM) to this data set. SVM are machine learning systems that use a hypothesis space of linear functions in a kernel-induced higher-dimensional feature space. SVM are optimized by minimizing a bound on a generalized error ( risk) measure rather than just the mean square error over a training set. Under Mercer's conditions on the kernels the corresponding optimization problems are convex; hence global optimal solutions can be readily computed. The SVM-based reconstruction is used to develop time series forecasts for multiple lead times ranging from 2 weeks to several months. Unlike previously reported methodologies, SVM are able to extract the dynamics using only a few past observed data points out of the training examples. The reliability of the algorithm in learning and forecasting the dynamics is tested using split sample sensitivity analysis, with a particular interest in forecasting extreme states. Efforts are also made to assess variations in predictability as a function of initial conditions and as a function of the degree of extrapolation from the state space used for learning the model.

Neural network classifiers are trained to classify life and death from labelled 9 x 9 game records. The performance is compared to standard classifiers from statistical pattern recognition. A recursive framework for classification is used to improve performance iteratively. Using a maximum of four iterations our cascaded scoring architecture (CSA*) scores 98.9% of the positions correctly. Nearly all incorrectly scored positions are recognised (they can be corrected by a human operator). By providing reliable score information CSA* opens the large source of Go knowledge implicitly available in human game records for automatic extraction. It thus paves the way for a successful application of machine learning in Go. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

There is some risk involved in using Opponent-Model search. For adequate forecasting, two conditions should be imposed. Both the prediction of the opponent's moves and the judgement of future positions should be of good quality. The two conditions heavily depend on the evaluation functions used. In the article we distinguish evaluation functions by type. Three fundamentally different types are introduced. Thorough analysis of a variety of characteristics leads to eight possible orderings. The role of the evaluation functions is studied by attempting to answer five research questions. Moreover, actual computer game-playing programs investigate the research questions by a series of experiments in which Opponent-Model search is performed. The game of Bao is our test bed, it was selected because of its relatively narrow game tree, which allowed for an appropriate search depth in the experiments. We restrict ourselves to five evaluation functions generated with the help of machine-learning techniques. A set of round-robin tournaments between these evaluation functions show that when the above conditions are met, Opponent-Model search can be applied successfully. Answers to the research questions are given in the conclusions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Denis, F; Gilleron, R; Letouzey, F				Denis, F; Gilleron, R; Letouzey, F			Learning from positive and unlabeled examples	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT 2000)	DEC 11-13, 2000	SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA	Univ New S Wales, Sch Comp Sci & Engn		PAC learning; statistical query model; semi-supervised learning; data mining		In many machine learning settings, labeled examples are difficult to collect while unlabeled data are abundant. Also, for some binary classification problems, positive examples which are elements of the target concept are available. Can these additional data be used to improve accuracy of supervised learning algorithms? We investigate in this paper the design of learning algorithms from positive and unlabeled data only. Many machine learning and data mining algorithms, such as decision tree induction algorithms and naive Bayes algorithms, use examples only to evaluate statistical queries (SQ-like algorithms). Kearns designed the statistical query learning model in order to describe these algorithms. Here, we design an algorithm scheme which transforms any SQ-Iike algorithm into an algorithm based on positive statistical queries (estimate for probabilities over the set of positive instances) and instance statistical queries (estimate for probabilities over the instance space). We prove that any class learnable in the statistical query learning model is learnable from positive statistical queries and instance statistical queries only if a lower bound on the weight of any target concept f can be estimated in polynomial time. Then, we design a decision tree induction algorithm POSC4.5, based on C4.5, that uses only positive and unlabeled examples and we give experimental results for this algorithm. In the case of imbalanced classes in the sense that one of the two classes (say the positive class) is heavily underrepresented compared to the other class, the learning problem remains open. This problem is challenging because it is encountered in many real-world applications. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To identify serum protein biomarkers specific for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) technology. Methods. A total of 103 serum samples from patients and healthy controls were analyzed. Thirty-four of the patients had a diagnosis of RA, based on the American College of Rheumatology criteria. The inflammation control group comprised 20 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), 9 with asthma, and 10 with Crohn's disease. The noninflammation control group comprised 14 patients with knee osteoarthritis and 16 healthy control subjects. Serum protein profiles were obtained by SELDI-TOF-MS and compared in order to identify new biomarkers specific for RA. Data were analyzed by a machine learning algorithm called decision tree boosting, according to different preprocessing steps. Results. The most discriminative mass/charge (m/z) values serving as potential biomarkers for RA were identified on arrays for both patients with RA versus controls and patients with RA versus patients with PsA. From among several candidates, the following peaks were highlighted: m/z values of 2,924 (RA versus controls on H4 arrays), 10,832 and 11,632 (RA versus controls on CM10 arrays), 4,824 (RA versus PsA on H4 arrays), and 4,666 (RA versus PsA on CM10 arrays). Positive results of proteomic analysis were associated with positive results of the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide test. Our observations suggested that the 10,832 peak could represent myeloid-related protein 8. Conclusion. SELDI-TOF-MS technology allows rapid analysis of many serum samples, and use of decision tree boosting analysis as the main statistical method allowed us to propose a pattern of protein peaks specific for RA:.

J	Andrade, AO; Nasuto, S; Kyberd, P; Sweeney-Reed, CM				Andrade, AO; Nasuto, S; Kyberd, P; Sweeney-Reed, CM			Generative topographic mapping applied to clustering and visualization of motor unit action potentials	BIOSYSTEMS			English	Article						cluster analysis; electromyography; motor unit action potentials; generative topographic mapping; self-organizing map	SIGNAL DECOMPOSITION; MYOELECTRIC SIGNAL; EMG SIGNALS; CLASSIFICATION; ELECTROMYOGRAPHY; NETWORK	The identification and visualization of clusters formed by motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) is an essential step in investigations seeking to explain the control of the neuromuscular system. This work introduces the generative topographic mapping (GTM), a novel machine learning tool, for clustering of MUAPs, and also it extends the GTM technique to provide a way of visualizing MUAPs. The performance of GTM was compared to that of three other clustering methods: the self-organizing map (SOM), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and the neural-gas network (NGN). The results, based on the study of experimental MUAPs, showed that the rate of success of both GTM and SOM outperformed that of GMM and NGN, and also that GTM may in practice be used as a principled alternative to the SOM in the study of MUAPs. A visualization tool, which we called GTM grid, was devised for visualization of MUAPs lying in a high-dimensional space. The visualization provided by the GTM grid was compared to that obtained from principal component analysis (PCA). (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A method for automatic rules induction called AREX using evolutionary induction of decision trees and automatic programming is introduced. The proposed algorithm is applied to a cardiovascular dataset consisting of different groups of attributes which should possibly reveal the presence of some specific cardiovascular problems in young patients. A case study is presented that shows the use of AREX for the classification of patients and for discovering possible new medical knowledge from the dataset. The defined knowledge discovery loop comprises a medical expert's assessment of induced rules to drive the evolution of rule sets towards more appropriate solutions. The final result is the discovery of a possible new medical knowledge in the field of pediatric cardiology. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This is an extremely challenging problem owing to the many sources of variation in a person's imaged appearance: pose variation, scale, facial expression, illumination, partial occlusion, motion blur, etc. The method developed in this work combines approaches from computer vision, for detection and pose estimation, with those from machine learning for classification. A 'generative' model of a person's head is defined consisting of a coarse 3-D model and multiple texture maps. This allows faces to be rendered with a variety of facial expressions and at poses differing from those of the training data. It is shown that the identity of a target face can then be determined by first proposing faces with similar pose, and then classifying the target face as one of the proposed faces or not. Furthermore, the texture maps of the model can be automatically updated as new poses and expressions are detected. Results of detecting three characters in a TV situation comedy are demonstrated.

J	Stanley, KO; Bryant, BD; Miikkulainen, R				Stanley, KO; Bryant, BD; Miikkulainen, R			Real-time neuroevolution in the NERO video game	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						interactive; online; neural networks; neuroevolution; neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT); neuroevolving robotic operatives (NERO); real-time; video games	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; EVOLUTION; TOPOLOGIES; ALGORITHM; GENES	In most modern video games, character behavior is scripted; no matter how many times the player exploits a weakness, that weakness is never repaired. Yet, if game characters could learn through interacting with the player, behavior could improve as the game is played, keeping it interesting. This paper introduces the real-time Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (rtNEAT) method for evolving increasingly complex artificial neural networks in real time, as a game is being played. The rtNEAT method allows agents to change and improve during the game. In fact, rtNEAT makes possible an entirely new genre of video games in which the player trains a team of agents through a series of customized exercises. To demonstrate this concept, the Neuroevolving Robotic Operatives (NERO) game was built based on rtNEAT. In NERO, the player trains a team of virtual robots for combat against other players' teams. This paper describes results from this novel application of machine learning, and demonstrates that rtNEAT makes possible video games like NERO where agents evolve and adapt in real time. In the future, rtNEAT may allow new kinds of educational and training applications through interactive and adapting games.

J	Wang, YQ; Wang, SY; Lai, KK				Wang, YQ; Wang, SY; Lai, KK			A new fuzzy support vector machine to evaluate credit risk	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						classification; credit scoring; fuzzy theory; machine learning; support vector machine (SVM)	ROUGH SETS; MODELS	Due to recent financial crises and regulatory concerns, financial intermediaries' credit risk assessment is an area of renewed interest in both the academic world and the business community. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy support vector machine to discriminate good creditors from bad ones. Because in credit scoring areas we usually cannot label one customer as absolutely good who is sure to repay in time, or absolutely bad who will default certainly, our new fuzzy support vector machine treats every sample as both positive and negative classes, but with different memberships. By this way we expect the new fuzzy support vector machine to have more generalization ability, while preserving the merit of insensitive to outliers, as the fuzzy support vector machine (SVM) proposed in previous papers. We reformulate this kind of two-group classification problem into a quadratic programming problem. Empirical tests on three public datasets show that it can have better discriminatory power than the standard support vector machine and the fuzzy support vector machine if appropriate kernel and membership generation method are chosen.

In this paper, a novel approach for the classification of cavity sizes, based on their maximum PD charge transfer-applied voltage (Delta Q-V) characteristics using a fuzzy decision tree system, is proposed. The (Delta Q-V) partial discharge patterns for different cavity sizes are represented by features extracted from their pulse shapes, and the classification rules are directly extracted from the data using the decision tree. The decision rules obtained from the decision tree are then converted to the fuzzy IF-then rules, and the back-propagation algorithm is utilized to tune the parameters of the membership functions employed in the fuzzy classifier. The neuro-fuzzy classification technique is shown to provide successful classification of void sizes in an easily interpretive fashion.

In this paper, we present a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) algorithm for learning the parameters and classifying the states of a state-space model with a Markov switching. A stochastic implementation based on the Gibbs sampler is introduced in the expectation step of the MCEM algorithm. We study the asymptotic properties of the proposed algorithm, and we also describe how a nesting approach and the Rao-Blackwellized forms can be employed to accelerate the rate of convergence of the MCEM algorithm. Finally, the performance and the effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated by applications to simulated and physiological experimental data.

However, no one technique is best for all users in all situations. To combat this, we have previously developed a market-based recommender system that allows multiple agents ( each representing a different recommendation method or system) to compete with one another to present their best recommendations to the user. In our system, the marketplace encourages good recommendations by rewarding the corresponding agents who supplied them according to the users' ratings of their suggestions. Moreover, we have theoretically shown how our system incites the agents to bid in a manner that ensures only the best recommendations are presented. To do this effectively in practice, however, each agent needs to be able to classify its recommendations into different internal quality levels, learn the users' interests for these different levels, and then adapt its bidding behavior for the various levels accordingly. To this end, in this paper, we develop a reinforcement learning and Boltzmann exploration strategy that the recommending agents can exploit for these tasks. We then demonstrate that this strategy does indeed help the agents to effectively obtain information about the users' interests which, in turn, speeds up the market convergence and enables the system to rapidly highlight the best recommendations.

In this paper, we study this issue in cost-sensitive learning that considers both test costs and misclassification costs. If some attributes ( tests) are too expensive in obtaining their values, it would be more cost-effective to miss out their values, similar to skipping expensive and risky tests ( missing values) in patient diagnosis ( classification). That is, "missing is useful" as missing values actually reduces the total cost of tests and misclassifications and, therefore, it is not meaningful to impute their values. We discuss and compare several strategies that utilize only known values and that "missing is useful" for cost reduction in cost-sensitive decision tree learning.

Currently, the only definitive method to ascertain the presence of prostatic cancer is by trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) directed biopsy. Owing to the poor image quality of ultrasound, the accuracy of TRUS is only 20%-25%. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to have a higher accuracy of prostate cancer detection compared to ultrasound. Consequently, several researchers have been exploring the use of high resolution MRI in performing prostate biopsies. Visual detection of prostate cancer, however, continues to be difficult owing to its apparent lack of shape, and the fact that several malignant and benign structures have overlapping intensity and texture characteristics. In this paper, we present a fully automated computer-aided detection (CAD) system for detecting prostatic adenocarcinoma from 4 Testa ex vivo magnetic resonance (MR) imagery of the prostate. After the acquired MR images have been corrected for background inhomogeneity and nonstandardness, novel three-dimensional (3-D) texture features are extracted from the 3-D MRI scene. A Bayesian classifier then assigns each image voxel a "likelihood" of malignancy for each feature independently. The "likelihood" images generated in this fashion are then combined using an optimally weighted feature combination scheme. Quantitative evaluation was performed by comparing the CAD results with the manually ascertained ground truth for the tumor on the MRL The tumor labels on the MR slices were determined manually by an expert by visually registering the MR slices with the corresponding regions on the histology slices. We evaluated our CAD system on a total of 33 two-dimensional (2-D) MR slices from five different 3-D MR prostate studies. Five slices from two different glands were used for training. Our feature combination scheme was found to outperform the individual texture features, and also other popularly used feature combination methods, including AdaBoost, ensemble averaging, and majority voting. Further, in several instances our CAD system performed better than the experts in terms of accuracy, the expert segmentations being determined solely from visual inspection of the MRI data. In addition, the intrasystem variability (changes in CAD accuracy with changes in values of system parameters) was significantly lower than the corresponding intraobserver and interobserver variability. CAD performance was found to be very similar for different training sets. Future work will focus on extending the methodology to guide high-resolution MRI-assisted in vivo prostate biopsies.

J	An, SJ; Hua, YB; Manton, JH; Fang, Z				An, SJ; Hua, YB; Manton, JH; Fang, Z			Group decorrelation enhanced subspace method for identifying FIR MIMO channels driven by unknown uncorrelated colored sources	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						adaptive signal processing; blind deconvolution; blind identification; machine learning; MIMO channels; sensor array processing; source separation; system identification	BLIND IDENTIFICATION; 2ND-ORDER STATISTICS; SEPARATION; SYSTEMS	Identification of finite-impulse-response (FIR) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels driven by unknown uncorrelated colored sources is a challenging problem. In this paper, a group decorrelation enhanced subspace (GDES) method is presented. The GDES method uses the idea of subspace decomposition and signal decorrelation more effectively than the joint diagonalization enhanced subspace (JDES) method previously reported in the literature. The GDES method has a much better performance than the JDES method. The correctness of the GDES method is proved assuming that 1) the channel matrix is irreducible and column reduced and 2) the source spectral matrix has distinct diagonal functions. However, the GDES method has an inherent ability to trade off between the required condition on the channel matrix and that on the source spectral matrix. Simulations show that the GDES method yields good results even when the channel matrix is not irreducible, which is not possible at all for the JDES method.
