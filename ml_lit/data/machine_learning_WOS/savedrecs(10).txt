Fungible Orthogonal Channel Sets for Multi-User Exploitation of Spectrum	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Cognitive radio; dynamic spectrum access; machine learning; opportunistic channel selection	COGNITIVE RADIO NETWORKS; MEDIUM ACCESS	This paper proposes a two-stage process for assigning fungible orthogonal channel sets to multiple cognitive radios (CRs) for opportunistic spectrum access. Assigning orthogonal channel sets to the CRs eliminates the possibility of collision among them, and allows the CRs to focus on avoiding collisions with the primary user (PU). In particular, each CR uses a learning-based dynamic channel selection (DCS) algorithm to maximize the exploitation of the assigned channels. We propose a neural network that can accurately estimate the performance of the adopted learning-based DCS algorithm on a set of channels, using the duty cycle and the complexity of the PU's behavior on the channels. Our simulations on synthetic and real measurement data sets show that the proposed channel sets allocation algorithm, together with the neural network, significantly outperforms a method that selects channels with the lowest duty cycle.

Organizational metrics of interchromatin speckle factor domains: integrative classifier for stem cell adhesion & lineage signaling	INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY			English	Article							OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION; IN-VITRO; MESENCHYMAL CELLS; SUBSTRATE; BIOMATERIALS; TOPOGRAPHY; NUCLEUS; PATHWAY; SHAPE; FATE	Stem cell fates on biomaterials are influenced by the complex confluence of microenvironmental cues emanating from soluble growth factors, cell-to-cell contacts, and biomaterial properties. Cell-microenvironment interactions influence the cell fate by initiating a series of outside-in signaling events that traverse from the focal adhesions to the nucleus via the cytoskeleton and modulate the sub-nuclear protein organization and gene expression. Here, we report a novel imaging-based framework that highlights the spatial organization of sub-nuclear proteins, specifically the splicing factor SC-35 in the nucleoplasm, as an integrative marker to distinguish between minute differences of stem cell lineage pathways in response to stimulatory soluble factors, surface topologies, and microscale topographies. This framework involves the high resolution image acquisition of SC-35 domains and imaging-based feature extraction to obtain quantitative nuclear metrics in tandem with machine learning approaches to generate a predictive cell state classification model. The acquired SC-35 metrics led to 490% correct classification of emergent human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) phenotypes in populations of hMSCs exposed for merely 3 days to basal, adipogenic, or osteogenic soluble cues, as well as varying levels of dexamethasone-induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression. Early osteogenic cellular responses across a series of surface patterns, fibrous scaffolds, and micropillars were also detected and classified using this imaging-based methodology. Complex cell states resulting from inhibition of RhoGTPase, beta-catenin, and FAK could be classified with 490% sensitivity on the basis of differences in the SC-35 organizational metrics. This indicates that SC-35 organization is sensitively impacted by adhesion-related signaling molecules that regulate osteogenic differentiation. Our results show that diverse microenvironment cues affect different attributes of the SC-35 organizational metrics and lead to distinct emergent organizational patterns. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the early organization of SC-35 domains could serve as a "fingerprint'' of the intracellular mechanotransductive signaling that governs growth factor-and topography-responsive stem cell states.

We therefore propose a binary classifier called Nokoi that allows fast yet reliable decoy-free separation of correct from incorrect peptide-to-spectrum matches (PSMs). Nokoi was trained on a very large collection of heterogeneous data using ranks supplied by the Mascot search engine to label correct and incorrect PSMs. We show that Nokoi outperforms Mascot and achieves a performance very close to that of Percolator at substantially higher processing speeds.

Models for predicting objective function weights in prostate cancer IMRT	MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						knowledge-based treatment planning; machine learning; inverse optimization	INTENSITY-MODULATED RADIOTHERAPY; CONVEX PARETO SURFACES; RADIATION-THERAPY; DOSE OPTIMIZATION; PATIENT GEOMETRY; QUALITY-CONTROL; AT-RISK; ALGORITHM	Purpose: To develop and evaluate the clinical applicability of advanced machine learning models that simultaneously predict multiple optimization objective function weights from patient geometry for intensity-modulated radiation therapy of prostate cancer. Methods: A previously developed inverse optimization method was applied retrospectively to determine optimal objective function weights for 315 treated patients. The authors used an overlap volume ratio (OV) of bladder and rectum for different PTV expansions and overlap volume histogram slopes (OVSR and OVSB for the rectum and bladder, respectively) as explanatory variables that quantify patient geometry. Using the optimal weights as ground truth, the authors trained and applied three prediction models: logistic regression (LR), multinomial logistic regression (MLR), and weighted K-nearest neighbor (KNN). The population average of the optimal objective function weights was also calculated. Results: The OV at 0.4 cm and OVSR at 0.1 cm features were found to be the most predictive of the weights. The authors observed comparable performance (i.e., no statistically significant difference) between LR, MLR, and KNN methodologies, with LR appearing to perform the best. All three machine learning models outperformed the population average by a statistically significant amount over a range of clinical metrics including bladder/rectum V53Gy, bladder/rectum V70Gy, and dose to the bladder, rectum, CTV, and PTV. When comparing the weights directly, the LR model predicted bladder and rectum weights that had, on average, a 73% and 74% relative improvement over the population average weights, respectively. The treatment plans resulting from the LR weights had, on average, a rectum V70Gy that was 35% closer to the clinical plan and a bladder V70Gy that was 29% closer, compared to the population average weights. Similar results were observed for all other clinical metrics. Conclusions: The authors demonstrated that the KNN and MLR weight prediction methodologies perform comparably to the LR model and can produce clinical quality treatment plans by simultaneously predicting multiple weights that capture trade-offs associated with sparing multiple OARs.

J	Okada, K; Rysavy, S; Flores, A; Linguraru, MG				Okada, Kazunori; Rysavy, Steven; Flores, Arturo; Linguraru, Marius George			Noninvasive differential diagnosis of dental periapical lesions in cone-beam CT scans	MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						computer-aided diagnosis; dental imaging; periapical lesion; noninvasive diagnosis; cone-beam computed tomography	LINEAR DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS; IMAGE SEGMENTATION; 3-D RECONSTRUCTION; RADICULAR CYSTS; ORAL-SURGERY; RANDOM-WALKS; TOMOGRAPHY; GRANULOMAS; SYSTEM	Purpose: This paper proposes a novel application of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) to an everyday clinical dental challenge: the noninvasive differential diagnosis of periapical lesions between periapical cysts and granulomas. A histological biopsy is the most reliable method currently available for this differential diagnosis; however, this invasive procedure prevents the lesions from healing noninvasively despite a report that they may heal without surgical treatment. A CAD using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) offers an alternative noninvasive diagnostic tool which helps to avoid potentially unnecessary surgery and to investigate the unknown healing process and rate for the lesions. Methods: The proposed semiautomatic solution combines graph-based random walks segmentation with machine learning-based boosted classifiers and offers a robust clinical tool with minimal user interaction. As part of this CAD framework, the authors provide two novel technical contributions: (1) probabilistic extension of the random walks segmentation with likelihood ratio test and (2) LDA-AdaBoost: a new integration of weighted linear discriminant analysis to AdaBoost. Results: A dataset of 28 CBCT scans is used to validate the approach and compare it with other popular segmentation and classification methods. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method with 94.1% correct classification rate and an improvement of the performance by comparison with the Simon's state-of-the-art method by 17.6%. The authors also compare classification performances with two independent ground-truth sets from the histopathology and CBCT diagnoses provided by endodontic experts. Conclusions: Experimental results of the authors show that the proposed CAD system behaves in clearer agreement with the CBCT ground-truth than with histopathology, supporting the Simon's conjecture that CBCT diagnosis can be as accurate as histopathology for differentiating the periapical lesions.

Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning is a lengthy process, which requires the planner to iterate between choosing beam angles, specifying dose-volume objectives and executing IMRT optimization. In thorax treatment planning, where there are no class solutions for beam placement, beam angle selection is performed manually, based on the planner's clinical experience. The purpose of this work is to propose and study a computationally efficient framework that utilizes machine learning to automatically select treatment beam angles. Such a framework may be helpful for reducing the overall planning workload. Methods: The authors introduce an automated beam selection method, based on learning the relationships between beam angles and anatomical features. Using a large set of clinically approved IMRT plans, a random forest regression algorithm is trained to map a multitude of anatomical features into an individual beam score. An optimization scheme is then built to select and adjust the beam angles, considering the learned interbeam dependencies. The validity and quality of the automatically selected beams evaluated using the manually selected beams from the corresponding clinical plans as the ground truth. Results: The analysis included 149 clinically approved thoracic IMRT plans. For a randomly selected test subset of 27 plans, IMRT plans were generated using automatically selected beams and compared to the clinical plans. The comparison of the predicted and the clinical beam angles demonstrated a good average correspondence between the two (angular distance 16.8 degrees +/- 10 degrees, correlation 0.75 +/- 0.2). The dose distributions of the semiautomatic and clinical plans were equivalent in terms of primary target volume coverage and organ at risk sparing and were superior over plans produced with fixed sets of common beam angles. The great majority of the automatic plans (93%) were approved as clinically acceptable by three radiation therapy specialists. Conclusions: The results demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing a learning-based approach for automatic selection of beam angles in thoracic IMRT planning. The proposed method may assist in reducing the manual planning workload, while sustaining plan quality. (C) 2015 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

In this study, 829 diverse compounds with rat carcinogenicity were collected from Carcinogenic Potency Database (CPDB). Using six types of fingerprints to represent the molecules, 30 binary and ternary classification models were generated to predict chemical carcinogenicity by five machine learning methods. The models were evaluated by an external validation set containing 87 chemicals from ISSCAN database. The best binary model was developed by MACCS keys and kNN algorithm with predictive accuracy at 83.91 %, while the best ternary model was also generated by MACCS keys and kNN algorithm with overall accuracy at 80.46 %. Furthermore, the best binary and ternary classification models were used to estimate carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke components containing 2251 compounds. 981 ones were predicted as carcinogens by binary classification model, while 110 compounds were predicted as strong carcinogens and 807 ones as weak carcinogens by ternary classification model. The results indicated that our models would be helpful for prediction of chemical carcinogenicity.

Novel Uses of In Vitro Data to Develop Quantitative Biological Activity Relationship Models for in Vivo Carcinogenicity Prediction	MOLECULAR INFORMATICS			English	Article						Computational toxicology; In vitro data; Biological descriptors; Quantitative biological activity relationship (QBAR); Carcinogenicity; OECD; REACH	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CYTOCHROMES P450; RISK-ASSESSMENT; RANDOM FOREST; XENOBIOTIC-METABOLISM; HUMAN HAZARD; ASSAY DATA; TOXICOLOGY; QSAR; CHEMICALS	The availability of large in vitro datasets enables better insight into the mode of action of chemicals and better identification of potential mechanism(s) of toxicity. Several studies have shown that not all in vitro assays can contribute as equal predictors of in vivo carcinogenicity for development of hybrid Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) models. We propose two novel approaches for the use of mechanistically relevant in vitro assay data in the identification of relevant biological descriptors and development of Quantitative Biological Activity Relationship (QBAR) models for carcinogenicity prediction. We demonstrate that in vitro assay data can be used to develop QBAR models for in vivo carcinogenicity prediction via two case studies corroborated with firm scientific rationale. The case studies demonstrate the similarities between QBAR and QSAR modeling in: (i) the selection of relevant descriptors to be used in the machine learning algorithm, and (ii) the development of a computational model that maps chemical or biological descriptors to a toxic endpoint. The results of both the case studies show: (i) improved accuracy and sensitivity which is especially desirable under regulatory requirements, and (ii) overall adherence with the OECD/REACH guidelines. Such mechanism based models can be used along with QSAR models for prediction of mechanistically complex toxic endpoints.

Based on the common overlap with other chronic disorders of visceral or somatic pain, mood and affect, and their responsiveness to centrally targeted treatments, an important role of central nervous system in their pathophysiology is likely. A growing number of brain imaging studies in irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, and bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis has identified abnormalities in evoked brain responses, resting state activity, and connectivity, as well as in gray and white matter properties. Structural and functional alterations in brain regions of the salience, emotional arousal, and sensorimotor networks, as well as in prefrontal regions, are the most consistently reported findings. Some of these changes show moderate correlations with behavioral and clinical measures. Most recently, data-driven machine-learning approaches to larger data sets have been able to classify visceral pain syndromes from healthy control subjects. Future studies need to identify the mechanisms underlying the altered brain signatures of chronic visceral pain and identify targets for therapeutic interventions.

Quantitative ultrasound texture analysis of fetal lungs to predict neonatal respiratory morbidity	ULTRASOUND IN OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY			English	Article						fetal lung maturity; image quantitative analysis; neonatal respiratory morbidity; texture analysis	LAMELLAR BODY COUNT; EARLY-TERM BIRTH; DISTRESS-SYNDROME; LATE-PRETERM; LECITHIN/SPHINGOMYELIN RATIO; IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; AMNIOTIC-FLUID; MATURITY; GESTATIONS; AMNIOCENTESIS	Objective To develop and evaluate the performance of a novel method for predicting neonatal respiratory morbidity based on quantitative analysis of the fetal lung by ultrasound. Methods More than 13 000 non-clinical images and 900 fetal lung images were used to develop a computerized method based on texture analysis and machine learning algorithms, trained to predict neonatal respiratory morbidity risk on fetal lung ultrasound images. The method, termed 'quantitative ultrasound fetal lung maturity analysis' (quantusFLM (TM)), was then validated blindly in 144 neonates, delivered at 28 + 0 to 39 + 0 weeks' gestation. Lung ultrasound images in DICOM format were obtained within 48 h of delivery and the ability of the software to predict neonatal respiratory morbidity, defined as either respiratory distress syndrome or transient tachypnea of the newborn, was determined. Results Mean (SD) gestational age at delivery was 36 + 1 (3 + 3) weeks. Among the 144 neonates, there were 29 (20.1%) cases of neonatal respiratory morbidity. Quantitative texture analysis predicted neonatal respiratory morbidity with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 86.2%, 87.0%, 62.5% and 96.2%, respectively. Conclusions Quantitative ultrasound fetal lung maturity analysis predicted neonatal respiratory morbidity with an accuracy comparable to that of current tests using amniotic fluid.

A unifying learning framework for building artificial game-playing agents	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Behavioral game theory; Graphical model; Multi-agent learning; Fictitious play; Hidden Markov model	EXPERIENCE; EQUILIBRIA; CONSTANT; SYSTEMS; MODELS	This paper investigates learning-based agents that are capable of mimicking human behavior in game playing, a central task in computational economics. Although computational economists have developed various game-playing agents, well-established machine learning methods such as graphical models have not been applied before. Leveraging probabilistic graphical models, this paper presents a novel sequential Bayesian network (SBN) framework for building artificial game-playing agents. We show that many existing agents, including reinforcement learning, fictitious play, and many of their variants, have a unified Bayesian explanation within the proposed SBN framework. Moreover, we discover that SBN can handle various important settings of game playing, allowing for a broad scope of its use in economics. SBN not only provides a unifying and satisfying framework to explain existing learning approaches in virtual economies, but also enables the development of new algorithms that are stronger or have fewer restrictions. In this paper, we derive a new algorithm, Hidden Markovian Play (HMP), from the generic SBN model to handle an important but difficult setting in which a player cannot observe the opponent's strategy and payoff. It leverages Markovian learning to infer unobservable information, leading to higher quality of the agents. Experiments on real-world field experiments in evaluating economies show that our HMP model outperforms the baseline algorithms for building artificial agents.

However, application of LS-SVMs and other RKHS variants in the identification context is formulated as a regularized linear regression aiming at the minimization of the 2 loss of the prediction error. This formulation corresponds to the assumption of an auto-regressive noise structure, which is often found to be too restrictive in practical applications. In this paper, Instrumental Variable (IV) based estimation is integrated into the LS-SVM approach, providing, under minor conditions, consistent identification of nonlinear systems regarding the noise modeling error. It is shown how the cost function of the LS-SVM is modified to achieve an IV-based solution. Although, a practically well applicable choice of the instrumental variable is proposed for the derived approach, optimal choice of this instrument in terms of the estimates associated variance still remains to be an open problem. The effectiveness of the proposed IV based LS-SVM scheme is also demonstrated by a Monte Carlo study based simulation example. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We determine which forest crop attributes are significant in predicting the product proportions (of sawlog, pallet, stake, and pulp) based on an Irish data set supplied by Coillte, the Irish state forestry company. Dirichlet regression and neural networks are applied to predict the product proportions and evaluated against a multivariate multiple regression benchmark model. Based on predictive performance, the neural network performs slightly better in comparison to Dirichlet regression. However, assessing the model logic and taking account of user interpretation, the Dirichlet regression outperforms the neural network. Both models are also compared to an existing rule-based model used by Coillte. The nonparametric and machine learning techniques provided consistent reliable models to accurately predict the PEP proportions. The two proposed models extend the versatility of nonparametric and machine learning techniques to areas such as forestry.

J	Deb, S; Monogioudis, P				Deb, Supratim; Monogioudis, Pantelis			Learning-Based Uplink Interference Management in 4G LTE Cellular Systems	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING			English	Article						4G LTE; interference management; power control; HetNet; self-optimizing networks (SONs)	POWER-CONTROL; SIR REGION; NETWORKS; COORDINATION; PERFORMANCE; CONVEXITY; SCHEME	LTE's uplink (UL) efficiency critically depends on how the interference across different cells is controlled. The unique characteristics of LTE's modulation and UL resource assignment poses considerable challenges in achieving this goal because most LTE deployments have 1:1 frequency reuse, and the uplink interference can vary considerably across successive time-slots. In this paper, we propose LeAP, a measurement data-driven machine learning paradigm for power control to manage uplink interference in LTE. The data-driven approach has the inherent advantage that the solution adapts based on network traffic, propagation, and network topology, which is increasingly heterogeneous with multiple cell-overlays. LeAP system design consists of the following components:1) design of user equipment (UE) measurement statistics that are succinct, yet expressive enough to capture the network dynamics, and 2) design of two learning-based algorithms that use the reported measurements to set the power control parameters and optimize the network performance. LeAP is standards-compliant and can be implemented in a centralized self-organized networking (SON) server resource (cloud). We perform extensive evaluations using radio network plans from a real LTE network operational in a major metro area in the US. Our results show that, compared to existing approaches, LeAP provides 4.9x gain in the 20th percentile of user data rate, 3.25x gain in median data rate.

J	Hong, J; Ohtsuki, T				Hong, Jihoon; Ohtsuki, Tomoaki			Signal Eigenvector-Based Device-Free Passive Localization Using Array Sensor	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Antenna array; device-free localization; machine learning; support vector machine (SVM)	RECOGNITION; NETWORKS; SYSTEMS	Device-free passive (DFP) localization techniques have received increasing attention for location-based services due to their ability to realize localization without holding any wireless device. Most of the existing DFP localization systems are based on the measurement of received signal strength (RSS) only. However, the localization accuracy is easily affected by the spatial and temporal variance of RSS due to multipath fading and noise, even in a static environment. In this paper, we propose a novel localization system for DFP localization using an array sensor, which uses an antenna array at a receiver and is mainly based on the signal eigenvector. We use a fingerprinting technique with multiclass support vector machines (SVMs) based on a combination of array signal features with spatial and temporal averaging. We evaluate the localization performance of our proposed system in different propagation environments, i.e., line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS). In addition, we analyze two types of receive antenna placement, i.e., centralized and distributed antennas. The experimental results show that the localization accuracy can be improved by the proposed system, particularly in the centralized antenna case. Moreover, they show that the proposed system can improve localization accuracy compared with the conventional RSS-only-based system.

Matching pairs of sparse features are extracted from subsequent frames, and the resulting optical flow information is divided into two classes (static or dynamic) using the RANSAC algorithm. This initial classification is then used to incrementally train a Gaussian process (GP) classifier that is then able to segment dynamic objects in new images. The GP hyperparameters are optimized online during navigation, with new data being gradually incorporated into the non-parametric model as it becomes available while redundant data is discarded, to maintain a near-constant computational cost. The result is a vector containing the probability that each pixel in the image belongs to a dynamic object, along with the corresponding uncertainty estimate of this classification. Experiments conducted using different robotic platforms, ranging from modified cars (driving at speeds of up to 50km/h) to portable cameras (with a full six-degree-of-freedom range of motion), show promising results even in highly unstructured environments with cars, buses and pedestrians as dynamic objects. We also show how it is possible to cluster individual dynamic pixels into different object instances, and then further cluster those into semantically meaningful categories without any prior knowledge of the environment. Finally, we provide visual odometry results that testify to the proposed algorithm's ability to correctly segment (and then remove) dynamic objects from a scene, and how this translates into a more accurate motion estimate between frames.

Clinical Vestibular Testing Assessed With Machine-Learning Algorithms	JAMA OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY			English	Article							SINUSOIDAL HARMONIC ACCELERATION; HEAD IMPULSE TEST; PERIPHERAL VESTIBULOPATHY; VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; CALORIC TEST; CLASSIFICATION; PREVALENCE; NYSTAGMUS; NEURITIS; VERTIGO	IMPORTANCE Dizziness and imbalance are common clinical problems, and accurate diagnosis depends on determining whether damage is localized to the peripheral vestibular system. Vestibular testing guides this determination, but the accuracy of the different tests is not known. OBJECTIVE To determine how well each element of the vestibular test battery segregates patients with normal peripheral vestibular function from those with unilateral reductions in vestibular function. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective analysis of vestibular test batteries in 8080 patients. Clinical medical records were reviewed for a subset of individuals with the reviewers blinded to the vestibular test data. INTERVENTIONS A group of machine-learning classifiers were trained using vestibular test data from persons who were "manually" labeled as having normal vestibular function or unilateral vestibular damage based on a review of their medical records. The optimal trained classifier was then used to categorize patients whose diagnoses were unknown, allowing us to determine the information content of each element of the vestibular test battery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The information provided by each element of the vestibular test battery to segregate individuals with normal vestibular function from those with unilateral vestibular damage. RESULTS The time constant calculated from the rotational test ranked first in information content, and measures that were related physiologically to the rotational time constant were 10 of the top 12 highest-ranked variables. The caloric canal paresis ranked eighth, and the other elements of the test battery provided minimal additional information. The sensitivity of the rotational time constant was 77.2%, and the sensitivity of the caloric canal paresis was 59.6%; the specificity of the rotational time constant was 89.0%, and the specificity of the caloric canal paresis was 64.9%. The diagnostic accuracy of the vestibular test battery increased from 72.4% to 93.4% when the data were analyzed with the optimal machine-learning classifier. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Rotational testing should be considered the primary test to diagnose unilateral peripheral vestibular damage in patients with dizziness or imbalance. Most physicians, however, continue to rely on caloric tests to guide their diagnoses. Our results support a significant shift in the approach used to determine diagnoses in patients with vestibular symptoms.

Few operational flood-forecast models are available in the region. Here, we integrated a number of proven technologies in a novel way to produce a super-ensemble forecast system for the Englishman River, a flood-prone stream on Vancouver Island. This three-day-ahead modeling system utilizes up to 42 numerical weather prediction model outputs from the North American Ensemble Forecast System, combined with six artificial neural network-based streamflow models representing various slightly different system conceptualizations, all of which were trained exclusively on historical high-flow data. As such, the system combines relatively low model development times and costs with the generation of fully probabilistic forecasts reflecting uncertainty in the simulation of both atmospheric and terrestrial hydrologic dynamics. Results from operational testing by British Columbia's flood forecasting agency during the 2013-2014 storm season suggest that the prediction system is operationally useful and robust.

This review provides an overview of the most important new technologies and their applications. A MEDLINE database search was performed revealing a total of 1702 references. All references were considered for information on six main topics, namely image guidance and navigation, robot-assisted surgery, human-machine interface, surgical processes and clinical pathways, computer-assisted surgical training, and clinical decision support. Further references were obtained through cross-referencing the bibliography cited in each work. Based on their respective field of expertise, the authors chose 64 publications relevant for the purpose of this review. Computer-assisted systems are increasingly used not only in experimental studies but also in clinical studies. Although computer-assisted abdominal surgery is still in its infancy, the number of studies is constantly increasing, and clinical studies start showing the benefits of computers used not only as tools of documentation and accounting but also for directly assisting surgeons during diagnosis and treatment of patients. Further developments in the field of clinical decision support even have the potential of causing a paradigm shift in how patients are diagnosed and treated.	[Kenngott, H.

Using multiple regression, Bayesian networks and artificial neural networks for prediction of total egg production in European quails based on earlier expressed phenotypes	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						egg production; phenotypic network; prediction model; non-parametric model; Bayesian networks	LINEAR-REGRESSION; PRODUCTION CURVE; MODELS; SELECTION; HENS	The prediction of total egg production (TEP) potential in poultry is an important task to aid optimized management decisions in commercial enterprises. The objective of the present study was to compare different modeling approaches for prediction of TEP in meat type quails (Coturnix coturnix coturnix) using phenotypes such as weight, weight gain, egg production and egg quality measurements. Phenotypic data on 30 traits from two lines (L1, n = 180; and L2, n = 205) of quail were modeled to predict TEP. Prediction models included multiple linear regression and artificial neural network (ANN). Moreover, Bayesian network (BN) and a stepwise approach were used as variable selection methods. BN results showed that TEP is independent from other earlier expressed traits when conditioned on egg production from 35 to 80 days of age (EP1). In addition, the prediction accuracy was much lower when EP1 was not included in the model. The best predictive model was ANN, after feature selection, showing prediction correlations of r = 0.792 and r = 0.714 for L1 and L2, respectively. In conclusion, machine learning methods may be useful, but reasonable prediction accuracies are obtained only when partial egg production measurements are included in the model.	[Felipe, Vivian P.

Cognitive radio is intelligent enough to adapt the communication parameters of the unused licensed spectrum. Spectrum sensing is one of the most important tasks of the cognitive radio cycle. In this paper, the auto-correlation function kernel based Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier along with Welch's Periodogram detector is successfully implemented for the detection of four QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) based signals propagating through an AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) channel. It is shown that the combination of statistical signal processing and machine learning concepts improve the spectrum sensing process and spectrum sensing is possible even at low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) values up to -50 dB.

Materials and Methods: Institutional and regional medical ethics committees approved the study, and all patients signed a consent form. Two hundred thirty-five preoperative adult patients from two institutions with a subsequent histologically confirmed diagnosis of glioma after surgery were included retrospectively. An SVM learning technique was applied to MR imaging-based whole-tumor relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) histograms. SVM models with the highest diagnostic accuracy for 6-month and 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival associations were trained on 101 patients from the first institution. With Cox survival analysis, the diagnostic effectiveness of the SVM models was tested on independent data from 134 patients at the second institution. Results were adjusted for known survival predictors, including patient age, tumor size, neurologic status, and postsurgery treatment, and were compared with survival associations from an expert reader. Results: Compared with total qualitative assessment by an expert reader, the whole-tumor rCBV-based SVM model was the strongest parameter associated with 6-month and 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival in the independent patient data (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.794-0.851; hazard ratio, 5.4-21.2). Discussion: Machine learning by means of SVM in combination with whole-tumor rCBV histogram analysis can be used to identify early patient survival in aggressive gliomas. The SVM model returned higher diagnostic accuracy values than an expert reader, and the model appears to be insensitive to patient, observer, and institutional variations.

With the availability of a large variety of online content and the disjunctive nature of results provided by traditional search engines, it becomes crucial to provide learners with adapted learning paths that propose a sequence of resources that match their learning objectives. In an ideal case, the sequence of documents provided to the learner should be such that each new document relies on concepts that have been already defined in previous documents. Thus, the problem of determining an effective learning path from a corpus of web documents depends on the accurate identification of outcome and prerequisite concepts in these documents and on their ordering according to this information. Until now, only a few works have been proposed to distinguish between prerequisite and outcome concepts, and to the best of our knowledge, no method has been introduced so far to benefit from this information to produce a meaningful learning path. To this aim, this article first describes a concept annotation method that relies on machine-learning techniques to predict the class of each concept-prerequisite or outcome-on the basis of contextual and local features. Then, this categorization is exploited to produce an automatic resource sequencing on the basis of different representations and scoring functions that transcribe the precedence relation between learning resources. Experiments conducted on a real dataset built from online resources show that our concept annotation approach outperforms the baseline method and that the learning paths automatically generated are consistent with the ground truth provided by the author of the online content.

A machine learning approach is proposed to model crop rotations which can predict with good accuracy, at the beginning of the agricultural season, the crops most likely to be present in a given field using the crop sequence of the previous 3-5 years. The approach is able to learn from data and to integrate expert knowledge represented as first-order logic rules. Its accuracy is assessed using the French Land Parcel Information System implemented in the frame of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. This assessment is done using different settings in terms of temporal depth and spatial generalization coverage. The obtained results show that the proposed approach is able to predict the crop type of each field, before the beginning of the crop season, with an accuracy as high as 60%, which is better than the results obtained with current approaches based on remote sensing imagery.

Usually, the biomass quality is determined using expensive devices, such as mass spectrometers, or complex chemical tests that may need several days to complete. Because of the high costs of such methods, people tend to forsake biomass quality assessment and move on to directly produce bioproducts from any kind of biomass. In this paper, a cheap and fast solution for biomass type identification is proposed and investigated. The quality of biomass can be inferred at a coarse level from the type of biomass. In the proposed approach, biomass type identification is treated as a texture classification problem. A texture classification system developed for mobile devices which is able to distinguish between four types of biomass texture images is presented in this paper. Several state of the art texture classification systems based on machine learning are evaluated in a series of experiments on a data set of biomass texture images. The experiments are conducted to determine the system that can offer the best trade-off between accuracy and speed, since the goal is to implement it on a mobile device with limited processing power and memory. In the end, the selected system can identify the type of biomass from pictures taken with a mobile device camera in a few seconds directly on the respective mobile device.

J	Krivak, R; Hoksza, D				Krivak, Radoslav; Hoksza, David			Improving protein-ligand binding site prediction accuracy by classification of inner pocket points using local features	JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS			English	Article						Ligand binding site; Protein pocket; Binding site prediction; Pocket score; Molecular recognition; Machine learning; Random forests	DRUGGABILITY PREDICTION; RANDOM FOREST; DRUG DESIGN; IDENTIFICATION; SURFACE; BIOINFORMATICS; ALGORITHM; CAVITIES; FINDSITE; NMR	Background: Protein-ligand binding site prediction from a 3D protein structure plays a pivotal role in rational drug design and can be helpful in drug side-effects prediction or elucidation of protein function. Embedded within the binding site detection problem is the problem of pocket ranking - how to score and sort candidate pockets so that the best scored predictions correspond to true ligand binding sites. Although there exist multiple pocket detection algorithms, they mostly employ a fairly simple ranking function leading to sub-optimal prediction results. Results: We have developed a new pocket scoring approach (named PRANK) that prioritizes putative pockets according to their probability to bind a ligand. The method first carefully selects pocket points and labels them by physico-chemical characteristics of their local neighborhood. Random Forests classifier is subsequently applied to assign a ligandability score to each of the selected pocket point. The ligandability scores are finally merged into the resulting pocket score to be used for prioritization of the putative pockets. With the used of multiple datasets the experimental results demonstrate that the application of our method as a post-processing step greatly increases the quality of the prediction of Fpocket and ConCavity, two state of the art protein-ligand binding site prediction algorithms. Conclusions: The positive experimental results show that our method can be used to improve the success rate, validity and applicability of existing protein-ligand binding site prediction tools. The method was implemented as a stand-alone program that currently contains support for Fpocket and Concavity out of the box, but is easily extendible to support other tools.

Eliciting and Receiving Online Support: Using Computer-Aided Content Analysis to Examine the Dynamics of Online Social Support	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						social support; health communication; self-disclosure; social media; support groups; emotions; natural language processing	BREAST-CANCER; INTERNET; WOMEN; PEER; INTERVENTIONS	Background: Although many people with serious diseases participate in online support communities, little research has investigated how participants elicit and provide social support on these sites. Objective: The first goal was to propose and test a model of the dynamic process through which participants in online support communities elicit and provide emotional and informational support. The second was to demonstrate the value of computer coding of conversational data using machine learning techniques (1) by replicating results derived from human-coded data about how people elicit support and (2) by answering questions that are intractable with small samples of human-coded data, namely how exposure to different types of social support predicts continued participation in online support communities. The third was to provide a detailed description of these machine learning techniques to enable other researchers to perform large-scale data analysis in these communities. Methods: Communication among approximately 90,000 registered users of an online cancer support community was analyzed. The corpus comprised 1,562,459 messages organized into 68,158 discussion threads. Amazon Mechanical Turk workers coded (1) 1000 thread-starting messages on 5 attributes (positive and negative emotional self-disclosure, positive and negative informational self-disclosure, questions) and (2) 1000 replies on emotional and informational support. Their judgments were used to train machine learning models that automatically estimated the amount of these 7 attributes in the messages. Across attributes, the average Pearson correlation between human-based judgments and computer-based judgments was .65. Results: Part 1 used human-coded data to investigate relationships between (1) 4 kinds of self-disclosure and question asking in thread-starting posts and (2) the amount of emotional and informational support in the first reply. Self-disclosure about negative emotions (beta=.24, P<.001), negative events (beta=.25, P<.001), and positive events (beta=.10, P=.02) increased emotional support. However, asking questions depressed emotional support (beta=-.21, P<.001). In contrast, asking questions increased informational support (beta=. 38, P<.001), whereas positive informational self-disclosure depressed it (beta=-.09, P=.003). Self-disclosure led to the perception of emotional needs, which elicited emotional support, whereas asking questions led to the perception of informational needs, which elicited informational support. Part 2 used machine-coded data to replicate these results. Part 3 analyzed the machine-coded data and showed that exposure to more emotional support predicted staying in the group longer 33% (hazard ratio=0.67, P<.001), whereas exposure to more informational support predicted leaving the group sooner (hazard ratio=1.05, P<.001). Conclusions: Self-disclosure is effective in eliciting emotional support, whereas question asking is effective in eliciting informational support. Moreover, perceptions that people desire particular kinds of support influence the support they receive. Finally, the type of support people receive affects the likelihood of their staying in or leaving the group. These results demonstrate the utility of machine learning methods for investigating the dynamics of social support exchange in online support communities.

High-resolution genetic mapping of maize pan-genome sequence anchors	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							COPY NUMBER VARIATION; TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS; WIDE ASSOCIATION; WHOLE-GENOME; EVOLUTION; POPULATION; DIVERSITY; PLANTS; DUPLICATION; ALIGNMENT	In addition to single-nucleotide polymorphisms, structural variation is abundant in many plant genomes. The structural variation across a species can be represented by a 'pan-genome', which is essential to fully understand the genetic control of phenotypes. However, the pan-genome's complexity hinders its accurate assembly via sequence alignment. Here we demonstrate an approach to facilitate pan-genome construction in maize. By performing 18 trillion association tests we map 26 million tags generated by reduced representation sequencing of 14,129 maize inbred lines. Using machine-learning models we select 4.4 million accurately mapped tags as sequence anchors, 1.1 million of which are presence/absence variations. Structural variations exhibit enriched association with phenotypic traits, indicating that it is a significant source of adaptive variation in maize. The ability to efficiently map ultrahigh-density pan-genome sequence anchors enables fine characterization of structural variation and will advance both genetic research and breeding in many crops.

Equipped with sophisticated sensors and advanced computing hardware, phones can be used to infer users' location, activity, social setting, and more. As devices become increasingly intelligent, their capabilities evolve beyond inferring context to predicting it, and then reasoning and acting upon the predicted context. This article provides an overview of the current state of the art in mobile sensing and context prediction paving the way for full-fledged anticipatory mobile computing. We present a survey of phenomena that mobile phones can infer and predict, and offer a description of machine learning techniques used for such predictions. We then discuss proactive decision making and decision delivery via the user-device feedback loop. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of anticipatory mobile computing.

Under the ERM principle, one minimizes an upper bound of the true risk, which is approximated by the summation of empirical risk and the complexity of the candidate classifier class. To guarantee a satisfactory learning performance, ERM requires that the training data are i.i.d. sampled from the unknown source distribution. However, this may not be the case in active learning, where one selects the most informative samples to label, and these data may not follow the source distribution. In this article, we generalize the ERM principle to the active learning setting. We derive a novel form of upper bound for the true risk in the active learning setting; by minimizing this upper bound, we develop a practical batch mode active learning method. The proposed formulation involves a nonconvex integer programming optimization problem. We solve it efficiently by an alternating optimization method. Our method is shown to query the most informative samples while preserving the source distribution as much as possible, thus identifying the most uncertain and representative queries. We further extend our method to multiclass active learning by introducing novel pseudolabels in the multiclass case and developing an efficient algorithm. Experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world applications demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Rapid, Accurate, and On-Site Detection of C-difficile in Stool Samples	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY			English	Article							VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; ION MOBILITY SPECTROMETRY; DIARRHEA; DIAGNOSIS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; INFECTION; OUTBREAK; DISEASE; DELAYS	OBJECTIVES: A rapid test to diagnose Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) on hospital wards could minimize common but critical diagnostic delay. Field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) is a portable mass spectrometry instrument that quickly analyses the chemical composition of gaseous mixtures (e.g., above a stool sample). Can FAIMS accurately distinguish Clostridium difficile-positive from -negative stool samples? METHODS: We analyzed 213 stool samples with FAIMS, of which 71 were Clostridium difficile positive by microbiological analysis. The samples were divided into training, test, and validation samples. We used the training and test samples (n=135) to identify which sample characteristics discriminate between positive and negative samples, and to build machine learning algorithms interpreting these characteristics. The best performing algorithm was then prospectively validated on new, blinded validation samples (n=78). The predicted probability of CDI (as calculated by the algorithm) was compared with the microbiological test results (direct toxin test and culture). RESULTS: Using a Random Forest classification algorithm, FAIMS had a high discriminatory ability on the training and test samples (C-statistic 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86-0.97)). When applied to the blinded validation samples, the C-statistic was 0.86 (0.75-0.97). For samples analyzed <= 7 days of collection (n=76), diagnostic accuracy was even higher (C-statistic: 0.93 (0.85-1.00)). A cutoff value of 0.32 for predicted probability corresponded with a sensitivity of 92.3% (95% CI: 77.4-98.6%) and specificity of 86.0% (78.3-89.3%). For even fresher samples, discriminatory ability further increased. CONCLUSIONS: FAIMS analysis of unprocessed stool samples can differentiate between Clostridium difficile-positive and -negative samples with high diagnostic accuracy.

Denoising and feature extraction methods are also utilized to get higher classification accuracy. The goal of this study is to find an effective machine learning method for classifying ElectroMyoGram (EMG) signals by applying de-noising, feature extraction and classifier. This study presents a framework for classification of EMG signals using multiscale principal component analysis (MSPCA) for de-noising, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for feature extraction and decision tree algorithms for classification. The presented framework automatically classifies the EMG signals as myopathic, ALS or normal, using CART, C4.5 and random forest decision tree algorithms. Results are compared by using numerous performance measures such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F-measure and area under ROC curve (AK). Combination of DWT and random forest achieved the best performance using k-fold cross-validation with 96.67% total classification accuracy. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach has the capability for the classification of EMG signals with a good accuracy. In addition, the proposed framework can be used to support clinicians for diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nine statistical measures, including several seldom-used variability measures for these signals, were calculated for each time series. Next, after an evaluation of four popular machine learning methods, the optimal feature subset was generated with a hill-climbing feature selection method. Experiments were performed on a data set with 16 healthy control (CO) subjects, 13 ALS, 15 PD and 20 HD patients. When evaluated with the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method, the highest accuracy rate for discriminating between groups of NDD patients and healthy control subjects was 96.83%. The best classification accuracy (100%) was obtained with two subtype binary classifiers (PD vs. CO and HD vs. CO). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We represented chemicals based on bioactivity and chemical structure descriptors, then used supervised machine learning to predict in vivo hepatotoxic effects. A set of 677 chemicals was represented by 711 in vitro bioactivity descriptors (from ToxCast assays), 4,376 chemical structure descriptors (from QikProp, OpenBabel, PaDEL, and PubChem), and three hepatotoxicity categories (from animal studies). Hepatotoxicants were defined by rat liver histopathology observed after chronic chemical testing and grouped into hypertrophy (161), injury (101) and proliferative lesions (99). Classifiers were built using six machine learning algorithms: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), Naive Bayes (NB), support vector machines (SVM), classification and regression trees (CART), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and an ensemble of these classifiers (ENSMB). Classifiers of hepatotoxicity were built using chemical structure descriptors, ToxCast bioactivity descriptors, and hybrid descriptors. Predictive performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation testing and in-loop, filter-based, feature subset selection. Hybrid classifiers had the best balanced accuracy for predicting hypertrophy (0.84 +/- 0.08), injury (0.80 +/- 0.09), and proliferative lesions (0.80 +/- 0.10). Though chemical and bioactivity classifiers had a similar balanced accuracy, the former were more sensitive, and the latter were more specific. CART, ENSMB, and SVM classifiers performed the best, and nuclear receptor activation and mitochondrial functions were frequently found in highly predictive classifiers of hepatotoxicity. ToxCast and ToxRefDB provide the largest and richest publicly available data sets for mining linkages between the in vitro bioactivity of environmental chemicals and their adverse histopathological outcomes. Our findings demonstrate the utility of high-throughput assays for characterizing rodent hepatotoxicants, the benefit of using hybrid representations that integrate bioactivity and chemical structure, and the need for objective evaluation of classification performance.

Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning and statistics. One of the data mining tasks is anomaly detection which is the analysis of large quantities of data to identify items, events or observations which do not conform to an expected pattern. Anomaly detection is applicable in a variety of domains, e.g., fraud detection, fault detection, system health monitoring but this article focuses on application of anomaly detection in the field of network intrusion detection. The main goal of the article is to prove that an entropy-based approach is suitable to detect modern botnet-like malware based on anomalous patterns in network. This aim is achieved by realization of the following points: (i) preparation of a concept of original entropy-based network anomaly detection method, (ii) implementation of the method, (iii) preparation of original dataset, (iv) evaluation of the method.

However, an interaction based model combining these factors has not been established yet. Regarding the low effect of individual SNPs, a model investigating the interactive role of SNPs and clinical variables in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) seems auspicious. Thus 225 patients featured in previous work of the GSRD were enrolled in this investigation. According to data availability and previous positive results, 12 SNPs in HTR2A, COMT, ST8SIA2, PPP3CC and BDNF as well as 8 clinical variables featured in other GSRD studies were chosen for this investigation. Random forests algorithm were used for variable shrinkage and k-means clustering for surfacing variable characteristics determining treatment outcome. Using these machine learning and clustering algorithms, we detected a set of 3 SNPs and a clinical variable that was significantly associated with treatment response. About 62% of patients exhibiting the allelic combination of GG-GG-TT for rs6265, rs7430 and rs6313 of the BDNF, PPP3CC and HTR2A genes, respectively, and without melancholia showed a HAM-D decline under 17 compared to about 34% of the whole study sample. Our random forests prediction model for treatment outcome showed that combining clinical and genetic variables gradually increased the prediction performance recognizing correctly 25% of responders using all 4 factors. Thus, we could confirm our previous findings and furthermore show the strength of an interaction-based model combining statistical algorithms in identifying and operating treatment predictors.

Modeling false positive error making patterns in radiology trainees for improved mammography education	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Breast cancer; Radiology education; Computer vision; Machine learning	BREAST-CANCER; MASSES; DIFFERENCE; REDUCTION; FEATURES	Introduction: While mammography notably contributes to earlier detection of breast cancer, it has its limitations, including a large number of false positive exams. Improved radiology education could potentially contribute to alleviating this issue. Toward this goal, in this paper we propose an algorithm for modeling of false positive error making among radiology trainees. Identifying troublesome locations for the trainees could focus their training and in turn improve their performance. Methods: The algorithm proposed in this paper predicts locations that are likely to result in a false positive error for each trainee based on the previous annotations made by the trainee. The algorithm consists of three steps. First, the suspicious false positive locations are identified in mammograms by Difference of Gaussian filter and suspicious regions are segmented by computer vision-based segmentation algorithms. Second, 133 features are extracted for each suspicious region to describe its distinctive characteristics. Third, a random forest classifier is applied to predict the likelihood of the trainee making a false positive error using the extracted features. The random forest classifier is trained using previous annotations made by the trainee. We evaluated the algorithm using data from a reader study in which 3 experts and 10 trainees interpreted 100 mammographic cases. Results: The algorithm was able to identify locations where the trainee will commit a false positive error with accuracy higher than an algorithm that selects such locations randomly. Specifically, our algorithm found false positive locations with 40% accuracy when only 1 location was selected for all cases for each trainee and 12% accuracy when 10 locations were selected. The accuracies for randomly identified locations were both 0% for these two scenarios. Conclusions: In this first study on the topic, we were able to build computer models that were able to find locations for which a trainee will make a false positive error in images that were not previously seen by the trainee. Presenting the trainees with such locations rather than randomly selected ones may improve their educational outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Adams			Efficient and sparse feature selection for biomedical text classification via the elastic net: Application to ICU risk stratification from nursing notes	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Text mining; Feature selection; Elastic net; ICU; Risk stratification; Machine learning	INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; WEANING PATIENTS; MORTALITY; REGRESSION; MODEL; MACHINE; SYSTEM; CANCER; SCORE	Background and significance: Sparsity is often a desirable property of statistical models, and various feature selection methods exist so as to yield sparser and interpretable models. However, their application to biomedical text classification, particularly to mortality risk stratification among intensive care unit (ICU) patients, has not been thoroughly studied. Objective: To develop and characterize sparse classifiers based on the free text of nursing notes in order to predict ICU mortality risk and to discover text features most strongly associated with mortality. Methods: We selected nursing notes from the first 24 h of ICU admission for 25,826 adult ICU patients from the MIMIC-II database. We then developed a pair of stochastic gradient descent-based classifiers with elastic-net regularization. We also studied the performance-sparsity tradeoffs of both classifiers as their regularization parameters were varied. Results: The best-performing classifier achieved a 10-fold cross-validated AUC of 0.897 under the log loss function and full 1,2 regularization, while full L-1 regularization used just 0.00025% of candidate input features and resulted in an AUC of 0.889. Using the log loss (range of AUCs 0.889-0.897) yielded better performance compared to the hinge loss (0.850-0.876), but the latter yielded even sparser models. Discussion: Most features selected by both classifiers appear clinically relevant and correspond to predictors already present in existing ICU mortality models. The sparser classifiers were also able to discover a number of informative - albeit nonclinical - features. Conclusion: The elastic-net-regularized classifiers perform reasonably well and are capable of reducing the number of features required by over a thousandfold, with only a modest impact on performance.

J	Franke, S; Meixensberger, J; Neumuth, T				Franke, Stefan; Meixensberger, Juergen; Neumuth, Thomas			Multi-perspective workflow modeling for online surgical situation models	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Surgical workflow; Workflow modeling; Machine learning	HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL; OPERATING-ROOM; LEVEL TASKS; RECOGNITION; ENVIRONMENTS; VALIDATION; DURATION	Introduction: Surgical workflow management is expected to enable situation-aware adaptation and intelligent systems behavior in an integrated operating room (OR). The overall aim is to unburden the surgeon and OR staff from both manual maintenance and information seeking tasks. A major step toward intelligent systems behavior is a stable classification of the surgical situation from multiple perspectives based on performed low-level tasks. Material and methods: The present work proposes a method for the classification of surgical situations based on multi-perspective workflow modeling. A model network that interconnects different types of surgical process models is described. Various aspects of a surgical situation description were considered: low-level tasks, high-level tasks, patient status, and the use of medical devices. A study with sixty neurosurgical interventions was conducted to evaluate the performance of our approach and its robustness against incomplete workflow recognition input. Results: A correct classification rate of over 90% was measured for high-level tasks and patient status. The device usage models for navigation and neurophysiology classified over 95% of the situations correctly, whereas the ultrasound usage was more difficult to predict. Overall, the classification rate decreased with an increasing level of input distortion. Discussion: Autonomous adaptation of medical devices and intelligent systems behavior do not currently depend solely on low-level tasks. Instead, they require a more general type of understanding of the surgical condition. The integration of various surgical process models in a network provided a comprehensive representation of the interventions and allowed for the generation of extensive situation descriptions. Conclusion: Multi-perspective surgical workflow modeling and online situation models will be a significant pre-requisite for reliable and intelligent systems behavior. Hence, they will contribute to a cooperative OR environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In order to avoid misleading results, accurate and reliable diagnostic system for breast cancer is indispensable. Recently, several interesting machine-learning (ML) approaches are proposed for prediction of breast cancer. To this end, we developed a novel classifier stacking based evolutionary ensemble system "Can-Evo-Ens" for predicting amino acid sequences associated with breast cancer. In this paper, first, we selected four diverse-type of ML algorithms of Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest as base-level classifiers. These classifiers are trained individually in different feature spaces using physicochemical properties of amino acids. In order to exploit the decision spaces, the preliminary predictions of base-level classifiers are stacked. Genetic programming (GP) is then employed to develop a meta-classifier that optimal combine the predictions of the base classifiers. The most suitable threshold value of the best-evolved predictor is computed using Particle Swarm Optimization technique. Our experiments have demonstrated the robustness of Can-Evo-Ens system for independent validation dataset. The proposed system has achieved the highest value of Area Under Curve (AUC) of ROC Curve of 99.95% for cancer prediction. The comparative results revealed that proposed approach is better than individual ML approaches and conventional ensemble approaches of AdaBoostMl, Bagging, GentleBoost, and Random Subspace. It is expected that the proposed novel system would have a major impact on the fields of Biomedical, Genomics, Proteomics, Bioinformatics, and Drug Development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A spline-based tool to assess and visualize the calibration of multiclass risk predictions	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Risk models; Probability estimation; Machine learning; Logistic regression; Calibration; Multiclass	MACHINE-LEARNING-METHODS; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION MODELS; OVARIAN-TUMOR-ANALYSIS; PROBABILITY ESTIMATION; EXTERNAL VALIDATION; MULTIPLE IMPUTATION; DECISION-MAKING; CANCER; DISCRIMINATION; CLASSIFICATION	When validating risk models (or probabilistic classifiers), calibration is often overlooked. Calibration refers to the reliability of the predicted risks, i.e. whether the predicted risks correspond to observed probabilities. In medical applications this is important because treatment decisions often rely on the estimated risk of disease. The aim of this paper is to present generic tools to assess the calibration of multiclass risk models. We describe a calibration framework based on a vector spline multinomial logistic regression model. This framework can be used to generate calibration plots and calculate the estimated calibration index (ECI) to quantify lack of calibration. We illustrate these tools in relation to risk models used to characterize ovarian tumors. The outcome of the study is the surgical stage of the tumor when relevant and the final histological outcome, which is divided into five classes: benign, borderline malignant, stage I, stage II-IV, and secondary metastatic cancer. The 5909 patients included in the study are randomly split into equally large training and test sets. We developed and tested models using the following algorithms: logistic regression, support vector machines, k nearest neighbors, random forest, naive Bayes and nearest shrunken centroids. Multiclass calibration plots are interesting as an approach to visualizing the reliability of predicted risks. The ECI is a convenient tool for comparing models, but is less informative and interpretable than calibration plots. In our case study, logistic regression and random forest showed the highest degree of calibration, and the naive Bayes the lowest. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A novel neural-inspired learning algorithm with application to clinical risk prediction	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Cardiovascular disease; Classification; Clinical risk prediction; Neural-inspired algorithms	CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; DENTATE GYRUS; HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; ADULT NEUROGENESIS; CLASSIFICATION; CALIFORNIA; STROKE; HAWAII	Clinical risk prediction - the estimation of the likelihood an individual is at risk of a disease - is a coveted and exigent clinical task, and a cornerstone to the recommendation of life saving management strategies. This is especially important for individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) given the fact that it is the leading causes of death in many developed counties. To this end, we introduce a novel learning algorithm - a key factor that influences the performance of machine learning-based prediction models - and utilities it to develop CVD risk prediction tool. This novel neural-inspired algorithm, called the Artificial Neural Cell System for classification (ANCSc), is inspired by mechanisms that develop the brain and empowering it with capabilities such as information processing/storage and recall, decision making and initiating actions on external environment. Specifically, we exploit on 3 natural neural mechanisms responsible for developing and enriching the brain - namely neurogenesis, neuroplasticity via nurturing and apoptosis - when implementing ANCSc algorithm. Benchmark testing was conducted using the Honolulu Heart Program (HHP) dataset and results are juxtaposed with 2 other algorithms - i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Evolutionary Data-Conscious Artificial Immune Recognition System (EDC-AIRS). Empirical experiments indicate that ANCSc algorithm (statistically) outperforms both SVM and EDC-AIRS algorithms. Key clinical markers identified by ANCSc algorithm include risk factors related to diet/lifestyle, pulmonary function, personal/family/medical history, blood data, blood pressure, and electrocardiography. These clinical markers, in general, are also found to be clinically significant - providing a promising avenue for identifying potential cardiovascular risk factors to be evaluated in clinical trials.

Multi-Step Protocol for Automatic Evaluation of Docking Results Based on Machine Learning Methods-A Case Study of Serotonin Receptors 5-HT6 and 5-HT7	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							MUSCARINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; PROTEIN-LIGAND COMPLEXES; GENETIC ALGORITHM; MOLECULAR RECOGNITION; SCORING FUNCTION; STRUCTURAL BASIS; BINDING; VALIDATION; ANTAGONIST; PREDICTION	Molecular docking, despite its undeniable usefulness in computer-aided drug design protocols and the increasing sophistication of tools used in the prediction of ligand-protein interaction energies, is still connected with a problem of effective results analysis. In this study, a novel protocol for the automatic evaluation of numerous docking results is presented, being a combination of Structural Interaction Fingerprints and Spectrophores descriptors, machine-learning techniques, and multi-step results analysis. Such an approach takes into consideration the performance of a particular learning algorithm (five machine learning methods were applied), the performance of the docking algorithm itself, the variety of conformations returned from the docking experiment, and the receptor structure (homology models were constructed on five different templates). Evaluation using compounds active toward 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptors, as well as additional analysis carried out for beta-2 adrenergic receptor ligands, proved that the methodology is a viable tool for supporting virtual screening protocols, enabling proper discrimination between active and inactive compounds.

Generative topographic maps may be used for nonlinear dimensionality reduction and probabilistic modeling. For compound mapping, we represented the molecules by two-dimensional pharmacophore features (chemically advanced template search descriptor). The results obtained suggest a close resemblance of synthetic drugs with natural products in terms of their pharmacophore features, despite pronounced differences in chemical structure. Generative topographic map-based cluster analysis revealed both known and new potential activities of natural products and drug-like compounds. We conclude that the generative topographic map method is suitable for inferring functional similarities between these two classes of compounds and predicting macromolecular targets of natural products.

Cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways are of utmost importance in inflammatory processes; therefore, novel inhibitors are currently needed for both of them. Dual inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-1 and 5-lipoxygenase are anti-inflammatory drugs with high efficacy and low side effects. In this work, 57 leaf extracts (EtOH-H2O 7:3, v/v) from Asteraceae species with in vitro dual inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 and 5-lipoxygenase were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution-ORBITRAP-mass spectrometry analysis and subjected to in silico studies using machine learning algorithms. The data from all samples were processed by employing differential expression analysis software coupled to the Dictionary of Natural Products for dereplication studies. The 6052 chromatographic peaks (ESI positive and negative modes) of the extracts were selected by a genetic algorithm according to their respective anti-inflammatory properties; after this procedure, 1241 of them remained. A study using a decision tree classifier was carried out, and 11 compounds were determined to be biomarkers due to their anti-inflammatory potential. Finally, a model to predict new biologically active extracts from Asteraceae species using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry information with no prior knowledge of their biological data was built using a multilayer perceptron (artificial neural networks) with the back-propagation algorithm using the biomarker data. As a result, a new and robust artificial neural network model for predicting the anti-inflammatory activity of natural compounds was obtained, resulting in a high percentage of correct predictions (81%), high precision (100%) for dual inhibition, and low error values (mean absolute error=0.3), as also shown in the validation test. Thus, the biomarkers of the Asteraceae extracts were statistically correlated with their anti-inflammatory activities and can therefore be useful to predict new anti-inflammatory extracts and their anti-inflammatory compounds using only liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry data.

J	Chen, CJ; Pai, TW; Cheng, M				Chen, Chi-Jim; Pai, Tun-Wen; Cheng, Mox			A Support Vector Machine Approach for Truncated Fingerprint Image Detection from Sweeping Fingerprint Sensors	SENSORS			English	Article							QUALITY	A sweeping fingerprint sensor converts fingerprints on a row by row basis through image reconstruction techniques. However, a built fingerprint image might appear to be truncated and distorted when the finger was swept across a fingerprint sensor at a non-linear speed. If the truncated fingerprint images were enrolled as reference targets and collected by any automated fingerprint identification system (AFIS), successful prediction rates for fingerprint matching applications would be decreased significantly. In this paper, a novel and effective methodology with low time computational complexity was developed for detecting truncated fingerprints in a real time manner. Several filtering rules were implemented to validate existences of truncated fingerprints. In addition, a machine learning method of supported vector machine (SVM), based on the principle of structural risk minimization, was applied to reject pseudo truncated fingerprints containing similar characteristics of truncated ones. The experimental result has shown that an accuracy rate of 90.7% was achieved by successfully identifying truncated fingerprint images from testing images before AFIS enrollment procedures. The proposed effective and efficient methodology can be extensively applied to all existing fingerprint matching systems as a preliminary quality control prior to construction of fingerprint templates.

Carbonate reservoirs are abundant in the Middle East, the Gulf of Mexico and in other major petroleum fields that are regarded as the main oil producers. Due to the nature of such reservoirs that are associated with low matrix permeability, the fracture is the key parameter that governs the fluid flow in porous media and consequently oil production. Conventional methods to determine the fracture density include utilizing core data and the image log family, which are both time consuming and costly processes. In addition, the cores are limited to certain intervals and there is no image log for the well drilled before the introduction of this tool. These limitations motivate petroleum engineers to try to find appropriate alternatives. Recently, intelligent systems on the basis of machine learning have been applied to various branches of science and engineering. The objective of this study is to develop a mathematical model to predict the fracture density using full set log data as inputs based on a combination of three intelligent systems namely, the radial basis function neural network, the multilayer perceptron neural network and the least square supported vector machine. The developed committee machine intelligent system (CMIS) is the weighted average of the individual results of each expert. Proper corresponding weights are determined using a genetic algorithm (GA). The other important feature of the proposed model is its generalization capability. The ability of this model to predict data that have not been introduced during the training stage is very good.

Temporal distribution of instability events in continuously monitored step-down unit patients: Implications for Rapid Response Systems	RESUSCITATION			English	Article						Instability; Machine learning; Medical emergency teams; Noninvasive monitoring; Physiologic monitoring; Rapid response systems	MEDICAL EMERGENCY TEAMS; CONSENSUS CONFERENCE; SURGICAL-PATIENTS; ACTIVATION; ADMISSION; IMPACT; NURSE; RISK	Aim: Medical Emergency Teams (MET) activations are more frequent during daytime and weekdays, but whether due to greater patient instability, proximity from admission time, or caregiver concentration is unclear. We sought to determine if instability events, when they occurred, varied in their temporal distribution. Methods: Monitoring data were recorded (frequency 1/20 Hz) in 634 SDU patients (41,635 monitoring hours). Vital sign excursion beyond our MET trigger thresholds defined alerts. The resultant 1399 alerts from 216 patients were tallied according to clock hour and time elapsed since admission. We fit patient ID (n = 216), clock hour, time since SDU admission, and alert present into a null model and three mixed effect logistic regression models: clock hour, hours elapsed since admission, and both clock hour and time elapsed since admission as fixed effect covariates. We performed likelihood ratio tests on these models to assess if, among all alerts, there were proportionally more alerts for any given clock hour, or proximity to admission time. Results: Only time elapsed since admission (p < 0.001), and not clock hour adjusting for time elapsed since admission (p = 0.885), was significant for temporal disproportion. Results were unchanged if the first 24 h following admission were excluded from the models. Conclusion: Although instability alerts are distributed most frequently within 24 h after SDU admission in unstable patients, they are otherwise not more likely to distribute proportionally more frequently during certain clock hours. If MET utilization peaks do not coincide with admission time peaks, other variables contributing to unrecognized instability should be explored. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

COIN Collaboration	The overlooked potential of Generalized Linear Models in astronomy-II: Gamma regression and photometric redshifts	ASTRONOMY AND COMPUTING			English	Article						Techniques: photometric; Methods: statistical; Methods: analytical; Galaxies: distances and redshifts	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; GALAXIES; PCA	Machine learning techniques offer a precious tool box for use within astronomy to solve problems involving so-called big data. They provide a means to make accurate predictions about a particular system without prior knowledge of the underlying physical processes of the data. In this article, and the companion papers of this series, we present the set of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) as a fast alternative method for tackling general astronomical problems, including the ones related to the machine learning paradigm. To demonstrate the applicability of GLMs to inherently positive and continuous physical observables, we explore their use in estimating the photometric redshifts of galaxies from their multi-wavelength photometry. Using the gamma family with a log link function we predict redshifts from the PHoto-z Accuracy Testing simulated catalogue and a subset of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey from Data Release 10. We obtain fits that result in catastrophic outlier rates as low as similar to 1% for simulated and similar to 2% for real data. Moreover, we can easily obtain such levels of precision within a matter of seconds on a normal desktop computer and with training sets that contain merely thousands of galaxies. Our software is made publicly available as a user-friendly package developed in Python, R and via an interactive web application. This software allows users to apply a set of GLMs to their own photometric catalogues and generates publication quality plots with minimum effort. By facilitating their ease of use to the astronomical community, this paper series aims to make GLMs widely known and to encourage their implementation in future large-scale projects, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.

Several machine learning classification algorithms, Naive Bayes classifiers (NBC), k-nearest neighbours (k-NN), decision trees, support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) were implemented and directly compared on a sample of 700 seeds for the first time. The results indicated that the ANN (multilayer perceptron architecture) showed better performance in classification than other models.

A growing accumulation of software errors with time causes a phenomenon called software aging. This phenomenon can result in system performance degradation and eventually system hang/crash. To cope with software aging, software rejuvenation has been proposed. Software rejuvenation is a proactive technique which leads to removing the accumulated software errors by stopping the system, cleaning up its internal state, and resuming its normal operation. One of the main challenges of software rejuvenation is accurately predicting the time to crash due to aging factors such as memory leaks. In this paper, different machine learning techniques are compared to accurately predict the software time to crash under different aging scenarios. Finally, by comparing the accuracy of different techniques, it can be concluded that the multilayer perceptron neural network has the highest prediction accuracy among all techniques studied.

The non-neutralizing role of antibodies in stimulating effector cell responses may have been a key mechanism of the protection observed in the RV144 HIV vaccine trial. In an extensive investigation of a rich set of data collected from RV144 vaccine recipients, we here employ machine learning methods to identify and model associations between antibody features (IgG subclass and antigen specificity) and effector function activities (antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis, cellular cytotoxicity, and cytokine release). We demonstrate via cross-validation that classification and regression approaches can effectively use the antibody features to robustly predict qualitative and quantitative functional outcomes. This integration of antibody feature and function data within a machine learning framework provides a new, objective approach to discovering and assessing multivariate immune correlates.

To lower cost and reduce the time to obtain promising peptides, machine learning approaches can greatly assist in the process and even partly replace expensive laboratory experiments by learning a predictor with existing data or with a smaller amount of data generation. Unfortunately, once the model is learned, selecting peptides having the greatest predicted bioactivity often requires a prohibitive amount of computational time. For this combinatorial problem, heuristics and stochastic optimization methods are not guaranteed to find adequate solutions. We focused on recent advances in kernel methods and machine learning to learn a predictive model with proven success. For this type of model, we propose an efficient algorithm based on graph theory, that is guaranteed to find the peptides for which the model predicts maximal bioactivity. We also present a second algorithm capable of sorting the peptides of maximal bioactivity. Extensive analyses demonstrate how these algorithms can be part of an iterative combinatorial chemistry procedure to speed up the discovery and the validation of peptide leads. Moreover, the proposed approach does not require the use of known ligands for the target protein since it can leverage recent multi-target machine learning predictors where ligands for similar targets can serve as initial training data. Finally, we validated the proposed approach in vitro with the discovery of new cationic antimicrobial peptides. Source code freely available at http://graal.ift.ulaval.ca/peptide-design/.

Evapotranspiration based on equilibrated relative humidity (ETRHEQ): Evaluation over the continental US	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						evapotranspiration; latent heat flux; surface conductance; canopy conductance; energy balance; meteorological data	CONTERMINOUS UNITED-STATES; DATA ASSIMILATION SYSTEM; LAND-COVER DATABASE; GROUND HEAT-FLUX; WATER-VAPOR; CLIMATE DATA; SPATIAL INTERPOLATION; WIND-SPEED; SURFACE; EVAPORATION	A novel method of estimating evapotranspiration (ET), referred to as the ETRHEQ method, is further developed, validated, and applied across the U.S. from 1961 to 2010. The ETRHEQ method estimates the surface conductance to water vapor transport, which is the key rate-limiting parameter of typical ET models, by choosing the surface conductance that minimizes the vertical variance of the calculated relative humidity profile averaged over the day. The ETRHEQ method, which was previously tested at five AmeriFlux sites, is modified for use at common weather stations and further validated at 20 AmeriFlux sites that span a wide range of climates and limiting factors. Averaged across all sites, the daily latent heat flux RMSE is approximate to 26 Wm(-2) (or 15%). The method is applied across the U.S. at 305 weather stations and spatially interpolated using ANUSPLIN software. Gridded annual mean ETRHEQ ET estimates are compared with four data sets, including water balance-derived ET, machine-learning ET estimates based on FLUXNET data, North American Land Data Assimilation System project phase 2 ET, and a benchmark product that integrates 14 global ET data sets, with RMSEs ranging from 8.7 to 12.5 cmyr(-1). The ETRHEQ method relies only on data measured at weather stations, an estimate of vegetation height derived from land cover maps, and an estimate of soil thermal inertia. These data requirements allow it to have greater spatial coverage than direct measurements, greater historical coverage than satellite methods, significantly less parameter specification than most land surface models, and no requirement for calibration.

J	Yang, J; Park, MW; Vela, PA; Golparvar-Fard, M				Yang, Jun; Park, Man-Woo; Vela, Patricio A.; Golparvar-Fard, Mani			Construction performance monitoring via still images, time-lapse photos, and video streams: Now, tomorrow, and the future	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Construction; Performance monitoring; Computer vision; Machine learning	PROGRESS MEASUREMENT; TRACKING METHODS; COMPUTER VISION; SITE IMAGES; MODEL; RECOGNITION; EQUIPMENT; SYSTEM; RETRIEVAL; VISUALIZATION	Timely and accurate monitoring of onsite construction operations can bring an immediate awareness on project specific issues. It provides practitioners with the information they need to easily and quickly make project control decisions. Despite their importance, the current practices are still time-consuming, costly, and prone to errors. To facilitate the process of collecting and analyzing performance data, researchers have focused on devising methods that can semi-automatically or automatically assess ongoing operations both at project level and operation level. A major line of work has particularly focused on developing computer vision techniques that can leverage still images, time-lapse photos and video streams for documenting the work in progress. To this end, this paper extensively reviews these state-of-the-art vision-based construction performance monitoring methods. Based on the level of information perceived and the types of output, these methods are mainly divided into two categories (namely project level: visual monitoring of civil infrastructure or building elements vs. operation level: visual monitoring of construction equipment and workers). The underlying formulations and assumptions used in these methods are discussed in detail. Finally the gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed in future research are identified.

J	Teizer, J				Teizer, Jochen			Status quo and open challenges in vision-based sensing and tracking of temporary resources on infrastructure construction sites	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Building information modeling; Computer vision and machine learning; Resource location tracking and progress monitoring; Safety and health; Sensors: photo and video cameras, unmanned aerial vehicles; Surveying: laser scanning photo- and videogrammetry	FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY; VISUALIZATION TECHNOLOGY; EQUIPMENT; OPERATIONS; FUSION; SAFETY; RECONSTRUCTION; PRODUCTIVITY; SEGMENTATION; RECOGNITION	Modern construction projects require sufficient planning and management of resources to become successful. Core issues are tasks that deal with maintaining the schedule, such as procuring materials, guaranteeing the supply chain, controlling the work status, and monitoring safety and quality. Timely feedback of project status aids project management by providing accurate percentages of task completions and appropriately allocating resources (workforce, equipment, material) to coordinate the next work packages. However, current methods for measuring project status or progress, especially on large infrastructure projects, are mostly based on manual assessments. Recent academic research and commercial development has focused on semi- or fully-automated approaches to collect and process images of evolving worksites. Preliminary results are promising and show capturing, analyzing, and documenting construction progress and linking to information models is possible. This article presents first an overview to vision-based sensing technology available for temporary resource tracking at infrastructure construction sites. Second, it provides the status quo of research applications by highlighting exemplary case. Third, a discussion follows on existing advantages and current limitations of vision based sensing and tracking. Open challenges that need to be addressed in future research efforts conclude this paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To extend the applications of regular vector-based clustering algorithms, the Discrete Distribution (D2) clustering algorithm has been developed, aiming at clustering data represented by bags of weighted vectors which are well adopted data signatures in many emerging information retrieval and multimedia learning applications. However, the high computational complexity of D2-clustering limits its impact in solving massive learning problems. Here we present the parallel D2-clustering (PD2-clustering) algorithm with substantially improved scalability. We developed a hierarchical multipass algorithm structure for parallel computing in order to achieve a balance between the individual-node computation and the integration process of the algorithm. Experiments and extensive comparisons between PD2-clustering and other clustering algorithms are conducted on synthetic datasets. The results show that the proposed parallel algorithm achieves significant speed-up with minor accuracy loss. We apply PD2-clustering to image concept learning. In addition, by extending D2-clustering to symbolic data, we apply PD2-clustering to protein sequence clustering. For both applications, we demonstrate the high competitiveness of our new algorithm in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.

We begin by providing a comprehensive survey of the forecasting algorithms and explanatory variables used in the motion picture domain. Because of the importance of forecasting in early periods, we develop three sequential forecasting models for predicting the non-cumulative and cumulative box office earnings: (1) prior to, (2) a week after, and (3) two weeks after release. The numbers of SNS mentions and their weekly trends are used as input variables in addition to the screening-related information. A genetic algorithm is adopted for determining significant input variables, whereas three machine learning-based nonlinear regression algorithms and their combinations are employed for building forecasting models. Experimental results show that the utilization of SNS data, machine learning-based algorithms and their combination made noticeable improvements to the forecasting accuracies of all the three models.

Intelligent virtual agents are often blind to users' laughter and unable to produce convincing laughter themselves. Respiratory, auditory, and facial laughter signals have been investigated but laughter-related body movements have received less attention. The aim of this study is threefold. First, to probe human laughter perception by analyzing patterns of categorisations of natural laughter animated on a minimal avatar. Results reveal that a low dimensional space can describe perception of laughter "types". Second, to investigate observers' perception of laughter (hilarious, social, awkward, fake, and non-laughter) based on animated avatars generated from natural and acted motion-capture data. Significant differences in torso and limb movements are found between animations perceived as laughter and those perceived as non-laughter. Hilarious laughter also differs from social laughter. Different body movement features were indicative of laughter in sitting and standing avatar postures. Third, to investigate automatic recognition of laughter to the same level of certainty as observers' perceptions. Results show recognition rates of the Random Forest model approach human rating levels. Classification comparisons and feature importance analyses indicate an improvement in recognition of social laughter when localized features and nonlinear models are used.

The success of machine learning approaches to WSD is largely dependent on the representation of the context in which an ambiguous word occurs. In practice, different kernel functions can be designed according to different representations since kernels can be well defined on general types of data, such as vectors, sequences, trees, as well as graphs. In this paper, we present a framework of composite kernel machines for enhanced automatic WSD. This method exploits the properties of Mercer's kernels to construct a family of composite kernels that flexibly combine the word frequency and syntagmatic relation information. The experimental results on several SENSEVAL benchmark datasets show the combination of kernels outperforms the kernels that take into account the word frequency or syntagmatic relation information alone, which suggests that both types of kernels contain complementary information for WSD.

Automatic identification of methotrexate-induced liver toxicity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis from the electronic medical record	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article						natural language processing; electronic medical record; pharmacogenetic; rheumatoid arthritis; methotrexate; liver toxicity	CROHNS-DISEASE; HEALTH RECORDS; CLINICAL TEXT; TEMPORAL EXPRESSIONS; ULCERATIVE-COLITIS; EXTRACTION; RISK; SURGERY; EVENTS; SYSTEM	Objectives To improve the accuracy of mining structured and unstructured components of the electronic medical record (EMR) by adding temporal features to automatically identify patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with methotrexate-induced liver transaminase abnormalities. Materials and methods Codified information and a string-matching algorithm were applied to a RA cohort of 5903 patients from Partners HealthCare to select 1130 patients with potential liver toxicity. Supervised machine learning was applied as our key method. For features, Apache clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) was used to extract standard vocabulary from relevant sections of the unstructured clinical narrative. Temporal features were further extracted to assess the temporal relevance of event mentions with regard to the date of transaminase abnormality. All features were encapsulated in a 3-month-long episode for classification. Results were summarized at patient level in a training set (N=480 patients) and evaluated against a test set (N=120 patients). Results The system achieved positive predictive value (PPV) 0.756, sensitivity 0.919, F1 score 0.829 on the test set, which was significantly better than the best baseline system (PPV 0.590, sensitivity 0.703, F1 score 0.642). Our innovations, which included framing the phenotype problem as an episode-level classification task, and adding temporal information, all proved highly effective.

The aim of this work was to develop and evaluate computational vision techniques on solving ordinary problems as the area fraction of phases determination of AISI 1020 steels. Three techniques were implemented and evaluated: k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) which consists in classifying pixels based on their neighborhood information, Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vectors Machine, these last two centered on supervised machine learning processes. Indexes that denote classification quality were then evaluated. Concerning classification time and relative accuracy, the SVM results have shown superiority. Nevertheless, in all cases, the classification values have agreed with the area fraction values expected for this type of steel based on theoretical metallurgical analysis.

They gained tremendous popularity in many application domains. Robotics on the other hand is a wide research discipline that embraces artificial intelligence in a complex individually-thinking robot and distributed robots. Recently, metaheuristics made a significant impact on the application areas of collaborating robotics. This new trend of collaborating robotics, offers the possibility of enhanced task performance, high reliability, low unit complexity and decreased cost over traditional robotic systems. Collaborating robots however are more than just networks of independent agents; they are potentially reconfigurable networks of communicating agents capable of coordinated sensing and interaction with the environment. On the conceptual level, these bots can be empowered by the logics of metaheuristic algorithms which share the same functionalities and capabilities. This paper reviews the recent advances of metaheuristic algorithms on robotics applications. A taxonomy is provided as a reference for robotics designers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kugler, SD; Polsterer, K; Hoecker, M				Kuegler, S. D.; Polsterer, K.; Hoecker, M.			Determining spectroscopic redshifts by using k nearest neighbor regression I. Description of method and analysis	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						methods: data analysis; astronomical databases: miscellaneous; methods: statistical; galaxies: distances and redshifts; catalogs	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; TARGET SELECTION; GALAXY SAMPLE; DATA RELEASE; QUASARS; SEARCH	Context. In astronomy, new approaches to process and analyze the exponentially increasing amount of data are inevitable. For spectra, such as in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectral database, usually templates of well-known classes are used for classification. In case the fitting of a template fails, wrong spectral properties (e.g. redshift) are derived. Validation of the derived properties is the key to understand the caveats of the template-based method. Aims. In this paper we present a method for statistically computing the redshift z based on a similarity approach. This allows us to determine redshifts in spectra for emission and absorption features without using any predefined model. Additionally, we show how to determine the redshift based on single features. As a consequence we are, for example, able to filter objects that show multiple redshift components. Methods. The redshift calculation is performed by comparing predefined regions in the spectra and individually applying a nearest neighbor regression model to each predefined emission and absorption region. Results. The choice of the model parameters controls the quality and the completeness of the redshifts. For approximate to 90% of the analyzed 16 000 spectra of our reference and test sample, a certain redshift can be computed that is comparable to the completeness of SDSS (96%). The redshift calculation yields a precision for every individually tested feature that is comparable to the overall precision of the redshifts of SDSS. Using the new method to compute redshifts, we could also identify 14 spectra with a significant shift between emission and absorption or between emission and emission lines. The results already show the immense power of this simple machine-learning approach for investigating huge databases such as the SDSS.	[Kuegler, S.

Diagnosis based on cultured specimens is the reference standard, however results take weeks to process. Scientists are looking for early detection strategies, which remain the cornerstone of tuberculosis control. Consequently there is a need to develop an expert system that helps medical professionals to accurately and quickly diagnose the disease. Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS) has been used successfully for diagnosing various diseases. However, little effort has been undertaken to improve its classification accuracy. Objectives: In order to increase the classification accuracy of AIRS, this study introduces a new hybrid system that incorporates a support vector machine into AIRS for diagnosing tuberculosis. Patients and Methods: Patient epacris reports obtained from the Pasteur laboratory of Iran were used as the benchmark data set, with the sample size of 175 (114 positive samples for TB and 60 samples in the negative group). The strategy of this study was to ensure representativeness, thus it was important to have an adequate number of instances for both TB and non-TB cases. The classification performance was measured through 10-fold cross-validation, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), sensitivity and specificity, Youden's Index, and Area Under the Curve (AUC). Statistical analysis was done using the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA), a machine learning program for windows. Results: With an accuracy of 100%, sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 100%, Youden's Index of 1, Area Under the Curve of 1, and RMSE of 0, the proposed method was able to successfully classify tuberculosis patients. Conclusions: There have been many researches that aimed at diagnosing tuberculosis faster and more accurately. Our results described a model for diagnosing tuberculosis with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. This model can be used as an additional tool for experts in medicine to diagnose TBC more accurately and quickly.

A Novel Preprocessing Scheme to Improve the Prediction of Sand Fraction From Seismic Attributes Using Neural Networks	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Artificial neural network (ANN); empirical mode decomposition (EMD); entropy; Fourier transform (FT); normalized mutual information (NMI); preprocessing; regularization; reservoir characterization (RC); sand fraction (SF); three-dimensional (3-D) median filtering; wavelets	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; TIME-SERIES; ULF WAVE; RESERVOIR; ALGORITHM; SIGNAL; PERMEABILITY; TRANSFORMS; SYSTEM	This paper presents a novel preprocessing scheme to improve the prediction of sand fraction from multiple seismic attributes such as seismic impedance, amplitude, and frequency using machine learning and information filtering. The available well logs along with the three-dimensional (3-D) seismic data have been used to benchmark the proposed preprocessing stage using a methodology that primarily consists of three steps: 1) preprocessing; 2) training; and 3) postprocessing. An artificial neural network (ANN) with conjugate-gradient learning algorithm has been used to model the sand fraction. The available sand fraction data from the high-resolution well logs have far more information content than the low-resolution seismic attributes. Therefore, regularization schemes based on Fourier transform (FT), wavelet decomposition (WD), and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) have been proposed to shape the high-resolution sand fraction data for effective machine learning. The input data sets have been segregated into training, testing, and validation sets. The test results are primarily used to check different network structures and activation function performances. Once the network passes the testing phase with an acceptable performance in terms of the selected evaluators, the validation phase follows. In the validation stage, the prediction model is tested against unseen data. The network yielding satisfactory performance in the validation stage is used to predict lithological properties from seismic attributes throughout a given volume. Finally, a postprocessing scheme using 3-D spatial filtering is implemented for smoothing the sand fraction in the volume. Prediction of lithological properties using this framework is helpful for reservoir characterization (RC).

This paper warns of the dangers of this practice by way of an example. We show that the residence registration numbers (RRNs) of many Koreans, which are very important and confidential personal information analogous to social security numbers in the United States, can be estimated solely from the information that they have made open to the public. In our study, we utilized machine learning algorithms to infer information that was then used to extract a part of the RRNs. Consequently, we were able to extract 45.5% of SNS users' RRNs using a machine learning algorithm and brute-force search that did not consume exorbitant amounts of resources.

SNOMED CT is a large medical ontology that is formally defined so that it ensures global consistency and support of complex reasoning tasks. Most biomedical ontologies and taxonomies on the other hand define concepts only textually, without the use of logic. Here, we investigate how to automatically generate formal concept definitions from textual ones. We develop a method that uses machine learning in combination with several types of lexical and semantic features and outputs formal definitions that follow the structure of SNOMED CT concept definitions. Results: We evaluate our method on three benchmarks and test both the underlying relation extraction component as well as the overall quality of output concept definitions. In addition, we provide an analysis on the following aspects: (1) How do definitions mined from the Web and literature differ from the ones mined from manually created definitions, e.g., MESH? (2) How do different feature representations, e.g., the restrictions of relations' domain and range, impact on the generated definition quality?, (3) How do different machine learning algorithms compare to each other for the task of formal definition generation?, and, (4) What is the influence of the learning data size to the task? We discuss all of these settings in detail and show that the suggested approach can achieve success rates of over 90%. In addition, the results show that the choice of corpora, lexical features, learning algorithm and data size do not impact the performance as strongly as semantic types do. Semantic types limit the domain and range of a predicted relation, and as long as relations' domain and range pairs do not overlap, this information is most valuable in formalizing textual definitions. Conclusions: The analysis presented in this manuscript implies that automated methods can provide a valuable contribution to the formalization of biomedical knowledge, thus paving the way for future applications that go beyond retrieval and into complex reasoning.

Firstly, the concept of SVM is explained and then, the recent studies on the application of SVM in structural engineering are summarized and discussed. Next, we performed three case studies using the experimental studies provided. Applicability of SVM in structural engineering is confirmed by these case studies.

Machining induced surface integrity and microstructure alterations size play a critical role in product fatigue life and reliability. Cutting tool geometry, coating type, and cutting conditions can affect surface and subsurface hardness as well as grain size. In this paper, predictions of machining induced microhardness and grain size are performed by using 3D finite element (FE) simulations of machining and machine learning models. Microhardness and microstructure of machined surfaces of Ti-6Al-4V are investigated. Hardness measurements are conducted at elevated temperatures to develop a predictive model by utilizing FE-based temperature fields for hardness profile. Measured hardness, grain size, and fractions are utilized in developing predictive models. Predicted microhardness profiles and grain sizes are then utilized in understanding the effect of machining parameters such as cutting speed, tool coating, and edge radius on the surface integrity. Optimization using genetic algorithms is performed to identify most favorable tool edge radius and cutting conditions.

This makes the monitoring and modeling of urban change's spatial patterns critical to urban planners, decision makers, and environment protection activists. Although a wide range of methods exists for modeling and simulating urban growth, machine learning (ML) techniques have received less attention despite their potential for producing highly accurate predictions of future urban extents. The aim of this study is to investigate two ML techniques, namely radial basis function network (RBFN) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks, for modeling urban change. By predicting urban change for 2010, the models' performance is evaluated by comparing results with a reference map and by using a set of pertinent statistical measures, such as average spatial distance deviation and figure of merit. The application of these techniques employs the case study area of Mumbai, India. The results show that both models, which were tested using the same explanatory variables, produced promising results in terms of predicting the size and extent of future urban areas. Although a close match between RBFN and MLP is observed, RBFN demonstrates higher spatial accuracy of prediction. Accordingly, RBFN was utilized to simulate urban change for 2020 and 2030. Overall, the study provides evidence that RBFN is a robust and efficient ML technique and can therefore be recommended for land use change modeling.

In the proposed method, MRMR is employed as a feature selection tool for dimensionality reduction in order to further improve the diagnostic accuracy of the ELM classifier. The impact of the type of activation functions, the number of hidden neurons and the size of the feature subsets on the performance of ELM have been investigated in detail. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been rigorously evaluated against the ES disease dataset, a benchmark dataset, from UCI machine learning database in terms of classification accuracy. Experimental results have demonstrated that our method has achieved the best classification accuracy of 98.89% and an average accuracy of 98.55% via 10-fold cross-validation technique. The proposed method might serve as a new candidate of powerful methods for diagnosing ES diseases.

Among all the methods for semi-supervised dimensionality reduction, SDA and LapRLS/L are two popular ones. Though the two methods are actually the extensions of different supervised methods, we show in this paper that both SDA and Lap-RLS/L can be unified under a regularized least square framework. In this paper, we propose a new effective semi-supervised dimensionality reduction method for better cope with data sampled from nonlinear manifold. In addition, the proposed method can both handle the regression as well as the subspace learning problem. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations show the effectiveness of our algorithm. The results in simulations demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can achieve great superiority compared with other existing methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Traffic sign segmentation and classification using statistical learning methods	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Driver support system; Traffic sign detection; Chromatic and achromatic segmentations; Fourier Descriptors; Classification; Machine learning techniques	RECOGNITION; ALGORITHMS	Traffic signs are an essential part of any circulation system, and failure detection by the driver may significantly increase the accident risk. Currently, automatic traffic sign detection systems still have some performance limitations, specially for achromatic signs and variable lighting conditions. In this work, we propose an automatic traffic-sign detection method capable of detecting both chromatic and achromatic signs, while taking into account rotations, scale changes, shifts, partial deformations, and shadows. The proposed system is divided into three stages: (1) segmentation of chromatic and achromatic scene elements using L*a*b* and HSI spaces, where two machine learning techniques (k-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines) are benchmarked; (2) post-processing in order to discard non-interest regions, to connect fragmented signs, and to separate signs located at the same post; and (3) signshape classification by using Fourier Descriptors, which yield significant advantage in comparison to other contour-based methods, and subsequent shape recognition with machine learning techniques. Experiments with two databases of real-world images captured with different cameras yielded a sign detection rate of about 97% with a false alarm rate between 3% and 4%, depending on the database. Our method can be readily used for maintenance, inventory, or driver support system applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Lillo-Castellano, J.

J	Nixon, Z; Michel, J				Nixon, Zachary; Michel, Jacqueline			Predictive Modeling of Subsurface Shoreline Oil Encounter Probability from the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							BEACHES; PERSISTENCE; PATTERNS; TREES	To better understand the distribution of remaining lingering subsurface oil residues from the Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS) along the shorelines of Prince William Sound (PWS), AK, we revised previous modeling efforts to allow spatially explicit predictions of the distribution of subsurface oil. We used a set of pooled field data and predictor variables stored as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data to generate calibrated boosted tree models predicting the encounter probability of different categories of subsurface oil. The models demonstrated excellent predictive performance as evaluated by cross-validated performance statistics. While the average encounter probabilities at most shoreline locations are low across western PWS, clusters of shoreline locations with elevated encounter probabilities remain in the northern parts of the PWS, as well as more isolated locations. These results can be applied to estimate the location and amount of remaining oil, evaluate potential ongoing impacts, and guide remediation. This is the first application of quantitative machine-learning based modeling techniques in estimating the likelihood of ongoing, long-term shoreline oil persistence after a major oil spill.

In the age of big data, classical learning machines often require huge computational resources in many practical cases. Quantum machine learning algorithms, on the other hand, could be exponentially faster than their classical counterparts by utilizing quantum parallelism. Here, we demonstrate a quantum machine learning algorithm to implement handwriting recognition on a four-qubit NMR test bench. The quantum machine learns standard character fonts and then recognizes handwritten characters from a set with two candidates. Because of the wide spread importance of artificial intelligence and its tremendous consumption of computational resources, quantum speedup would be extremely attractive against the challenges of big data.

Feature engineering for MEDLINE citation categorization with MeSH	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Text categorization; Feature engineering; Biomedical literature; MeSH indexing	TEXT CATEGORIZATION; SENTENCE SELECTION; ABSTRACTS; RULES	Background: Research in biomedical text categorization has mostly used the bag-of-words representation. Other more sophisticated representations of text based on syntactic, semantic and argumentative properties have been less studied. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of different text representations of biomedical texts as features for reproducing the MeSH annotations of some of the most frequent MeSH headings. In addition to unigrams and bigrams, these features include noun phrases, citation meta-data, citation structure, and semantic annotation of the citations. Results: Traditional features like unigrams and bigrams exhibit strong performance compared to other feature sets. Little or no improvement is obtained when using meta-data or citation structure. Noun phrases are too sparse and thus have lower performance compared to more traditional features. Conceptual annotation of the texts by MetaMap shows similar performance compared to unigrams, but adding concepts from the UMLS taxonomy does not improve the performance of using only mapped concepts. The combination of all the features performs largely better than any individual feature set considered. In addition, this combination improves the performance of a state-of-the-art MeSH indexer. Concerning the machine learning algorithms, we find that those that are more resilient to class imbalance largely obtain better performance. Conclusions: We conclude that even though traditional features such as unigrams and bigrams have strong performance compared to other features, it is possible to combine them to effectively improve the performance of the bag-of-words representation. We have also found that the combination of the learning algorithm and feature sets has an influence in the overall performance of the system. Moreover, using learning algorithms resilient to class imbalance largely improves performance. However, when using a large set of features, consideration needs to be taken with algorithms due to the risk of over-fitting. Specific combinations of learning algorithms and features for individual MeSH headings could further increase the performance of an indexing system.

Idiosyncratic Brain Activation Patterns Are Associated with Poor Social Comprehension in Autism	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						autism spectrum disorder; default mode network; heterogeneity; machine learning; naturalistic; social comprehension	SPECTRUM DISORDERS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; NATURAL SCENES; CHILDREN; NETWORK; ADULTS; MIND; ORGANIZATION; VARIABILITY	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) features profound social deficits but neuroimaging studies have failed to find any consistent neural signature. Here we connect these two facts by showing that idiosyncratic patterns of brain activation are associated with social comprehension deficits. Human participants with ASD (N = 17) and controls (N = 20) freely watched a television situation comedy (sitcom) depicting seminaturalistic social interactions ("The Office", NBC Universal) in the scanner. Intersubject correlations in the pattern of evoked brain activation were reduced in the ASD group-but this effect was driven entirely by five ASD subjects whose idiosyncratic responses were also internally unreliable. The idiosyncrasy of these five ASD subjects was not explained by detailed neuropsychological profile, eye movements, or data quality; however, they were specifically impaired in understanding the social motivations of characters in the sitcom. Brain activation patterns in the remaining ASD subjects were indistinguishable from those of control subjects using multiple multivariate approaches. Our findings link neurofunctional abnormalities evoked by seminaturalistic stimuli with a specific impairment in social comprehension, and highlight the need to conceive of ASD as a heterogeneous classification.

Deconvolving the Recognition of DNA Shape from Sequence	CELL			English	Article							TRANSCRIPTION-FACTOR-BINDING; HOX SPECIFICITY; GENOMIC SCALE; SITES; FEATURES; PREDICTION; COMPLEXES; PROTEINS; DATABASE	Protein-DNA binding is mediated by the recognition of the chemical signatures of the DNA bases and the 3D shape of the DNA molecule. Because DNA shape is a consequence of sequence, it is difficult to dissociate these modes of recognition. Here, we tease them apart in the context of Hox-DNA binding by mutating residues that, in a co-crystal structure, only recognize DNA shape. Complexes made with these mutants lose the preference to bind sequences with specific DNA shape features. Introducing shape-recognizing residues from one Hox protein to another swapped binding specificities in vitro and gene regulation in vivo. Statistical machine learning revealed that the accuracy of binding specificity predictions improves by adding shape features to a model that only depends on sequence, and feature selection identified shape features important for recognition. Thus, shape readout is a direct and independent component of binding site selection by Hox proteins.

Multiple conformational states in retrospective virtual screening - homology models vs. crystal structures: beta-2 adrenergic receptor case study	JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS			English	Article						Crystal structures; Homology models; Virtual screening; Structural Interaction Fingerprints; Ensemble of receptors	SEROTONIN RECEPTORS; DRUG DISCOVERY; COMPLEX; ADRENOCEPTOR; ANTAGONIST; AGONIST; GPCRS	Background: Distinguishing active from inactive compounds is one of the crucial problems of molecular docking, especially in the context of virtual screening experiments. The randomization of poses and the natural flexibility of the protein make this discrimination even harder. Some of the recent approaches to post-docking analysis use an ensemble of receptor models to mimic this naturally occurring conformational diversity. However, the optimal number of receptor conformations is yet to be determined. In this study, we compare the results of a retrospective screening of beta-2 adrenergic receptor ligands performed on both the ensemble of receptor conformations extracted from ten available crystal structures and an equal number of homology models. Additional analysis was also performed for homology models with up to 20 receptor conformations considered. Results: The docking results were encoded into the Structural Interaction Fingerprints and were automatically analyzed by support vector machine. The use of homology models in such virtual screening application was proved to be superior in comparison to crystal structures. Additionally, increasing the number of receptor conformational states led to enhanced effectiveness of active vs. inactive compounds discrimination. Conclusions: For virtual screening purposes, the use of homology models was found to be most beneficial, even in the presence of crystallographic data regarding the conformational space of the receptor. The results also showed that increasing the number of receptors considered improves the effectiveness of identifying active compounds by machine learning methods.

Automatic Detection of Diseased Tomato Plants Using Thermal and Stereo Visible Light Images	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DIGITAL INFRARED THERMOGRAPHY; DOWNY MILDEW; CANOPY; GRAPEVINE	Accurate and timely detection of plant diseases can help mitigate the worldwide losses experienced by the horticulture and agriculture industries each year. Thermal imaging provides a fast and non-destructive way of scanning plants for diseased regions and has been used by various researchers to study the effect of disease on the thermal profile of a plant. However, thermal image of a plant affected by disease has been known to be affected by environmental conditions which include leaf angles and depth of the canopy areas accessible to the thermal imaging camera. In this paper, we combine thermal and visible light image data with depth information and develop a machine learning system to remotely detect plants infected with the tomato powdery mildew fungus Oidium neolycopersici. We extract a novel feature set from the image data using local and global statistics and show that by combining these with the depth information, we can considerably improve the accuracy of detection of the diseased plants. In addition, we show that our novel feature set is capable of identifying plants which were not originally inoculated with the fungus at the start of the experiment but which subsequently developed disease through natural transmission.

Here, we demonstrate AutoPhase, a machine learning algorithm, which can identify the presence of the different phases in spectral and diffraction data. The algorithm uses training data to determine the characteristic features of each phase present and then uses these features to evaluate new spectral and diffraction data. AutoPhase was used to identify oxide phase growth during a high-throughput oxidation study of NiAl bond coats that used x-ray diffraction, Raman, and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques. The algorithm had a minimum overall accuracy of 88.9% for unprocessed data and 98.4% for postprocessed data. Although the features selected by AutoPhase for phase attribution were distinct from those of topical experts, these results show that AutoPhase can substantially increase the throughput high-throughput data analysis.

Underlying mechanisms that explain the highly specific binding of TFs to their genomic target sites are poorly understood. A better understanding of TF-DNA binding requires the ability to quantitatively model TF binding to accessible DNA as its basic step, before additional in vivo components can be considered. Traditionally, these models were built based on nucleotide sequence. Here, we integrated 3D DNA shape information derived with a high-throughput approach into the modeling of TF binding specificities. Using support vector regression, we trained quantitative models of TF binding specificity based on protein binding microarray (PBM) data for 68 mammalian TFs. The evaluation of our models included cross-validation on specific PBM array designs, testing across different PBM array designs, and using PBM-trained models to predict relative binding affinities derived from in vitro selection combined with deep sequencing (SELEX-seq). Our results showed that shape-augmented models compared favorably to sequence-based models. Although both k-mer and DNA shape features can encode inter-dependencies between nucleotide positions of the binding site, using DNA shape features reduced the dimensionality of the feature space. In addition, analyzing the feature weights of DNA shape-augmented models uncovered TF family-specific structural readout mechanisms that were not revealed by the DNA sequence. As such, this work combines knowledge from structural biology and genomics, and suggests a new path toward understanding TF binding and genome function.

These reflect the trends of the US housing market. In addition to these housing price indices, the development of a housing price prediction model can greatly assist in the prediction of future housing prices and the establishment of real estate policies. This study uses machine learning algorithms as a research methodology to develop a housing price prediction model. To improve the accuracy of housing price prediction, this paper analyzes the housing data of 5359 townhouses in Fairfax County, Virginia, gathered by the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) of the Metropolitan Regional Information Systems (MRIS). We develop a housing price prediction model based on machine learning algorithms such as C4.5, RIPPER, Naive Bayesian, and AdaBoost and compare their classification accuracy performance. We then propose an improved housing price prediction model to assist a house seller or a real estate agent make better informed decisions based on house price valuation. The experiments demonstrate that the RIPPER algorithm, based on accuracy, consistently outperforms the other models in the performance of housing price prediction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

During the five-year period from 2008 through 2012, approximately 90 films were released in the United States with production budgets in excess of $100 million. The majority of these films failed to recoup their production costs via gross domestic box office revenues. Existing decision support systems for pre-production analysis and green-lighting decisions lack sufficient accuracy to meaningfully assist decision makers in the film industry. Established models focus primarily upon post-release and post-production forecasts. These models often rely upon opening weekend data and are reasonably accurate but only if data up until the moment of release is included. A forecast made immediately prior to the debut of a film, however, is of limited value to stakeholders because it can only influence late-stage adjustments to advertising or distribution strategies and little else. In this paper we present the development of a model based upon a dynamic artificial neural network (DAN2) for the forecasting of movie revenues during the pre-production period. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of DAN2 and show that DAN2 improves box-office revenue forecasting accuracy by 32.8% over existing models. Subsequently, we offer an alternative modeling strategy by adding production budgets, pre-release advertising expenditures, runtime, and seasonality to the predictive variables. This alternative model produces excellent forecasting accuracy values of 94.1%. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we address the problem of finding a lens position where the image is in focus. We show that supervised machine learning techniques can be used to construct heuristics for a hill-climbing approach for finding such positions that out-performs previously proposed approaches in accuracy and robustly handles scenes with multiple objects at different focus distances and low-light situations. We gather a suite of 32 benchmarks representative of common photography situations and label them in an automated manner. A decision tree learning algorithm is used to induce heuristics from the data and the heuristics are then integrated into a control algorithm. Our experimental evaluation shows improved accuracy over previous work from 91.5% to 93.5% in regular settings and from 70.3% to 94.0% in low-light. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PsychoGenics developed three comprehensive highthroughtput systems, SmartCube (R), NeuroCube (R) and PhenoCube (R) systems, to increase the efficiency of the drug screening and phenotyping in rodents. These three systems capture different domains of behavior, namely, cognitive, motor, circadian, social, anxiety-like, gait and others, using custom-built computer vision software and machine learning algorithms for analysis. This review exemplifies the use of the three systems and explains how they can advance drug screening with their applications to phenotyping of disease models, drug screening, selection of lead candidates, behavior-driven lead optimization, and drug repurposing.

Clustering-based model of cysteine co-evolution improves disulfide bond connectivity prediction and reduces homologous sequence requirements	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							RECURSIVE NEURAL-NETWORKS; MACHINE-LEARNING-METHODS; CORRELATED MUTATIONS; CONTACT PREDICTION; PROTEINS; INFORMATION; PATTERNS; STATE	Motivation: Cysteine residues have particular structural and functional relevance in proteins because of their ability to form covalent disulfide bonds. Bioinformatics tools that can accurately predict cysteine bonding states are already available, whereas it remains challenging to infer the disulfide connectivity pattern of unknown protein sequences. Improving accuracy in this area is highly relevant for the structural and functional annotation of proteins. Results: We predict the intra-chain disulfide bond connectivity patterns starting from known cysteine bonding states with an evolutionary-based unsupervised approach called Sephiroth that relies on high-quality alignments obtained with HHblits and is based on a coarse-grained cluster-based modelization of tandem cysteine mutations within a protein family. We compared our method with state-of-the-art unsupervised predictors and achieve a performance improvement of 25-27% while requiring an order of magnitude less of aligned homologous sequences (similar to 10(3) instead of similar to 10(4)).

ChIP-chip experiments that interrogate the binding of particular TFs to genomic regions are used to reconstruct gene regulatory networks at genome-scale, but are plagued by high false-positive rates. Meanwhile, a large body of knowledge on high-quality regulatory interactions remains largely unexplored, as it is available only in natural language descriptions scattered over millions of scientific publications. Such data are hard to extract and regulatory data currently contain together only 503 regulatory relations between human TFs. Results: We developed a text-mining-assisted workflow to systematically extract knowledge about regulatory interactions between human TFs from the biological literature. We applied this workflow to the entire Medline, which helped us to identify more than 45 000 sentences potentially describing such relationships. We ranked these sentences by a machine-learning approach. The top-2500 sentences contained similar to 900 sentences that encompass relations already known in databases. By manually curating the remaining 1625 top-ranking sentences, we obtained more than 300 validated regulatory relationships that were not present in a regulatory database before. Full-text curation allowed us to obtain detailed information on the strength of experimental evidences supporting a relationship. Conclusions: We were able to increase curated information about the human core transcriptional network by >60% compared with the current content of regulatory databases. We observed improved performance when using the network for disease gene prioritization compared with the state-of-the-art.

A change in stability may subsequently lead to dysfunction and finally cause diseases. Moreover, protein engineering approaches aim to deliberately modify protein properties, where stability is a major constraint. In order to support basic research and protein design tasks, several computational tools for predicting the change in stability upon mutations have been developed. Comparative studies have shown the usefulness but also limitations of such programs. Results: We aim to contribute a novel method for predicting changes in stability upon point mutation in proteins called MAESTRO. MAESTRO is structure based and distinguishes itself from similar approaches in the following points: (i) MAESTRO implements a multi-agent machine learning system. (ii) It also provides predicted free energy change (Delta Delta G) values and a corresponding prediction confidence estimation. (iii) It provides high throughput scanning for multi-point mutations where sites and types of mutation can be comprehensively controlled. (iv) Finally, the software provides a specific mode for the prediction of stabilizing disulfide bonds. The predictive power of MAESTRO for single point mutations and stabilizing disulfide bonds is comparable to similar methods. Conclusions: MAESTRO is a versatile tool in the field of stability change prediction upon point mutations.

In this study, we recorded auditory stimuli in three-dimensional space and then replayed the stimuli through earphones during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). By employing a machine learning algorithm, we successfully decoded sound location from the blood oxygenation level-dependent signals in the temporal lobe. Analysis of the data revealed that different cortical patterns were evoked by sounds from different locations. Specifically, discrimination of sound location along the abscissa axis evoked robust responses in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) and right mid-STG, discrimination along the elevation (EL) axis evoked robust responses in the left posterior middle temporal lobe (MTL) and right STG, and discrimination along the ordinate axis evoked robust responses in the left mid-MTL and right mid-STG. These results support a distributed representation of acoustic space in human cortex.

Machine-learning scoring functions for identifying native poses of ligands docked to known and novel proteins	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							BINDING-AFFINITY PREDICTION; FLEXIBLE DOCKING; MOLECULAR DOCKING; PDBBIND DATABASE; VALIDATION; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM; SEARCH	Background: Molecular docking is a widely-employed method in structure-based drug design. An essential component of molecular docking programs is a scoring function (SF) that can be used to identify the most stable binding pose of a ligand, when bound to a receptor protein, from among a large set of candidate poses. Despite intense efforts in developing conventional SFs, which are either force-field based, knowledge-based, or empirical, their limited docking power (or ability to successfully identify the correct pose) has been a major impediment to cost-effective drug discovery. Therefore, in this work, we explore a range of novel SFs employing different machine-learning (ML) approaches in conjunction with physicochemical and geometrical features characterizing protein-ligand complexes to predict the native or near-native pose of a ligand docked to a receptor protein's binding site. We assess the docking accuracies of these new ML SFs as well as those of conventional SFs in the context of the 2007 PDBbind benchmark dataset on both diverse and homogeneous (protein-family-specific) test sets. Further, we perform a systematic analysis of the performance of the proposed SFs in identifying native poses of ligands that are docked to novel protein targets. Results and conclusion: We find that the best performing ML SF has a success rate of 80% in identifying poses that are within 1 angstrom root-mean-square deviation from the native poses of 65 different protein families. This is in comparison to a success rate of only 70% achieved by the best conventional SF, ASP, employed in the commercial docking software GOLD. In addition, the proposed ML SFs perform better on novel proteins that they were never trained on before. We also observed steady gains in the performance of these scoring functions as the training set size and number of features were increased by considering more protein-ligand complexes and/or more computationally-generated poses for each complex.

Gene-targeted and whole-exome experiments are mainly focused on coding sequence variants related to a single or multiple nucleotides. The analysis of the biological significance of this multitude of genomic variant is challenging and computational demanding. Results: We present PaPI, a new machine-learning approach to classify and score human coding variants by estimating the probability to damage their protein-related function. The novelty of this approach consists in using pseudo amino acid composition through which wild and mutated protein sequences are represented in a discrete model. A machine learning classifier has been trained on a set of known deleterious and benign coding variants with the aim to score unobserved variants by taking into account hidden sequence patterns in human genome potentially leading to diseases. We show how the combination of amphiphilic pseudo amino acid composition, evolutionary conservation and homologous proteins based methods outperforms several prediction algorithms and it is also able to score complex variants such as deletions, insertions and indels. Conclusions: This paper describes a machine-learning approach to predict the deleteriousness of human coding variants. A freely available web application (http://papi.unipv.it) has been developed with the presented method, able to score up to thousands variants in a single run.

Herein, we present systematic studies of the dynamical aspects of a model ternary metallic liquid Cu40Zr51Al9 using molecular dynamics simulations with embedded atom method. We observed a dynamical crossover from Arrhenius to super-Arrhenius behavior in the transport properties (self diffusion coefficient, self relaxation time, and shear viscosity) bordered at T-x similar to 1300 K. Unlike in many molecular and macromolecular liquids, this crossover phenomenon occurs well above the melting point of the system (T-m similar to 900 K) in the equilibrium liquid state; and the crossover temperature T-x is roughly twice of the glass-transition temperature of the system (T-g). Below T-x, we found the elemental dynamics decoupled and the Stokes-Einstein relation broke down, indicating the onset of heterogeneous spatially correlated dynamics in the system mediated by dynamic communications among local configurational excitations. To directly characterize and visualize the correlated dynamics, we employed a nonparametric, unsupervised machine learning technique and identified dynamical clusters of atoms with similar atomic mobility. The revealed average dynamical cluster size shows an accelerated increase below T-x and mimics the trend observed in other ensemble averaged quantities that are commonly used to quantify the spatially heterogeneous dynamics such as the non-Gaussian parameter alpha(2) and the four-point correlation function chi(4).

A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR DYNAMICAL MASS MEASUREMENTS OF GALAXY CLUSTERS	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmology: theory; dark matter; galaxies: clusters: general; galaxies: kinematics and dynamics; gravitation; large-scale structure of universe; methods: statistical	SOUTH-POLE TELESCOPE; VELOCITY DISPERSIONS; COSMOLOGICAL PARAMETERS; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; SCALING RELATIONS; RICH CLUSTERS; COMA CLUSTER; CATALOG; NORMALIZATION; CONSTRAINTS	We present a modern machine learning (ML) approach for cluster dynamical mass measurements that is a factor-of-two improvement over using a conventional scaling relation. Different methods are tested against a mock cluster catalog constructed using halos with mass >= 10 M(circle dot)h(-1) from Multidark's publicly available N-body MDPL halo catalog. In the conventional method, we use a standard M(sigma(nu)) power-law scaling relation to infer cluster mass, M, from line of sight (LOS) galaxy velocity dispersion, sigma(nu). The resulting fractional mass error distribution is broad, with width Delta epsilon approximate to 0.87 (68% scatter), and has extended high-error tails. The standard scaling relation can be simply enhanced by including higher-order moments of the LOS velocity distribution. Applying the kurtosis as a correction term to log (sigma(nu)) reduces the width of the error distribution to Delta epsilon approximate to 0.74 (16% improvement). ML can be used to take full advantage of all the information in the velocity distribution. We employ the Support Distribution Machines (SDMs) algorithm that learns from distributions of data to predict single values. SDMs trained and tested on the distribution of LOS velocities yield Delta epsilon approximate to 0.46 (47% improvement). Furthermore, the problematic tails of the mass error distribution are effectively eliminated. Decreasing cluster mass errors will improve measurements of the growth of structure and lead to tighter constraints on cosmological parameters.

The completed HOG accelerator contains gradient calculation circuit module and histogram accumulation circuit module. The linear SVM classification algorithm producing a number of necessary weak classifiers is combined with Adaboost algorithm to establish a strong classifier. The human detection is successfully implemented on a portable embedded platform to reduce the system cost and size. Experimental result shows that the performance error of accuracy appears merely about 0.1-0.4% in comparison between the presented FPGA based HW/SW co-design and the PC based pure software.

Although many machine learning algorithms exist that perform inference and learning in an optimal way, the complete description of how one of those algorithms (or a novel algorithm) can be implemented in the brain is currently incomplete. There have been many proposed solutions that address how neurons can perform optimal inference but the question of how synaptic plasticity can implement optimal learning is rarely addressed. This paper aims to unify the two fields of probabilistic inference and synaptic plasticity by using a neuronal network of realistic model spiking neurons to implement a well-studied computational model called the Helmholtz Machine. The Helmholtz Machine is amenable to neural implementation as the algorithm it uses to learn its parameters, called the wake-sleep algorithm, uses a local delta learning rule. Our spiking-neuron network implements both the delta rule and a small example of a Helmholtz machine. This neuronal network can learn an internal model of continuous-valued training data sets without supervision. The network can also perform inference on the learned internal models. We show how various biophysical features of the neural implementation constrain the parameters of the wake-sleep algorithm, such as the duration of the wake and sleep phases of learning and the minimal sample duration. We examine the deviations from optimal performance and tie them to the properties of the synaptic plasticity rule.

Human and Machine Learning in Non-Markovian Decision Making	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DOPAMINE NEURONS; PREDICTION ERRORS; REWARD VALUE; NEURAL BASIS; TD-GAMMON; RISK; UNCERTAINTY; FEEDBACK; MODEL; ENVIRONMENT	Humans can learn under a wide variety of feedback conditions. Reinforcement learning (RL), where a series of rewarded decisions must be made, is a particularly important type of learning. Computational and behavioral studies of RL have focused mainly on Markovian decision processes, where the next state depends on only the current state and action. Little is known about non-Markovian decision making, where the next state depends on more than the current state and action. Learning is non-Markovian, for example, when there is no unique mapping between actions and feedback. We have produced a model based on spiking neurons that can handle these non-Markovian conditions by performing policy gradient descent [1]. Here, we examine the model's performance and compare it with human learning and a Bayes optimal reference, which provides an upper-bound on performance. We find that in all cases, our population of spiking neurons model well-describes human performance.

J	Zhang, JJ; Fang, M; Li, X				Zhang, Ju-Jie; Fang, Min; Li, Xiao			Multi-label learning with discriminative features for each label	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Multi-label learning; Multi-label classification; Spectral clustering; Problem transformation	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; TEXT CATEGORIZATION; CLASSIFICATION	During the last decade, multi-label learning has attracted the attention of more and more researchers in machine learning field due to wide real-world applications. Existing approaches often predict an unseen example for all labels based on the same feature vector. However, this strategy might be suboptimal since different labels usually depend on different aspects of the feature vector. Furthermore, for each label there is close relationship between positive and negative instances, which is quite informative for classification. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called ML-DFL, which trains a model for each label with newly constructed discriminative features. In order to form these features, we also propose a spectral clustering algorithm SIA to find the closely located local structures between positive and negative instances, which are assumed to be of more discriminative information, and then transform the original data set by consulting the clustering results in a simple but effective way. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on a collection of benchmark data sets. The results clearly validate the superiority of ML-DFL to various competitors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Brain activity classifies adolescents with and without a familial history of substance use disorders	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						substance use disorders; family history; risk; fMRI; emotional conflict; brain connectivity; machine learning	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EMOTIONAL FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; HIGH-RISK; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; IMPULSE CONTROL; ALCOHOLISM; CONNECTIVITY; ACTIVATION	aimed to uncover differences in brain circuits of adolescents with parental positive or negative histories of substance use disorders (SUD), when performing a task that elicits emotional conflict, testing whether the brain circuits could serve as endophenotype markers to distinguish these adolescents. We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 11 adolescents with a positive familial history of SUD (FH+ group) and seven adolescents with a negative familial history of SUD (FH- group) when performing an emotional stroop task. We extracted brain features from the conflict-related contrast images in group level analyses and granger causality indices (GCIs) that measure the causal interactions among regions. Support vector machine (SVM) was applied to classify the FH+ and FH- adolescents. Adolescents with FH+ showed greater activity and weaker connectivity related to emotional conflict, decision making and reward system including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and ventral tegmental area (VIA). High classification accuracies were achieved with leave-one-out cross validation (89.75% for the maximum conflict, 96.71% when combining maximum conflict and general conflict contrast, 97.28% when combining activity of the two contrasts and GCIs). Individual contributions of the brain features to the classification were further investigated, indicating that activation in PFC, ACC, VIA and effective connectivity from PFC to ACC play the most important roles. We concluded that fundamental differences of neural substrates underlying cognitive behaviors of adolescents with parental positive or negative histories of SUD provide new insight into potential neurobiological mechanisms contributing to the elevated risk of FH+ individuals for developing SUD.

When applied to diploid genome assembly, these assemblers perform poorly, owing to the violation of assumptions during both the contigging and scaffolding phases. Effective tools to overcome these problems are in growing demand. Increasing parameter stringency during contigging is an effective solution to obtaining haplotype-specific contigs; however, effective algorithms for scaffolding such contigs are lacking. Methods: We present a stand-alone scaffolding algorithm, ScaffoldScaffolder, designed specifically for scaffolding diploid genomes. The algorithm identifies homologous sequences as found in "bubble" structures in scaffold graphs. Machine learning classification is used to then classify sequences in partial bubbles as homologous or non-homologous sequences prior to reconstructing haplotype-specific scaffolds. We define four new metrics for assessing diploid scaffolding accuracy: contig sequencing depth, contig homogeneity, phase group homogeneity, and heterogeneity between phase groups. Results: We demonstrate the viability of using bubbles to identify heterozygous homologous contigs, which we term homolotigs. We show that machine learning classification trained on these homolotig pairs can be used effectively for identifying homologous sequences elsewhere in the data with high precision (assuming error-free reads). Conclusion: More work is required to comparatively analyze this approach on real data with various parameters and classifiers against other diploid genome assembly methods. However, the initial results of ScaffoldScaffolder supply validity to the idea of employing machine learning in the difficult task of diploid genome assembly.

But how to correctly and efficiently decifer the gene regulatory network from high-throughput gene expression data is a big challenge due to the relatively small amount of observations and curse of dimensionality. Computational biologists have developed many statistical inference and machine learning algorithms to analyze the microarray data. In the previous studies, the correctness of an inferred regulatory network is manually checked through comparing with public database or an existing model. Results: In this work, we present a novel procedure to automatically infer and verify gene regulatory networks from time series expression data. The dynamic Bayesian network, a statistical inference algorithm, is at first implemented to infer an optimal network from time series microarray data of S. cerevisiae, then, a weighted symbolic model checker is applied to automatically verify or falsify the inferred network through checking some desired temporal logic formulas abstracted from experiments or public database. Conclusions: Our studies show that the marriage of statistical inference algorithm with model checking technique provides a more efficient way to automatically infer and verify the gene regulatory network from time series expression data than previous studies.

Our aim here was to evaluate the possibilities from a machine learning system intended to provide an estimation of the LVTES anatomical region with the use of ICD-EGM in the situation where 12-lead electrocardiogram of ventricular tachycardia are not available. Several machine learning techniques were specifically designed and benchmarked, both from classification (such as Neural Networks (NN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM)) and regression (Kernel Ridge Regression) problem statements. Classifiers were evaluated by using accuracy rates for LVTES identification in a controlled number of anatomical regions, and the regression approach quality was studied in terms of the spatial resolution. We analyzed the ICD-EGM of 23 patients (18 +/- 10 EGM per patient) during left ventricular pacing and simultaneous recording of the spatial coordinates of the pacing electrode with a navigation system. Several feature sets extracted from ICD-EGM (consisting of times and voltages) were shown to convey more discriminative information than the raw waveform. Among classifiers, the SVM performed slightly better than NN. In accordance with previous clinical works, the average spatial resolution for the LVTES was about 3 cm, as in our system, which allows it to support the faster determination of the LVTES in ablation procedures. The proposed approach also provides with a framework suitable for driving the design of improved performance future systems.

This adaptability involves several stress and developmentally responsive genes, in which microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important regulatory factors. However, the currently used approaches to identify miRNAs in this polyploid complex system focus on conserved and highly expressed miRNAs avoiding regularly those that are often lineage-specific, condition-specific, or appeared recently in evolution. In addition, many environmental and biological factors affecting miRNA expression were not yet considered, resulting still in an incomplete repertoire of wheat miRNAs. Results: We developed a conservation-independent technique based on an integrative approach that combines machine learning, bioinformatic tools, biological insights of known miRNA expression profiles and universal criteria of plant miRNAs to identify miRNAs with more confidence. The developed pipeline can potentially identify novel wheat miRNAs that share features common to several species or that are species specific or clade specific. It allowed the discovery of 199 miRNA candidates associated with different abiotic stresses and development stages. We also highlight from the raw data 267 miRNAs conserved with 43 miRBase families. The predicted miRNAs are highly associated with abiotic stress responses, tolerance and development. GO enrichment analysis showed that they may play biological and physiological roles associated with cold, salt and aluminum (Al) through auxin signaling pathways, regulation of gene expression, ubiquitination, transport, carbohydrates, gibberellins, lipid, glutathione and secondary metabolism, photosynthesis, as well as floral transition and flowering. Conclusion: This approach provides a broad repertoire of hexaploid wheat miRNAs associated with abiotic stress responses, tolerance and development. These valuable resources of expressed wheat miRNAs will help in elucidating the regulatory mechanisms involved in freezing and Al responses and tolerance mechanisms as well as for development and flowering. In the long term, it may help in breeding stress tolerant plants.

J	Kordjamshidi, P; Roth, D; Moens, MF				Kordjamshidi, Parisa; Roth, Dan; Moens, Marie-Francine			Structured learning for spatial information extraction from biomedical text: bacteria biotopes	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Bacteria biotopes; Spatial information extraction; Biomedical text mining; Structured learning; BioNLP		Background: We aim to automatically extract species names of bacteria and their locations from webpages. This task is important for exploiting the vast amount of biological knowledge which is expressed in diverse natural language texts and putting this knowledge in databases for easy access by biologists. The task is challenging and the previous results are far below an acceptable level of performance, particularly for extraction of localization relationships. Therefore, we aim to design a new system for such extractions, using the framework of structured machine learning techniques. Results: We design a new model for joint extraction of biomedical entities and the localization relationship. Our model is based on a spatial role labeling (SpRL) model designed for spatial understanding of unrestricted text. We extend SpRL to extract discourse level spatial relations in the biomedical domain and apply it on the BioNLP-ST 2013, BB-shared task. We highlight the main differences between general spatial language understanding and spatial information extraction from the scientific text which is the focus of this work. We exploit the text's structure and discourse level global features. Our model and the designed features substantially improve on the previous systems, achieving an absolute improvement of approximately 57 percent over F1 measure of the best previous system for this task. Conclusions: Our experimental results indicate that a joint learning model over all entities and relationships in a document outperforms a model which extracts entities and relationships independently. Our global learning model significantly improves the state-of-the-art results on this task and has a high potential to be adopted in other natural language processing (NLP) tasks in the biomedical domain.

Encouraged by successful de novo 3D structure prediction of globular and alpha-helical membrane proteins from sequence alignments alone, we developed an approach to predict the 3D structure of TMBs. The approach combines the maximum-entropy evolutionary coupling method for predicting residue contacts (EVfold) with a machine-learning approach (boctopus2) for predicting beta-strands in the barrel. In a blinded test for 19 TMB proteins of known structure that have a sufficient number of diverse homologous sequences available, this combined method (EVfold_bb) predicts hydrogen-bonded residue pairs between adjacent beta-strands at an accuracy of similar to 70%. This accuracy is sufficient for the generation of all-atom 3D models. In the transmembrane barrel region, the average 3D structure accuracy [template-modeling (TM) score] of top-ranked models is 0.54 (ranging from 0.36 to 0.85), with a higher (44%) number of residue pairs in correct strand-strand registration than in earlier methods (18%). Although the nonbarrel regions are predicted less accurately overall, the evolutionary couplings identify some highly constrained loop residues and, for FecA protein, the barrel including the structure of a plug domain can be accurately modeled (TM score = 0.68). Lower prediction accuracy tends to be associated with insufficient sequence information and we therefore expect increasing numbers of beta-barrel families to become accessible to accurate 3D structure prediction as the number of available sequences increases.

Proteomic Analysis of Plasma from California Sea Lions (Zalophus californianus) Reveals Apolipoprotein E as a Candidate Biomarker of Chronic Domoic Acid Toxicosis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TOXICITY; NMDA; GLYCOSYLATION; NEUROTOXICITY; PATHOLOGY; EPILEPSY; NEURONS; DISEASE; MODEL; RATS	Domoic acid toxicosis (DAT) in California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) is caused by exposure to the marine biotoxin domoic acid and has been linked to massive stranding events and mortality. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs in addition to the presence of domoic acid in body fluids. Chronic DAT further is characterized by reoccurring seizures progressing to status epilepticus. Diagnosis of chronic DAT is often slow and problematic, and minimally invasive tests for DAT have been the focus of numerous recent biomarker studies. The goal of this study was to retrospectively profile plasma proteins in a population of sea lions with chronic DAT and those without DAT using two dimensional gel electrophoresis to discover whether individual, multiple, or combinations of protein and clinical data could be utilized to identify sea lions with DAT. Using a training set of 32 sea lion sera, 20 proteins and their isoforms were identified that were significantly different between the two groups (p<0.05). Interestingly, 11 apolipoprotein E (ApoE) charge forms were decreased in DAT samples, indicating that ApoE charge form distributions may be important in the progression of DAT. In order to develop a classifier of chronic DAT, an independent blinded test set of 20 sea lions, seven with chronic DAT, was used to validate models utilizing ApoE charge forms and eosinophil counts. The resulting support vector machine had high sensitivity (85.7% with 92.3% negative predictive value) and high specificity (92.3% with 85.7% positive predictive value). These results suggest that ApoE and eosinophil counts along with machine learning can perform as a robust and accurate tool to diagnose chronic DAT. Although this analysis is specifically focused on blood biomarkers and routine clinical data, the results demonstrate promise for future studies combining additional variables in multidimensional space to create robust classifiers.

However, these estimates are constrained to the satellite era while regions such as the Amazon basin have been heavily impacted by deforestation before this period. Assessing the net contribution of past tropical deforestation to the growth in atmospheric CO2 is therefore challenging. We address this lack of data by constructing two maps of potential AGB with a machine learning algorithm trained on the relationship between AGB and climate and topography in intact forest landscapes of the Amazon basin. Reconstructions converge to a current deficit of 11.5-12% in AGB or a net loss of similar to 7-8PgC of AGB in the Amazon basin compared to current estimates. This represents a net contribution of similar to 1.8 ppm of atmospheric CO2 or 1.5% of the historical growth.

A rapid event-related potential (ERP) method for point-of-care evaluation of brain function: Development of the Halifax Consciousness Scanner	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Event-related potential; MMN; P300; N400; Neurophysiology; Test battery	COGNITIVE EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SUBJECTS OWN NAME; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; COMATOSE PATIENTS; VEGETATIVE STATE; NONTRAUMATIC COMA; PERMUTATION TESTS; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; PREDICTIVE-VALUE; NOVELTY P3	Background: Event-related potentials (ERPs) may provide a non-invasive index of brain function for a range of clinical applications. However, as a lab-based technique, ERPs are limited by technical challenges that prevent full integration into clinical settings. New method: To translate ERP capabilities from the lab to clinical applications, we have developed methods like the Halifax Consciousness Scanner (HCS). HCS is essentially a rapid, automated ERP evaluation of brain functional status. The present study describes the ERP components evoked from auditory tones and speech stimuli. ERP results were obtained using a 5-min test in 100 healthy individuals. The HCS sequence was designed to evoke the N100, the mismatch negativity (MMN), P300, the early negative enhancement (ENE), and the N400. These components reflected sensation, perception, attention, memory, and language perception, respectively. Component detection was examined at group and individual levels, and evaluated across both statistical and classification approaches. Results: All ERP components were robustly detected at the group level. At the individual level, non-parametric statistical analyses showed reduced accuracy relative to support vector (SVM) machine classification, particularly for speech-based ERPs. Optimized SVM results were MMN:95.6%; P300:99.0%; ENE: 91.8%; and N400: 92.3%. Conclusions: A spectrum of individual-level ERPs can be obtained in a very short time. Machine learning classification improved detection accuracy across a large healthy control sample. Translating ERPs into clinical applications is increasingly possible at the individual level.

This measure enables the integration of classical graph theory indices with new knowledge pertaining to structural feature extraction from semantic networks. MiF improves the conventional Jaccard and/or Simpson indices, and reconciles both the geodesic information (random walk) and co-occurrence adjustment (degree balance and distribution). We measure the effectiveness of graph-based coefficients through the application of linguistic graph information for a neural activity recorded during conceptual processing in the human brain. Specifically, the MiF distance is computed between each of the nouns used in a previous neural experiment and each of the in-between words in a subgraph derived from the Edinburgh Word Association Thesaurus of English. From the MiF-based information matrix, a machine learning model can accurately obtain a scalar parameter that specifies the degree to which each voxel in (the MRI image of) the brain is activated by each word or each principal component of the intermediate semantic features. Furthermore, correlating the voxel information with the MiF-based principal components, a new computational neurolinguistics model with a network connectivity paradigm is created. This allows two dimensions of context space to be incorporated with both semantic and neural distributional representations.

Since there are thousands of compounds, this step should be both fast and effective in order to distinguish drug-like and nondrug-like molecules. Statistical machine learning methods are widely used in drug discovery studies for classification purpose. Here, we aim to develop a new tool, which can classify molecules as drug-like and nondrug-like based on various machine learning methods, including discriminant, tree-based, kernel-based, ensemble and other algorithms. To construct this tool, first, performances of twenty-three different machine learning algorithms are compared by ten different measures, then, ten best performing algorithms have been selected based on principal component and hierarchical cluster analysis results. Besides classification, this application has also ability to create heat map and dendrogram for visual inspection of the molecules through hierarchical cluster analysis. Moreover, users can connect the PubChem database to download molecular information and to create two-dimensional structures of compounds.

Because of PV's nonlinear characteristics, a variety of faults may be difficult to detect by conventional protection devices, leading to safety issues and fire hazards in PV fields. To fill this protection gap, machine learning techniques have been proposed for fault detection based on measurements, such as PV array voltage, current, irradiance, and temperature. However, existing solutions usually use supervised learning models, which are trained by numerous labeled data (known as fault types) and therefore, have drawbacks: 1) the labeled PV data are difficult or expensive to obtain, 2) the trained model is not easy to update, and 3) the model is difficult to visualize. To solve these issues, this paper proposes a graph-based semi-supervised learning model only using a few labeled training data that are normalized for better visualization. The proposed model not only detects the fault, but also further identifies the possible fault type in order to expedite system recovery. Once the model is built, it can learn PV systems autonomously over time as weather changes. Both simulation and experimental results show the effective fault detection and classification of the proposed method.

Application of the Bi-CoPaM Method to Five Escherichia Coli Datasets Generated under Various Biological Conditions	JOURNAL OF SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Genome-wide analysis; Consistent co-expression; Bi-CoPaM; Escherichia coli; Multiple datasets analysis	MICROARRAY DATA; BIOSYNTHESIS; DISCOVERY; GENES	The increasing amounts of high-throughput biological datasets stimulate the information engineering and machine learning research community to direct more studies towards designing and applying novel methods which are sophisticated and specialised to tackle the problems that are specific in such datasets. The recently proposed binarisation of consensus partition matrices (Bi-CoPaM) method tackles the problem of scrutinising multiple gene expression microarray datasets to identify the subsets of genes which are consistently co-expressed across them. It allows for clustering results which better reflect the biological fact that most of the genes in any cell are expected to be irrelevant to the specific context in hand, as well as the fact that many genes might participate in multiple processes. This has been achieved by clustering the given set of genes while allowing any gene to have any of the three eventualities, to be exclusively assigned to a single cluster, to be simultaneously assigned to multiple clusters, or not to be assigned to any of the clusters. In this study, we expand the scope of application of the Bi-CoPaM method by applying it, for the first time, to bacterial datasets, namely to a set of five Escherichia coli bacterial datasets generated under different biological conditions, in order to identify the subsets of genes which are consistently co-expressed, i.e. well correlated with each other. We identify two clusters with such consistent co-expression, and interestingly, they themselves are consistently negatively correlated with each other. The first cluster is enriched with genes participating in protein synthesis and DNA repair while the second is enriched with transporting genes. Consequently, we draw biological hypotheses that relate some of the genes with currently unknown biological processes to their potential processes. These hypotheses can serve as pilots for focused future gene discovery studies.

Rough set theory has been proved to be an excellent mathematical tool for dimension reduction. In this paper, based on rough set, a novel framework for ensemble is proposed. hi our proposed framework, the relationship among attributes in rough subspace is first considered, and the maximum dependency degree of attribute is first employed to effectively reduce the searching space of reducts and augment the diversity of selected reducts. In addition, in order to choose an appropriate reduct from the dynamic reduct searching space, an assessment function which can balance the accuracy and diversity is utilized. At last, a new method, i.e., Dynamic Rough Subspace based Selective Ensemble (DRSSE), which is derived from our framework is given. By repeatedly changing the searching space of reducts and selecting the next reduct from the changed searching space, DRSSE finally trains an ensemble system with these selected reducts. Compared with several available ensemble methods, experimental results with several datasets demonstrate that DRSSE can lead to a comparative or even better performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Munoz-Romero, S; Arenas-Garcia, J; Gomez-Verdejo, V				Munoz-Romero, Sergio; Arenas-Garcia, Jeronimo; Gomez-Verdejo, Vanessa			Sparse and kernel OPLS feature extraction based on eigenvalue problem solving	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Partial least squares; Orthonormalized PLS; Lasso regularization; Feature extraction; Sparse kernel representation	CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; REDUCED-RANK REGRESSION; VARIABLE SELECTION; COMPONENT ANALYSIS	Orthonormalized partial least squares (OPLS) is a popular multivariate analysis method to perform supervised feature extraction. Usually, in machine learning papers OPLS projections are obtained by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. However, in statistical papers the method is typically formulated in terms of a reduced-rank regression problem, leading to a formulation based on a standard eigenvalue decomposition. A first contribution of this paper is to derive explicit expressions for matching the OPLS solutions derived under both approaches and discuss that the standard eigenvalue formulation is also normally more convenient for feature extraction in machine learning. More importantly, since optimization with respect to the projection vectors is carried out without constraints via a minimization problem, inclusion of penalty terms that favor sparsity is straightforward. In the paper, we exploit this fact to propose modified versions of OPLS. In particular, relying on the l(1) norm, we propose a sparse version of linear OPLS, as well as a non-linear kernel OPLS with pattern selection. We also incorporate a group-lasso penalty to derive an OPLS method with true feature selection. The discriminative power of the proposed methods is analyzed on a benchmark of classification problems. Furthermore, we compare the degree of sparsity achieved by our methods and compare them with other state-of-the-art methods for sparse feature extraction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recently, most pedestrian detection approaches of machine learning and signal processing have achieved advanced performance in traditional natural images. However, there exists a limitation on the accuracy in pedestrian detection. The reason behind this is that supporting information for detecting pedestrian is limited. In fact, spectrum besides visible light can provide abundant discriminative information for pedestrian detection. Therefore, it is significative to exploit multi-spectral information for detection task. In this paper, a multi-spectral based pedestrian detection approach is proposed, which not only takes use of the information of red, green and blue (RGB) bands, but also incorporates the information of near-infrared spectrum into the detection process. Latent variable support vector machines (L-SVM) are employed to train the multi-spectral pedestrian detection model. Experiments are implemented on a new dataset containing 1826 multi-spectral image pairs. The experimental results illustrate that utilizing multi-spectral information achieves significant performance improvement in a pedestrian detection task compared with only using RGB information.

A total of nine machine learning models are applied to perform classification of the medical data sets. A number of useful performance metrics which include accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, as well as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve are computed. In addition to the original data sets, noisy data sets are generated to evaluate the robustness of the classifiers against noise. The 10-fold cross validation method is used to compute the performance statistics, in order to ensure statistically reliable results pertaining to classification of the ECG and Korotkoff signals are produced. The outcomes indicate that while logistic regression models perform the best with the original data set, ensemble machine learning models achieve good accuracy rates with noisy data sets.

J	Krishnamoorthy, S				Krishnamoorthy, Srikumar			Linguistic features for review helpfulness prediction	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Review helpfulness; Linguistic category features; Sentiment analysis; Machine learning; Text mining	CONSUMER-BEHAVIOR	Online reviews play a critical role in customer's purchase decision making process on the web. The reviews are often ranked based on user helpfulness votes to minimize the review information overload problem. This paper examines the factors that contribute towards helpfulness of online reviews and builds a predictive model. The proposed predictive model extracts novel linguistic category features by analysing the textual content of reviews. In addition, the model makes use of review metadata, subjectivity and readability related features for helpfulness prediction. Our experimental analysis on two real-life review datasets reveals that a hybrid set of features deliver the best predictive accuracy. We also show that the proposed linguistic category features are better predictors of review helpfulness for experience goods such as books, music, and video games. The findings of this study can provide new insights to e-commerce retailers for better organization and ranking of online reviews and help customers in making better product choices.

They are based on full initial ratings in a user-item matrix. However, most of the time in group recommender systems, this matrix is sparse and users' preferences are unknown. This deficiency may make memory-based collaborative filtering unsuitable for group recommender systems. This paper, improves memory-based techniques for group recommendation systems by resolving the data sparsity problem. The core of the proposed method is based on a support vector machine learning model that computes similarities between items. This method employs calculated similarities and enhances basic memory-based techniques. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method overcomes the memory-based techniques. It also indicates that the presented work outperforms the latent factor approach, which is very efficient in sparse conditions. Finally, it is indicated that the proposed method gives a better performance than existing approaches on generating group recommendations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper mainly concerns the classification performance of SVMs for multiple classes and auxiliary algorithms combined with SVMs. These auxiliary algorithms include Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm, parameters optimizing methods and Two-Step Classification strategy. Results are given under data-based framework that classification ability and operation efficiency of SVMs are both improved when dimension is reduced; and Two-Step Classification SVM (TSC-SVM) works well under circumstances that samples overlap with each other seriously. In TSC-SVM, differences between adjacent samples are denoised by wavelet transform and magnified by a proper weighting function, after samples are sorted into correct groups in the first step. Discussions and comparisons are based on abalone dataset According to the simulations, it is believed that step-wise SVMs have superior classification ability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Optimization techniques provide a way to efficiently search for these solutions. ACO applied to data mining tasks - a decision tree construction - is one of these methods and the focus of this paper. The Ant Colony Decision Tree (ACDT) approach generates solutions efficiently and effectively but scales poorly to large problems. This article merges the methods that have been developed for better construction of decision trees by ants. The ACDT approach is tested in the context of the bi-criteria evaluation function by focusing on two problems: the size of the decision trees and the accuracy of classification obtained during ACDT performance. This approach is tested in co-learning mechanism, it means agents-ants can interact during the construction decision trees via pheromone values. This cooperation is a chance of getting better results. The proposed methodology of analysis of ACDT is tested in a number of well-known benchmark data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The empirical results clearly show that the ACDT algorithm creates good solutions which are located in the Pareto front.

Wavelet coefficients, which serve as inputs to the IT2FLS, are a compact form of original data but they exhibits highly discriminative features. The integration between WT and IT2FLS aims to cope with both high-dimensional data challenge and uncertainty. IT2FLS utilizes a hybrid learning process comprising unsupervised structure learning by the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering and supervised parameter tuning by genetic algorithm. This learning process is computationally expensive, especially when employed with high-dimensional data. The application of WT therefore reduces computational burden and enhances performance of IT2FLS. Experiments are implemented with two frequently used medical datasets from the UCI Repository for machine learning: the Wisconsin breast cancer and Cleveland heart disease. A number of important metrics are computed to measure the performance of the classification. They consist of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results demonstrate a significant dominance of the wavelet-IT2FLS approach compared to other machine learning methods including probabilistic neural network, support vector machine, fuzzy ARTMAP, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. The proposed approach is thus useful as a decision support system for clinicians and practitioners in the medical practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Experiments indicate that the proposed multiple-mapping kernel framework (MMKF) is effective for hyper-spectral image classification.

The aim of instance selection is to reduce the data size by filtering out noisy data, which may degrade the mining performance, from a given dataset. Genetic algorithms have presented an effective instance selection approach to improve the performance of data mining algorithms. However, current approaches only pursue the simplest evolutionary process based on the most reasonable and simplest rules. In this paper, we introduce a novel instance selection algorithm, namely a genetic-based biological algorithm (GBA). GBA fits a "biological evolution" into the evolutionary process, where the most streamlined process also complies with the reasonable rules. In other words, after long-term evolution, organisms find the most efficient way to allocate resources and evolve. Consequently, we can closely simulate the natural evolution of an algorithm, such that the algorithm will be both efficient and effective. Our experiments are based on comparing GBA with five state-of-the-art algorithms over 50 different domain datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The experimental results demonstrate that GBA outperforms these baselines, providing the lowest classification error rate and the least storage requirement. Moreover, GBA is very computational efficient, which only requires slightly larger computational cost than GA.

H.; Sahoo, Doyen; Liu, Zhi-Yong			Moving average reversion strategy for on-line portfolio selection	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Portfolio selection; On-line learning; Mean reversion; Moving average reversion		On-line portfolio selection, a fundamental problem in computational finance, has attracted increasing interest from artificial intelligence and machine learning communities in recent years. Empirical evidence shows that stock's high and low prices are temporary and stock prices are likely to follow the mean reversion phenomenon. While existing mean reversion strategies are shown to achieve good empirical performance on many real datasets, they often make the single-period mean reversion assumption, which is not always satisfied, leading to poor performance in certain real datasets. To overcome this limitation, this article proposes a multiple-period mean reversion, or so-called "Moving Average Reversion" (MAR), and a new on-line portfolio selection strategy named "On-Line Moving Average Reversion" (OLMAR), which exploits MAR via efficient and scalable online machine learning techniques. From our empirical results on real markets, we found that OLMAR can overcome the drawbacks of existing mean reversion algorithms and achieve significantly better results, especially on the datasets where existing mean reversion algorithms failed. In addition to its superior empirical performance, OLMAR also runs extremely fast, further supporting its practical applicability to a wide range of applications.

This study developed an evolutionary metaheuristic intelligence model for efficiently and accurately estimating reinforcement loads. The proposed model improves the prediction capability of the firefly algorithm (FA) by integrating intelligent components, namely, a chaotic map, an adaptive inertia weight, and a Levy flight. The enhanced FA is then used to optimise the hyperparameters for a least squares support vector regression model. The proposed model was validated using a database of 15 wall case studies (94 data points in total) via a cross-validation algorithm. The method was then compared with conventional prediction methods in terms of the accuracy for predicting the reinforcement tensile loads of GRS structures. The cross-validation results demonstrated that the proposed model has a superior accuracy and mean absolute percentage errors lower than 10%. Moreover, a comparison with the baseline models and empirical methods indicate that the evolutionary metaheuristic intelligence model provides a significant improvement in terms of the root mean square errors (by 63.61-92.30%).

To reduce the noise sensitive issue of common machine learning strategies, a kind of SOC estimation method based on fuzzy least square support vector machine is proposed. By applying fuzzy inference and nonlinear correlation measurement, the effects of the samples with low confidence can be reduced. Further, a new approach for determining the error interval of regression results is proposed to avoid the control system malfunction. Tests are carried out on modified COMS electric vehicles, with two battery packs each consists of 24 50 Ah LiFePO4 batteries. The effectiveness of the method is proven by the test and the comparison with other popular methods. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Many approaches and tools have been proposed in the literature providing different results. In this paper, we extend a previous work regarding the application of machine learning techniques for design pattern detection, by adding a more extensive experimentation and enhancements in the analysis method. Here we exploit a combination of graph matching and machine learning techniques, implemented in a tool we developed, called MARPLE-DPD. Our approach allows the application of machine learning techniques, leveraging a modeling of design patterns that is able to represent pattern instances composed of a variable number of classes. We describe the experimentations for the detection of five design patterns on 10 open source software systems, compare the performances obtained by different learning models with respect to a baseline, and discuss the encountered issues.

For knowledge discovery in huge, complex and nonlinear stock market data, the eXtended Classifier Systems (XCS) is quite suitable because of the excellent learning and explicit expression abilities derived from its intrinsic techniques that include classification rule mining, evolutionary learning and reinforcement learning. This paper presents an Evolutionary Trend Reversion Model (eTrendRev), which is based on the proposed XCS with learn mode (XCSL) and trend-reversion strategy. The eTrendRev is highlighted in three aspects; (1) the explicit rules generated by XCSL are more understandable than black-box models, such as neural networks, thus can provide justifiable knowledge to guide trading; (2) the original pure explore mode of XCS is substituted by the proposed learn mode, which is shown in this study to perform better and is more stable; (3) a variety of trend-reversion strategies are integrated and made dynamic through evolutionary learning. For model evaluation, experiments were carried out on the historical data of the Shanghai Composite Index and the NASDAQ Composite Index, and back-testing results indicate that eTrendRev can produce higher return with lower risk and recognize significant market turning points in a timely fashion. This study also confirms the profitability of using sole trend-reversion indicators in machine learning-based QI model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Particle Swarm Optimization based dictionary learning for remote sensing big data	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Online dictionary learning; Particle Swarm Optimization; Sparse representation; Big data; Machine learning	IMAGE REPRESENTATIONS; K-SVD; SPARSE; NOISY	Dictionary learning, which is based on sparse coding, has been frequently applied to many tasks related to remote sensing processes. Recently, many new non-analytic dictionary-learning algorithms have been proposed. Some are based on online learning. In online learning, data can be sequentially incorporated into the computation process. Therefore, these algorithms can train dictionaries using large-scale remote sensing images. However, their accuracy is decreased for two reasons. On one hand, it is a strategy of updating all atoms at once; on the other, the direction of optimization, such as the gradient, is not well estimated because of the complexity of the data and the model. In this paper, we propose a method of improved online dictionary learning based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In our iterations, we reasonably selected special atoms within the dictionary and then introduced the PSO into the atom-updating stage of the dictionary-learning model. Furthermore, to guide the direction of the optimization, the prior reference data were introduced into the PSO model. As a result, the movement dimension of the particles is reasonably limited and the accuracy and effectiveness of the dictionary are promoted, but without heavy computational burdens. Experiments confirm that our proposed algorithm improves the performance of the algorithm for large-scale remote sensing images, and our method also has a better effect on noise suppression.

The Consolidated Tree Construction (CTC) algorithm was proposed as an algorithm to solve a classification problem involving a high degree of class imbalance without losing the explaining capacity, a desirable characteristic of single decision trees and rule sets. CTC works by resampling the training sample and building a tree from each subsample, in a similar manner to ensemble classifiers, but applying the ensemble process during the tree construction phase, resulting in a unique final tree. In the ECML/PKDD 2013 conference the term "Inner Ensembles" was coined to refer to such methodologies. In this paper we propose a resampling strategy for classification algorithms that use multiple subsamples. This strategy is based on the class distribution of the training sample to ensure a minimum representation of all classes when resampling. This strategy has been applied to CTC over different classification contexts. A robust classification algorithm should not just be able to rank in the top positions for certain classification problems but should be able to excel when faced with a broad range of problems. In this paper we establish the robustness of the CTC algorithm against a wide set of classification algorithms with explaining capacity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The DM method uses a Markovian diffusion process to model and analyze data. A spectral analysis of the DM kernel yields a map of the data into a low dimensional space, where Euclidean distances between the mapped data points represent the diffusion distances between the corresponding high dimensional data points. Many machine learning methods, which are based on the Euclidean metric, can be applied to the mapped data points in order to take advantage of the diffusion relations between them. However, a significant drawback of the DM is the need to apply spectral decomposition to a kernel matrix, which becomes infeasible for large datasets. In this paper, we present an efficient approximation of the DM embedding. The presented approximation algorithm produces a dictionary of data points by identifying a small set of informative representatives. Then, based on this dictionary, the entire dataset is efficiently embedded into a low dimensional space. The Euclidean distances in the resulting embedded space approximate the diffusion distances. The properties of the presented embedding and its relation to DM method are analyzed and demonstrated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Automated STN detection typically involves extracting quantitative features from MERs for classifier training. This study evaluates the ability of feature selection to identify optimal feature combinations for automated STN localization. Methods: We extracted 13 features from 65 MERs for classifier training. For logistic regression (LR) classification, we compared classifiers identified by feature selection to those containing all possible feature combinations. We used classification error as our metric with hold-one-patient-out cross-validation. We also compared patient-specific vs. independent normalization on classifier performance. Results: Feature selection and patient-specific normalization were superior to non-optimized, patient-independent classifiers. Feature selection, patient-specific normalization, and both produced relative error reductions of 4.95%, 31.36%, and 38.92%, respectively. Three of four feature-selected LR classifiers performed better than 99% of classifiers with all possible feature combinations. Optimal feature combinations were not predictable from individual feature performance. Conclusions: Feature selection reduces classification error in automated STN localization from MERs. Additional improvement from patient-specific normalization suggests these approaches are necessary for clinically reliable automation of MER interpretation. Significance: These findings represent an incremental advance in automated functional localization of STN from MER in DBS surgery. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Usually, this classification setting is by nature highly imbalanced, because there are classes in the problem that are a priori more probable than others. Although standard over-sampling methods can improve the classification of minority classes in ordinal classification, they tend to introduce severe errors in terms of the ordinal label scale, given that they do not take the ordering into account. A specific ordinal over-sampling method is developed in this paper for the first time in order to improve the performance of machine learning classifiers. The method proposed includes ordinal information by approaching over-sampling from a graph-based perspective. The results presented in this paper show the good synergy of a popular ordinal regression method (a reformulation of support vector machines) with the graph-based proposed algorithms, and the possibility of improving both the classification and the ordering of minority classes. A cost-sensitive version of the ordinal regression method is also introduced and compared with the over-sampling proposals, showing in general lower performance for minority classes.

We consider the optimality of ranking algorithms through minimization of the theoretical risk which combines pairwise ranking errors of ordinal categories with differential ranking costs. The extension shows that for a certain class of convex loss functions including exponential loss, the optimal ranking function can be represented as a ratio of weighted conditional probability of upper categories to lower categories, where the weights are given by the misranking costs. This result also bridges traditional ranking methods such as proportional odds model in statistics with various ranking algorithms in machine learning. Further, the analysis of multipartite ranking with different costs provides a new perspective on non-smooth listwise ranking measures such as the discounted cumulative gain and preference learning. We illustrate our findings with simulation study and real data analysis.

The input noisy distance measurements are first embedded by Diffusion embedding and then by Isomap. This allows to better estimate the intrinsic network geometry and derive improved adaptive bases, that are used to estimate the global localization via L-1 regression. We then introduce the Augmented Dual Embedding by computationally augmenting the set of measured distances and computing the dual embedding. This significantly improves the scheme's robustness and accuracy. We also propose a straightforward approach to preprocessing the noisy distances via the triangle inequality. The proposed scheme is experimentally shown to outperform contemporary state-of-the-art localization schemes.

Discrimination of Schizophrenia Auditory Hallucinators by Machine Learning of Resting-State Functional MRI	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Resting state fMRI; Schizophrenia; machine learning; feature selection; lattice computing; functional connectivity; lattice auto-associative memories	MORPHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATIVE MEMORIES; SUPPORT-VECTOR-MACHINES; DOMAIN CRITERIA RDOC; VERBAL HALLUCINATIONS; REGIONAL HOMOGENEITY; COROLLARY DISCHARGE; HESCHLS GYRUS; FMRI DATA; 1ST-DEGREE RELATIVES; NEURAL-NETWORK	Auditory hallucinations (AH) are a symptom that is most often associated with schizophrenia, but patients with other neuropsychiatric conditions, and even a small percentage of healthy individuals, may also experience AH. Elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying AH in schizophrenia may offer insight into the pathophysiology associated with AH more broadly across multiple neuropsychiatric disease conditions. In this paper, we address the problem of classifying schizophrenia patients with and without a history of AH, and healthy control (HC) subjects. To this end, we performed feature extraction from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data and applied machine learning classifiers, testing two kinds of neuroimaging features: (a) functional connectivity (FC) measures computed by lattice auto-associative memories (LAAM), and (b) local activity (LA) measures, including regional homogeneity (ReHo) and fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF). We show that it is possible to perform classification within each pair of subject groups with high accuracy. Discrimination between patients with and without lifetime AH was highest, while discrimination between schizophrenia patients and HC participants was worst, suggesting that classification according to the symptom dimension of AH may be more valid than discrimination on the basis of traditional diagnostic categories. FC measures seeded in right Heschl's gyrus (RHG) consistently showed stronger discriminative power than those seeded in left Heschl's gyrus (LHG), a finding that appears to support AH models focusing on right hemisphere abnormalities. The cortical brain localizations derived from the features with strong classification performance are consistent with proposed AH models, and include left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), parahippocampal gyri, the cingulate cortex, as well as several temporal and prefrontal cortical brain regions. Overall, the observed findings suggest that computational intelligence approaches can provide robust tools for uncovering subtleties in complex neuroimaging data, and have the potential to advance the search for more neuroscience-based criteria for classifying mental illness in psychiatry research.

Using Supervised Machine Learning to Code Policy Issues: Can Classifiers Generalize across Contexts?	ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						agenda setting; content analysis; machine learning; big data	AGENDAS	Content analysis of political communication usually covers large amounts of material and makes the study of dynamics in issue salience a costly enterprise. In this article, we present a supervised machine learning approach for the automatic coding of policy issues, which we apply to news articles and parliamentary questions. Comparing computer-based annotations with human annotations shows that our method approaches the performance of human coders. Furthermore, we investigate the capability of an automatic coding tool, which is based on supervised machine learning, to generalize across contexts. We conclude by highlighting implications for methodological advances and empirical theory testing.

J	Lin, J				Lin, Jimmy			On Building Better Mousetraps and Understanding the Human Condition: Reflections on Big Data in the Social Sciences	ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						big data; computational social science; machine learning; data mining; log analysis	CHOCOLATE CONSUMPTION; NOBEL	Over the past few years, we have seen the emergence of big data: disruptive technologies that have transformed commerce, science, and many aspects of society. Despite the tremendous enthusiasm for big data, there is no shortage of detractors. This article argues that many criticisms stem from a fundamental confusion over goals: whether the desired outcome of big data use is better science or better engineering. Critics point to the rejection of traditional data collection and analysis methods, confusion between correlation and causation, and an indifference to models with explanatory power. From the perspective of advancing social science, these are valid reservations. I contend, however, that if the end goal of big data use is to engineer computational artifacts that are more effective according to well-defined metrics, then whatever improves those metrics should be exploited without prejudice. Sound scientific reasoning, while helpful, is not necessary to improve engineering. Understanding the distinction between science and engineering resolves many of the apparent controversies surrounding big data and helps to clarify the criteria by which contributions should be assessed.

This article offers an overview of machine learning methods well-suited to social science problems, including decision trees, dimension reduction methods, nearest neighbor algorithms, support vector models, and penalized regression. In addition to novel algorithms, machine learning places great emphasis on model checking (through holdout samples and cross-validation) and model shrinkage (adjusting predictions toward the mean to reduce overfitting). This article advocates replacing typical regression analyses with two different sorts of models used in concert. A multi-algorithm ensemble approach should be used to determine the noise floor of a given dataset, while simpler methods such as penalized regression or decision trees should be used for theory building and hypothesis testing.

The ability of different lexicons to correctly identify affective tone (e.g., positive vs. negative) is assessed in different social media environments. Our comparisons examine the reliability and validity of publicly available, off-the-shelf classifiers. We use datasets from a range of online sources that vary in the diversity and formality of the language used, and we apply different classifiers to extract information about the affective tone in these datasets. We first measure agreement (reliability test) and then compare their classifications with the benchmark of human coding (validity test). Our analyses show that validity and reliability vary with the formality and diversity of the text; we also show that ready-to-use methods leave much space for improvement when analyzing domain-specific content and that a machine-learning approach offers more accurate predictions across communication domains.

Research has long debated whether the citizenry reacts to what candidates say, how they say it, or simply how they appear. This study uses detailed coding of the first 2012 debate between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney to test the relative influence of the candidates' verbal persuasiveness and nonverbal features on viewers' second screen behaviortheir use of computers, tablets, and mobile phones to enhance or extend the televised viewing experience. To examine these relationships, we merged two datasets: (1) a shot-by-shot content analysis coded for functional, tonal, and visual elements of both candidates' communication behavior during the debate; and (2) corresponding real-time measures, synched and lagged, of the volume and sentiment of Twitter expression about Obama and Romney. We find the candidates' facial expressions and physical gestures to be more consistent and robust predictors of the volume and valence of Twitter expression than candidates' persuasive strategies, verbal utterances, and voice tone during the debate.

In this study, we proposed a probabilistic model using Bayesian network (BN) to predict the short survivability of patients with brain metastasis from lung cancer. A nationwide cancer patient database from 1996 to 2010 in Taiwan was used. The cohort consisted of 438 patients with brain metastasis from lung cancer. We utilized synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) to solve the imbalanced property embedded in the problem. The proposed BN was compared with three competitive models, namely, naive Bayes (NB), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machine (SVM). Statistical analysis showed that performances of BN, LR, NB, and SVM were statistically the same in terms of all indices with low sensitivity when these models were applied on an imbalanced data set. Results also showed that SMOTE can improve the performance of the four models in terms of sensitivity, while keeping high accuracy and specificity. Further, the proposed BN is more effective as compared with NB, LR, and SVM from two perspectives: the transparency and ability to show the relation of factors affecting brain metastasis from lung cancer; it allows decision makers to find the probability despite incomplete evidence and information; and the sensitivity of the proposed BN is the highest among all standard machine learning methods.

Integrating biological knowledge based on functional annotations for biclustering of gene expression data	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Biclustering of gene expression data; Integration of biological knowledge; Scatter search	MICROARRAY DATA; CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM; REGULATORY NETWORKS; SIMILARITY; PROTEOMICS; DISCOVERY; PATTERNS; ONTOLOGY; SEARCH; SETS	Gene expression data analysis is based on the assumption that co-expressed genes imply co-regulated genes. This assumption is being reformulated because the co-expression of a group of genes may be the result of an independent activation with respect to the same experimental condition and not due to the same regulatory regime. For this reason, traditional techniques are recently being improved with the use of prior biological knowledge from open-access repositories together with gene expression data. Biclustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that searches patterns in gene expression data matrices. A scatter search-based biclustering algorithm that integrates biological information is proposed in this paper. In addition to the gene expression data matrix, the input of the algorithm is only a direct annotation file that relates each gene to a set of terms from a biological repository where genes are annotated. Two different biological measures, FracGO and SimNTO, are proposed to integrate this information by means of its addition to-be-optimized fitness function in the scatter search scheme. The measure FracGO is based on the biological enrichment and SimNTO is based on the overlapping among GO annotations of pairs of genes. Experimental results evaluate the proposed algorithm for two datasets and show the algorithm performs better when biological knowledge is integrated. Moreover, the analysis and comparison between the two different biological measures is presented and it is concluded that the differences depend on both the data source and how the annotation file has been built in the case GO is used. It is also shown that the proposed algorithm obtains a greater number of enriched biclusters than other classical biclustering algorithms typically used as benchmark and an analysis of the overlapping among biclusters reveals that the biclusters obtained present a low overlapping. The proposed methodology is a general-purpose algorithm which allows the integration of biological information from several sources and can be extended to other biclustering algorithms based on the optimization of a merit function.

Due to the bursty and diverse tenant workloads, over-provisioning for the peak or under-provisioning for the off-peak often results in either infrastructure cost or service level agreement (SLA) penalty cost. Moreover, although the process of scaling out database systems will help DBaaS providers satisfy tenants' service level agreement, its indiscriminate use has performance implications or incurs action cost. In this paper, we propose SmartSLA, a cost-sensitive virtualized resource management system for CPU-bound database services which is composed of two modules. The system modeling module uses machine learning techniques to learn a model for predicting the SLA penalty cost for each tenant under different resource allocations. Based on the learned model, the resource allocating module dynamically adjusts the resource allocation by weighing the potential reduction of SLA penalty cost against increase of infrastructure cost and action cost. SmartSLA is evaluated by using the TPC-W and modified YCSB benchmarks with dynamic workload trace and multiple database tenants. The experimental results show that SmartSLA is able to minimize the total cost under time-varying workloads compared to the other cost-insensitive approaches.

Super Learner Analysis of Electronic Adherence Data Improves Viral Prediction and May Provide Strategies for Selective HIV RNA Monitoring	JAIDS-JOURNAL OF ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROMES			English	Article						HIV; adherence; antiretroviral therapy; virological failure; HIV RNA monitoring; Medication Event Monitoring System; Super Learner	PHARMACY REFILL ADHERENCE; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; VIROLOGICAL FAILURE; INFECTED PATIENTS; ADULTS; RESISTANCE; VALIDATION; EFAVIRENZ; ALGORITHM; SETTINGS	Objective: Regular HIV RNA testing for all HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is expensive and has low yield since most tests are undetectable. Selective testing of those at higher risk of failure may improve efficiency. We investigated whether a novel analysis of adherence data could correctly classify virological failure and potentially inform a selective testing strategy. Design: Multisite prospective cohort consortium. Methods: We evaluated longitudinal data on 1478 adult patients treated with ART and monitored using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) in 16 US cohorts contributing to the MACH14 consortium. Because the relationship between adherence and virological failure is complex and heterogeneous, we applied a machine-learning algorithm (Super Learner) to build a model for classifying failure and evaluated its performance using cross-validation. Results: Application of the Super Learner algorithm to MEMS data, combined with data on CD4(+) T-cell counts and ART regimen, significantly improved classification of virological failure over a single MEMS adherence measure. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, evaluated on data not used in model fitting, was 0.78 (95% confidence interval: 0.75 to 0.80) and 0.79 (95% confidence interval: 0.76 to 0.81) for failure defined as single HIV RNA level >1000 copies per milliliter or >400 copies per milliliter, respectively. Our results suggest that 25%-31% of viral load tests could be avoided while maintaining sensitivity for failure detection at or above 95%, for a cost savings of $16-$29 per person-month. Conclusions: Our findings provide initial proof of concept for the potential use of electronic medication adherence data to reduce costs through behavior-driven HIV RNA testing.

J	Le, T; Cuturi, M				Le, Tam; Cuturi, Marco			Adaptive Euclidean maps for histograms: generalized Aitchison embeddings	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Metric learning for histograms; Aitchison geometry; Probability simplex; Embeddings	COMPOSITIONAL DATA; SEQUENCES; FEATURES	Learning distances that are specifically designed to compare histograms in the probability simplex has recently attracted the attention of the machine learning community. Learning such distances is important because most machine learning problems involve bags of features rather than simple vectors. Ample empirical evidence suggests that the Euclidean distance in general and Mahalanobis metric learning in particular may not be suitable to quantify distances between points in the simplex. We propose in this paper a new contribution to address this problem by generalizing a family of embeddings proposed by Aitchison (J R Stat Soc 44:139-177, 1982) to map the probability simplex onto a suitable Euclidean space. We provide algorithms to estimate the parameters of such maps by building on previous work on metric learning approaches. The criterion we study is not convex, and we consider alternating optimization schemes as well as accelerated gradient descent approaches. These algorithms lead to representations that outperform alternative approaches to compare histograms in a variety of contexts.

In visual data exploration with scatter plots, no single plot is sufficient to analyze complicated high-dimensional data sets. Given numerous visualizations created with different features or methods, meta-visualization is needed to analyze the visualizations together. We solve how to arrange numerous visualizations onto a meta-visualization display, so that their similarities and differences can be analyzed. Visualization has recently been formalized as an information retrieval task; we extend this approach, and formalize meta-visualization as an information retrieval task whose performance can be rigorously quantified and optimized. We introduce a machine learning approach to optimize the meta-visualization, based on an information retrieval perspective: two visualizations are similar if the analyst would retrieve similar neighborhoods between data samples from either visualization. Based on the approach, we introduce a nonlinear embedding method for meta-visualization: it optimizes locations of visualizations on a display, so that visualizations giving similar information about data are close to each other. In experiments we show such meta-visualization outperforms alternatives, and yields insight into data in several case studies.

J	Su, HY; Rousu, J				Su, Hongyu; Rousu, Juho			Multilabel classification through random graph ensembles	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Multilabel classification; Structured output; Ensemble methods; Kernel methods; Graphical models	TEXT CATEGORIZATION	We present new methods for multilabel classification, relying on ensemble learning on a collection of random output graphs imposed on the multilabel, and a kernel-based structured output learner as the base classifier. For ensemble learning, differences among the output graphs provide the required base classifier diversity and lead to improved performance in the increasing size of the ensemble. We study different methods of forming the ensemble prediction, including majority voting and two methods that perform inferences over the graph structures before or after combining the base models into the ensemble. We put forward a theoretical explanation of the behaviour of multilabel ensembles in terms of the diversity and coherence of microlabel predictions, generalizing previous work on single target ensembles. We compare our methods on a set of heterogeneous multilabel benchmark problems against the state-of-the-art machine learning approaches, including multilabel AdaBoost, convex multitask feature learning, as well as single target learning approaches represented by Bagging and SVM. In our experiments, the random graph ensembles are very competitive and robust, ranking first or second on most of the datasets. Overall, our results show that our proposed random graph ensembles are viable alternatives to flat multilabel and multitask learners.

J	Lin, ZC; Liu, RS; Li, H				Lin, Zhouchen; Liu, Risheng; Li, Huan			Linearized alternating direction method with parallel splitting and adaptive penalty for separable convex programs in machine learning	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Convex programs; Alternating direction method; Linearized alternating direction method; Proximal alternating direction method; Parallel splitting; Adaptive renalty	THRESHOLDING ALGORITHM; CONVERGENCE RATE; OPTIMIZATION	Many problems in machine learning and other fields can be (re)formulated as linearly constrained separable convex programs. In most of the cases, there are multiple blocks of variables. However, the traditional alternating direction method (ADM) and its linearized version (LADM, obtained by linearizing the quadratic penalty term) are for the two-block case and cannot be naively generalized to solve the multi-block case. So there is great demand on extending the ADM based methods for the multi-block case. In this paper, we propose LADM with parallel splitting and adaptive penalty (LADMPSAP) to solve multi-block separable convex programs efficiently. When all the component objective functions have bounded subgradients, we obtain convergence results that are stronger than those of ADM and LADM, e.g., allowing the penalty parameter to be unbounded and proving the sufficient and necessary conditions for global convergence. We further propose a simple optimality measure and reveal the convergence rate of LADMPSAP in an ergodic sense. For programs with extra convex set constraints, with refined parameter estimation we devise a practical version of LADMPSAP for faster convergence. Finally, we generalize LADMPSAP to handle programs with more difficult objective functions by linearizing part of the objective function as well. LADMPSAP is particularly suitable for sparse representation and low-rank recovery problems because its subproblems have closed form solutions and the sparsity and low-rankness of the iterates can be preserved during the iteration. It is also highly parallelizable and hence fits for parallel or distributed computing. Numerical experiments testify to the advantages of LADMPSAP in speed and numerical accuracy.

J	Mason, RA; Just, MA				Mason, Robert A.; Just, Marcel Adam			Physics instruction induces changes in neural knowledge representation during successive stages of learning	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Learning; fMRI; Causality; Mechanical systems; Knowledge representation	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PRIMARY AUDITORY-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; BIOLOGICAL MOTION; MENTAL ROTATION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; POOR READERS; WHOLE-BRAIN; FMRI	Incremental instruction on the workings of a set of mechanical systems induced a progression of changes in the neural representations of the systems. The neural representations of four mechanical systems were assessed before, during, and after three phases of incremental instruction (which first provided information about the system components, then provided partial causal information, and finally provided full functional information). In 14 participants, the neural representations of four systems (a bathroom scale, a fire extinguisher, an automobile braking system, and a trumpet) were assessed using three recently developed techniques: (1) machine learning and classification of multi-voxel patterns; (2) localization of consistently responding voxels; and (3) representational similarity analysis (RSA). The neural representations of the systems progressed through four stages, or states, involving spatially and temporally distinct multi-voxel patterns: (1) initially, the representation was primarily visual (occipital cortex); (2) it subsequently included a large parietal component; (3) it eventually became cortically diverse (frontal, parietal, temporal, and medial frontal regions); and (4) at the end, it demonstrated a strong frontal cortex weighting (frontal and motor regions). At each stage of knowledge, it was possible for a classifier to identify which one of four mechanical systems a participant was thinking about, based on their brain activation patterns. The progression of representational states was suggestive of progressive stages of learning: (1) encoding information from the display; (2) mental animation, possibly involving imagining the components moving; (3) generating causal hypotheses associated with mental animation; and finally (4) determining how a person (probably oneself) would interact with the system. This interpretation yields an initial, cortically-grounded, theory of learning of physical systems that potentially can be related to cognitive learning theories by suggesting links between cortical representations, stages of learning, and the understanding of simple systems.

Given decision-making under severe time pressure, it is reasonable to posit that the brain configures itself, prior to processing stimulus information, in a way that depends upon prior beliefs and/or anticipation. However, relatively little is known about such configuration processes, how they might be manifested in the human brain, or ultimately how they mediate task performance. Here we show that network configuration, defined via pre-stimulus functional connectivity measures estimated from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, is predictive of performance in a time-pressured Go/No- Go task. Specifically, using connectivity measures to summarize network properties, we show that prestimulus brain state can be used to discriminate behaviorally correct and incorrect trials, as well as behaviorally correct commission and omission trial categories. More broadly, our results show that pre-stimulus functional configurations of cortical and sub-cortical networks can be a major determiner of task performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Two structurally new compounds were found to be characterized by a significant 5-HT6R activity (K-i of 119 and 670 nM). The compounds do not possess a positive ionizable group in their structures and therefore they belong to the group of atypical, non-basic 5-HT6R ligands. The obtained hits were proved to fit well in the 5-HT6R binding cavity by docking and molecular dynamic simulation experiments. Moreover, an in silico evaluation of the ADMET properties of these compounds predicted their drug-like character. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To accomplish the objective of this study, the experimental data set made up of nitrogen oxides (NOx ), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O-3), and dust (PM10) was collected over 3 years (2006-2008). The US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) establishes the limit values of the main pollutants in the atmosphere in order to ensure the health of healthy people. Firstly, this MARS regression model captures the main perception of statistical learning theory in order to obtain a good prediction of the dependence among the main pollutants in the Oviedo urban area. Secondly, the main advantages of MARS are its capacity to produce simple, easy-to-interpret models, its ability to estimate the contributions of the input variables, and its computational efficiency. Finally, on the basis of these numerical calculations, using the MARS technique, conclusions of this research work are exposed.	[Garcia Nieto, P.

We recently developed an automated classifier that can detect and quantify macrosteatosis with greater than or equal to 95% precision and recall (sensitivity). Here, we report our early results on the classifier's performance in detecting lobular inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning. Automatic quantification of lobular inflammation and ballooning was performed on digital images of hematoxylin and eosin stained slides of liver biopsy samples from 59 individuals with normal liver histology and varying severity of NAFLD. Two expert hepatopathologists scored liver biopsies according the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis clinical research network scoring system and provided annotations of lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning on the digital images. The classifier had precision and recall of 70% and 49% for lobular inflammation, and 91% and 54% for hepatocyte ballooning. In addition, the classifier had an area under the curve of 95% for lobular inflammation and 98% for hepatocyte, ballooning. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient for comparison with pathologist grades was 45.2% for lobular inflammation and 46% for hepatocyte ballooning. Our novel observations demonstrate that automatic quantification of cardinal NAFLD histologic lesions is feasible and offer promise for further development of automatic quantification as a potential aid to pathologists evaluating NAFLD biopsies in clinical practice and clinical trials.

Methods: We performed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging on eight adolescents before and after CES with mean age of about nine-years old who had Tourette's syndrome with moderate to severe tics symptom. Independent component analysis (ICA) with hierarchical partner matching method was used to examine the functional connectivity between regions within cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit. Granger causality was used to investigate effective connectivity among these regions detected by ICA. We then performed pattern classification on independent components with significant group differences that served as endophenotype markers to distinguish the adolescents between TS and the normalized ones after CES. Results: Results showed that TS adolescents after CES treatment had stronger functional activity and connectivity in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), caudate and posterior cingulate cortex while had weaker activity in supplementary motor area within the motor pathway compared with TS before CES. Conclusion: The results suggest that the functional activity and connectivity in motor pathway was suppressed while activities in the control portions within CSTC loop including ACC and caudate were increased in TS adolescents after CES compared with adolescents before CES. Significance: The normalization of the balance between motor and control portions of the CSTC circuit may result in the recovery of TS adolescents.

To address this problem, in this paper, we explore the feasibility of autonomously detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the older adult population. We implement a signal processing approach equipped with a machine learning paradigm to process and analyze real-world data acquired using home-based unobtrusive sensing technologies. Using the sensor and clinical data pertaining to 97 subjects, acquired over an average period of three years, a number of measures associated with the subjects' walking speed and general activity in the home were calculated. Different time spans of these measures were used to generate feature vectors to train and test two machine learning algorithms namely support vector machines and random forests. We were able to autonomously detect MCI in older adults with an area under the ROC curve of 0.97 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.93 using a time window of 24 weeks. This study is of great significance since it can potentially assist in the early detection of cognitive impairment in older adults.

In various applications in signal processing and machine learning, the model of interest is structured in several ways, for example, a matrix that is simultaneously sparse and low rank. Often norms that promote the individual structures are known, and allow for recovery using an orderwise optimal number of measurements (e.g., l(1) norm for sparsity, nuclear norm for matrix rank). Hence, it is reasonable to minimize a combination of such norms. We show that, surprisingly, using multiobjective optimization with these norms can do no better, orderwise, than exploiting only one of the structures, thus revealing a fundamental limitation in sample complexity. This result suggests that to fully exploit the multiple structures, we need an entirely new convex relaxation. Further, specializing our results to the case of sparse and low-rank matrices, we show that a nonconvex formulation recovers the model from very few measurements (on the order of the degrees of freedom), whereas the convex problem combining the l(1) and nuclear norms requires many more measurements, illustrating a gap between the performance of the convex and nonconvex recovery problems. Our framework applies to arbitrary structure-inducing norms as well as to a wide range of measurement ensembles. This allows us to give sample complexity bounds for problems such as sparse phase retrieval and low-rank tensor completion.

Occasionally, only few records that indicate defective units are available and they are classified as a minority group in a large database. Such a situation leads to an imbalanced data set problem, wherein it engenders a great challenge to deal with by applying machine-learning techniques for obtaining effective solution. In addition, the database may comprise overlapping samples of different classes. This paper introduces two models of evolutionary fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) neural networks to deal with the imbalanced data set problems in a semiconductor manufacturing operations. In particular, both the FAM models and hybrid genetic algorithms are integrated in the proposed evolutionary artificial neural networks (EANNs) to classify an imbalanced data set. In addition, one of the proposed EANNs incorporates a facility to learn overlapping samples of different classes from the imbalanced data environment. The classification results of the proposed evolutionary FAM neural networks are presented, compared, and analyzed using several classification metrics. The outcomes positively indicate the effectiveness of the proposed networks in handling classification problems with imbalanced data sets.

However, due to the limited availability of human labeled training data, training data that stay in the same feature space or have the same distribution as the future data cannot be guaranteed to be sufficient enough to avoid the over-fitting problem. In real-world applications, apart from data in the target domain, related data in a different domain can also be included to expand the availability of our prior knowledge about the target future data. Transfer learning addresses such cross-domain learning problems by extracting useful information from data in a related domain and transferring them for being used in target tasks. In recent years, with transfer learning being applied to visual categorization, some typical problems, e.g., view divergence in action recognition tasks and concept drifting in image classification tasks, can be efficiently solved. In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms in visual categorization applications, such as object recognition, image classification, and human action recognition.

When dealing with incomplete or fragmented remains, metric analysis of the tarsal bones of the feet has proven valuable. In this study, the utility of 18 width, length, and height tarsal measurements were assessed for sex-related variation in a Portuguese sample. A total of 300 males and females from the Coimbra Identified Skeletal Collection were used to develop sex prediction models based on statistical and machine learning algorithm such as discriminant function analysis, logistic regression, classification trees, and artificial neural networks. All models were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation and an independent test sample composed of 60 males and females from the Identified Skeletal Collection of the 21st Century. Results showed that tarsal bone sex-related variation can be easily captured with a high degree of repeatability. A simple tree-based multivariate algorithm involving measurements from the calcaneus, talus, first and third cuneiforms, and cuboid resulted in 88.3 % correct sex estimation both on training and independent test sets. Traditional statistical classifiers such as the discriminant function analysis were outperformed by machine learning techniques. Results obtained show that machine learning algorithm are an important tool the forensic practitioners should consider when developing new standards for sex estimation.

Using Skew for Classification	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Machine learning; skew; classification; modeling		One classic example of a binary classifier is one which employs the mean and standard deviation of the data set as a mechanism for classification. Indeed, principle component analysis has played a major role in this effort. In this paper, we propose that one should also include skew in order to make this method of classification a little more precise. One needs a simple probability distribution function which can be easily fit to a data set and use this pdf to create a classifier with improved error rates and comparable to other classifiers.

However, use of machine learning in the absence of clinical domain expertise can be tenuous and lead to misinformed conclusions. To illustrate this concern, the current paper critically evaluates and attempts to reproduce results from two studies (Wall et al. in Transl Psychiatry 2(4):e100, 2012a; PloS One 7(8), 2012b) that claim to drastically reduce time to diagnose autism using machine learning. Our failure to generate comparable findings to those reported by Wall and colleagues using larger and more balanced data underscores several conceptual and methodological problems associated with these studies. We conclude with proposed best-practices when using machine learning in autism research, and highlight some especially promising areas for collaborative work at the intersection of computational and behavioral science.

Existing approaches describe complex microstructures either using a small set of descriptors that lack sufficient level of details, or using generic high order microstructure functions of infinite dimensionality without explicit physical meanings. We propose a new machine learning-based method for identifying the key microstructure descriptors from vast candidates as potential microstructural design variables. With a large number of candidate microstructure descriptors collected from literature covering a wide range of microstructural material systems, a four-step machine learning-based method is developed to eliminate redundant microstructure descriptors via image analyses, to identify key microstructure descriptors based on structure-property data, and to determine the microstructure design variables. The training criteria of the supervised learning process include both microstructure correlation functions and material properties. The proposed methodology effectively reduces the infinite dimension of the microstructure design space to a small set of descriptors without a significant information loss. The benefits are demonstrated by an example of polymer nanocomposites optimization. We compare designs using key microstructure descriptors versus using empirically chosen microstructure descriptors as a demonstration of the proposed method.

In order to acquire human activity information from the personal space, many wearable multi-sensor devices have been developed. In this paper, a novel technique for automatic activity recognition based on multi-sensor data is presented. In order to utilize these data efficiently and overcome the big data problem, an offline adaptive-Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is proposed. A sensor selection scheme is implemented based on an improved Viterbi algorithm. A new method is proposed that incorporates personal experience into the HMM model as a priori information. Experiments are conducted using a personal wearable computer eButton consisting of multiple sensors. Our comparative study with the standard HMM and other alternative methods in processing the eButton data have shown that our method is more robust and efficient, providing a useful tool to evaluate human activity and lifestyle.

In case of early detection and diagnosis, the survival rate of patients significantly increases. In this study, a novel method and system that provides automatic detection of juxtapleural nodule pattern have been developed from cross-sectional images of lung CT (Computerized Tomography). Shape-based and both shape and texture based 7 features are contributed to the literature for lung nodules. System that we developed consists of six main stages called preprocessing, lung segmentation, detection of nodule candidate regions, feature extraction, feature selection (with five feature ranking criteria) and classification. LIDC dataset containing cross-sectional images of lung CT has been utilized, 1410 nodule candidate regions and 40 features have been extracted from 138 cross-sectional images for 24 patients. Experimental results for 10 classifiers are obtained and presented. Adding our derived features to known 33 features has increased nodule recognition performance from 0.9639 to 0.9679 AUC value on generalized linear model regression (GLMR) for 22 selected features and being reached one of the most successful results in the literature.

Such tactical behavior can be relevant in military simulations and video games, as well as in everyday tasks in the physical world, such as driving an automobile. Furthermore, PIGEON displays good performance across two different approaches to learning (observational and experiential) and across multiple domains. PIGEON is a hybrid algorithm, combining NEAT and PSO in two different manners. The investigation described in this paper compares the performance of the two versions of PIGEON to each other as well as to NEAT and to PSO individually. These four machine learning algorithms are applied in two different approaches to learning-through observation of human performance and through experience, as well as in three distinct domain testbeds. The criteria used to compare them were high proficiency in task completion and rapid learning. Results indicate that overall, PIGEON worked best when NEAT and PSO are applied in an alternating manner. This combination was called PIGEON-Alternate, or simply Alternate. The two versions of the PIGEON algorithm, the tests conducted, the results obtained and the conclusions are described in detail.

This paper explores the factors influencing SOC to a depth of 30 cm in eastern Australia. We used a machine learning approach to identify the key drivers of SOC storage and vertical distribution at 1401 sites from New South Wales, Australia. We then assessed the influence of the identified factors using traditional statistical approaches. Precipitation was important to and positively associated with SOC content, whereas temperature was important to and negatively associated with SOC vertical distribution. The importance of geology to SOC content increased with increasing soil depth. Land-use was important to both SOC content and its vertical distribution. We attribute these results to the influence of precipitation on primary production controlling SOC content, and the stronger influence of temperature on microbial activity affecting SOC degradation and vertical distribution. Geology affects SOC retention below the surface. Land-use controls SOC via production, removal and vertical mixing. The factors driving SOC storage are not identical to those driving SOC vertical distribution. Changes to these drivers will have differential effects on SOC storage and depth distribution.

Scores are based on the Partial Order Optimum Likelihood (POOL) machine learning method, using computed electrostatic properties, surface geometric features, and information obtained from the phylogenetic tree as input features. Predictions of distal residue participation in catalysis are compared with experimental kinetics data from the literature on variants of the featured enzymes; some additional kinetics measurements are reported for variants of Pseudomonas putida nitrile hydratase (ppNH) and for Escherichiacoli alkaline phosphatase (AP). The multilayer active sites of P. putida nitrile hydratase and of human phosphoglucose isomerase are predicted by the POOL log ZP scores, as is the single-layer active site of P. putida ketosteroid isomerase. The logZP score cutoff utilized here results in over-prediction of distal residue involvement in E. coli alkaline phosphatase. While fewer experimental data points are available for P. putida mandelate racemase and for human carbonic anhydrase II, the POOL logZP scores properly predict the previously reported participation of distal residues.

The prediction task can be translated into the computational challenge of assigning each residue the label binding site or non-binding site. Observational data comes from various possibly highly correlated sources. It includes the structure of the protein but not the structure of the complex. The model class of conditional random fields (CRFs) has previously successfully been used for protein binding site prediction. Here, a new CRF-approach is presented that models the dependencies of residues using a general graphical structure defined as a neighborhood graph and thus our model makes fewer independence assumptions on the labels than sequential labeling approaches. A novel node feature change in free energy is introduced into the model, which is then denoted by F-CRF. Parameters are trained with an online large-margin algorithm. Using the standard feature class relative accessible surface area alone, the general graph-structure CRF already achieves higher prediction accuracy than the linear chain CRF of Li et al. F-CRF performs significantly better on a large range of false positive rates than the support-vector-machine-based program PresCont of Zellner et al. on a homodimer set containing 128 chains. F-CRF has a broader scope than PresCont since it is not constrained to protein subgroups and requires no multiple sequence alignment. The improvement is attributed to the advantageous combination of the novel node feature with the standard feature and to the adopted parameter training method. Proteins 2015; 83:844-852.

Difficulties in identifying miRNAs through experimental techniques combined with the huge amount of data from new sequencing technologies have made in silico discrimination of bona fide miRNA precursors from non-miRNA hairpin-like structures an important topic in bioinformatics. Among various techniques developed for this classification problem, machine learning approaches have proved to be the most promising. However these approaches require the use of training data, which is problematic due to an imbalance in the number of miRNAs (positive data) and non-miRNAs (negative data), which leads to a degradation of their performance. In order to address this issue, we present an ensemble method that uses a boosting technique with support vector machine components to deal with imbalanced training data. Classification is performed following a feature selection on 187 novel and existing features. The algorithm, miRBoost, performed better in comparison with state-of-the-art methods on imbalanced human and cross-species data. It also showed the highest ability among the tested methods for discovering novel miRNA precursors. In addition, miRBoost was over 1400 times faster than the second most accurate tool tested and was significantly faster than most of the other tools. miRBoost thus provides a good compromise between prediction efficiency and execution time, making it highly suitable for use in genome-wide miRNA precursor prediction. The software miRBoost is available on our web server http://EvryRNA.ibisc.univ-evry.fr.

Severe flood occurrences in Kelantan, Malaysia cause damage to both life and property every year. Due to the huge losses in this area, development of appropriate flood modeling is required for the government. Remote sensing and geographic information system techniques can support overall flood management as they can produce rapid data collection and analysis for hydrological studies. The existing models for flood mapping have some weak points that may improve through more sophisticated and ensemble methods. The current research aimed to propose a novel ensemble method by integrating support vector machine (SVM) and frequency ratio (FR) to produce spatial modeling in flood susceptibility assessment. In the literature, mostly statistical and machine learning methods are used individually; however, their integration can enhance the final output. The FR model can perform bivariate statistical analysis and evaluate the correlation between the flooding and classes of each conditioning factors. The weights achieved by FR can be assigned to each conditioning factor and the resulted factors can be used in SVM analysis. In order to examine the efficiency of the proposed ensemble method and to show the proficiency of SVM, another machine learning algorithm such as decision tree (DT) was applied and the results were compared. To perform the methods, the upper catchment of the Kelantan basin in Malaysia was chosen. First, a flood inventory map with a total of 155 flood locations were extracted from various sources over the study area. The flood inventory map was randomly divided into two dataset; 70 % (115 flood locations) for the purpose of training and the remaining 30 % (40 flood locations) was used for validation. The spatial database included digital elevation model, curvature, geology, river, stream power index, rainfall, land use/cover, soil type, topographic wetness index and slope. For model validation, area under curve method was used and both success and prediction rate curves were calculated. The validation results for ensemble method showed 88.71 and 85.21 % for success rate and prediction rate respectively. The DT model showed 87.00 and 82.00 % for the success rate and prediction rate respectively. It is evident that the accuracies were increased using the ensemble method. The acquired results proved the efficiency of the proposed ensemble method as rapid, accurate and reasonable in flood susceptibility assessment.

Relying on results from differential geometry (the Lojasiewicz gradient inequality), the single limit-point convergence of the algorithm iterates is demonstrated and relatively tight bounds on the convergence rate are derived. In sharp contrast to the existing asymptotic results, the new results presented here allow the objective function to have multiple and non-isolated minima. The new results also offer new insights into the asymptotic properties of several classes of recursive algorithms which are routinely used in engineering, statistics, machine learning and operations research.

Past research has evaluated models of intertemporal choice by measuring goodness of fit or identifying which decision-making anomalies they can accommodate. An alternative criterion for model quality, which is partly antithetical to these standard criteria, is predictive accuracy. We used cross-validation to examine how well 10 models of intertemporal choice could predict behaviour in a 100-trial binary-decision task. Many models achieved the apparent ceiling of 85% accuracy, even with smaller training sets. When noise was added to the training set, however, a simple logistic-regression model we call the difference model performed particularly well. In many situations, between-model differences in predictive accuracy may be small, contrary to long-standing controversy over the modelling question in research on intertemporal choice, but the simplicity and robustness of the difference model recommend it to future use.

The underpricing of stocks in IPOs, or essentially leaving money on the table, is considered as an important, challenging and worthy research topic in literature. Within the proposed framework, the IPO performance in the short run and the factors that affect this short run performance were analyzed. Popular machine learning methods - several decision tree models and support vector machines were developed to investigate the major factors affecting the short-term performance of initial IPOs. A k-fold cross validation methodology was used to assess and contrast the performance of the predictive models. An information fusion-based sensitivity analysis was performed to combine the values of individual variable importance results into a common representation. The results showed that there was underpricing in the initial public offerings of Turkish companies, although it was not as high as the underpricing determined in developed markets. The market sentiment, the annual sales amounts, the total assets turnover rates, IPO stocks sales methods, the underwriting methods, the offer prices, debt ratio, and number of shares sold were among the most influential factors affecting the short term performance of initial public offerings of Turkish companies.

Prediction models are derived from logged on-board data that are downloaded during workshop visits and have been collected over three years on a large number of vehicles. A number of issues are identified with the data sources, many of which originate from the fact that the data sources were not designed for data mining. Nevertheless, exploiting this available data is very important for the automotive industry as means to quickly introduce predictive maintenance solutions. It is shown on a large data set from heavy duty trucks in normal operation how this can be done and generate a profit. Random forest is used as the classifier algorithm, together with two methods for feature selection whose results are compared to a human expert. The machine learning based features outperform the human expert features, which supports the idea to use data mining to improve maintenance operations in this domain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In such systems, transmitters may rapidly change the selected (channel, rate) pair to opportunistically learn and track the pair offering the highest throughput. We formulate the problem of sequential channel and rate selection as an online optimization problem and show its equivalence to a structured multiarmed-bandit problem. The structure stems from inherent properties of the achieved throughput as a function of the selected channel and rate. We derive fundamental performance limits satisfied by any channel and rate adaptation algorithm and propose algorithms that achieve (or approach) these limits. In turn, the proposed algorithms optimally exploit the inherent structure of the throughput. We illustrate the efficiency of our algorithms using both test-bed and simulation experiments, in both stationary and nonstationary radio environments. In stationary environments, the packet successful transmission probabilities at the various channel and rate pairs do not evolve over time, whereas in nonstationary environments, they may evolve. In practical scenarios, the proposed algorithms are able to track the best channel and rate quite accurately without the need for any explicit measurement of and feedback on the quality of the various channels.

Here, we address the question of what can be done when it is relatively easy to obtain healthy patient samples, but when abnormalities corresponding to disease states may be rare and one-of-a-kind. The associated computational challenge, anomaly detection, is a well-studied machine-learning problem. However, due to the dimensionality and variability of expression data, existing methods based on feature space analysis or individual anomalously expressed genes are insufficient. We present a novel approach, CSAX, that identifies pathways in an individual sample in which the normal expression relationships are disrupted. To evaluate our approach, we have compiled and released a compendium of public expression data sets, reformulated to create a test bed for anomaly detection. We demonstrate the accuracy of CSAX on the data sets in our compendium, compare it to other leading methods, and show that CSAX aids in both identifying anomalies and explaining their underlying biology. We describe an approach to characterizing the difficulty of specific expression anomaly detection tasks. We then illustrate CSAX's value in two developmental case studies. Confirming prior hypotheses, CSAX highlights disruption of platelet activation pathways in a neonate with retinopathy of prematurity and identifies, for the first time, dysregulated oxidative stress response in second trimester amniotic fluid of fetuses with obese mothers. Our approach provides an important step toward identification of individual disease patterns in the era of precision medicine.

In contrast to classical machine learning methods, transfer learning methods exploit the knowledge accumulated from data in auxiliary domains to facilitate predictive modeling consisting of different data patterns in the current domain. To improve the performance of existing transfer learning methods and handle the knowledge transfer process in real-world systems, computational intelligence has recently been applied in transfer learning. This paper systematically examines computational intelligence-based transfer learning techniques and clusters related technique developments into four main categories: (a) neural network-based transfer learning; (b) Bayes-based transfer learning; (c) fuzzy transfer learning, and (d) applications of computational intelligence-based transfer learning.

Here, we introduce discriminative regulatory-element detection from GRO-seq (dREG), a sensitive machine learning method that uses support vector regression to identify active TREs from GRO-seq data without requiring cap-based enrichment (https://github.com/Danko-Lab/dREG/). This approach allows TRES to be assayed together with gene expression levels and other transcriptional features in a single experiment. Predicted TREs are more enriched for several marks of transcriptional activation-including expression quantitative trait loci, disease-associated polymorphisms, acetylated histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac) and transcription factor binding-than those identified by alternative functional assays. Using dREG, we surveyed TREs in eight human cell types and provide new insights into global patterns of TRE function.

This vast amount of data can help identify various patterns in the human population. In this study, we present methods and algorithms that can assist in identifying variations in lifespan distributions of the human population in the past centuries, in detecting social and genetic features that correlate with the human lifespan, and in constructing predictive models of human lifespan based on various features that can easily be extracted from genealogy datasets. We have evaluated the presented methods and algorithms on a large online genealogy dataset with over a million profiles and over 9 million connections, all of which were collected from the WikiTree website. Our findings indicate that significant but small positive correlations exist between the parents' lifespan and their children's lifespan. Additionally, we found slightly higher and significant correlations between the lifespans of spouses. We also discovered a very small positive and significant correlation between longevity and reproductive success in males, and a small and significant negative correlation between longevity and reproductive success in females. Moreover, our predictive models presented results with a Mean Absolute Error as low as 13.18 in predicting the lifespans of individuals who outlived the age of 10, and our classification models presented better than random classification results in predicting which people who outlive the age of 50 will also outlive the age of 80. We believe that this study will be the first of many studies to utilize the wealth of data on human populations, existing in online genealogy datasets, to better understand factors that influence the human lifespan. Understanding these factors can assist scientists in providing solutions for successful aging.

Stars are born together from giant molecular clouds and, if we assume that the priors were chemically homogeneous and well-mixed, we expect them to share the same chemical composition. Most of the stellar aggregates are disrupted while orbiting the Galaxy and most of the dynamic information is lost, thus the only possibility of reconstructing the stellar formation history is to analyze the chemical abundances that we observe today. Aims. The chemical tagging technique aims to recover disrupted stellar clusters based merely on their chemical composition. We evaluate the viability of this technique to recover co-natal stars that are no longer gravitationally bound. Methods. Open clusters are co-natal aggregates that have managed to survive together. We compiled stellar spectra from 31 old and intermediate-age open clusters, homogeneously derived atmospheric parameters, and 17 abundance species, and applied machine learning algorithms to group the stars based on their chemical composition. This approach allows us to evaluate the viability and efficiency of the chemical tagging technique. Results. We found that stars at different evolutionary stages have distinct chemical patterns that may be due to NLTE effects, atomic diffusion, mixing, and biases. When separating stars into dwarfs and giants, we observed that a few open clusters show distinct chemical signatures while the majority show a high degree of overlap. This limits the recovery of co-natal aggregates by applying the chemical tagging technique. Nevertheless, there is room for improvement if more elements are included and models are improved.

Since faults in transmission lines threatens stability of the entire power network, fast and reliable fault diagnosis is an important problem in transmission line protection. This work is the first paper exploiting sparse signal recovery for the fault-diagnosis problem in power networks with nonlinear swing-type dynamics. It presents a novel and scalable technique to detect, isolate and identify transmission faults using a relatively small number of observations by exploiting the sparse nature of the faults. Buses in power networks are typically described by second-order nonlinear swing equations. Based on this description, the problem of fault diagnosis for transmission lines is formulated as a compressive sensing or sparse signal recovery problem, which is then solved using a sparse Bayesian formulation. An iterative reweighted l(1)-minimisation algorithm based on the sparse Bayesian learning update is then derived to solve the fault diagnosis problem efficiently. With the proposed framework, a real-time fault monitoring scheme can be built using only measurements of phase angles at the buses. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Miller, LD; Soh, LK; Scott, S				Miller, L. Dee; Soh, Leen-Kiat; Scott, Stephen			GENETIC ALGORITHM CLASSIFIER SYSTEM FOR SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						semi-supervised learning; cluster-then-label; unsupervised clustering; genetic algorithm	FEATURE-SELECTION; FRAMEWORK	Real-world datasets often contain large numbers of unlabeled data points, because there is additional cost for obtaining the labels. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms use both labeled and unlabeled data points for training that can result in higher classification accuracy on these datasets. Generally, traditional SSLs tentatively label the unlabeled data points on the basis of the smoothness assumption that neighboring points should have the same label. When this assumption is violated, unlabeled points are mislabeled injecting noise into the final classifier. An alternative SSL approach is cluster-then-label (CTL), which partitions all the data points (labeled and unlabeled) into clusters and creates a classifier by using those clusters. CTL is based on the less restrictive cluster assumption that data points in the same cluster should have the same label. As shown, this allows CTLs to achieve higher classification accuracy on many datasets where the cluster assumption holds for the CTLs, but smoothness does not hold for the traditional SSLs. However, cluster configuration problems (e.g., irrelevant features, insufficient clusters, and incorrectly shaped clusters) could violate the cluster assumption. We propose a new framework for CTLs by using a genetic algorithm (GA) to evolve classifiers without the cluster configuration problems (e.g., the GA removes irrelevant attributes, updates number of clusters, and changes the shape of the clusters). We demonstrate that a CTL based on this framework achieves comparable or higher accuracy with both traditional SSLs and CTLs on 12 University of California, Irvine machine learning datasets.

Much is hidden in innovative tax shelters combining multiple business structures such as partnerships, trusts, and S-corporations into complex transaction networks designed to reduce and obscure the true tax liabilities of their individual shareholders. One known gambit employed by these shelters is to offset real gains in one part of a portfolio by creating artificial capital losses elsewhere through the mechanism of "inflated basis" (TaxAnalysts 2005), a process made easier by the relatively flexible set of rules surrounding "pass-through" entities such as partnerships (IRS 2009). The ability to anticipate the likely forms of emerging evasion schemes would help auditors develop more efficient methods of reducing the tax gap. To this end, we have developed a prototype evolutionary algorithm designed to generate potential schemes of the inflated basis type described above. The algorithm takes as inputs a collection of asset types and tax entities, together with a rule-set governing asset exchanges between these entities. The schemes produced by the algorithm consist of sequences of transactions within an ownership network of tax entities. Schemes are ranked according to a "fitness function" (Goldberg in Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning. Addison-Wesley, Boston, 1989); the very best schemes are those that afford the highest reduction in tax liability while incurring the lowest expected penalty.

This variation especially hampers the application of otherwise successful supervised-learning techniques which, in order to perform well, often require a large amount of labeled training data that is exactly representative of the target data. We therefore propose to use transfer learning for image segmentation. Transfer-learning techniques can cope with differences in distributions between training and target data, and therefore may improve performance over supervised learning for segmentation across scanners and scan protocols. We present four transfer classifiers that can train a classification scheme with only a small amount of representative training data, in addition to a larger amount of other training data with slightly different characteristics. The performance of the four transfer classifiers was compared to that of standard supervised classification on two magnetic resonance imaging brain-segmentation tasks with multi-site data: white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid segmentation; and white-matter-/MS-lesion segmentation. The experiments showed that when there is only a small amount of representative training data available, transfer learning can greatly outperform common supervised-learning approaches, minimizing classification errors by up to 60%.

Many state-of-the-art approaches to image segmentation use structured models whose parameters must be carefully chosen for optimal performance. A popular choice is to learn them using a large-margin framework and more specifically structured support vector machines (SSVM). Although SSVMs are appealing, they suffer from certain limitations. First, they are restricted in practice to linear kernels because the more powerful nonlinear kernels cause the learning to become prohibitively expensive. Second, they require iteratively finding the most violated constraints, which is often intractable for the loopy graphical models used in image segmentation. This requires approximation that can lead to reduced quality of learning. In this paper, we propose three novel techniques to overcome these limitations. We first introduce a method to "kernelize" the features so that a linear SSVM framework can leverage the power of nonlinear kernels without incurring much additional computational cost. Moreover, we employ a working set of constraints to increase the reliability of approximate subgradient methods and introduce a new way to select a suitable step size at each iteration. We demonstrate the strength of our approach on both 2-D and 3-D electron microscopic (EM) image data and show consistent performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches.

However, the amount of human annotation effort required to analyze them remains a major bottleneck. While machine learning algorithms can be used to help automate this process, they require training data, which is time-consuming to obtain manually, especially in image stacks. Furthermore, due to changing experimental conditions, successive stacks often exhibit differences that are severe enough to make it difficult to use a classifier trained for a specific one on another. This means that this tedious annotation process has to be repeated for each new stack. In this paper, we present a domain adaptation algorithm that addresses this issue by effectively leveraging labeled examples across different acquisitions and significantly reducing the annotation requirements. Our approach can handle complex, nonlinear image feature transformations and scales to large microscopy datasets that often involve high-dimensional feature spaces and large 3D data volumes. We evaluate our approach on four challenging electron and light microscopy applications that exhibit very different image modalities and where annotation is very costly. Across all applications we achieve a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art machine learning methods and demonstrate our ability to greatly reduce human annotation effort.

Wafer defects are a serious problem that could cause massive losses to the companies' yield. The defects occur as a result of a lengthy and complex fabrication process involving hundreds of stages, and they can create unique patterns. If these patterns were to be identified and classified correctly, then the root of the fabrication problem can be recognized and eventually resolved. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely accepted and are well suited for such classification-/identification problems. However, none of the existing ML model's performance exceeds 96% in identification accuracy for such tasks. In this paper, we develop a state-of-the-art classifying algorithm using multiple ML techniques, relying on a general-regression-network-based consensus learning model along with a powerful randomization technique. We compare our proposed method with the widely used ML models in terms of model accuracy, stability, and time complexity. Our method has proved to be more accurate and stable as compared to any of the existing algorithms reported in the literature, achieving its accuracy of 99.8%, stability of 1.128, and TBM of 15.8 s.

Spiking neural networks (SNN)-based architectures have shown great potential as a solution for realizing ultra-low power consumption using spike-based neuromorphic hardware. This work describes a novel approach for converting a deep CNN into a SNN that enables mapping CNN to spike-based hardware architectures. Our approach first tailors the CNN architecture to fit the requirements of SNN, then trains the tailored CNN in the same way as one would with CNN, and finally applies the learned network weights to an SNN architecture derived from the tailored CNN. We evaluate the resulting SNN on publicly available Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Neovision2 Tower and CIFAR-10 datasets and show similar object recognition accuracy as the original CNN. Our SNN implementation is amenable to direct mapping to spike-based neuromorphic hardware, such as the ones being developed under the DARPA SyNAPSE program. Our hardware mapping analysis suggests that SNN implementation on such spike-based hardware is two orders of magnitude more energy-efficient than the original CNN implementation on off-the-shelf FPGA-based hardware.

J	Zheng, Y; Zemel, RS; Zhang, YJ; Larochelle, H				Zheng, Yin; Zemel, Richard S.; Zhang, Yu-Jin; Larochelle, Hugo			A Neural Autoregressive Approach to Attention-based Recognition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION			English	Article						Deep learning; Attention-based recognition; Neural networks; Neural autoregressive distribution estimator	SEARCH	Tasks that require the synchronization of perception and action are incredibly hard and pose a fundamental challenge to the fields of machine learning and computer vision. One important example of such a task is the problem of performing visual recognition through a sequence of controllable fixations; this requires jointly deciding what inference to perform from fixations and where to perform these fixations. While these two problems are challenging when addressed separately, they become even more formidable if solved jointly. Recently, a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) model was proposed that could learn meaningful fixation policies and achieve good recognition performance. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach based on a feed-forward, auto-regressive architecture, which permits exact calculation of training gradients (given the fixation sequence), unlike for the RBM model. On a problem of facial expression recognition, we demonstrate the improvement gained by this alternative approach. Additionally, we investigate several variations of the model in order to shed some light on successful strategies for fixation-based recognition.

Closed-loop separation control using machine learning	JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS			English	Article						control theory; flow control; separated flows	BACKWARD-FACING STEP; REDUCED-ORDER MODELS; DRAG REDUCTION; BLUFF-BODY; FEEDBACK-CONTROL; FLOW; LAYER; OPTIMIZATION	We present the first closed-loop separation control experiment using a novel, model-free strategy based on genetic programming, which we call 'machine learning control'. The goal is to reduce the recirculation zone of backward-facing step flow at Re-h = 1350 manipulated by a slotted jet and optically sensed by online particle image velocimetry. The feedback control law is optimized with respect to a cost functional based on the recirculation area and a penalization of the actuation. This optimization is performed employing genetic programming. After 12 generations comprised of 500 individuals, the algorithm converges to a feedback law which reduces the recirculation zone by 80 %. This machine learning control is benchmarked against the best periodic forcing which excites Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices. The machine learning control yields a new actuation mechanism resonating with the low-frequency flapping mode instability. This feedback control performs similarly to periodic forcing at the design condition but outperforms periodic forcing when the Reynolds number is varied by a factor two. The current study indicates that machine learning control can effectively explore and optimize new feedback actuation mechanisms in numerous experimental applications.

Plasma biosignature and brain pathology related to persistent cognitive impairment in late-life depression	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							PITTSBURGH COMPOUND-B; WHITE-MATTER HYPERINTENSITIES; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MAJOR DEPRESSION; OLDER-ADULTS; CROSS-VALIDATION; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; GENE-EXPRESSION; METAANALYSIS; HYPOTHESIS	Cognitive impairment is highly prevalent among individuals with late-life depression (LLD) and tends to persist even after successful treatment. The biological mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in LLD are complex and likely involve abnormalities in multiple pathways, or 'cascades,' reflected in specific biomarkers. Our aim was to evaluate peripheral (blood-based) evidence for biological pathways associated with cognitive impairment in older adults with LLD. To this end, we used a data-driven comprehensive proteomic analysis (multiplex immunoassay including 242 proteins), along with measures of structural brain abnormalities (gray matter atrophy and white matter hyperintensity volume via magnetic resonance imaging), and brain amyloid-beta (A beta) deposition (PiB-positron emission tomography). We analyzed data from 80 older adults with remitted major depression (36 with mild cognitive impairment (LLD+MCI) and 44 with normal cognitive (LLD+NC)) function. LLD+MCI was associated with differential expression of 24 proteins (P < 0.05 and q-value <0.30) related mainly to the regulation of immune-inflammatory activity, intracellular signaling, cell survival and protein and lipid homeostasis. Individuals with LLD+MCI also showed greater white matter hyperintensity burden compared with LLD+NC (P = 0.015). We observed no differences in gray matter volume or brain A beta deposition between groups. Machine learning analysis showed that a group of three proteins (Apo AI, IL-12 and stem cell factor) yielded accuracy of 81.3%, sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 86.4% in discriminating participants with MCI from those with NC function (with an averaged cross-validation accuracy of 76.3%, sensitivity of 69.4% and specificity of 81.8% with nested cross-validation considering the model selection bias). Cognitive impairment in LLD seems to be related to greater cerebrovascular disease along with abnormalities in immune-inflammatory control, cell survival, intracellular signaling, protein and lipid homeostasis, and clotting processes. These results suggest that individuals with LLD and cognitive impairment may be more vulnerable to accelerated brain aging and shed light on possible mediators of their elevated risk for progression to dementia.

J	Bayati, M				Bayati, Mostafa			Using cuckoo optimization algorithm and imperialist competitive algorithm to solve inverse kinematics problem for numerical control of robotic manipulators	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART I-JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND CONTROL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Robotic manipulator; inverse kinematics; machine learning; cuckoo optimization algorithm; imperialist competitive algorithm; numerical control	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SYSTEM	Inverse kinematics is one of the most important and complicated problems in robotics, and there is almost no exact analytical solution for this problem. Alternatively, with significant growth in machine learning techniques in recent decades, numerical methods are widely being used to solve this problem. This article aims to present a novel application of two powerful meta-heuristic optimization algorithms including cuckoo optimization algorithm and imperialist competitive algorithm to solve robotic manipulators' inverse kinematics problem for the first time. Recently, these two algorithms have been used to solve several problems in different majors more efficiently in comparison with other well-known algorithms. To validate the efficiency of proposed approaches and suggest them as the preferred numerical methods to solve this problem, a comprehensive study has been done on performance of almost all recently used numerical methods to solve the same problem including genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, harmony search and differential evolution algorithms as well as adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and two artificial neural networks (multilayer perceptron and radial basis function). Simulations have been performed on an anthropomorphic arm with spherical wrist manipulator case study because of its complex model and degree of freedom. Proposed approach can be included in computer-aided manufacturing packages to increase robotic manipulators' efficiencies.

The framework is suitable for any block-based video codec. In the proposed solution, features are extracted from coding units and summarized to form features at frame levels. Stepwise regression is used to select the important feature variables and reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors. Thereafter, a polynomial regression-based approach is used to model the nonlinear relationship between the feature vectors and the true objective quality values. Such values are estimated for coding units and video frames. The proposed framework is implemented using MPEG-2 and HEVC. The objective quality estimation results are compared against an existing state-of-the-art solution and quantified using the Pearson correlation factor and the root mean square error measure.

A study of machine learning regression methods for major elemental analysis of rocks using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy	SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART B-ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY			English	Article						Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS); Partial least squares (PLS); Support vector regression (SVR); Lasso; Principal component regression (PCR)	PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; MASS ABSORPTION-COEFFICIENTS; CHEMCAM INSTRUMENT SUITE; MODELS; MARS; CLASSIFICATION; SAMPLES; UNIT	The ChemCam instrument on the Mars Curiosity rover is generating thousands of LIBS spectra and bringing interest in this technique to public attention. The key to interpreting Mars or any other types of LIBS data are calibrations that relate laboratory standards to unknowns examined in other settings and enable predictions of chemical composition. Here, LIBS spectral data are analyzed using linear regression methods including partial least squares (PLS-1 and PLS-2), principal component regression (PCR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso), elastic net, and linear support vector regression (SVR-Lin). These were compared against results from nonlinear regression methods including kernel principal component regression (K-PCR), polynomial kernel support vector regression (SVR-Py) and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) regression to discern the most effective models for interpreting chemical abundances from LIBS spectra of geological samples. The results were evaluated for 100 samples analyzed with 50 laser pulses at each of five location averaged together. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were employed to evaluate the statistical significance of differences among the nine models using their predicted residual sum of squares (PRESS) to make comparisons. For MgO, SiO2, Fe2O3, CaO, and MnO, the sparse models outperform all the others except for linear SVR, while for Na2O, K2O, TiO2, and P2O5, the sparse methods produce inferior results, likely because their emission lines in this energy range have lower transition probabilities. The strong performance of the sparse methods in this study suggests that use of dimensionality-reduction techniques as a preprocessing step may improve the performance of the linear models. Nonlinear methods tend to overfit the data and predict less accurately, while the linear methods proved to be more generalizable with better predictive performance. These results are attributed to the high dimensionality of the data (6144 channels) relative to the small number of samples studied. The best-performing models were SVR-Lin for SiO2, MgO, Fe2O3, and Na2O, lasso for Al2O3, elastic net for MnO, and PLS-1 for CaO, TiO2, and K2O. Although these differences in model performance between methods were identified, most of the models produce comparable results when p <= 0.05 and all techniques except kNN produced statistically-indistinguishable results. It is likely that a combination of models could be used together to yield a lower total error of prediction, depending on the requirements of the user. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Some works conducted over the last years have pointed out that such algorithms are generally susceptible to deception, notably in the form of attacks carefully constructed to evade detection. Various learning schemes have been proposed to overcome this weakness. One such system is Keyed IDS (KIDS), introduced at DIMVA "10. KIDS" core idea is akin to the functioning of some cryptographic primitives, namely to introduce a secret element (the key) into the scheme so that some operations are infeasible without knowing it. In KIDS the learned model and the computation of the anomaly score are both key-dependent, a fact which presumably prevents an attacker from creating evasion attacks. In this work we show that recovering the key is extremely simple provided that the attacker can interact with KIDS and get feedback about probing requests. We present realistic attacks for two different adversarial settings and show that recovering the key requires only a small amount of queries, which indicates that KIDS does not meet the claimed security properties. We finally revisit KIDS' central idea and provide heuristic arguments about its suitability and limitations.

J	Kwon, BK; Won, JS; Kang, DJ				Kwon, Bae-Keun; Won, Jong-Seob; Kang, Dong-Joong			Fast defect detection for various types of surfaces using random forest with VOV features	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRECISION ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Defect detection; Surface inspection; Random forest; Machine learning	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FILTER DESIGN; IMAGES; MODELS	Defect detection on an object surface is one of the most important tasks of an automated visual inspection system. The most modern defect detection systems are required to operate in real-time and handle high-resolution images. One of main difficulties in system applications is that it cannot be used for general inspection of various types of surface without tuning the internal parameters. In this paper, we demonstrate how to solve the problem mentioned above by using simple variance profile values of pixel intensities and applying it to the random-forest-based machine learning algorithm. Variance of Variance (VOV) profiles are used to describe the texture of an object surface and to amplify the irregularity of intensity variations. The feature amplification property of the VOV method can be applied generally to various types of surface and defect. For effective learning and reduction of false detection, a defect-size insensitive approach and a hard sample retraining process are introduced. The experimental results demonstrate reliable defect detection for various surface types without changing parameters.

J	Buckingham, D; Skalka, C; Bongard, J				Buckingham, David; Skalka, Christian; Bongard, Josh			Inductive machine learning for improved estimation of catchment-scale snow water equivalent	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Snow water equivalent; Machine learning; Wireless sensor network; Snowpack modeling; Genetic programming	SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; ACCUMULATION; COVER; BASIN; MELT; SIMULATIONS; VARIABILITY; TERRAIN; MODEL; TREE	Infrastructure for the automatic collection of single-point measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) is well-established. However, because SWE varies significantly over space, the estimation of SWE at the catchment scale based on a single-point measurement is error-prone. We propose low-cost, lightweight methods for near-real-time estimation of mean catchment-wide SWE using existing infrastructure, wireless sensor networks, and machine learning algorithms. Because snowpack distribution is highly nonlinear, we focus on Genetic Programming (GP), a nonlinear, white-box, inductive machine learning algorithm. Because we did not have access to near-real-time catchment-scale SWE data, we used available data as ground truth for machine learning in a set of experiments that are successive approximations of our goal of catchment-wide SWE estimation. First, we used a history of maritime snowpack data collected by manual snow courses. Second, we used distributed snow depth (HS) data collected automatically by wireless sensor networks. We compared the performance of GP against linear regression (LR), binary regression trees (BT), and a widely used basic method (BM) that naively assumes non-variable snowpack. In the first experiment set, GP and LR models predicted SWE with lower error than BM. In the second experiment set, GP had lower error than LR, but outperformed BT only when we applied a technique that specifically mitigated the possibility of over-fitting. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, efficient feature extraction and feature selection is a key issue to automatic condition monitoring and fault diagnosis processes. In order to focus on those issues, this paper presents a study that uses ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to extract features and hybrid binary bat algorithm (HBBA) hybridized with machine learning algorithm to reduce the dimensionality as well to select the predominant features which contains the necessary discriminative information. Efficiency of the approaches are evaluated using standard classification metrics such as Nearest neighbours, C4.5, DTNB, K star and JRip. The gear fault experiments were conducted, acquired the vibration signals for different gear states such as normal, frosting, pitting and crack, under constant motor speed and constant load. The proposed method is applied to identify the different gear faults at early stage and the results demonstrate its effectiveness.

Platys: An Active Learning Framework for Place-Aware Application Development and Its Evaluation	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Experimentation; Measurement; Mobile application development; location-aware; place-aware; context-aware; middleware; place recognition; active learning; semi-supervised learning; usability; privacy	COMPUTING APPLICATIONS; SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION; VIRTUAL WORLDS; CONTEXT; SPACE; MIDDLEWARE; SYSTEMS; MODEL	We introduce a high-level abstraction of location called place. A place derives its meaning from a user's physical space, activities, or social context. In this manner, place can facilitate improved user experience compared to the traditional representation of location, which is spatial coordinates. We propose the Platys framework as a way to address the special challenges of place-aware application development. The core of Platys is a middleware that (1) learns a model of places specific to each user via active learning, a machine learning paradigm that seeks to reduce the user-effort required for training the middleware, and (2) exposes the learned user-specific model of places to applications at run time, insulating application developers from dealing with both low-level sensors and user idiosyncrasies in perceiving places. We evaluated Platys via two studies. First, we collected place labels and Android phone sensor readings from 10 users. We applied Platys' active learning approach to learn each user's places and found that Platys (1) requires fewer place labels to learn a user's places with a desired accuracy than do two traditional supervised approaches, and (2) learns places with higher accuracy than two unsupervised approaches. Second, we conducted a developer study to evaluate Platys' efficiency in assisting developers and its effectiveness in enabling usable applications. In this study, 46 developers employed either Platys or the Android location API to develop a place-aware application. Our results indicate that application developers employing Platys, when compared to those employing the Android API, (1) develop a place-aware application faster and perceive reduced difficulty and (2) produce applications that are easier to understand (for developers) and potentially more usable and privacy preserving (for application users).

It is difficult to classify the EMG features because an EMG signal has nonlinear and time-varying characteristics. Therefore, in several previous studies, various machine-learning methods have been applied. A DBN is a fast, greedy learning algorithm that can find a fairly good set of weights rapidly, even in deep networks with a large number of parameters and many hidden layers. To evaluate this model, we acquired EMG signals, extracted their features, and then compared the model with the DBN and other conventional classifiers. The accuracy of the DBN is higher than that of the other algorithms. The classification performance of the DBN model designed is approximately 88.60%. It is 7.55% (p=9.82x10(-12)) higher than linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and 2.89% (p=1.94x10(-5)) higher than support vector machine (SVM). Further, the DBN is better than shallow learning algorithms or back propagation (BP), and this model is effective for an EMG-based user-interfaced system.

We introduce a composite strategy that adds machine learning corrections to computationally inexpensive approximate legacy quantum methods. After training, highly accurate predictions of enthalpies, free energies, entropies, and electron correlation energies are possible, for significantly larger molecular sets than used for training. For thermochemical properties of up to 16k isomers of C7H10O2 we present numerical evidence that chemical accuracy can be reached. We also predict electron correlation energy in post Hartree-Fock methods, at the computational cost of HartreeFock, and we establish a qualitative relationship between molecular entropy and electron correlation. The transferability of our approach is demonstrated, using semiempirical quantum chemistry and machine learning models trained on 1 and 10% of 134k organic molecules, to reproduce enthalpies of all remaining molecules at density functional theory level of accuracy.

For a given class of compounds, ML techniques require sufficiently large training sets to develop ML models that can be used for adapting SQC parameters to reflect changes in molecular composition and geometry. The ML-SQC approach allows the automatic tuning of SQC parameters for individual molecules, thereby improving the accuracy without deteriorating transferability to molecules with molecular descriptors very different from those in the training set. The performance of this approach is demonstrated for the semiempirical OM2 method using a set of 6095 constitutional isomers C7H10O2, for which accurate ab initio atomization enthalpies are available. The ML-OM2 results show improved average accuracy and a much reduced error range compared with those of standard OM2 results, with mean absolute errors in atomization enthalpies dropping from 6.3 to 1.7 kcal/mol. They are also found to be superior to the results from specific OM2 reparameterizations (rOM2) for the same set of isomers. The ML-SQC approach thus holds promise for fast and reasonably accurate high-throughput screening of materials and molecules.

These studies claim that self-report is unreliable, making "objective" neuroimaging classification methods imperative. However, the relative performance of ML on neuroimaging and self-report data have not been compared. This study used commonly reported ML algorithms to measure differences between "objective" neuroimaging data and "subjective" self-report (ie, mood and pain intensity) in their ability to discriminate between individuals with and without chronic pain. Structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 26 individuals (14 individuals with fibromyalgia and 12 healthy controls) were processed to derive volumes from 56 brain regions per person. Self-report data included visual analog scale ratings for pain intensity and mood (ie, anger, anxiety, depression, frustration, and fear). Separate models representing brain volumes, mood ratings, and pain intensity ratings were estimated across several ML algorithms. Classification accuracy of brain volumes ranged from 53 to 76%, whereas mood and pain intensity ratings ranged from 79 to 96% and 83 to 96%, respectively. Overall, models derived from self-report data outperformed neuroimaging models by an average of 22%. Although neuroimaging clearly provides useful insights for understanding neural mechanisms underlying pain processing, self-report is reliable and accurate and continues to be clinically vital. Perspective: The present study compares neuroimaging, self-reported mood, and self-reported pain intensity data in their ability to classify individuals with and without fibromyalgia using ML algorithms. Overall, models derived from self-reported mood and pain intensity data outperformed structural neuroimaging models.

In this paper, a machine learning method is presented to statistically classify avian vocalizations. Automated approaches were applied to isolate bird songs from long field recordings, assess song similarities, and classify songs into distinct variants. Because no positive controls were available to assess the true classification of variants, multiple replicates of automatic classification of song variants were analyzed to investigate clustering uncertainty. The automatic classifications were more similar to the expert classifications than expected by chance. Application of these methods demonstrated the presence of discrete song variants in an island population of the New Zealand hihi (Notiomystis cincta). The geographic patterns of song variation were then revealed by integrating over classification replicates. Because this automated approach considers variation in song variant classification, it reduces potential human bias and facilitates the reproducibility of the results.

However, a common problem in applying machine learning algorithms is that the number of imaging data dimensions often greatly exceeds the number of available training samples. Furthermore, interpretability of the learned classifier with respect to brain function and anatomy is an important, but non-trivial issue. We propose the use of logistic regression with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to capture the most critical input features. In particular, we consider application of group LASSO to select brain areas relevant to diagnosis. An additional advantage of LASSO is its probabilistic output, which allows evaluation of diagnosis certainty. To verify our approach, we obtained semantic and phonological verbal fluency fMRI data from 31 depression patients and 31 control subjects, and compared the performances of group LASSO (gLASSO), and sparse group LASSO (sgLASSO) to those of standard LASSO (sLASSO), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. Over 90% classification accuracy was achieved with gLASSO, sgLASSO, as well as SVM; however, in contrast to SVM, LASSO approaches allow for identification of the most discriminative weights and estimation of prediction reliability. Semantic task data revealed contributions to the classification from left precuneus, left precentral gyrus, left inferior frontal cortex (pars triangularis), and left cerebellum (c rus1). Weights for the phonological task indicated contributions from left inferior frontal operculum, left post central gyrus, left insula, left middle frontal cortex, bilateral middle temporal cortices, bilateral precuneus, left inferior frontal cortex (pars triangularis), and left precentral gyrus. The distribution of normalized odds ratios further showed, that predictions with absolute odds ratios higher than 0.2 could be regarded as certain.

Recent experimental advances are accelerating the pace of data collection. The resulting growth of information about morphological, physiological, and molecular properties encourages efforts to automate neuronal classification by powerful machine learning techniques. We review state-of-the-art analysis approaches and the availability of suitable data and resources, highlighting prominent challenges and opportunities. The effective solution of the neuronal classification problem will require continuous development of computational methods, high-throughput data production, and systematic metadata organization to enable cross-laboratory integration.

J	Garrett, A; New, J				Garrett, Aaron; New, Joshua			Scalable tuning of building models to hourly data	ENERGY			English	Article						Autotune; Energy Plus; Calibration; Optimization; Evolutionary computation	SYSTEMS	Energy models of existing buildings are unreliable unless calibrated so that they correlate well with actual energy usage. Manual tuning requires a skilled professional and is prohibitively expensive for small projects, imperfect, non-repeatable, and not scalable to the dozens of sensor channels that smart meters, smart appliances, and sensors are making available. A scalable, automated methodology is needed to quickly, intelligently calibrate building energy models to all available data, increase the usefulness of those models, and facilitate speed-and-scale penetration of simulation-based capabilities into the marketplace for actualized energy savings. The "Autotune" project is a novel, model-agnostic methodology that leverages supercomputing, large simulation ensembles, and big data mining with multiple machine learning algorithms to allow automatic calibration of simulations that match measured experimental data in a way that is deployable on commodity hardware. This paper shares several methodologies employed to reduce the combinatorial complexity to a computationally tractable search problem for hundreds of input parameters. Accuracy metrics are provided that quantify model error to measured data for either monthly or hourly electrical usage from a highly instrumented, emulated-occupancy research home.

Identifying neuroimaging biomarkers for illness onset and treatment response would lead to immediate clinical benefits. In this review we discuss if neuroimaging may be utilised to diagnose patients with psychosis, predict those who will develop the illness in those at high risk, and stratify patients. State-of-the-art developments in the field are critically examined including multicentre studies, longitudinal designs, multimodal imaging and machine learning as well as some of the challenges in utilising future neuroimaging biomarkers in clinical trials. As many of these developments are already being applied in neuroimaging studies of Alzheimer's disease, we discuss what lessons have been learned from this field and how they may be applied to research in psychosis.

SVM and ANN Application to Multivariate Pattern Recognition Using Scatter Data	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						Multivariate patterns; SVM; Fuzzy ARTMAP; PCA; univariate patterns	OF-CONTROL SIGNALS; STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL; NEURAL-NETWORK ENSEMBLE; MANUFACTURING PROCESSES; MODEL	several methods of Statistical Process Control (SPC) are used to analyze process measurements with the purpose to detect faults that affect the process stability. SPC has a major drawback because it indicates the presence of faults without explaining which ones and where are the faults. In practical applications, SPC just analyses univariate signals limiting the study of multiple measures. Nowadays, novel methods have been developed for fault analysis based on pattern recognition in control charts. However, the majority of these studies follow a univariate approach. This article proposes a multivariate pattern recognition approach using machine learning algorithms in conjunction with a scatter diagram as the proposed method. In particular the aim of this approach is to monitor quality characteristics of a product in a multivariate environment considering states in control and out of control without the constraints of statistical conditions with the possibility of its application in real time. Results using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the FuzzyARTMAP neural network showed that multivariate patterns can be recognized successfully in 81% of the cases.

Specific markers were replaced by morphological parameters of cells and nuclei. Method: Fresh blood was taken from a healthy female and given a treatment to induce cell necrosis and apoptosis. Afterward, the samples were stained with AnnexinV-FITC, DRAQ5 and DAPI. Slides were made and analyzed using the cytometer iCys. Pictures were scanned. The analyzed sample consisted of 73 sets of images of DAPI, DRAQ5 and AnnexinV-FITC, respectively. For image analysis and subsequent statistical processing, the CellProfiler and CellProfilerAnalyst were used. Each sample was analyzed twice. The first analysis was conducted using the markers (DAPI, DRAQ5 and Annexin) for an unequivocal identification and subsequent count of necrotic, apoptotic and live cells (gold standard). Thereafter, a second analysis was performed for the nuclear morphology and texture (morphometric analysis). After the machine learning process was completed, the software calculated the quantity of cells in each of the three groups. A comparison between the result of the gold standard and the morphometric analysis was performed using linear regression and a Bland-Altman test. Results: The linear regression between the two compared analyses was r(2) = 0.57 for apoptosis, r(2) = 0.84 for necrosis and r(2) = 0.79 for living cells. Conclusion: It may be concluded that it is possible to replace specific markers against morphology without losing the reproducible high-throughput character of a cytometric analysis.

The BBB passage was modeled using classification and regression schemes on a novel extensive and curated data set (the largest to the best of our knowledge) in terms of log BB. Prior to the model development, steps of data analysis that comprise chemical data curation, structural, cutoff and cluster analysis (CA) were conducted. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) were used to fit classification and correlation functions. The best LDA-based model showed overall accuracies over 85% and 83% for the training and test sets, respectively. Also a MLR-based model with acceptable explanation of more than 69% of the variance in the experimental log BB was developed. A brief and general interpretation of proposed models allowed the estimation on how 'near' our computational approach is to the factors that determine the passage of molecules through the BBB. In a final effort some popular and powerful Machine Learning methods were considered. Comparable or similar performance was observed respect to the simpler linear techniques. Most of the compounds with anomalous behavior were put aside into a set denoted as controversial set and discussion regarding to these compounds is provided. Finally, our results were compared with methodologies previously reported in the literature showing comparable to better results. The results could represent useful tools available and reproducible by all scientific community in the early stages of neuropharmaceutical drug discovery/development projects.

Two main categories of PV modeling are available: the parametric and the nonparametric. In this paper, a methodology using a nonparametric PV model is proposed, using as inputs several forecasts of meteorological variables from a Numerical Weather Forecast model, and actual AC power measurements of PV plants. The methodology was built upon the R environment and uses Quantile Regression Forests as machine learning tool to forecast AC power with a confidence interval. Real data from five PV plants was used to validate the methodology, and results show that daily production is predicted with an absolute cvMBE lower than 1.3%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

For this aim, a novel method named as SVM-FFA is developed by hybridizing the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with Firefly Algorithm (FFA) to predict the monthly mean horizontal global solar radiation using three meteorological parameters of sunshine duration ((n) over bar), maximum temperature (T-max)) and minimum temperature (T-min) as inputs. The predictions accuracy of the proposed SVM-FFA model is validated compared to those of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Genetic Programming (GP) models. The root mean square (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R-2), correlation coefficient (r) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are used as reliable indicators to assess the models' performance. The attained results show that the developed SVM FFA model provides more precise predictions compared to ANN and GP models, with RMSE of 0.6988, R-2 of 0.8024, r of 0.8956 and MAPE of 6.1768 in training phase while, RMSE value of 1.8661, R-2 value of 0.7280, r value of 0.8532 and MAPE value of 11.5192 are obtained in the testing phase. The results specify that the developed SVM FFA model can be adjudged as an efficient machine learning technique for accurate prediction of horizontal global solar radiation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A Novel Memristor-Based Hardware Security Primitive	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Security; Design; Hardware-intrinsic security; memristor; physically unclonable functions; process variation; security protocols	AUTHENTICATION; PROTECTION; CIRCUITS; DESIGN	Memristor is an exciting new addition to the repertoire of fundamental circuit elements. Alternatives to many security protocols originally employing traditional mathematical cryptography involve novel hardware security primitives, such as Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). In this article, we propose a novel hybrid memristor-CMOS PUF circuit and demonstrate its suitability through extensive simulations of environmental and process variation effects. The proposed PUF circuit has substantially less hardware overhead than previously proposed memristor-based PUF circuits while being inherently resistant to machine learning-based modeling attacks because of challenge-dependent delays of the memristor stages. The proposed PUF can be conveniently used in many security applications and protocols based on hardware-intrinsic security.

Many techniques have been proposed for processing, managing, and mining trajectory data in the past decade, fostering a broad range of applications. In this article, we conduct a systematic survey on the major research into trajectory data mining, providing a panorama of the field as well as the scope of its research topics. Following a road map from the derivation of trajectory data, to trajectory data preprocessing, to trajectory data management, and to a variety of mining tasks (such as trajectory pattern mining, outlier detection, and trajectory classification), the survey explores the connections, correlations, and differences among these existing techniques. This survey also introduces the methods that transform trajectories into other data formats, such as graphs, matrices, and tensors, to which more data mining and machine learning techniques can be applied. Finally, some public trajectory datasets are presented. This survey can help shape the field of trajectory data mining, providing a quick understanding of this field to the community.

It is estimated that >50% of the entire human proteome is glycosylated. However, it is still a significant challenge to identify glycosylation sites, which requires expensive/laborious experimental research. Thus, bioinformatics approaches that can predict the glycan occupancy at specific sequons in protein sequences would be useful for understanding and utilizing this important PTM. Results: In this study, we present a novel bioinformatics tool called GlycoMine, which is a comprehensive tool for the systematic in silico identification of C-linked, N-linked, and O-linked glycosylation sites in the human proteome. GlycoMine was developed using the random forest algorithm and evaluated based on a well-prepared up-to-date benchmark dataset that encompasses all three types of glycosylation sites, which was curated from multiple public resources. Heterogeneous sequences and functional features were derived from various sources, and subjected to further two-step feature selection to characterize a condensed subset of optimal features that contributed most to the type-specific prediction of glycosylation sites. Five-fold cross-validation and independent tests show that this approach significantly improved the prediction performance compared with four existing prediction tools: NetNGlyc, NetOGlyc, EnsembleGly and GPP. We demonstrated that this tool could identify candidate glycosylation sites in case study proteins and applied it to identify many high-confidence glycosylation target proteins by screening the entire human proteome.

Machine learning for transient discovery in Pan-STARRS1 difference imaging	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: data analysis; methods: statistical; techniques: image processing; surveys; supernovae: general	ULTRALUMINOUS SUPERNOVAE; SUPERLUMINOUS SUPERNOVA; OBJECT CLASSIFICATION; SKY SURVEY; 1ST; PROGENITOR; REDSHIFT	Efficient identification and follow-up of astronomical transients is hindered by the need for humans to manually select promising candidates from data streams that contain many false positives. These artefacts arise in the difference images that are produced by most major ground-based time-domain surveys with large format CCD cameras. This dependence on humans to reject bogus detections is unsustainable for next generation all-sky surveys and significant effort is now being invested to solve the problem computationally. In this paper, we explore a simple machine learning approach to real-bogus classification by constructing a training set from the image data of similar to 32 000 real astrophysical transients and bogus detections from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey. We derive our feature representation from the pixel intensity values of a 20 x 20 pixel stamp around the centre of the candidates. This differs from previous work in that it works directly on the pixels rather than catalogued domain knowledge for feature design or selection. Three machine learning algorithms are trained (artificial neural networks, support vector machines and random forests) and their performances are tested on a held-out subset of 25 per cent of the training data. We find the best results from the random forest classifier and demonstrate that by accepting a false positive rate of 1 per cent, the classifier initially suggests a missed detection rate of around 10 per cent. However, we also find that a combination of bright star variability, nuclear transients and uncertainty in human labelling means that our best estimate of the missed detection rate is approximately 6 per cent.

Experiments with three approaches to recognizing lexical entailment	NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING			English	Article							EXTRACTING SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS; WORD COOCCURRENCE STATISTICS; SIMILARITY	Inference in natural language often involves recognizing lexical entailment (RLE), that is, identifying whether one word entails another. For example, buy entails own. Two general strategies for RLE have been proposed: One strategy is to manually construct an asymmetric similarity measure for context vectors (directional similarity) and another is to treat RLE as a problem of learning to recognize semantic relations using supervised machine-learning techniques (relation classification). In this paper, we experiment with two recent state-of-the-art representatives of the two general strategies. The first approach is an asymmetric similarity measure (an instance of the directional similarity strategy), designed to capture the degree to which the contexts of a word, a, form a subset of the contexts of another word, b. The second approach (an instance of the relation classification strategy) represents a word pair, a : b, with a feature vector that is the concatenation of the context vectors of a and b, and then applies supervised learning to a training set of labeled feature vectors. In addition, we introduce a third approach that is a new instance of the relation classification strategy. The third approach represents a word pair, a: b, with a feature vector in which the features are the differences in the similarities of a and b to a set of reference words. All three approaches use vector space models of semantics, based on word-context matrices. We perform an extensive evaluation of the three approaches using three different datasets. The proposed new approach (similarity differences) performs significantly better than the other two approaches on some datasets and there is no dataset for which it is significantly worse. Along the way, we address some of the concerns raised in past research, regarding the treatment of RLE as a problem of semantic relation classification, and we suggest, it is beneficial to make connections between the research in lexical entailment and the research in semantic relation classification.

However, supplementary information, such as multitemporal data and/or land surface temperature (LST), has the potential to improve the land cover classification accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, in order to map land covers, we evaluated the potential of multitemporal Landsat 8' s spectral and thermal imageries using a random forest (RF) classifier. We used a grid search approach based on the out-of-bag (OOB) estimate of error to optimize the RF parameters. Four different scenarios were considered in this research: (1) RF classification of multitemporal spectral images, (2) RF classification of multitemporal LST images, (3) RF classification of all multitemporal LST and spectral images, and (4) RF classification of selected important or optimum features. The study area in this research was Naghadeh city and its surrounding region, located in West Azerbaijan Province, northwest of Iran. The overall accuracies of first, second, third, and fourth scenarios were equal to 86.48, 82.26, 90.63, and 91.82 %, respectively. The quantitative assessments of the results demonstrated that the most important or optimum features increase the class separability, while the spectral and thermal features produced a more moderate increase in the land cover mapping accuracy. In addition, the contribution of the multitemporal thermal information led to a considerable increase in the user and producer accuracies of classes with a rapid temporal change behavior, such as crops and vegetation.

Yet, discriminating between similar freshwater communities such as graminoid/sedge from remotely sensed imagery is more difficult. Most of this activity has been performed using medium to low resolution imagery. There are only a few studies using high spatial resolution imagery and machine learning image classification algorithms for mapping heterogeneous wetland plant communities. This study addresses this void by analyzing whether machine learning classifiers such as decision trees (DT) and artificial neural networks (ANN) can accurately classify graminoid/sedge communities using high resolution aerial imagery and image texture data in the Everglades National Park, Florida. In addition to spectral bands, the normalized difference vegetation index, and first-and second-order texture features derived from the near-infrared band were analyzed. Classifier accuracies were assessed using confusion tables and the calculated kappa coefficients of the resulting maps. The results indicated that an ANN (multilayer perceptron based on back propagation) algorithm produced a statistically significantly higher accuracy (82.04 %) than the DT (QUEST) algorithm (80.48 %) or the maximum likelihood (80.56 %) classifier (alpha<0.05). Findings show that using multiple window sizes provided the best results. First-order texture features also provided computational advantages and results that were not significantly different from those using second-order texture features.

However, the exact length of the preictal state is unclear and varies from seizure to seizure. We propose a novel statistical approach for proper selection of the preictal period, which can also be considered either as a measure of predictability of a seizure or as the prediction capability of an understudy feature. The optimal preictal periods (OPPs) obtained from the training samples can be used for building a more accurate classifier model. The proposed method uses amplitude distribution histograms of features extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. To evaluate this method, we extract spectral power features in different frequency bands from monopolar and space-differential EEG signals of 18 patients suffering from pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Furthermore, comparisons among monopolar channels with space-differential channels, as well as intracranial EEG (iEEG) and surface EEG (sEEG) signals, indicate that while monopolar signals perform better in iEEG recordings, no significant difference is noticeable in sEEG recordings.

J	Ou, Y; Patrick, J				Ou, Ying; Patrick, Jon			Automatic negation detection in narrative pathology reports	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Negation detection; Lexicon-based approach; Syntax-based approach; Machine-learning-based approach; Pathology reports	INFORMATION EXTRACTION; SYSTEM; PIPELINE	Objective: To detect negations of medical entities in free-text pathology reports with different approaches, and evaluate their performances. Methods and material: Three different approaches were applied for negation detection: the lexicon-based approach was a rule-based method, relying on trigger terms and termination clues; the syntax-based approach was also a rule-based method, where the rules and negation patterns were designed using the dependency output from the Stanford parser; the machine-learning-based approach used a support vector machine as a classifier to build models with a number of features. A total of 284 English pathology reports of lymphoma were used for the study. Results: The machine-learning-based approach had the best overall performance on the test set with micro-averaged F-score of 82.56%, while the syntax-based approach performed worst with 78.62% Fscore. The lexicon-based approach attained an overall average precision of 89.74% and recall of 76.09%, which were significantly better than the results achieved by Negation Tagger with a similar approach. Discussion: The lexicon-based approach benefitted from being customized to the corpus more than the other two methods. The errors in negation detection with the syntax-based approach producing poorest performance were mainly due to the poor parsing results, and the errors with the other methods were probably because of the abnormal grammatical structures. Conclusions: A machine-learning-based approach has potential advantages for negation detection, and may be preferable for the task. To improve the overall performance, one of the possible solutions is to apply different approaches to each section in the reports. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In general, the secondary structure of a searched noncoding RNA is defined with a structure model constructed from the structural alignment of a set of sequences from its family. Computing the optimal alignment between a sequence and a structure model is the core part of an algorithm that can search genomes for noncoding RNAs. In practice, a single structure model may not be sufficient to capture all crucial features important for a noncoding RNA family. In this paper, we develop a novel machine learning approach that can efficiently search genomes for noncoding RNAs with high accuracy. During the search procedure, a sequence segment in the searched genome sequence is processed and a feature vector is extracted to represent it. Based on the feature vector, a classifier is used to determine whether the sequence segment is the searched ncRNA or not. Our testing results show that this approach is able to efficiently capture crucial features of a noncoding RNA family. Compared with existing search tools, it significantly improves the accuracy of genome annotation.

Accurately predicting disulfide connectivity solely from protein sequence helps to improve the intrinsic understanding of protein structure and function, especially in the post-genome era where large volume of sequenced proteins without being functional annotated is quickly accumulated. In this study, a new feature extracted from the predicted protein 3D structural information is proposed and integrated with traditional features to form discriminative features. Based on the extracted features, a random forest regression model is performed to predict protein disulfide connectivity. We compare the proposed method with popular existing predictors by performing both cross-validation and independent validation tests on benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing predictors. We believe the superiority of the proposed method benefits from both the good discriminative capability of the newly developed features and the powerful modelling capability of the random forest.

The key idea of this density ratio approach is that the ratio is directly estimated so that difficult density estimation is avoided. So far, parametric and non-parametric direct density ratio estimators with various loss functions have been developed, and the kernel least-squares method was demonstrated to be highly useful both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. On the other hand, recent study in pattern recognition exhibited that deep architectures such as a convolutional neural network can significantly outperform kernel methods. In this paper, we propose to use the convolutional neural network in density ratio estimation, and experimentally show that the proposed method tends to outperform the kernel-based method in outlying image detection.

Therefore, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) research is becoming more and more important. Life activities and the protein-protein interactions are inseparable, such as DNA synthesis, gene transcription activation, protein translation, etc. Though many methods based on biological experiments and machine learning have been proposed, they all spent a long time to learn and obtained an imprecise accuracy. How to efficiently and accurately predict PPIs is still a big challenge. To take up such a challenge, we developed a new predictor by incorporating the reduced amino acid alphabet (RAAA) information into the general form of pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAAC) and with the weighted sparse representation-based classification (WSRC). The remarkable advantages of introducing the reduced amino acid alphabet is being able to avoid the notorious dimensionality disaster or overfitting problem in statistical prediction. Additionally, experiments have proven that our method achieved good performance in both a low- and high-dimensional feature space. Among all of the experiments performed on the PPIs data of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the best one achieved 90.91% accuracy, 94.17% sensitivity, 87.22% precision and a 83.43% Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value. In order to evaluate the prediction ability of our method, extensive experiments are performed to compare with the state-of-the-art technique, support vector machine (SVM). The achieved results show that the proposed approach is very promising for predicting PPIs, and it can be a helpful supplement for PPIs prediction.

J	Esteves, S; Silva, JN; Carvalho, JP; Veiga, L				Esteves, Sergio; Silva, Joao Nuno; Carvalho, Joao Paulo; Veiga, Luis			Incremental dataflow execution, resource efficiency and probabilistic guarantees with Fuzzy Boolean nets	JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING			English	Article						Workflow; Dataflow; Incremental processing; Continuous processing; Data-intensive; NoSQL; Quality-of-service; Machine learning; Fuzzy logic		Currently, there is a strong need for organizations to analyze and process ever-increasing volumes of data in order to answer to real-time processing demands. Such continuous and data-intensive processing is often achieved through the composition of complex data-intensive workflows (i.e., dataflows). Dataflow management systems typically enforce strict temporal synchronization across the various processing steps. Non-synchronous behavior often has to be explicitly programmed on an ad-hoc basis, which requires additional lines of code in programs and thus the possibility of errors. More so, in a large set of scenarios for continuous and incremental processing, the output of dataflow applications at each execution can suffer almost no difference when comparing to the previous execution, and therefore resources, energy and computational power are unknowingly wasted. To face such lack of efficiency, transparency, and generality, we introduce the notion of Quality-of-Data (QoD), which describes the level of changes required on a data store that cause the triggering of processing steps. This, so that the dataflow (re-)execution is reduced until its outcome would reach a significant and meaningful variation, which is inside a specified freshness limit. Based on the QoD notion, we propose a novel dataflow model, with framework (Fluxy), for orchestrating data-intensive processing steps, which communicate data via a NoSQL storage, and whose triggering semantics is driven by dynamic QoD constraints automatically defined for different datasets by means of Fuzzy Boolean Nets. These nets give probabilistic guarantees about the prediction of the cumulative error between consecutive dataflow executions. With Fluxy, we demonstrate how dataflows can be leveraged to respond to quality boundaries (that can be seen as SLAs) to deliver controlled and augmented performance, rationalization of resources, and task prioritization.

Early detection of thyroid disorder is an increasingly important area in the field of medical diagnosis, pattern recognition, machine learning and data mining. Thyroid disorder, either over production (hyperthyroidism) or less production (hypothyroidism) results in imbalanced state of thyroid hormone stimulation in human beings. So, controlling this disorder has become a central issue in healthcare and needs great attention. This research critically examines different classification models constructed using a novel mathematical ranked improved F-score ordering (RIFO) applied to thyroid dataset taken from machine learning repository, University of California, Irvine. A total of nine possible and effective feature subsets have been constructed and each subset is tested with three most benchmarked algorithms namely C4.5, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function network (RBFN) using tenfold cross-validation and various training-test partitions. The obtained results show diverse conclusions, but one with interesting and highest accuracy has been presented. From the results, it is observed that MLP has emerged with an outstanding performance of 98.15%, which is greater than all earlier research. The dataset has 3 classes, 5 features and 215 records (hypo=30, hyper=35, normal=150).

We established this relationship based on an analysis of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites X-ray observations of similar to 50,000 X, M, C, and flares derived from the NOAA/Space Weather Prediction Center flares catalog. Employing a combination of machine learning techniques (K-nearest neighbors and nearest centroid algorithms) we show a separation of the observed parameters for the different peak flaring energies. This analysis is validated by successfully predicting the flare classes for 100% of the X-class flares, 76% of the M-class flares, 80% of the C-class flares, and 81% of the B-class flares for solar cycle 24, based on the training of the parametric extracts for solar flares in cycles 22-23.

Friedman was born in Yreka, California, USA, on December 29, 1939. He received his high school education at Yreka High School, then spent two years at Chico State College before transferring to the University of California at Berkeley in 1959. He completed an undergraduate degree in physics in 1962 and a Ph.D. in high-energy particle physics in 1968 and was a post-doctoral research physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory during 1968-1972. In 1972, he moved to Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) as head of the Computation Research Group, retaining this position until 2006. In 1981, he was appointed half time as Professor in the Department of Statistics, Stanford University, remaining half time with his SLAC appointment. He has held visiting appointments at CSIRO in Sydney, CERN and the Department of Statistics at Berkeley, and has had a very active career as a commercial consultant. Jerry became Professor Emeritus in the Department of Statistics in 2007. Apart from some 30 publications in high-energy physics early in his career, Jerry has published over 70 research articles and books in statistics and computer science, including co-authoring the pioneering books Classification and Regression Trees and The Elements of Statistical Learning. Many of his publications have hundreds if not thousands of citations (e.g., the CART book has over 21,000). Much of his software is incorporated in commercial products, including at least one popular search engine. Many of his methods and algorithms are essential inclusions in modern statistical and data mining packages.

This information can be utilized for public health monitoring tasks, particularly for pharmacovigilance, via the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques. However, the language in social media is highly informal, and user-expressed medical concepts are often nontechnical, descriptive, and challenging to extract. There has been limited progress in addressing these challenges, and thus far, advanced machine learning-based NLP techniques have been underutilized. Our objective is to design a machine learning-based approach to extract mentions of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from highly informal text in social media. Methods We introduce ADRMine, a machine learning-based concept extraction system that uses conditional random fields (CRFs). ADRMine utilizes a variety of features, including a novel feature for modeling words' semantic similarities. The similarities are modeled by clustering words based on unsupervised, pretrained word representation vectors (embeddings) generated from unlabeled user posts in social media using a deep learning technique. Results ADRMine outperforms several strong baseline systems in the ADR extraction task by achieving an F-measure of 0.82. Feature analysis demonstrates that the proposed word cluster features significantly improve extraction performance. Conclusion It is possible to extract complex medical concepts, with relatively high performance, from informal, user-generated content. Our approach is particularly scalable, suitable for social media mining, as it relies on large volumes of unlabeled data, thus diminishing the need for large, annotated training data sets.

Automated confidence ranked classification of randomized controlled trial articles: an aid to evidence-based medicine	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Support Vector Machines; Natural Language Processing; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Evidence-Based Medicine; Systematic Reviews; Information Retrieval	SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS; RETRIEVAL; WORKLOAD; MEDLINE; UPDATE	Objective: For many literature review tasks, including systematic review (SR) and other aspects of evidence-based medicine, it is important to know whether an article describes a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Current manual annotation is not complete or flexible enough for the SR process. In this work, highly accurate machine learning predictive models were built that include confidence predictions of whether an article is an RCT. Materials and Methods: The LibSVM classifier was used with forward selection of potential feature sets on a large human-related subset of MEDLINE to create a classification model requiring only the citation, abstract, and MeSH terms for each article. Results: The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.973 and mean squared error of 0.013 on the held out year 2011 data. Accurate confidence estimates were confirmed on a manually reviewed set of test articles. A second model not requiring MeSH terms was also created, and performs almost as well. Discussion: Both models accurately rank and predict article RCT confidence. Using the model and the manually reviewed samples, it is estimated that about 8000 (3%) additional RCTs can be identified in MEDLINE, and that 5% of articles tagged as RCTs in Medline may not be identified. Conclusion: Retagging human-related studies with a continuously valued RCT confidence is potentially more useful for article ranking and review than a simple yes/no prediction. The automated RCT tagging tool should offer significant savings of time and effort during the process of writing SRs, and is a key component of a multistep text mining pipeline that we are building to streamline SR workflow. In addition, the model may be useful for identifying errors in MEDLINE publication types.

The Effect of Sample Age and Prediction Resolution on Myocardial Infarction Risk Prediction	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Classification; clinical decision support system; clinical risk prediction; medical screening; myocardial infarction	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; CLASSIFICATION; MODELS; DEPRESSION; DESIGN; STROKE; SCORE	Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the leading causes of death in many developed countries. Hence, early detection of MI events is critical for effective preventative therapies, potentially reducing avoidable mortality. One approach for early disease prediction is the use of risk prediction models developed using machine learning techniques. One important component of these models is to provide clinicians with the flexibility to customize (e.g., the prediction range) and use the risk prediction model that they deemed most beneficial for their patients. Therefore, in this paper, we develop MI prediction models and investigate the effect of sample age and prediction resolution on the performance of MI risk prediction models. The cardiovascular health study dataset was used in this study. Results indicate that the prediction model developed using SVM algorithm is capable of achieving high sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy of 95.3%, 84.8%, and 90.1%, respectively, over a time span of 6 years. Both sample age and prediction resolution were found not to have a significant impact on the performance of MI risk prediction models developed using subjects aged 65 and above. This implies that risk prediction models developed using different sample age and prediction resolution is a feasible approach. These models can be integrated into a computer aided screening tool which clinicians can use to interpret and predict the MI risk status of the individual patients after performing the necessary clinical assessments (e.g., cognitive function, physical function, electrocardiography, general changes to health/lifestyle, and medications) required by the models. This could offer a means for clinicians to screen the patients at risk of having MI in the near future and prescribe early medical intervention to reduce the risk.

Beyond Where to How: A Machine Learning Approach for Sensing Mobility Contexts Using Smartphone Sensors	SENSORS			English	Article						context awareness; smartphone sensors; machine learning; classification; mobility context; supervised learning	RECOGNITION	This paper presents the results of research on the use of smartphone sensors (namely, GPS and accelerometers), geospatial information (points of interest, such as bus stops and train stations) and machine learning (ML) to sense mobility contexts. Our goal is to develop techniques to continuously and automatically detect a smartphone user's mobility activities, including walking, running, driving and using a bus or train, in real-time or near-real-time (<5 s). We investigated a wide range of supervised learning techniques for classification, including decision trees (DT), support vector machines (SVM), naive Bayes classifiers (NB), Bayesian networks (BN), logistic regression (LR), artificial neural networks (ANN) and several instance-based classifiers (KStar, LWLand IBk). Applying ten-fold cross-validation, the best performers in terms of correct classification rate (i.e., recall) were DT (96.5%), BN (90.9%), LWL (95.5%) and KStar (95.6%). In particular, the DT-algorithm RandomForest exhibited the best overall performance. After a feature selection process for a subset of algorithms, the performance was improved slightly. Furthermore, after tuning the parameters of RandomForest, performance improved to above 97.5%. Lastly, we measured the computational complexity of the classifiers, in terms of central processing unit (CPU) time needed for classification, to provide a rough comparison between the algorithms in terms of battery usage requirements. As a result, the classifiers can be ranked from lowest to highest complexity (i.e., computational cost) as follows: SVM, ANN, LR, BN, DT, NB, IBk, LWL and KStar. The instance-based classifiers take considerably more computational time than the non-instance-based classifiers, whereas the slowest non-instance-based classifier (NB) required about five-times the amount of CPU time as the fastest classifier (SVM). The above results suggest that DT algorithms are excellent candidates for detecting mobility contexts in smartphones, both in terms of performance and computational complexity.

With embedded systems being more and more intertwined and working together not only with each other, but also with their environments as cyber physical systems (CPSs), more streamlined development workflows are employed to handle the increasing complexity during a system's design phase. SystemC is a C++ library for the design of hardware/software systems, enabling the designer to quickly prototype, e.g., a distributed CPS without having to decide about particular implementation details (such as whether to implement a feature in hardware or in software) early in the design process. Thereby, this approach reduces the initial implementation's complexity by offering an abstract layer with which to build a working prototype. However, as SystemC is based on C++, analyzing designs becomes a difficult task due to the complex language features that are available to the designer. Several fundamentally different approaches for analyzing SystemC designs have been suggested. This work illustrates several different SystemC analysis approaches, including their specific advantages and shortcomings, allowing designers to pick the right tools to assist them with a specific problem during the design of a system using SystemC.

For this purpose, a set of data collected from 32 children with different attention skills is analyzed during their interaction with a set of puzzle games. The authors of this study hypothesize that participants with better performance may have quantifiably different eye-movement patterns from users with poorer results. The use of eye trackers outside the research community may help to extend their potential with available intelligent therapies, bringing state-of-the-art technologies to users. The use of gaze data constitutes a new information source in intelligent therapies that may help to build new approaches that are fully-customized to final users' needs. This may be achieved by implementing machine learning algorithms for classification. The initial study of the dataset has proven a 0.88 (+/- 0.11) classification accuracy with a random forest classifier, using cross-validation and hierarchical tree-based feature selection. Further approaches need to be examined in order to establish more detailed attention behaviors and patterns among children with and without attention problems.

Three different texture-based methods (grey level co-occurrence metric (GLCM), Gabor wavelets and Fourier-based textural ordination (FOTO)) were used in conjunction with two different machine learning (ML)-based regression techniques (support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF) regression). These methods were implemented on both 50-cm resolution Digital Globe data extracted from Google Earth (TM) (GE) and 8-cm commercially obtained VHR imagery. This study further examines the role of forest biophysical parameters, such as ground-measured canopy cover and vertical canopy height, in explaining AGB distribution. Three models were developed using: (i) horizontal canopy variables (i.e., canopy cover and texture variables) plus vertical canopy height; (ii) horizontal variables only; and (iii) texture variables only. AGB was variable across the site, ranging from 51.02 Mg/ha to 356.34 Mg/ha. GE-based AGB estimates were comparable to those derived from commercial aerial imagery. The findings demonstrate that novel use of this array of texture-based techniques with GE imagery can help promote the wider use of freely available imagery for low-cost, fine-resolution monitoring of forests parameters at the landscape scale.

Recent pose recognition algorithms have adopted machine learning techniques, utilizing a large collection of motion capture data. The effectiveness of the algorithms is greatly influenced by the diversity and variability of training data. We present a new sampling method that resamples a collection of human motion data to improve the pose variability and achieve an arbitrary size and level of density in the space of human poses. The space of human poses is high dimensional, and thus, brute-force uniform sampling is intractable. We exploit dimensionality reduction and locally stratified sampling to generate either uniform or application specifically biased distributions in the space of human poses. Our algorithm learns to recognize such challenging poses as sitting, kneeling, stretching, and doing yoga using a remarkably small amount of training data. The recognition algorithm can also be steered to maximize its performance for a specific domain of human poses. We demonstrate that our algorithm performs much better than the Kinect software development kit for recognizing challenging acrobatic poses while performing comparably for easy upright standing poses.

In this paper, we propose a machine-learning-integrated load control (MILC) scheme for improved performance and reliability. By dynamic capacity adjustment and interactive load heuristic, MILC tries to reduce the power deviation while keeping the temperature violation ratio and switching counts within an acceptable range. A prototype of the proposed scheme has been implemented and, through experiments using load traces from a real home, we evaluate the performance of MILC. The results show that MILC reduces the peak demand from 4993 W to 4236 W and successfully decreases the power deviation by 12.1% on average(1).

J	Heidrich, W				Heidrich, Wolfgang			Computational Imaging and Display - Hardware-Software Co-design for Imaging Devices	COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM			English	Article								Computational Imaging aims to develop new cameras and imaging modalities that optically encode information about the real world in such a way that it can be captured by image sensors. The resulting images represent detailed information such as scene geometry, motion of solids and liquids, multi-spectral information, or high contrast (high dynamic range), which can then be computationally decoded using inverse methods, machine learning, and numerical optimization. Computational Displays use a similar approach, but in reverse. Here, the goal is to computationally encode a target image that is then optically decoded by the display hardware for presentation to a human observer. Computational displays are capable of generating glasses-free 3D displays, high dynamic range imagery, or images and videos with spatial and/or temporal super-resolution. In this talk I will give an overview of recent advances and current challenges in rapidly expanding research area.

Although computational techniques including interpolation and substitution have been applied to recover missing information caused by cloud contamination, these algorithms are subject to many limitations. In this paper, a novel smart information reconstruction (SMIR) method is proposed, in order to reconstruct cloud contaminated pixel values from the time-space-spectrum continuum with the aid of a machine learning tool, namely extreme learning machine (ELM). For the purpose of demonstration, the performance of SMIR is evaluated by reconstructing the missing remote sensing reflectance values derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Terra satellite over Lake Nicaragua, where is a very cloudy area year round. For comparison, the traditional backpropagation neural network algorithms will also be implemented to reconstruct the missing values. Experimental results show that the ELM outperforms the BP algorithms by an enhanced machine learning capacity with simulated memory effect embedded in MODIS due to linking the complex time-space-spectrum continuum between cloud-free and cloudy pixels. The ELM-based SMIR practice presents a correlation coefficient of 0.88 with root mean squared error of 7.4E - 04sr(-1) between simulated and observed reflectance values. Finding suggests that the SMIR method is effective to reconstruct all the missing information providing visually logical and quantitatively assured images for further image processing and interpretation in environmental applications.

J	Huang, X; Xie, C; Fang, X; Zhang, LP				Huang, Xin; Xie, Cong; Fang, Xing; Zhang, Liangpei			Combining Pixel- and Object-Based Machine Learning for Identification of Water-Body Types From Urban High-Resolution Remote-Sensing Imagery	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						High resolution; machine learning; object-oriented; water detection; water extraction; water index	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; INDEX NDWI; CLASSIFICATION; EXTRACTION; TRANSFORMATION; DELINEATION; PREDICTORS; VEGETATION; SCATTERING; FEATURES	Water is one of the vital components for the ecological environment, which plays an important role in human survival and socioeconomic development. Water resources in urban areas are gradually decreasing due to the rapid urbanization, especially in developing countries. Therefore, the precise extraction and automatic identification of water bodies are of great significance and urgently required for urban planning. It should be noted that although some studies have been reported regarding the water-area extraction, to our knowledge, few papers concern the identification of urban water types (e.g., rivers, lakes, canals, and ponds). In this paper, a novel two-level machine-learning framework is proposed for identifying the water types from urban high-resolution remote-sensing images. The framework consists of two interpretation levels: 1) water bodies are extracted at the pixel level, where the water/shadow/vegetation indexes are considered and 2) water types are further identified at the object level, where a set of geometrical and textural features are used. Both levels employ machine learning for the image interpretation. The proposed framework is validated using the GeoEye-1 and WorldView-2 images, over two mega cities in China, i.e., Wuhan and Shenzhen, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieved satisfactory accuracies for both water extraction [95.4% (Shenzhen), 96.2% (Wuhan)], and water type classification [94.1% (Shenzhen), 95.9% (Wuhan)] in complex urban areas.

However, it is challenging to interpret the functional relevance of the genetic variations found by population genetics studies. In this review, we discuss studies that integrate multiple levels of data, especially transcriptome profiles and phenotype data, to assign functional roles of genetic variations involved in kidney function. Furthermore, we introduce state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, Bayesian networks, support vector machines, and Gaussian process regression, which have been applied successfully to integrating genetic, regulatory, and clinical information to predict clinical outcomes. These methods are likely to be deployed successfully in the nephrology field in the near future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Recent experiments have suggested a new complex network of splicing regulation involving chromatin, transcription and multiple protein factors. In particular, the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), the Argonaute protein AGO1, and members of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family have been implicated in the regulation of splicing associated with chromatin and the elongation of RNAPII. These results raise the question of whether these proteins may associate at the chromatin level to modulate alternative splicing. Results: Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data for CTCF, AGO1, HP1 alpha, H3K27me3, H3K9me2, H3K36me3, RNAPII, total H3 and 5metC and alternative splicing arrays from two cell lines, we have analyzed the combinatorial code of their binding to chromatin in relation to the alternative splicing patterns between two cell lines, MCF7 and MCF10. Using Machine Learning techniques, we identified the changes in chromatin signals that are most significantly associated with splicing regulation between these two cell lines. Moreover, we have built a map of the chromatin signals on the pre-mRNA, that is, a chromatin-based RNA-map, which can explain 606 (68.55%) of the regulated events between MCF7 and MCF10. This chromatin code involves the presence of HP1 alpha, CTCF, AGO1, RNAPII and histone marks around regulated exons and can differentiate patterns of skipping and inclusion. Additionally, we found a significant association of HP1 alpha and CTCF activities around the regulated exons and a putative DNA binding site for HP1 alpha. Conclusions: Our results show that a considerable number of alternative splicing events could have a chromatin-dependent regulation involving the association of HP1 alpha and CTCF near regulated exons. Additionally, we find further evidence for the involvement of HP1 alpha and AGO1 in chromatin-related splicing regulation.

It gradually trains features one by one. Previous research indicated that supervised machine learning with input attribute ordering can improve classification results. Moreover, input space partitioning can also effectively reduce the interference among features. This study proposed IAL based on Grouped Feature Ordering, which fused feature partitioning with feature ordering. The experimental results show that this approach is not only applicable for pattern classification improvement, but also efficient to reduce interference among features.

J	Zhu, FJ; Wang, XF; Zhu, DH; Liu, YQ				Zhu, Fujin; Wang, Xuefeng; Zhu, Donghua; Liu, Yuqin			A Supervised Requirement-oriented Patent Classification Scheme Based on the Combination of Metadata and Citation Information	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Requirement-oriented taxonomy; Patent classification; Document representation; Machine learning	DOCUMENT CATEGORIZATION; FEATURE-SELECTION; TECHNOLOGY; OPPORTUNITIES	Patent classification systems are applied extensively in innovative analysis. Existing patent classification schemes are either technology-dependent or TRIZ-based. The former ones, such as the IPC and UPC, are normally developed by different patent offices in the world mainly for the purpose of patentability examination and patent retrieval, while the latter is for TRIZ users and analysts with no more than 40 categories. These static classifications are too complex and general to meet the in-depth patent classification requirements of a specific technology area or organization. To tackle these drawbacks, in this paper, we propose an automatic requirement-oriented patent classification scheme as a complementary method using supervised machine learning techniques to classify patent dataset into a user-defined taxonomy. The requirement-oriented patent taxonomy can be technology-dependent, application-dependent or a mixture of both tailored to specific business objectives. It is more comprehensible and adaptable to various patent management requirements. Through a set of experiments on a collection of 14,414 patents in a case study in the technology area of system on a chip (SoC), we recommend using the combination of the metadata and citation information as the document representation for the new method since it can obtain relatively high classification accuracy with a dramatically simplified document preprocessing process.

Application of Machine Learning Techniques to Accurately Predict Population Health Outcomes from a Minimal Demographic Dataset	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SELECTION; LASSO	For years, we have relied on population surveys to keep track of regional public health statistics, including the prevalence of non-communicable diseases. Because of the cost and limitations of such surveys, we often do not have the up-to-date data on health outcomes of a region. In this paper, we examined the feasibility of inferring regional health outcomes from socio-demographic data that are widely available and timely updated through national censuses and community surveys. Using data for 50 American states (excluding Washington DC) from 2007 to 2012, we constructed a machine-learning model to predict the prevalence of six non-communicable disease (NCD) outcomes (four NCDs and two major clinical risk factors), based on population socio-demographic characteristics from the American Community Survey. We found that regional prevalence estimates for non-communicable diseases can be reasonably predicted. The predictions were highly correlated with the observed data, in both the states included in the derivation model (median correlation 0.88) and those excluded from the development for use as a completely separated validation sample (median correlation 0.85), demonstrating that the model had sufficient external validity to make good predictions, based on demographics alone, for areas not included in the model development. This highlights both the utility of this sophisticated approach to model development, and the vital importance of simple socio-demographic characteristics as both indicators and determinants of chronic disease.

Our specific aims are: (1) to develop a computerized algorithm for medication discrepancy detection between patients' discharge prescriptions (structured data) and medications documented in free-text clinical notes (unstructured data); and (2) to assess the performance of the algorithm on real-world medication reconciliation data. Methods: We collected clinical notes and discharge prescription lists for all 271 patients enrolled in the Complex Care Medical Home Program at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center between 1/1/2010 and 12/31/2013. A double-annotated, gold-standard set of medication reconciliation data was created for this collection. We then developed a hybrid algorithm consisting of three processes: (1) a ML algorithm to identify medication entities from clinical notes, (2) a rule-based method to link medication names with their attributes, and (3) a NLP-based, hybrid approach to match medications with structured prescriptions in order to detect medication discrepancies. The performance was validated on the gold-standard medication reconciliation data, where precision (P), recall (R), F-value (F) and workload were assessed. Results: The hybrid algorithm achieved 95.0%/91.6%/93.3% of P/R/F on medication entity detection and 98.7%/99.4%/99.1% of P/R/F on attribute linkage. The medication matching achieved 92.4%/90.7%/91.5% (P/R/F) on identifying matched medications in the gold-standard and 88.6%/82.5%/85.5% (P/R/F) on discrepant medications. By combining all processes, the algorithm achieved 92.4%/90.7%/91.5% (P/R/F) and 71.5%/65.2%/68.2% (P/R/F) on identifying the matched and the discrepant medications, respectively.

Networks in Coronary Heart Disease Genetics As a Step towards Systems Epidemiology	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; HEPATIC LIPASE; ASSOCIATION; POLYMORPHISM; METAANALYSIS; PREDICTION; EXPERIENCE; DISCOVERY; PROMOTER; RISK	We present the use of innovative machine learning techniques in the understanding of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) through intermediate traits, as an example of the use of this class of methods as a first step towards a systems epidemiology approach of complex diseases genetics. Using a sample of 252 middle-aged men, of which 102 had a CHD event in 10 years follow-up, we applied machine learning algorithms for the selection of CHD intermediate phenotypes, established markers, risk factors, and their previously associated genetic polymorphisms, and constructed a map of relationships between the selected variables. Of the 52 variables considered, 42 were retained after selection of the most informative variables for CHD. The constructed map suggests that most selected variables were related to CHD in a context dependent manner while only a small number of variables were related to a specific outcome. We also observed that loss of complexity in the network was linked to a future CHD event. We propose that novel, non-linear, and integrative epidemiological approaches are required to combine all available information, in order to truly translate the new advances in medical sciences to gains in preventive measures and patients care.

J	Wang, YL; Li, TQ				Wang, Yanlu; Li, Tie-Qiang			Dimensionality of ICA in resting-state fMRI investigated by feature optimized classification of independent components with SVM	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; independent component analysis; pattern classification; machine learning; signal processing; image processing	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; TIME-SERIES; INTRINSIC DIMENSIONALITY; GROUP PICA; BRAIN; MODEL; CLASSIFIERS; REGRESSION; NETWORKS; REMOVAL	Different machine learning algorithms have recently been used for assisting automated classification of independent component analysis (ICA) results from resting-state fMRI data. The success of this approach relies on identification of artifact components and meaningful functional networks. A limiting factor of ICA is the uncertainty of the number of independent components (NIC). We aim to develop a framework based on support vector machines (SVM) and optimized feature-selection for automated classification of independent components (ICs) and use the framework to investigate the effects of input NIC on the ICA results. Seven different resting-state fMRI datasets were studied. 18 features were devised by mimicking the empirical criteria for manual evaluation. The five most significant (p < 0.01) features were identified by general linear modeling and used to generate a classification model for the framework. This feature-optimized classification of ICs with SVM (FOCIS) framework was used to classify both group and single subject ICA results. The classification results obtained using FOCIS and previously published FSL-FIX were compared against manually evaluated results. On average the false negative rate in identifying artifact contaminated ICs for FOCIS and FSL-FIX were 98.27 and 92.34%, respectively. The number of artifact and functional network components increased almost linearly with the input NIC. Through tracking, we demonstrate that incrementing NIC affects most ICs when NIC < 33, whereas only a few limited ICs are affected by direct splitting when NIC is incremented beyond NIC > 40. For a given IC, its changes with increasing NIC are individually specific irrespective whether the component is a potential resting-state functional network or an artifact component. Using FOCIS, we investigated experimentally the ICA dimensionality of resting-state fMRI datasets and found that the input NIC can critically affect the ICA results of resting-state fMRI data.

Based on this graph, we derive the normal profile composed of high-level features. We use NSL-KDD dataset to analyze and evaluate the efficiency of the proposed IDS at detecting denial-of-service (DOS) attacks. Experimental results show that the proposed IDS can achieve good results in terms of detection rate and false positive rate. For some DOS attacks, 100% detection rate is achieved with 1.55% false positive. We also use KDD99 dataset to compare the proposed IDS with two statistical-based methods and some data mining and machine learning-based methods. Comparison study shows that the proposed IDS achieves the best tradeoff between detection rate (99.76%) and false positive rate (0.6%). It also requires just a few microseconds to classify the connection as normal or attack with low CPU usage and low memory consumption. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this article, we describe a framework in which to consider penalized regression approaches to variable selection for causal effects. The framework leads to a simple impute, then select' class of procedures that is agnostic to the type of imputation algorithm as well as penalized regression used. It also clarifies how model selection involves a multivariate regression model for causal inference problems and that these methods can be applied for identifying subgroups in which treatment effects are homogeneous. Analogies and links with the literature on machine learning methods, missing data, and imputation are drawn. A difference least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm is defined, along with its multiple imputation analogs. The procedures are illustrated using a well-known right-heart catheterization dataset. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The difficulty this creates for identifying relevant alterations has stimulated the development of various computational approaches to distinguishing drivers from bystanders. We develop and apply an ensemble classifier (EC) machine learning method, which integrates 10 classifiers that are publically available, and apply it to breast and ovarian cancer. In particular we find the following: (1) Using both standard and non-standard metrics, EC almost always outperforms single method classifiers, often by wide margins. (2) Of the 50 highest ranked genes for breast (ovarian) cancer, 34 (30) are associated with other cancers in either the OMIM, CGC or NCG database (P < 10(-22)). (3) Another 10, for both breast and ovarian cancer, have been identified by GWAS studies. (4) Several of the remaining genes--including a protein kinase that regulates the Fra-1 transcription factor which is overexpressed in ER negative breast cancer cells; and Fyn, which is overexpressed in pancreatic and prostate cancer, among others--are biologically plausible. Biological implications are briefly discussed. Source codes and detailed results are available at http://www.visantnet.org/misi/driver_ integration.zip.

We select a list of 85 easily measured (or derived) photometric quantities (or 'features') and spectroscopic redshifts for almost two million galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10. After identifying which features have the most predictive power, we use standard artificial Neural Networks (aNNs) to show that the addition of these features, in combination with the standard magnitudes and colours, improves the machine learning redshift estimate by 18 per cent and decreases the catastrophic outlier rate by 32 per cent. We further compare the redshift estimate using RDF with those from two different aNNs, and with photometric redshifts available from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that the RDF requires orders of magnitude less computation time than the aNNs to obtain a machine learning redshift while reducing both the catastrophic outlier rate by up to 43 per cent, and the redshift error by up to 25 per cent. When compared to the SDSS photometric redshifts, the RDF machine learning redshifts both decreases the standard deviation of residuals scaled by 1/(1+z) by 36 per cent from 0.066 to 0.041, and decreases the fraction of catastrophic outliers by 57 per cent from 2.32 to 0.99 per cent.

In this paper, we present a novel ensemble learning method: argumentation based multi-agent joint learning (AMAJL), which integrates ideas from multiagent argumentation, ensemble learning, and association rule mining. In AMAJL, argumentation technology is introduced as an ensemble strategy to integrate multiple base classifiers and generate a high performance ensemble classifier. We design an argumentation framework named Arena as a communication platform for knowledge integration. Through argumentation based joint learning, high quality individual knowledge can be extracted, and thus a refined global knowledge base can be generated and used independently for classification. We perform numerous experiments on multiple public datasets using AMAJL and other benchmark methods. The results demonstrate that our method can effectively extract high quality knowledge for ensemble classifier and improve the performance of classification.

A Novel Image Recuperation Approach for Diagnosing and Ranking Retinopathy Disease Level Using Diabetic Fundus Image	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Retinal fundus images are widely used in diagnosing and providing treatment for several eye diseases. Prior works using retinal fundus images detected the presence of exudation with the aid of publicly available dataset using extensive segmentation process. Though it was proved to be computationally efficient, it failed to create a diabetic retinopathy feature selection system for transparently diagnosing the disease state. Also the diagnosis of diseases did not employ machine learning methods to categorize candidate fundus images into true positive and true negative ratio. Several candidate fundus images did not include more detailed feature selection technique for diabetic retinopathy. To apply machine learning methods and classify the candidate fundus images on the basis of sliding window a method called, Diabetic Fundus Image Recuperation (DFIR) is designed in this paper. The initial phase of DFIR method select the feature of optic cup in digital retinal fundus images based on Sliding Window Approach. With this, the disease state for diabetic retinopathy is assessed. The feature selection in DFIR method uses collection of sliding windows to obtain the features based on the histogram value. The histogram based feature selection with the aid of Group Sparsity Non-overlapping function provides more detailed information of features. Using Support Vector Model in the second phase, the DFIR method based on Spiral Basis Function effectively ranks the diabetic retinopathy diseases. The ranking of disease level for each candidate set provides a much promising result for developing practically automated diabetic retinopathy diagnosis system. Experimental work on digital fundus images using the DFIR method performs research on the factors such as sensitivity, specificity rate, ranking efficiency and feature selection time.

Researchers and clinicians are also increasingly interested in the study of functional-connectivity patterns of brains at rest and how these relations might change in conditions like Alzheimer's disease or clinical depression. In this study we investigate the efficacy of a specific multivariate statistical machine learning technique to perform patient stratification from functional-connectivity patterns of brains at rest. Whilst the majority of previous approaches to this problem have employed support vector machines (SVMs) we investigate the performance of Bayesian Gaussian process logistic regression (GP-LR) models with linear and non-linear covariance functions. GP-LR models can be interpreted as a Bayesian probabilistic analogue to kernel SVM classifiers. However, GP-LR methods confer a number of benefits over kernel SVMs. Whilst SVMs only return a binary class label prediction, GP-LR, being a probabilistic model, provides a principled estimate of the probability of class membership. Class probability estimates are a measure of the confidence the model has in its predictions, such a confidence score may be extremely useful in the clinical setting. Additionally, if miss-classification costs are not symmetric, thresholds can be set to achieve either strong specificity or sensitivity scores. Since GP-LR models are Bayesian, computationally expensive cross-validation hyper-parameter grid-search methods can be avoided. We apply these methods to a sample of 77 subjects; 27 with a diagnosis of probable AD, 50 with a diagnosis of a-MCI and a control sample of 39. All subjects underwent aMRI examination at 3 T to obtain a 7 minute and 20 second resting state scan. Our results support the hypothesis that GP-LR models can be effective at performing patient stratification: the implemented model achieves 75% accuracy disambiguating healthy subjects from subjects with amnesic mild cognitive impairment and 97% accuracy disambiguating amnesic mild cognitive impairment subjects from those with Alzheimer's disease, accuracies are estimated using a held-out test set. Both results are significant at the 1% level. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

J	Ohzeki, M				Ohzeki, Masayuki			L-1-Regularized Boltzmann Machine Learning Using Majorizer Minimization	JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN			English	Article							ALGORITHM	We propose an inference method to estimate sparse interactions and biases according to Boltzmann machine learning. The basis of this method is L-1 regularization, which is often used in compressed sensing, a technique for reconstructing sparse input signals from undersampled outputs. L-1 regularization impedes the simple application of the gradient method, which optimizes the cost function that leads to accurate estimations, owing to the cost function's lack of smoothness. In this study, we utilize the majorizer minimization method, which is a well-known technique implemented in optimization problems, to avoid the non-smoothness of the cost function. By using the majorizer minimization method, we elucidate essentially relevant biases and interactions from given data with seemingly strongly-correlated components.

New method: Confocal fluorescence microscopy of multiplex-labeled (GFAP, DAPI) brain tissue is used to perform imaging of astrocytes in their tissue context. The proposed computational method identifies the astrocyte cell nuclei, and reconstructs their arbors using a local priority based parallel (LPP) tracing algorithm. Quantitative arbor measurements are extracted using Scorcioni's L-measure, and profiled by unsupervised harmonic co-clustering to reveal the morphological diversity. Results: The proposed method identifies astrocyte nuclei, generates 3-D reconstructions of their arbors, and extracts quantitative arbor measurements, enabling a morphological grouping of the cell population. Comparison with existing methods: Our method enables comprehensive spatial and morphological profiling of astrocyte populations in brain tissue for the first time, and overcomes limitations of prior methods. Visual proofreading of the results indicate a >95% accuracy in identifying astrocyte nuclei. The arbor reconstructions exhibited 3.2% fewer erroneous jumps in tracing, and 17.7% fewer false segments compared to the widely used fast-marching method that resulted in 9% jumps and 20.8% false segments. Conclusions: The proposed method can be used for large-scale quantitative studies of brain astrocyte distribution and morphology. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Housh, M; Ostfeld, A				Housh, Mashor; Ostfeld, Avi			An integrated logit model for contamination event detection in water distribution systems	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Water distribution systems; Water quality; Water security; Event detection; Logit analysis	SENSOR PLACEMENT; DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS; CHLORINE RESPONSE; QUALITY SENSORS; TIME-SERIES; CLASSIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION	The problem of contamination event detection in water distribution systems has become one of the most challenging research topics in water distribution systems analysis. Current attempts for event detection utilize a variety of approaches including statistical, heuristics, machine learning, and optimization methods. Several existing event detection systems share a common feature in which alarms are obtained separately for each of the water quality indicators. Unifying those single alarms from different indicators is usually performed by means of simple heuristics. A salient feature of the current developed approach is using a statistically oriented model for discrete choice prediction which is estimated using the maximum likelihood method for integrating the single alarms. The discrete choice model is jointly calibrated with other components of the event detection system framework in a training data set using genetic algorithms. The fusing process of each indicator probabilities, which is left out of focus in many existing event detection system models, is confirmed to be a crucial part of the system which could be modelled by exploiting a discrete choice model for improving its performance. The developed methodology is tested on real water quality data, showing improved performances in decreasing the number of false positive alarms and in its ability to detect events with higher probabilities, compared to previous studies.

Fault diagnosis in DSL networks using support vector machines	COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Network management; Support vector machines; Supervised learning; One-class classifiers; DSL anomalies	MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM	The adequate operation for a number of service distribution networks relies on the effective maintenance and fault management of their underlay DSL infrastructure. Thus, new tools are required in order to adequately monitor and further diagnose anomalies that other segments of the DSL network cannot identify due to the pragmatic issues raised by hardware or software misconfigurations. In this work we present a fundamentally new approach for classifying known DSL-level anomalies by exploiting the properties of novelty detection via the employment of one-class Support Vector Machines (SVMs). By virtue of the imbalance residing in the training samples that consequently lead to problematic prediction outcomes when used within two-class formulations, we adopt the properties of one-class classification and construct models for independently identifying and classifying a single type of a DSL-level anomaly. Given the fact that the greater number of the installed Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs) within the DSL network of a large European ISP were misconfigured, thus unable to accurately flag anomalous events, we utilize as inference solutions the models derived by the one-class SVM formulations built by the known labels as flagged by the much smaller number of correctly configured DSLAMs in the same network in order to aid the classification aspect against the monitored unlabeled events. By reaching an average over 95% on a number of classification accuracy metrics such as precision, recall and F-score we show that one-class SVM classifiers overcome the biased classification outcomes achieved by the traditional two-class formulations and that they may constitute as viable and promising components within the design of future network fault management strategies. In addition, we demonstrate their superiority over commonly used two-class machine learning approaches such as Decision Trees and Bayesian Networks that has been used in the same context within past solutions.

Test outcome is reported as "negative", "atypical" (defined as abnormal epithelial changes of uncertain diagnostic significance), and "positive" (defined as definitive cellular evidence of epithelial dysplasia or carcinoma). The major challenge is how to properly manage the "atypical" patients in order to diagnose OSCC early and prevent OSCC. In this study, we collected exfoliative cytology data, histopathology data, and clinical data of normal subjects (n=102), oral leukoplakia (OLK) patients (n=82), and OSCC patients (n= 93), and developed a data analysis procedure for quantitative risk stratification of OLK patients. This procedure involving a step called expert-guided data transformation and reconstruction (EdTAR) which allows automatic data processing and reconstruction and reveals informative signals for subsequent risk stratification. Modern machine learning techniques were utilized to build statistical prediction models on the reconstructed data. Among the several models tested using resampling methods for parameter pruning and performance evaluation, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was found to be optimal with a high sensitivity (median>0.98) and specificity (median>0.99). With the SVM model, we constructed an oral cancer risk index (OCRI) which may potentially guide clinical follow-up of OLK patients. One OLK patient with an initial OCRI of 0.88 developed OSCC after 40 months of follow-up. In conclusion, we have developed a statistical method for qualitative risk stratification of OLK patients. This method may potentially improve cost-effectiveness of clinical follow-up of OLK patients, and help design clinical chemoprevention trial for highrisk populations.

Because of their low costs and high performance, many statistical and machine learning methods have been recently implemented to identify these associations. Most existing computer-aided methods for predicting ADRs mainly rely on known drug-ADR associations and achieve expected performances on overall data sets. However, they fail to predict ADRs for less-characterized drugs because of insufficient prior knowledge. To solve this problem, we present a novel method with new drug features. In this paper, we first applied a novel matrix-completion method called inductive matrix completion (IMC) to predict ADRs by combining features for drugs and ADRs. Then, similarities between drugs were calculated in different ways based on drug-target interactions. Finally, comprehensive validations were carried out to compare the new approach with four other typical approaches on various drug features. Comparison of approaches and features showed that no matter evaluated by tenfold cross-validation or prospective validation, IMC consistently performed well on both types of drugs, well-known or less studied. Moreover, the cosine similarity of drugs was prominent for IMC. Therefore, our method excels at predicting ADRs for less-characterized drugs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the recent researches showed that ILs might bring potential risk to environment and humans. In this work, genetic function approximation (GFA) and least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) models were developed for predicting the cytotoxicity of a great variety of ILs, including 9 types of cations and 44 types of anions, to Leukemia Rat Cell Line (IPC-81) based on the structural descriptors calculated from the combination of cations and anions. Seven descriptors were selected by GFA to develop the linear QSAR model. According to the discussion of descriptors, the cation structure was the main factor of the toxicity which mainly depends on the hydrophobicity and space structure of cations. The LSSVM model was built to predict accurately the cytotoxicity of ILs to capture the nonlinear nature. The rigorous internal and external validation and applicability domain (AD) were performed to verify the reliability and predictability for GFA and LSSVM models. The results indicated that both models could be used for estimating the cytotoxicity of new ILs to IPC-81, and the discovered key structural characteristics could provide reference information for designing and synthesizing safer ILs.

J	Hamp, T; Rost, B				Hamp, Tobias; Rost, Burkhard			More challenges for machine-learning protein interactions	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							SEQUENCES; DATABASE; SIZE	Motivation: Machine learning may be the most popular computational tool in molecular biology. Providing sustained performance estimates is challenging. The standard cross-validation protocols usually fail in biology. Park and Marcotte found that even refined protocols fail for protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Results: Here, we sketch additional problems for the prediction of PPIs from sequence alone. First, it not only matters whether proteins A or B of a target interaction A-B are similar to proteins of training interactions (positives), but also whether A or B are similar to proteins of non-interactions (negatives). Second, training on multiple interaction partners per protein did not improve performance for new proteins (not used to train). In contrary, a strictly non-redundant training that ignored good data slightly improved the prediction of difficult cases. Third, which prediction method appears to be best crucially depends on the sequence similarity between the test and the training set, how many true interactions should be found and the expected ratio of negatives to positives. The correct assessment of performance is the most complicated task in the development of prediction methods. Our analyses suggest that PPIs square the challenge for this task.

Despite such drastic changes to the protein sequence, FS indels and NS variants have been discovered in healthy individuals. How to discriminate disease-causing from neutral FS indels and NS variants is an understudied problem. Results: We have built a machine learning method called DDIG-in (FS) based on real human genetic variations from the Human Gene Mutation Database (inherited disease-causing) and the 1000 Genomes Project (GP) (putatively neutral). The method incorporates both sequence and predicted structural features and yields a robust performance by 10-fold cross-validation and independent tests on both FS indels and NS variants. We showed that human-derived NS variants and FS indels derived from animal orthologs can be effectively employed for independent testing of our method trained on human-derived FS indels. DDIG-in (FS) achieves a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.59, a sensitivity of 86%, and a specificity of 72% for FS indels. Application of DDIG-in (FS) to NS variants yields essentially the same performance (MCC of 0.43) as a method that was specifically trained for NS variants. DDIG-in (FS) was shown to make a significant improvement over existing techniques.

Daily reports of incidents appear in public media including major ex-filtrations of data for the purposes of stealing identities, credit card numbers, and intellectual property as well as to take control of network resources. Methods used by attackers constantly change in order to defeat techniques employed by information technology (IT) teams intended to discover or block intrusions. "Zero Day" attacks whose "signatures" are not yet in IT databases are continually being uncovered. Machine learning approaches have been widely used to increase the effectiveness of intrusion detection platforms. While some machine learning techniques are effective at detecting certain types of attacks, there are no known methods that can be applied universally and achieve consistent results for multiple attack types. The focus of our research is the development of a framework that combines the outputs of multiple learners in order to improve the efficacy of network intrusion on data that contains instances of multiple classes of attacks. We have chosen the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as the core learning algorithm due to recent research that suggests that ELMs are straightforward to implement, computationally efficient and have excellent learning performance characteristics on par with the Support Vector Machine (SVM), one of the most widely used and best performing machine learning platforms (Liu, Gao, & Li, 2012). We introduce the novel Multiple Adaptive Reduced Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (MARK-ELM) which combines Multiple Kernel Boosting (Xia & Hoi, 2013) with the Multiple Classification Reduced Kernel ELM (Deng, Zheng, & Zhang, 2013). We tested this approach on several machine learning datasets as well as the KDD Cup 99 (Flettich & Bay, 1999) intrusion detection dataset. Our results indicate that MARK-ELM works well for the majority of University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository small datasets and is scalable for larger datasets. For UCI datasets we achieved performance similar to the MKBoost Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach. In our experiments we demonstrate that MARK-ELM achieves superior detection rates and much lower false alarm rates than other approaches on intrusion detection data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Indeed, text collections are large and it is very difficult for biologists to fully take benefit from this amount of knowledge. Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods have been applied to extract background knowledge from biomedical texts. Some of existing NLP approaches are based on handcrafted rules and thus are time consuming and often devoted to a specific corpus. Machine learning based NLP methods, give good results but generate outcomes that are not really understandable by a user. Results: We take advantage of an hybridization of data mining and natural language processing to propose an original symbolic method to automatically produce patterns conveying gene interactions and their characterizations. Therefore, our method not only allows gene interactions but also semantics information on the extracted interactions (e. g., modalities, biological contexts, interaction types) to be detected. Only limited resource is required: the text collection that is used as a training corpus. Our approach gives results comparable to the results given by state-of-the-art methods and is even better for the gene interaction detection in AIMed. Conclusions: Experiments show how our approach enables to discover interactions and their characterizations. To the best of our knowledge, there is few methods that automatically extract the interactions and also associated semantics information.

SuperCDMS Collaboration	Dark matter effective field theory scattering in direct detection experiments	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								We examine the consequences of the effective field theory )EFT) of dark atter-nucleon scattering for current and proposed direct detection experiments. Exclusion limits on EFT coupling constants computed using the optimum interval method are presented for SuperCDMS Soudan, CDMS II, and LUX, and the necessity of combining results from multiple experiments in order to determine dark matter parameters is discussed. We demonstrate that spectral differences between the standard dark matter model and a general EFT interaction can produce a bias when calculating exclusion limits and when developing signal models for likelihood and machine learning techniques. We also discuss the implications of the EFT for the next-generation (G2) direct detection experiments and point out regions of complementarity in the EFT parameter space.	[Cornell, B.; Golwala, S.

Machine Learning for Discriminating Quantum Measurement Trajectories and Improving Readout	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							SYSTEMS	Current methods for classifying measurement trajectories in superconducting qubit systems produce fidelities systematically lower than those predicted by experimental parameters. Here, we place current classification methods within the framework of machine learning (ML) algorithms and improve on them by investigating more sophisticated ML approaches. We find that nonlinear algorithms and clustering methods produce significantly higher assignment fidelities that help close the gap to the fidelity possible under ideal noise conditions. Clustering methods group trajectories into natural subsets within the data, which allows for the diagnosis of systematic errors. We find large clusters in the data associated with T-1 processes and show these are the main source of discrepancy between our experimental and ideal fidelities. These error diagnosis techniques help provide a path forward to improve qubit measurements.	[Magesan, Easwar; Gambetta, Jay M.; Corcoles, A.

QuantiFly: Robust Trainable Software for Automated Drosophila Egg Counting	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DIETARY RESTRICTION; IMAGE-ANALYSIS	We report the development and testing of software called QuantiFly: an automated tool to quantify Drosophila egg laying. Many laboratories count Drosophila eggs as a marker of fitness. The existing method requires laboratory researchers to count eggs manually while looking down a microscope. This technique is both time-consuming and tedious, especially when experiments require daily counts of hundreds of vials. The basis of the QuantiFly software is an algorithm which applies and improves upon an existing advanced pattern recognition and machine-learning routine. The accuracy of the baseline algorithm is additionally increased in this study through correction of bias observed in the algorithm output. The QuantiFly software, which includes the refined algorithm, has been designed to be immediately accessible to scientists through an intuitive and responsive user-friendly graphical interface. The software is also open-source, self-contained, has no dependencies and is easily installed (https://github.com/dwaithe/quantifly). Compared to manual egg counts made from digital images, QuantiFly achieved average accuracies of 94% and 85% for eggs laid on transparent (defined) and opaque (yeast-based) fly media. Thus, the software is capable of detecting experimental differences in most experimental situations. Significantly, the advanced feature recognition capabilities of the software proved to be robust to food surface artefacts like bubbles and crevices. The user experience involves image acquisition, algorithm training by labelling a subset of eggs in images of some of the vials, followed by a batch analysis mode in which new images are automatically assessed for egg numbers. Initial training typically requires approximately 10 minutes, while subsequent image evaluation by the software is performed in just a few seconds. Given the average time per vial for manual counting is approximately 40 seconds, our software introduces a timesaving advantage for experiments starting with as few as 20 vials. We also describe an optional acrylic box to be used as a digital camera mount and to provide controlled lighting during image acquisition which will guarantee the conditions used in this study.

Although mathematical methods can potentially help clinicians to predict the progression of diseases, there is no method so far that estimates the patient state from very short time-series of a biomarker for making diagnosis and/or prognosis by employing the information of previous patients. Here, we propose a mathematical framework for integrating other patients' datasets to infer and predict the state of the disease in the current patient based on their short history. We extend a machine-learning framework of "prediction with expert advice" to deal with unstable dynamics. We construct this mathematical framework by combining expert advice with a mathematical model of prostate cancer. Our model predicted well the individual biomarker series of patients with prostate cancer that are used as clinical samples.

Recent years, more and more research works have tried to build effective machine learning models to identify an Internet flow with the few packets at its early stage. However, a basic and important problem still needs to be studied in depth, that is how many packets are most effective in early stage Internet traffic identification. In this paper, we try to resolve this problem. Three Internet traffic data sets are applied. And the sizes of the first 10 packets are extracted for study. We firstly apply mutual information to analyze the information that the first n packets provide to the flow type. Then correlation analysis of each pair of adjacent packets is carried out to find out the feature redundancies. And then we execute a number of crossover identification experiments with different numbers of packets using 11 well-known supervised learning algorithms. Finally, statistical tests are applied for the experimental results to find out which number is the best performed one. Our experimental results show that 5-7 are the best packet numbers for early stage traffic identification. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Fox, CH; Paquet, PC; Reimchen, TE				Fox, Caroline Hazel; Paquet, Paul Charles; Reimchen, Thomas Edward			Novel species interactions: American black bears respond to Pacific herring spawn	BMC ECOLOGY			English	Article						Species interactions; Clupea pallasii; Ursus americanus; Intertidal zone; Forage fish; Pacific Ocean; Spawn	CLUPEA-HARENGUS-PALLASI; COASTAL BRITISH-COLUMBIA; BROWN BEARS; URSUS-ARCTOS; FOOD WEBS; CENTRAL SCANDINAVIA; RIPARIAN FORESTS; SALMON; MARINE; ALASKA	Background: In addition to the decline and extinction of the world's species, the decline and eventual loss of species interactions is one of the major consequences of the biodiversity crisis. On the Pacific coast of North America, diminished runs of salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) drive numerous marine-terrestrial interactions, many of which have been intensively studied, but marine-terrestrial interactions driven by other species remain relatively unknown. Bears (Ursus spp.) are major vectors of salmon into terrestrial ecosystems, but their participation in other cross-ecosystem interactions is similarly poorly described. Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), a migratory forage fish in coastal marine ecosystems of the North Pacific Ocean and the dominant forage fish in British Columbia (BC), spawn in nearshore subtidal and intertidal zones. Spawn resources (eggs, milt, and spawning adults) at these events are available to coastal predators and scavengers, including terrestrial species. In this study, we investigated the interaction between American black bears (Ursus americanus) and Pacific herring at spawn events in Quatsino Sound, BC, Canada. Results: Using remote cameras to monitor bear activity (1,467 camera days, 29 sites, years 2010-2012) in supratidal and intertidal zones and a machine learning approach, we determined that the quantity of Pacific herring eggs in supratidal and intertidal zones was a leading predictor of black bear activity, with bears positively responding to increasing herring egg masses. Other important predictors included day of the year and Talitrid amphipod (Traskorchestia spp.) mass. A complementary analysis of black bear scats indicated that Pacific herring egg mass was the highest ranked predictor of egg consumption by bears. Pacific herring eggs constituted a substantial yet variable component of the early springtime diet of black bears in Quatsino Sound (frequency of occurrence 0-34%; estimated dietary content 0-63%). Other major dietary items included graminoids (grasses and sedges), Phaeophyta (brown algae), Zosteraceae (seagrasses), and Talitrid amphipods. Conclusion: This research represents the first scientific evidence of a cross-ecosystem interaction between Pacific herring and American black bears. Our findings also expand knowledge of the ecological roles of both species. Combined, evidence of anthropogenic constraints on both black bears and Pacific herring suggests that bear-herring interactions were potentially stronger and more widespread in the past.

To gain a detailed understanding of the dynamically composed TU structures, we have used four strand-specific RNA-seq (ssRNA-seq) datasets collected under two experimental conditions to derive the genomic TU organization of Clostridium thermocellum using a machine-learning approach. Our method accurately predicted the genomic boundaries of individual TUs based on two sets of parameters measuring the RNA-seq expression patterns across the genome: expression-level continuity and variance. A total of 2590 distinct TUs are predicted based on the four RNA-seq datasets. Among the predicted TUs, 44% have multiple genes. We assessed our prediction method on an independent set of RNA-seq data with longer reads. The evaluation confirmed the high quality of the predicted TUs. Functional enrichment analyses on a selected subset of the predicted TUs revealed interesting biology. To demonstrate the generality of the prediction method, we have also applied the method to RNA-seq data collected on Escherichia coli and achieved high prediction accuracies. The TU prediction program named SeqTU is publicly available at https://code.google.com/p/seqtu/. We expect that the predicted TUs can serve as the baseline information for studying transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in C. thermocellum and other bacteria.

However, these machines also have disadvantages, as they respond with complex body dynamics when stimulated. These dynamics exhibit a variety of properties, including nonlinearity, memory, and potentially infinitely many degrees of freedom, which are often difficult to control. Here, we demonstrate that these seemingly undesirable properties can in fact be assets that can be exploited for real-time computation. Using body dynamics generated from a soft silicone arm, we show that they can be employed to emulate desired nonlinear dynamical systems. First, by using benchmark tasks, we demonstrate that the nonlinearity and memory within the body dynamics can increase the computational performance. Second, we characterize our systems computational capability by comparing its task performance with a standard machine learning technique and identify its range of validity and limitation. Our results suggest that soft bodies are not only impressive in their deformability and flexibility but can also be potentially used as computational resources on top and for free.

Goal-directed, habitual and Pavlovian prosocial behavior	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						model-based; model-free; Pavlovian; reinforcement learning; dictator game; prosocial behavior; altruism; warm-glow	EMPATHY-INDUCED ALTRUISM; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SOCIAL DECISION-MAKING; PRISONERS-DILEMMA GAME; OUTCOME-SPECIFIC FORMS; PEOPLE PLAY GAMES; INSTRUMENTAL TRANSFER; DICTATOR GAMES; YOUNG-CHILDREN; PUBLIC-GOODS	Although prosocial behaviors have been widely studied across disciplines, the mechanisms underlying them are not fully understood. Evidence from psychology, biology and economics suggests that prosocial behaviors can be driven by a variety of seemingly opposing factors: altruism or egoism, intuition or deliberation, inborn instincts or learned dispositions, and utility derived from actions or their outcomes. Here we propose a framework inspired by research on reinforcement learning and decision making that links these processes and explains characteristics of prosocial behaviors in different contexts. More specifically, we suggest that prosocial behaviors inherit features of up to three decision-making systems employed to choose between self- and other-regarding acts: a goal directed system that selects actions based on their predicted consequences, a habitual system that selects actions based on their reinforcement history, and a Pavlovian system that emits reflexive responses based on evolutionarily prescribed priors. This framework, initially described in the field of cognitive neuroscience and machine learning, provides insight into the potential neural circuits and computations shaping prosocial behaviors. Furthermore, it identifies specific conditions in which each of these three systems should dominate and promote other- or self- regarding behavior.

Being an object of study for decades, it has lately received an increasing interest from the scientific community. Usually, the proposed solutions have used either a feature-based or a distance-based representation to perform learning and classification tasks. This article presents the results of a comparative experimental study between these two approaches for computing similarity scores using a classification-based method. In particular, we use the Support Vector Machine as a flexible combiner both for a high dimensional feature space and for a family of distance measures, to finally learn similarity scores. The approaches have been tested in a content-based image retrieval context, using three different repositories. We analyze both the influence of the different input data formats and the training size on the performance of the classifier. Then, we found that a low-dimensional, multidistance-based representation can be convenient for small to medium-size training sets, whereas it is detrimental as the training size grows.

A Randomized Algorithm for the Exact Solution of Transductive Support Vector Machines	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								Random sampling is an efficient method for dealing with constrained optimization problems. In computational geometry, this method has been successfully applied, through Clarkson's algorithm (Clarkson1996), to solve a general class of problems called violator spaces. In machine learning, Transductive Support Vector Machines (TSVM) is a learning method used when only a small fraction of labeled data is available, which implies solving a nonconvex optimization problem. Several approximation methods have been proposed to solve it, but they usually find suboptimal solutions. However, a global optimal solution may be obtained by using exact techniques, but at the cost of suffering an exponential time complexity with respect to the number of instances. In this article, an interpretation of TSVM in terms of violator space is given. A randomized method is presented that extends the use of exact methods, thus reducing the time complexity exponentially w.r.t. the number of support vectors of the optimal solution instead of exponentially w.r.t. the number of instances.

Reinforcement learning improves behaviour from evaluative feedback	NATURE			English	Review							PREDICTION; TIME	Reinforcement learning is a branch of machine learning concerned with using experience gained through interacting with the world and evaluative feedback to improve a system's ability to make behavioural decisions. It has been called the artificial intelligence problem in a microcosm because learning algorithms must act autonomously to perform well and achieve their goals. Partly driven by the increasing availability of rich data, recent years have seen exciting advances in the theory and practice of reinforcement learning, including developments in fundamental technical areas such as generalization, planning, exploration and empirical methodology, leading to increasing applicability to real-life problems.

Network Reconstruction Based on Proteomic Data and Prior Knowledge of Protein Connectivity Using Graph Theory	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CELL SIGNALING NETWORKS; TRANSFORMED HEPATOCYTES; REGULATORY NETWORKS; MODELS; PATHWAYS	Modeling of signal transduction pathways is instrumental for understanding cells' function. People have been tackling modeling of signaling pathways in order to accurately represent the signaling events inside cells' biochemical microenvironment in a way meaningful for scientists in a biological field. In this article, we propose a method to interrogate such pathways in order to produce cell-specific signaling models. We integrate available prior knowledge of protein connectivity, in a form of a Prior Knowledge Network (PKN) with phosphoproteomic data to construct predictive models of the protein connectivity of the interrogated cell type. Several computational methodologies focusing on pathways' logic modeling using optimization formulations or machine learning algorithms have been published on this front over the past few years. Here, we introduce a light and fast approach that uses a breadth-first traversal of the graph to identify the shortest pathways and score proteins in the PKN, fitting the dependencies extracted from the experimental design. The pathways are then combined through a heuristic formulation to produce a final topology handling inconsistencies between the PKN and the experimental scenarios. Our results show that the algorithm we developed is efficient and accurate for the construction of medium and large scale signaling networks. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach by interrogating a manually curated interaction graph model of EGF/TNFA stimulation against made up experimental data. To avoid the possibility of erroneous predictions, we performed a cross-validation analysis. Finally, we validate that the introduced approach generates predictive topologies, comparable to the ILP formulation. Overall, an efficient approach based on graph theory is presented herein to interrogate protein-protein interaction networks and to provide meaningful biological insights.

Data Clustering using Memristor Networks	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CIRCUITS; MODEL	Memristors have emerged as a promising candidate for critical applications such as non-volatile memory as well as non-Von Neumann computing architectures based on neuromorphic and machine learning systems. In this study, we demonstrate that memristors can be used to perform principal component analysis (PCA), an important technique for machine learning and data feature learning. The conductance changes of memristors in response to voltage pulses are studied and modeled with an internal state variable to trace the analog behavior of the device. Unsupervised, online learning is achieved in a memristor crossbar using Sanger's learning rule, a derivative of Hebb's rule, to obtain the principal components. The details of weights evolution during training is investigated over learning epochs as a function of training parameters. The effects of device non-uniformity on the PCA network performance are further analyzed. We show that the memristor-based PCA network is capable of linearly separating distinct classes from sensory data with high clarification success of 97.6% even in the presence of large device variations.

A bioinformatic framework for immune repertoire diversity profiling enables detection of immunological status	GENOME MEDICINE			English	Article							T-CELL REPERTOIRE; IMMUNOGLOBULIN HEAVY; RECEPTOR REPERTOIRES; ANTIBODY REPERTOIRE; GENERATION; DEEP; SELECTION; SIGNATURES; DIAGNOSIS; EVENNESS	Background: Lymphocyte receptor repertoires are continually shaped throughout the lifetime of an individual in response to environmental and pathogenic exposure. Thus, they may serve as a fingerprint of an individual's ongoing immunological status (e.g., healthy, infected, vaccinated), with far-reaching implications for immunodiagnostics applications. The advent of high-throughput immune repertoire sequencing now enables the interrogation of immune repertoire diversity in an unprecedented and quantitative manner. However, steadily increasing sequencing depth has revealed that immune repertoires vary greatly among individuals in their composition; correspondingly, it has been reported that there are few shared sequences indicative of immunological status ('public clones'). Disconcertingly, this means that the wealth of information gained from repertoire sequencing remains largely unused for determining the current status of immune responses, thereby hampering the implementation of immune-repertoire-based diagnostics. Methods: Here, we introduce a bioinformatics repertoire-profiling framework that possesses the advantage of capturing the diversity and distribution of entire immune repertoires, as opposed to singular public clones. The framework relies on Hill-based diversity profiles composed of a continuum of single diversity indices, which enable the quantification of the extent of immunological information contained in immune repertoires. Results: We coupled diversity profiles with unsupervised (hierarchical clustering) and supervised (support vector machine and feature selection) machine learning approaches in order to correlate patients' immunological statuses with their B-and T-cell repertoire data. We could predict with high accuracy (greater than or equal to 80 %) a wide range of immunological statuses such as healthy, transplantation recipient, and lymphoid cancer, suggesting as a proof of principle that diversity profiling can recover a large amount of immunodiagnostic fingerprints from immune repertoire data. Our framework is highly scalable as it easily allowed for the analysis of 1000 simulated immune repertoires; this exceeds the size of published immune repertoire datasets by one to two orders of magnitude. Conclusions: Our framework offers the possibility to advance immune-repertoire-based fingerprinting, which may in the future enable a systems immunogenomics approach for vaccine profiling and the accurate and early detection of disease and infection.

The cascaded model is a two-level network in which the outputs of the first level (J(SC), V-OC, and FF) are the inputs of the second level, and the ultimate end-point is the overall PCE of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The model combines quantum chemical methods and machine learning methods, further including quantum chemical calculations, data division, feature selection, regression, and validation steps. To improve the efficiency of the model and reduce the redundancy and noise of the molecular descriptors, six feature selection methods (multiple linear regression, genetic algorithms, mean impact value, forward selection, backward elimination, and +n-m algorithm) are used with the support vector machine. The best established cascaded model predicts the PCE values of DSSCs with a MAE of 0.57 (%), which is about 10% of the mean value PCE (5.62%). The validation parameters according to the OECD principles are R-2(0.75), Q(2)(0.77), and Q(cv)(2) (0.76), which demonstrate the great goodness-of-fit, predictivity, and robustness of the model. Additionally, the applicability domain of the cascaded QSAR model is defined for further application. This study demonstrates that the established cascaded model is able to effectively predict the PCE for organic dye sensitizers with very low cost and relatively high accuracy, providing a useful tool for the design of dye sensitizers with high PCE.

A multi-label approach to target prediction taking ligand promiscuity into account	JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS			English	Article						Multi-label classifications; Ligand promiscuity; Probabilistic classifier	DRUG DISCOVERY; CLASSIFICATION; NETWORKS; PHARMACOLOGY; SIMILARITY; IDENTIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; ALGORITHMS; MACHINES; DESIGN	Background: According to Cobanoglu et al., it is now widely acknowledged that the single target paradigm (one protein/target, one disease, one drug) that has been the dominant premise in drug development in the recent past is untenable. More often than not, a drug-like compound (ligand) can be promiscuous - it can interact with more than one target protein. In recent years, in in silico target prediction methods the promiscuity issue has generally been approached computationally in three main ways: ligand-based methods; target-protein-based methods; and integrative schemes. In this study we confine attention to ligand-based target prediction machine learning approaches, commonly referred to as target-fishing. The target-fishing approaches that are currently ubiquitous in cheminformatics literature can be essentially viewed as single-label multi-classification schemes; these approaches inherently bank on the single target paradigm assumption that a ligand can zero in on one single target. In order to address the ligand promiscuity issue, one might be able to cast target-fishing as a multi-label multi-class classification problem. For illustrative and comparison purposes, single-label and multi-label Naive Bayes classification models (denoted here by SMM and MMM, respectively) for target-fishing were implemented. The models were constructed and tested on 65,587 compounds/ligands and 308 targets retrieved from the ChEMBL17 database. Results: On classifying 3,332 test multi-label (promiscuous) compounds, SMM and MMM performed differently. At the 0.05 significance level, a Wilcoxon signed rank test performed on the paired target predictions yielded by SMM and MMM for the test ligands gave a p-value < 5.1 x 10(-94) and test statistics value of 6.8 x 10(5), in favour of MMM. The two models performed differently when tested on four datasets comprising single-label (non-promiscuous) compounds; McNemar's test yielded chi(2) values of 15.657, 16.500 and 16.405 (with corresponding p-values of 7.594 x 10(-05), 4.865 x 10(-05) and 5.115 x 10(-05)), respectively, for three test sets, in favour of MMM. The models performed similarly on the fourth set. Conclusions: The target prediction results obtained in this study indicate that multi-label multi-class approaches are more apt than the ubiquitous single-label multi-class schemes when it comes to the application of ligand-based classifiers to target-fishing.

Automated innovization is an unsupervised machine learning technique that can automatically extract significant mathematical relationships from Pareto-optimal solution sets. These resulting relationships describe the conditions for Pareto-optimality for the multi-objective problem under consideration and can be used by scientists and practitioners as thumb rules to understand the problem better and to innovate new problem solving techniques; hence the name innovization (innovation through optimization). Higher-level innovization involves performing automated innovization on multiple Pareto-optimal solution sets obtained by varying one or more problem parameters. The automated innovization framework was recently updated using genetic programming. We extend this generalization to perform higher-level automated innovization and demonstrate the methodology on a standard two-bar bi-objective truss design problem. The procedure is then applied to a classic case of inventory management with multi-objective optimization performed at both system and process levels. The applicability of automated innovization to this area should motivate its use in other avenues of operational research. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Individual classifier selection is a key step in the development of multi-classifiers. Several works have shown the benefits of fusing complementary classifiers. Nevertheless, the selection of the base classifiers to be used is still an open question, and different approaches have been proposed in the literature. This work is based on the selection of the appropriate single classifiers by means of an evolutionary algorithm. Different base classifiers, which have been chosen from different classifier families, are used as candidates in order to obtain variability in the classifications given. Experimental results carried out with 20 databases from the UCI Repository show how adequate the proposed approach is; Stacked Generalization multi-classifier has been selected to perform the experimental comparisons.

The need for synthesizing realistic networks has resulted in development of various network models. In this paper, we address the problem of selecting and calibrating the model that best fits a given target network. The existing model fitting approaches mostly suffer from sensitivity to network perturbations, lack of the parameter estimation component, dependency on the size of the networks, and low accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we considered a broad range of network features and employed machine learning techniques such as genetic algorithms, distance metric learning, nearest neighbor classification, and artificial neural networks. Our proposed method, which is named ModelFit, outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines with respect to accuracy and noise tolerance in different network datasets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Computer-aided diagnosis from weak supervision: A benchmarking study	COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS			English	Article						Multiple instance learning; Cancer diagnosis; Diabetic retinopathy screening	CANCER; CLASSIFICATION	Supervised machine learning is a powerful tool frequently used in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) applications. The bottleneck of this technique is its demand for fine grained expert annotations, which are tedious for medical image analysis applications. Furthermore, information is typically localized in diagnostic images, which makes representation of an entire image by a single feature set problematic. The multiple instance learning framework serves as a remedy to these two problems by allowing labels to be provided for groups of observations, called bags, and assuming the group label to be the maximum of the instance labels within the bag. This setup can effectively be applied to CAD by splitting a given diagnostic image into a Cartesian grid, treating each grid element (patch) as an instance by representing it with a feature set, and grouping instances belonging to the same image into a bag. We quantify the power of existing multiple instance learning methods by evaluating their performance on two distinct CAD applications: (i) Barrett's cancer diagnosis and (ii) diabetic retinopathy screening. In the experiments, mi-Graph appears as the best-performing method in bag-level prediction (i.e. diagnosis) for both of these applications that have drastically different visual characteristics. For instance-level prediction (i.e. disease localization), mi-SVM ranks as the most accurate method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This way, feature selection has become an important issue on these researching areas. Nevertheless, as in past years the number of patterns and, more specifically, the number of features to be selected have grown very fast, parallel processing constitutes an important tool to reach efficient approaches that make possible to tackle complex problems within reasonable computing times. In this paper we propose parallel multi-objective optimization approaches to cope with high-dimensional feature selection problems. Several parallel multi-objective evolutionary alternatives are proposed, and experimentally evaluated by using some synthetic and BCI (Brain Computer Interface) benchmarks. The experimental results show that the cooperation of parallel evolving subpopulations provides improvements in the solution quality and computing time speedups depending on the parallel alternative and data profile.

They have very nice theoretical properties and have proven to be efficient in many real life applications but the design of SVM training algorithms often gives rise to challenging optimization issues. We propose here to review the basics of Support Vector Machine learning from a multi-agent optimization perspective. Multi-agents systems break down complex optimization problems into elementary "oracle" tasks and perform a collaborative solving process resulting in a self-organized solution of the complex problems. We show how the SVM training problem can also be "tackled" from this point of view and provide several perspectives for binary classification, hyperparameters selection, multiclass learning as well as unsupervised learning. This conceptual work is illustrated through simple examples in order to convey the ideas and understand the behavior of agent cooperation.

Despite a myriad of research work in the last two decades, optimization of traffic signals in network level is still an open research problem. This paper for the first time employs advanced cuckoo search optimization algorithm for optimally tuning parameters of intelligent controllers. Neural Network (NN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) are two intelligent controllers implemented in this study. For the sake of comparison, we also implement Q-learning and fixed-time controllers as benchmarks. Comprehensive simulation scenarios are designed and executed for a traffic network composed of nine four-way intersections. Obtained results for a few scenarios demonstrate the optimality of trained intelligent controllers using the cuckoo search method. The average performance of NN, ANFIS, and Q-learning controllers against the fixed-time controller are 44%, 39%, and 35%, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Buildings affected by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami were the focus in developing this method. In synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, buildings exhibit high backscattering caused by double-bounce reflection and layover. However, if the buildings are completely washed away or structurally destroyed by the tsunami, then this high backscattering might be reduced, and the post-event SAR data will show a lower sigma nought value than the pre-event SAR data. To exploit these relationships, a rapid method for classifying tsunami-induced building damage into multiple classes was developed by analyzing the statistical relationship between the change ratios in areas with high backscattering and in areas with building damage. The method was developed for the affected city of Sendai, Japan, based on the decision tree application of a machine learning algorithm. The results provided an overall accuracy of 67.4% and a kappa statistic of 0.47. To validate its transferability, the method was applied to the town of Watari, and an overall accuracy of 58.7% and a kappa statistic of 0.38 were obtained.

This has led to the emergence of multiple forensic applications based on the use of ENF signals. Examples of such applications include validating the time-of-recording of an ENF-containing multimedia signal or estimating its recording location based on concurrent reference signals from power grids. In this paper, we examine a novel ENF-based application that infers the power grid in which the ENF-containing multimedia signal was recorded without relying on the availability of concurrent power references. We investigate features based on the statistical differences in ENF variations between different power grids to serve as signatures for the region-of-recording of the media signal. We use these features in a multiclass machine learning implementation that is able to identify the grid-of-recording of a signal with high accuracy. In addition, we explore techniques for building multiconditional learning systems that can adapt to changes in the noise environment between the training and testing data.

Results from this study on a small sample of aviation safety narratives demonstrates an unsupervised categorization accuracy of 44% for primary-cause within the existing taxonomy. If provided with a large sample set, the indication is that a significant increase in accuracy is possible along with the possibility of recoding between data sets.

However, cautious selection of sensory features is crucial for attaining high recognition performance. In the machine-learning community, deep learning approaches have recently attracted increasing attention because deep neural networks can effectively extract robust latent features that enable various recognition algorithms to demonstrate revolutionary generalization capabilities under diverse application conditions. This study introduces a connectionist-hidden Markov model (HMM) system for noise-robust AVSR. First, a deep denoising autoencoder is utilized for acquiring noise-robust audio features. By preparing the training data for the network with pairs of consecutive multiple steps of deteriorated audio features and the corresponding clean features, the network is trained to output denoised audio features from the corresponding features deteriorated by noise. Second, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized to extract visual features from raw mouth area images. By preparing the training data for the CNN as pairs of raw images and the corresponding phoneme label outputs, the network is trained to predict phoneme labels from the corresponding mouth area input images. Finally, a multi-stream HMM (MSHMM) is applied for integrating the acquired audio and visual HMMs independently trained with the respective features. By comparing the cases when normal and denoised mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are utilized as audio features to the HMM, our unimodal isolated word recognition results demonstrate that approximately 65 % word recognition rate gain is attained with denoised MFCCs under 10 dB signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) for the audio signal input. Moreover, our multimodal isolated word recognition results utilizing MSHMM with denoised MFCCs and acquired visual features demonstrate that an additional word recognition rate gain is attained for the SNR conditions below 10 dB.

We review three different methods for making prediction intervals and the statistics used for their evaluation. How the prediction intervals look like, how different methods behave and how the prediction intervals can be utilized for the graphical evaluation of models is illustrated with the help of simple datasets. Afterwards we propose a combined method for making prediction intervals and explore its performance with two voting schemes for combining predictions of a diverse ensemble of models. All methods are tested on a large set of datasets on which we evaluate individual methods and aggregated variants for their abilities of selecting the best predictions. The analysis of correlations between the root mean squared error and our evaluation statistic show that both stability and reliability of the results increase as the techniques get more elaborate. We confirm that the methodology is suitable for the graphical comparison of individual models and is a viable way of discriminating among model candidates.

To accomplish the self-organization, we introduce an automatic decision algorithm along with solutions for merging and splitting of rules as well as the parameters they operate with, such as our novel incremental distance measurement and competitive recursive least squares. We emphasize the learning algorithm's having an impact for initial as well as long-term learning capabilities. We also emphasize the challenge for online learning, where examples are incoming in real-time and thus are unknown before they can be learned. Therefore, we solve parameter fixing by introducing a parameter free method. We show the performance of our method on various machine learning benchmarks as a highly accurate and low time-consuming method capable of adapting to different databases without the need for fixing any of its parameters according to the database.

In this paper, we presented a fuzzy total margin based support vector machine (FTM-SVM) method to handle the class imbalance learning (CIL) problem in the presence of outliers and noise. The proposed method incorporates total margin algorithm, different cost functions and the proper approach of fuzzification of the penalty into FTM-SVM and formulates them in nonlinear case. We considered an excellent type of fuzzy membership functions to assign fuzzy membership values and got six FTM-SVM settings. We evaluated the proposed FTM-SVM method on two artificial data sets and 16 real-world imbalanced data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed FTM-SVM method has higher G_Mean and F_Measure values than some existing CIL methods. Based on the overall results, we can conclude that the proposed FTM-SVM method is effective for CIL problem, especially in the presence of outliers and noise in data sets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Some studies have done in AIS through generating ellipsoidal detectors but they are restricted in their detector generating scheme - Genetic Algorithms (GA). In this study, an AIS was developed with ellipsoidal recognition regions by inspiring from the clonal selection principle and an effective search procedure for ellipsoidal regions was applied. Performance evaluation tests were conducted as well as application results on some real-world classification problems taken from UCI machine learning repository were obtained. Comparison with GA was also done in some of these problems. Very effective and comparatively good classification ratios were recorded. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The objective of such Websites is to provide time limited discounts on goods and services in the hope of enticing more customers to purchase such goods or services. The success of daily deal Websites has given rise to meta-level daily deal aggregator services that collect daily deal information from across the Web. Due to some of the unique characteristics of daily deal Websites such as high update frequency, time sensitivity, and lack of coherent information representation, many deal aggregators rely on human intervention to identify and extract deal information. In this paper, we propose an approach where daily deal information is identified, classified and properly segmented and localized. Our approach is based on a semi-supervised method that uses sentence-level features of daily deal information on a given Web page. Our work offers (i) a set of computationally inexpensive discriminative features that are able to effectively distinguishWeb pages that contain daily deal information; (ii) the construction and systematic evaluation of machine learning techniques based on these features to automatically classify daily deal Web pages; and (iii) the development of an accurate segmentation algorithm that is able to localize and extract individual deals from within a complex Web page. We have extensively evaluated our approach from different perspectives, the results of which show notable performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This problem is often solved by applying evolutionary algorithms in order to decrease the dimensional number of features involved. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid system to improve classification accuracy with an appropriate feature subset in binary problems based on an improved gravitational search algorithm. This algorithm makes the best of ergodicity of piecewise linear chaotic map to explore the global search and utilizes the sequential quadratic programming to accelerate the local search. We evaluate the proposed hybrid system on several UCI machine learning benchmark examples, comparing our approaches with feature selection techniques and obtained better predictions with consistently fewer relevant features. Furthermore, the improved gravitational search algorithm is tested on 23 nonlinear benchmark functions and compared with 5 other heuristic algorithms. The obtained results confirm the high performance of the improved gravitational search algorithm in solving function optimization problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, L; Fang, B; Shang, ZW; Tang, YY				Chen, Lin; Fang, Bin; Shang, Zhaowei; Tang, Yuanyan			Negative samples reduction in cross-company software defects prediction	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Cross-company defects prediction; Software fault prediction; Transfer learning	STATIC CODE ATTRIBUTES; FAULT PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; MODELS	Context: Software defect prediction has been widely studied based on various machine-learning algorithms. Previous studies usually focus on within-company defects prediction (WCDP), but lack of training data in the early stages of software testing limits the efficiency of WCDP in practice. Thus, recent research has largely examined the cross-company defects prediction (CCDP) as an alternative solution. Objective: However, the gap of different distributions between cross-company (CC) data and within-company (WC) data usually makes it difficult to build a high-quality CCDP model. In this paper, a novel algorithm named Double Transfer Boosting (DTB) is introduced to narrow this gap and improve the performance of CCDP by reducing negative samples in CC data. Method: The proposed DTB model integrates two levels of data transfer: first, the data gravitation method reshapes the whole distribution of CC data to fit WC data. Second, the transfer boosting method employs a small ratio of labeled WC data to eliminate negative instances in CC data. Results: The empirical evaluation was conducted based on 15 publicly available datasets. CCDP experiment results indicated that the proposed model achieved better overall performance than compared CCDP models. DTB was also compared to WCDP in two different situations. Statistical analysis suggested that DTB performed significantly better than WCDP models trained by limited samples and produced comparable results to WCDP with sufficient training data. Conclusions: DTB reforms the distribution of CC data from different levels to improve the performance of CCDP, and experimental results and analysis demonstrate that it could be an effective model for early software defects detection.

Modern techniques for producing extremely bright and coherent X-ray lasers allow a beam of streaming particles to be intercepted and hit by an ultrashort high-energy X-ray beam. Through machine learning methods the data thus collected can be transformed into a three-dimensional volumetric intensity map of the particle itself. The computational complexity associated with this problem is very high such that clusters of data parallel accelerators are required. We have implemented a distributed and highly efficient algorithm for the inversion of large collections of diffraction patterns targeting clusters of hundreds of GPUs. With the expected enormous amount of diffraction data to be produced in the foreseeable future, this is the required scale to approach real-time processing of data at the beam site. Using both real and synthetic data we look at the scaling properties of the application and discuss the overall computational viability of this exciting and novel imaging technique.

We present a simple and effective method to generate a classifier of face images, by training a linear classification algorithm on a massive dataset entirely assembled and labelled by automated means. In doing so, we perform the largest experiment on face gender recognition so far published, reporting the highest performance yet. Four million images and more than 60,000 features are used to train online classifiers. By using an ensemble of linear classifiers, we achieve an accuracy of 96.86% on the most challenging public database, labelled faces in the wild (LFW), 2.05% higher than the previous best result on the same dataset (Shan, 2012). This result is relevant both for the machine learning community, addressing the role of large datasets, and the computer vision community, providing a way to make high quality face gender classifiers. Furthermore, we propose a general way to generate and exploit massive data without human annotation. Finally, we demonstrate a simple and effective adaptation of the Pegasos that makes it more robust. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper we present models for categorizing a video into one of a number of predefined interactions or for detecting these interactions in a long video sequence. The models represent the interaction by a set of key temporal moments and the spatial structures they entail. For instance: two people approaching each other, then extending their hands before engaging in a "handshaking" interaction. Learning the model parameters requires only weak supervision in the form of an overall label for the interaction. Experimental results on the UT-Interaction and VIRAT datasets verify the efficacy of these structured models for human interactions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, many real-world applications involve samples that are not described as feature vectors, but as (dis) similarity data. Converting vectorial data into (dis) similarity data is more easily performed than converting (dis) similarity data into vectorial data. This study proposes a stochastic iterative distance transformation model for similarity-based learning. The proposed model can be used to identify a clear class boundary in data by modifying the (dis) similarities between examples. The experimental results indicate that the performance of the proposed method is comparable with those of various vector-based and proximity-based learning algorithms.

J	Miller, LD; Soh, LK				Miller, L. Dee; Soh, Leen-Kiat			Cluster-Based Boosting	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; machine learning; clustering algorithms	RECOGNITION	Boosting is an iterative process that improves the predictive accuracy for supervised (machine) learning algorithms. Boosting operates by learning multiple functions with subsequent functions focusing on incorrect instances where the previous functions predicted the wrong label. Despite considerable success, boosting still has difficulty on data sets with certain types of problematic training data (e.g., label noise) and when complex functions overfit the training data. We propose a novel cluster-based boosting (CBB) approach to address limitations in boosting for supervised learning systems. Our CBB approach partitions the training data into clusters containing highly similar member data and integrates these clusters directly into the boosting process. CBB boosts selectively (using a high learning rate, low learning rate, or not boosting) on each cluster based on both the additional structure provided by the cluster and previous function accuracy on the member data. Selective boosting allows CBB to improve predictive accuracy on problematic training data. In addition, boosting separately on clusters reduces function complexity to mitigate overfitting. We provide comprehensive experimental results on 20 UCI benchmark data sets with three different kinds of supervised learning systems. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CBB approach compared to a popular boosting algorithm, an algorithm that uses clusters to improve boosting, and two algorithms that use selective boosting without clustering.

This paper introduces a novel framework for nonlinear metric learning, called kernel density metric learning (KDML), which is easy to use and provides nonlinear, probability-based distance measures. KDML constructs a direct nonlinear mapping from the original input space into a feature space based on kernel density estimation. The nonlinear mapping in KDML embodies established distance measures between probability density functions, and leads to accurate classification on datasets for which existing linear metric learning methods would fail. It addresses the severe challenge to distance-based classifiers when features are from heterogeneous domains and, as a result, the Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance between original feature vectors is not meaningful. We also propose two ways to determine the kernel bandwidths, including an adaptive local scaling approach and an integrated optimization algorithm that learns the Mahalanobis matrix and kernel bandwidths together. KDML is a general framework that can be combined with any existing metric learning algorithm. As concrete examples, we combine KDML with two leading metric learning algorithms, large margin nearest neighbors (LMNN) and neighborhood component analysis (NCA). KDML can naturally handle not only numerical features, but also categorical ones, which is rarely found in previous metric learning algorithms. Extensive experimental results on various datasets show that KDML significantly improves existing metric learning algorithms in terms of classification accuracy.

A fundamental assumption for these approaches is that the documents in the collection are all about one topic. However, in reality users' interests can be diverse and the documents in the collection often involve multiple topics. Topic modelling, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), was proposed to generate statistical models to represent multiple topics in a collection of documents, and this has been widely utilized in the fields of machine learning and information retrieval, etc. But its effectiveness in information filtering has not been so well explored. Patterns are always thought to be more discriminative than single terms for describing documents. However, the enormous amount of discovered patterns hinder them from being effectively and efficiently used in real applications, therefore, selection of the most discriminative and representative patterns from the huge amount of discovered patterns becomes crucial. To deal with the above mentioned limitations and problems, in this paper, a novel information filtering model, Maximum matched Pattern-based Topic Model (MPBTM), is proposed. The main distinctive features of the proposed model include: (1) user information needs are generated in terms of multiple topics; (2) each topic is represented by patterns; (3) patterns are generated from topic models and are organized in terms of their statistical and taxonomic features; and (4) the most discriminative and representative patterns, called Maximum Matched Patterns, are proposed to estimate the document relevance to the user's information needs in order to filter out irrelevant documents. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model by using the TREC data collection Reuters Corpus Volume 1. The results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art term-based models and pattern-based models.

The molecular level understanding of these interactions helps us to decipher the mechanism of regulation. Conventionally these interactions were identified using small scale experimental techniques and high throughput technologies. But these approaches being time consuming and expensive, arouse the need of a computational approach for the prediction of interactions. To this end, a machine learning approach for predicting and classifying DNA-binding proteins has been used. Weka and LibSVM platform have been used to develop an effective classifying model. The different classifiers were applied on the attributes generated from protein sequence and tried to develop an efficient model for classifying a protein as DNA-interacting or DNA-non-interacting. Among several classifying algorithms applied to generate models, best performance was achieved using LibSVM with 87.83 % accuracy.

Upon the lack of information for predicting casualties in the earlier stage of earthquake and due to the features of predictors as small sample and nonlinearity, this paper applies improved support vector machine (SVM) to the construction of earthquake casualty prediction model and proposes robust wavelet (RW) v-SVM earthquake casualty prediction model. Considering the disadvantage that a single loss function in SVM is not able to suppress the large amplitudes and singular points of earthquake casualty predictors, a robust loss function that allows for segmented suppression is designed by combining with Gaussian loss function, Laplace loss function and rho-insensitive loss function, to handle different data of casualty predictors. In order to minimize the nonlinear classification error of SVM in higher-dimensional space, the independent variables in both the Morlet and Mexican parent wavelet kernel functions are replaced with a wavelet kernel function satisfying Mercer translation invariant kernel; thus, two wavelet kernel functions are obtained for machine learning, to mitigate the limitation of normal kernel function as reducing the errors. The numerical example shows that RW v-SVM model features rapid learning, high-precision prediction and advanced stability when it is used to predict earthquake casualties, which provides an effective method to solve this problem.

Many ML methods and evaluation techniques relate to the first two. Nevertheless, there are many applications where having an accurate probability estimate is of great importance. Deriving accurate probabilities from the output of a ML method is therefore an active area of research, resulting in several methods to turn a ranking into class probability estimates. In this manuscript we present a method, splined empirical probabilities, based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) to complement existing algorithms such as isotonic regression. Unlike most other methods it works with a cumulative quantity, the ROC curve, and as such can be tagged onto an ROC analysis with minor effort. On a diverse set of measures of the quality of probability estimates (Hosmer-Lemeshow, Kullback-Leibler divergence, differences in the cumulative distribution function) using simulated and real health care data, our approach compares favourably with the standard calibration method, the pool adjacent violators algorithm used to perform isotonic regression.

Multimodal Analysis of Functional and Structural Disconnection in Alzheimer's Disease Using Multiple Kernel SVM	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging; magnetic resonance imaging; diffusion tensor imaging; multiple kernel support vector machine	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; WHITE-MATTER DEGENERATION; FIBER TRACT INTEGRITY; CAUDATE-NUCLEUS; CLINICAL-APPLICATIONS; AUTOMATED DETECTION; BRAIN ATROPHY; FOLLOW-UP; MRI	Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients exhibit alterations in the functional connectivity between spatially segregated brain regions which may be related to both local gray matter (GM) atrophy as well as a decline in the fiber integrity of the underlying white matter tracts. Machine learning algorithms are able to automatically detect the patterns of the disease in image data, and therefore, constitute a suitable basis for automated image diagnostic systems. The question of which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities are most useful in a clinical context is as yet unresolved. We examined multimodal MRI data acquired from 28 subjects with clinically probable AD and 25 healthy controls. Specifically, we used fiber tract integrity as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), GM volume derived from structural MRI, and the graph-theoretical measures local clustering coefficient' and shortest path length' derived from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to evaluate the utility of the three imaging methods in automated multimodal image diagnostics, to assess their individual performance, and the level of concordance between them. We ran the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm and validated the results using leave-one-out cross-validation. For the single imaging modalities, we obtained an area under the curve (AUC) of 80% for rs-fMRI, 87% for DTI, and 86% for GM volume. When it came to the multimodal SVM, we obtained an AUC of 82% using all three modalities, and 89% using only DTI measures and GM volume. Combined multimodal imaging data did not significantly improve classification accuracy compared to the best single measures alone. Hum Brain Mapp 36:2118-2131, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We present the first phase of a system with the potential to attribute energy-related events to an individual occupant of a space and provide occupant-specific energy usage feedback in an uninstrumented space (e.g., home or office). This initial phase focuses on collecting the electromagnetic field (EMF) radiated by several common appliances to determine a unique signature for each appliance. It also implements a machine learning algorithm to classify appliances from an incoming EMF data file. The proposed approach has been prototyped with hardware realization. The results obtained on tested appliances indicate the EMF sensor's ability and potential to develop a system for providing occupant-specific energy feedback.

J	Wu, H; Miao, ZJ; Chen, JY; Yang, J; Gao, X				Wu, Hao; Miao, Zhenjiang; Chen, Jingyue; Yang, Jie; Gao, Xing			Recognition improvement through the optimisation of learning instances	IET COMPUTER VISION			English	Article							IMAGE RETRIEVAL; CLASSIFICATION; DISTANCE; FEATURES; SVM	Image recognition based on machine learning has been widely utilised in the computer vision field. In the image recognition process, quite a few positive and negative instances are needed for effective machine learning. However, some invalid instances selected from the instance candidates, particularly for negative instances, will result in reduced image recognition accuracy and wasted resources. When making the instance selections for machine learning, if a large number of negative instances are selected that exhibit a semantic distance too close to the positive instances, the recognition accuracy will be considerably reduced. The selection of valid negative instances from the instance candidates has become a new challenge in the field of computer vision. In this paper a new method containing several different algorithms is presented, that more effectively selects valid negative instances. In this innovative process, a Wordnet subtree, semantic distance based on feature descriptors and an improved K-nearest neighbour model were all utilised. Experiments were implemented using a large database to determine the effectiveness of this method. The results have demonstrated that this method can significantly improve the recognition results.

There is very limited literature exploring the electrocardiogram changes prior to I-HCA. The purpose of the study was to determine demographics and electrocardiographic predictors prior to I-HCA. A retrospective study was conducted among 39 cardiovascular subjects who had cardiopulmonary resuscitation from I-HCA with initial rhythms of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and asystole. Demographics including medical history, ejection fraction, laboratory values, and medications were examined. Electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters from telemetry were studied to identify changes in heart rate, QRS duration and morphology, and time of occurrence and location of ST segment changes prior to I-HCA. Increased age was significantly associated with failure to survive to discharge (p < 0.05). Significant change was observed in heart rate including a downtrend of heart rate within 15 min prior to I-HCA (p < 0.05). There was a significant difference in heart rate and QRS duration during the last hour prior to I-HCA compared to the previous hours (p < 0.05). Inferior ECG leads showed the most significant changes in QRS morphology and ST segments prior to I-HCA (p < 0.05). Subjects with an initial rhythm of asystole demonstrated significantly greater ECG changes including QRS morphology and ST segment changes compared to the subjects with initial rhythms of PEA (p < 0.05). Diagnostic ECG trends can be identified prior to I-HCA due to PEA and asystole and can be further utilized for training a predictive machine learning model for I-HCA.

In this paper, the scaling cut criterion-based supervised dimension reduction methods for data analysis are proposed. The scaling cut criterion can eliminate the limit of the hypothesis that data distribution of each class is homoscedastic Gaussian. To obtain a more reasonable mapping matrix and reduce the computational complexity, local scaling cut criterion-based dimension reduction is raised, which utilized the localization strategy of the input data. The localized -nearest neighbor graph is introduced , which relaxes the within-class variance and enlarges the between-class margin. Moreover, by kernelizing the scaling cut criterion and local scaling cut criterion, both methods are extended to efficiently model the nonlinear variability of the data. Furthermore, the optimal dimension scaling cut criterion is proposed, which can automatically select the optimal dimension for the dimension reduction methods. The approaches have been tested on several datasets, and the results have shown a better and efficient performance compared with other linear and nonlinear dimension reduction techniques.

Multibody dynamic systems as Bayesian networks: Applications to robust state estimation of mechanisms	MULTIBODY SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						State observers; EKF; Particle filter; Uncertainty; Rigid multibody systems; Virtual sensors	PARALLEL O(LOG(N)) CALCULATION; ARTICULATED-BODY ALGORITHM; MODELS; FORMULATION; FILTERS	This article addresses the problem of robustly estimating the dynamic state of a mechanism from a set of noisy sensor measurements. We start with a rigorous treatment of the problem from the perspective of graphical models, a popular formalism in the fields of statistical inference and machine learning. The modeling power of such a formalism is demonstrated by showing how the sequential estimation of a mechanism state with an extended Kalman filter (EKF), often used in previous works, becomes just one of the possible solutions. As an interesting alternative, we derive the formulation of a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) filter, also known as a particle filter (PF), suitable for online tracking the state of a rigid mechanism. We validate our ideas with both simulated and real datasets. Moreover, we prove the usefulness of the particle filtering solution for real-work applications due to its unmatched capability of automatically inferring the initial states of the mechanism along with its "assembly configuration" or "branch" if several ones are possible, a feature not matched by any previously proposed state observer in the multibody literature.

In recent years, remarkable results have been achieved in the early detection of weeds, plant diseases and insect pests in crops. These achievements are related both to the development of non-invasive, high resolution optical sensors and data analysis methods that are able to cope with the resolution, size and complexity of the signals from these sensors. Several methods of machine learning have been utilized for precision agriculture such as support vector machines and neural networks for classification (supervised learning); k-means and self-organizing maps for clustering (unsupervised learning). These methods are able to calculate both linear and non-linear models, require few statistical assumptions and adapt flexibly to a wide range of data characteristics. Successful applications include the early detection of plant diseases based on spectral features and weed detection based on shape descriptors with supervised or unsupervised learning methods. This review gives a short introduction into machine learning, analyses its potential for precision crop protection and provides an overview of instructive examples from different fields of precision agriculture.

Biometric watermarks based on face recognition methods for authentication of digital images	SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS			English	Article						watermarking technique; biometrics; face recognition; principal component analysis; neural networks (NN)	SECURITY	Because making digital images secure runs into the substantial challenge of owner authentication, many security schemes based on cryptography, steganography and watermarking technology include biometric recognition methods. To follow on these studies, this paper describes a combination of facial images with watermarking technology to automatically authenticate digital images owners/users. In the proposed methodology, biometric face recognition methods such as principal component analysis and eigenfeature regularization and extraction produce vectorial representations of facial images. These vectors are used as copyright watermarks, in a few common watermarking schemes, and are tested for identification purposes after they are extracted. Initially, watermarking algorithms are studied with some arbitrary cover image, and also the most robust algorithm is tested for different cover images of particular subjects. The strength of this paper is finding relationships between the original and extracted biometric data using neural networks instead of the most common, simple measures such as correlation coefficients or distance metrics. The NN subject identification is performed directly, as there is no need to reconstruct facial images after the watermarks are extracted, compute templates for particular subjects, or seek a suitable distance metric. What is more, the presented study includes a performance comparison of two machine learning methods, frequently used for face recognition, and of a few popular watermarking algorithms. Very promising identification results were obtained in many considered experiments, even those involving attacks on watermarked images. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Specifically, we propose an approach, coined as multiobjective defect predictor (MODEP), based on multiobjective forms of machine learning techniqueslogistic regression and decision trees specificallytrained using a genetic algorithm. The multiobjective approach allows software engineers to choose predictors achieving a specific compromise between the number of likely defect-prone classes or the number of defects that the analysis would likely discover (effectiveness), and lines of code to be analysed/tested (which can be considered as a proxy of the cost of code inspection). Results of an empirical evaluation on 10 datasets from the PROMISE repository indicate the quantitative superiority of MODEP with respect to single-objective predictors, and with respect to trivial baseline ranking classes by size in ascending or descending order. Also, MODEP outperforms an alternative approach for cross-project prediction, based on local prediction upon clusters of similar classes. Copyright (c) 2015John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In constructing a robust solution , we control the risk arising from violations of the constraints. This risk is measured by set-valued risk measures, which extend the usual univariate coherent distortion (=spectral) risk measures to the multivariate case. To obtain a robust solution in variables, the linear goal function is optimized under the restrictions holding uniformly for all parameters in a -variate uncertainty set. This set is built from uncertainty sets of the single constraints, each of which is a weighted-mean trimmed region in and can be efficiently calculated. Furthermore, a possible substitution of violations between different constraints is investigated by means of the admissable set of the multivariate risk measure. In the case of no substitution, we give an exact geometric algorithm, which possesses a worst-case polynomial complexity. We extend the algorithm to the general substitutability case, that is, to robust polyhedral optimization. The consistency of the approach is shown for generally distributed parameters. Finally, an application of the model to supervised machine learning is discussed.

Feature selection is usually a critical preprocessing step for many machine-learning applications such as clustering and classification. In this paper, we focus on feature selection for supervised classification which targets at finding features that can best predict class labels. Traditional greedy search algorithms incrementally find features based on the relevance of candidate features and the class label. However, this may lead to suboptimal results when there are redundant features that may interfere with the selection. To solve this problem, we propose a subset selection algorithm that considers both the selected and remaining features' relevances with the label. The intuition is that features, which do not have better alternatives from the feature set, should be selected first. We formulate the selection problem as maximizing the dependency margin which is measured by the difference between the selected feature set performance and the remaining feature set performance. Extensive experiments on various data sets show the superiority of the proposed approach against traditional algorithms.

J	Lukac, M; Kameyama, M				Lukac, Martin; Kameyama, Michitaka			An algorithm selection based platform for image understanding using high-level symbolic feedback and machine learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Image processing; Contour extraction; Algorithm selection; Bayesian networks	OBJECT RECOGNITION; SEGMENTATION; VISION; MODELS; SCENE	Natural image processing and understanding encompasses hundreds of different algorithms. Each algorithm generates best results for a particular set of input features and configurations of the objects/regions in the input image (environment). To obtain the best possible result of processing in a reliable manner, we propose an algorithm selection approach that selects the best algorithm for a each input image. The proposed algorithm selection starts by first selecting an algorithm using low level features such as color intensity, histograms, spectral coefficients or so and a user given context if available. The resulting high-level image description is analyzed for logical inconsistencies (contradictions) and image regions that must be processed using a different algorithm are selected. The high-level description and the optional user-given context are used by a Bayesian Network to estimate the cause of the error in the processing. The same Bayesian Network also generates new candidate algorithm for each region containing the contradiction in an iterative manner. This iterative selection stops when the high-level inconsistencies are all resolved or no more different algorithms can be selected. We also show that when inconsistencies can be detected, our framework is able to improve high-level description when compared with single algorithms. In order for such complex and iterative processing being computationally tractable we also introduce a hardware platform based on reconfigurable VLSI that is well suited as the platform of the proposed approach. We show that the algorithm selected approach is ideally suited for either a hybrid type VLSI processor or for a Logic-In-Memory processing platform.

Cost-sensitive feature selection over the past 10 years has seen increasingly rapid advances. Recently, a fast randomized algorithm was designed for this problem. Unfortunately, the performance of algorithms is heavily dependent on the size of datasets. In this paper, we propose an optimal randomized algorithm which adopts the restart strategy in the fast randomized algorithm for minimal test cost feature selection. The restart strategy can effectively address this limitation which depends on the size of datasets. There are two major stages in our algorithm: the addition stage and the deletion stage. In the addition stage, we obtain a subset to represent the original attributes. In this stage, the randomized mechanism helps us to select a subset rapidly. In the deletion stage, we remove redundant attributes by using the restart strategy to further improve the efficiency. Compared with the fast randomized algorithm, the effective of our algorithm increases sharply in the same runtime. Meanwhile, our algorithm reduces about a quarter of the runtime under the same number of experiments.

A recurrent neural network is trained to transcribe undiacritized Arabic text with fully diacritized sentences. We use a deep bidirectional long short-term memory network that builds high-level linguistic abstractions of text and exploits long-range context in both input directions. This approach differs from previous approaches in that no lexical, morphological, or syntactical analysis is performed on the data before being processed by the net. Nonetheless, when the network is post-processed with our error correction techniques, it achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding an average diacritic and word error rates of 2.09 and 5.82 %, respectively, on samples from 11 books. For the LDC ATB3 benchmark, this approach reduces the diacritic error rate by 25 %, the word error rate by 20 %, and the last-letter diacritization error rate by 33 % over the best published results.

Results from the new approach are compared with existing approaches. Two field datasets from the literature are used in this study. Support vector machine (SVM), which is a machine-learning algorithm, is used to increase the pool of field data samples. For a comprehensive understanding of bridge-pier-scour modeling, a model evaluation function is suggested using an orthogonal projection method on a model performance plot. A fast nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is evaluated on the model performance objective functions to search for Pareto optimal fronts. The proposed formulation is compared with two selected empirical models [Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 18 (HEC-18) and Froehlich equation] and a recently developed data-driven model (gene expression programming model). Results show that the proposed model improves the estimation of critical scour depth compared with the other models.

This fact has awoken research interest in the extraction of knowledge from Twitter. This paper aims to fill the gap of the lack of resources for Twitter sentiment analysis in Spanish by performing a study of different features and machine learning algorithms for classifying the polarity of Twitter posts. The result is a new corpus of Spanish tweets called COST, and we have carried out a wide-ranging experiment in which different machine learning algorithms have been used. Furthermore, we have tested the influence of using different weighting schemes for unigrams, the influence of eliminating stop-words and the application of a stemmer process.

Methods and resultsAn automated technique for nuclear atypia score (NAS) calculation is proposed. The proposed technique uses sophisticated digital image analysis and machine-learning methods to measure the NAS for haematoxylin and eosin stained images. The proposed technique first segments all nuclei regions. A set of morphology and texture features is extracted from presegmented nuclei regions. The histogram of each feature is then calculated to characterize the statistical information of the nuclei. Finally, a support vector machine classifier is applied to classify a high-power field image into different nuclear atypia classes. A set of 1188 digital images was analysed in the experiment. We successfully differentiated the high-power field image with NAS1 versus non-NAS1, NAS2 versus non-NAS2 and NAS3 versus non-NAS3, with area under receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.90, 0.86 and 0.87, respectively. In three classes evaluation, the average classification accuracy was 78.79%. We found that texture-based feature provides best performance for the classification. ConclusionThe automated technique is able to quantify statistical features that may be difficult to be measured by human and demonstrates the future potentials of automated image analysis technique in histopathology analysis. Lay description The aim of this study is to develop a novel computer-aided framework to study nuclear atypia classification in high-power field haematoxylin and eosin stained images. Our study offered a novel technique to automatically analyse the nuclei atypia degree in digital image. The automated technique proposed to utilize high-lever statistical information that may be difficult to be measured by human and is able to provide good nuclear atypia classification performance. It showed great potential to be used as an adjunct in assisting diagnosis by pathologists in the future.

An effective multiobjective approach for hard partitional clustering	MEMETIC COMPUTING			English	Article						Data clustering; Multiobjective optimization; Evolutionary and swarm intelligence; Mutiobjective particle swarm optimization	EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; OPTIMIZATION	Clustering is an unsupervised classification method in the field of data mining. Many population based evolutionary and swarm intelligence optimization methods are proposed to optimize clustering solutions globally based on a single selected objective function which lead to produce a single best solution. In this sense, optimized solution is biased towards a single objective, hence it is not equally well to the data set having clusters of different geometrical properties. Thus, clustering having multiple objectives should be naturally optimized through multiobjective optimization methods for capturing different properties of the data set. To achieve this clustering goal, many multiobjective population based optimization methods, e.g., multiobjective genetic algorithm, mutiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), are proposed to obtain diverse tradeoff solutions in the pareto-front. As single directional diversity mechanism in particle swarm optimization converges prematurely to local optima, this paper presents a two-stage diversity mechanism in MOPSO to improve its exploratory capabilities by incorporating crossover operator of the genetic algorithm. External archive is used to store non-dominated solutions, which is further utilized to find one best solution having highest F-measure value at the end of the run. Two conceptually orthogonal internal measures SSE and connectedness are used to estimate the clustering quality. Results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method over its competitors MOPSO, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, and multiobjective artificial bee colony on seven real data sets from UCI machine learning repository.

They boast a robustness that has spearheaded their application in many practical classification problems, especially when there is a significant diversity among the ensemble members. Actually, they replace traditional machine learning techniques in many applications and special attention has been devoted to them as a mean to improve the prediction accuracy for problems of high complexity. Several combination rules have been investigated in this context. However, it is claimed that no rule is always better than others for designing an optimal decision. The present study evaluates the performance of two different ensemble methods for protein secondary structure prediction. We focus on weighted opinions pooling and the most common aggregation rules for decisions inference. The ensemble members are accurate protein secondary structure single model predictors namely, Multi-Class Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks. Experiments are carried out using cross-validation tests on RS126 and CB513 benchmark datasets. Our results clearly confirm that ensembles are more accurate than a single model and the experimental comparison of the investigated ensemble schemes demonstrates that the newly introduced rule called Exponential Opinion Pool competes well against state-of-the-art fixed rules, especially the sum rule which in some cases is able to achieve better performance.

However, there is no work available that investigates the performance of ML-based methods against the text expression-based method, especially for incident and medical case categorization. Meanwhile, these two domains are becoming ever more popular, due to a growing interest of automation in security intelligence and health services. This paper presents a text expression-based method called Evolving Fuzzy Grammar (EFG) and evaluates its performance against the conventional ML methods of Na < ve Bayes, support vector machine, -nearest neighbor, adaptive booting, and decision tree. The incident dataset used is a real dataset that was taken from the World Incidents Tracking System, while ImageCLEF 2009 was used as the source for radiology case reports. The results suggested variations of strength and weakness of each method in both categorization tasks, where a standard evaluation technique (i.e., recall, precision, and -measure) was used. In both domains, the SMO and IBk methods were the best, while AdaBoost was the worst. It was also observed that the medical dataset was easier to categorize than the incident. Although EFG was ranked second lowest, it obtained the highest precision score in the bombing categorization, the highest score in armed attack recall, and was averagely ranked in the top three for the medical case categorization. It was also noted that the text expression-based method used in EFG was the most verbose and expressive, when compared to the ML methods. This indicates that EFG is a viable method in text categorization and may serve as an alternative approach to such a task.

J	Tadic, JM; Ilic, V; Biraud, S				Tadic, Jovan M.; Ilic, Velibor; Biraud, Sebastien			Examination of geostatistical and machine-learning techniques as interpolators in anisotropic atmospheric environments	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Universal kriging; Neural networks; Urban outflow; Airborne measurements; Ensemble	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS; SPATIAL INTERPOLATION; AIRBORNE; PERFORMANCE; WIND	Selecting which interpolation method to use significantly affects the results of atmospheric studies. The goal of this study is to examine the performance of several interpolation techniques under typical atmospheric conditions. Several types of kriging and artificial neural networks used as spatial interpolators are here compared and evaluated against ordinary kriging, using real airborne CO2 mixing-ratio data and synthetic data. The real data were measured (on December 26, 2012) between Billings and Lamont, near Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, within and above the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Predictions were made all along the flight trajectory within a total volume of 5000 km(3) of atmospheric air (27 x 33 x 5.6 km). We evaluated (a) universal kriging, (b) ensemble neural networks, (c) universal kriging with ensemble neural network outputs used as covariates, and (d) ensemble neural networks with ordinary kriging of the residuals as interpolation tools. We found that in certain cases, when the weaknesses of ordinary kriging interpolation schemes (based on an omnidirectional isotropic variogram presumption) became apparent, more sophisticated interpolation methods were in order. In this study, preservation of the potentially nonlinear relationship between the trend and coordinates (by using neural kriging output as a covariate in a universal kriging scheme) was attempted, with varying degrees of success (it was best performer in 4 out of 8 cases). The study confirmed the necessity of selecting an interpolation approach that includes a combination of expert understanding and appropriate interpolation tools. The error analysis showed that uncertainty representations generated by the kriging methods are superior to neural networks, but that the actual error varies from case to case. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This approach allows us to investigate the role of left/right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in predicting the neural activity of fMRI associated with sentence polarities. Subjects in the experiment were asked to judge the matching of the presented picture with the meaning of affirmative and negative sentences. Our results highlight the role of RDLPFC in encoding of the related mental activity to sentence polarities such that the right hemisphere (RDLPFC) can predict sentence polarity with high accuracy as compared to the left hemisphere (LDLPFC), and that the negative sentences are decoded with high performance as compared to affirmative sentences from the RDLPFC across subjects. In addition, this experiment's results show that negative sentences involve more syntactic structure than affirmative sentences.

Recently, it has come to our attention that a number of misplaced notions and misunderstandings are being dissipated on the relationships between ELM and some earlier works. This paper wishes to clarify that (1) ELM theories manage to address the open problem which has puzzled the neural networks, machine learning and neuroscience communities for 60 years: whether hidden nodes/neurons need to be tuned in learning, and proved that in contrast to the common knowledge and conventional neural network learning tenets, hidden nodes/neurons do not need to be iteratively tuned in wide types of neural networks and learning models (Fourier series, biological learning, etc.). Unlike ELM theories, none of those earlier works provides theoretical foundations on feedforward neural networks with random hidden nodes; (2) ELM is proposed for both generalized single-hidden-layer feedforward network and multi-hidden-layer feedforward networks (including biological neural networks); (3) homogeneous architecture-based ELM is proposed for feature learning, clustering, regression and (binary/multi-class) classification. (4) Compared to ELM, SVM and LS-SVM tend to provide suboptimal solutions, and SVM and LS-SVM do not consider feature representations in hidden layers of multi-hidden-layer feedforward networks either.

Many opinion keywords carry varying polarities in different contexts, posing huge challenges for sentiment analysis research. Previous work on contextual polarity disambiguation makes use of term-level context, such as words and patterns, and resolves the polarity with a range of rule-based, statistics-based or machine learning methods. The major shortcoming of these methods lies in that the term-level features sometimes are ineffective in resolving the polarity. In this work, opinion-level context is explored, in which intra-opinion features and inter-opinion features are finely defined. To enable effective use of opinion-level features, the Bayesian model is adopted to resolve the polarity in a probabilistic manner. Experiments with the Opinmine corpus demonstrate that opinion-level features can make a significant contribution in word polarity disambiguation in four domains.

Some previous studies focus on temperature as primary variable of study, though there have been other works focused on precipitation or even wind speed as objective variable. In this paper, we use the self-organized Second Order Data Coupled Clustering (SODCC) algorithm to carry out a spatio-temporal analysis of temperature patterns in Europe. By applying the SODCC we identify three different regimes of spatio-temporal correlations based on their geographical extent: small, medium, and large-scale regimes. Based on these regimes, it is possible to detect a change in the spatio-temporal trend of air temperature, reflecting a shift in the extent of the correlations in stations in the Iberian Peninsula and Southern France. We also identify an oscillating spatio-temporal trend in the Western Asia region and a stable medium-scale regime affecting the British Isles. These results are found to be consistent with previous studies in climate change. The patterns obtained with the SODCC algorithm may represent a signal of climate change to be taken into account, and so the SODCC could be used as detection method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Improvement of predictive models of risk of disease progression in chronic hepatitis C by incorporating longitudinal data	HEPATOLOGY			English	Article							FIBROSIS PROGRESSION; VIRUS-INFECTION; THERAPY; INTERFERON	Existing predictive models of risk of disease progression in chronic hepatitis C have limited accuracy. The aim of this study was to improve upon existing models by applying novel statistical methods that incorporate longitudinal data. Patients in the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment Against Cirrhosis trial were analyzed. Outcomes of interest were (1) fibrosis progression (increase of two or more Ishak stages) and (2) liver-related clinical outcomes (liver-related death, hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplant, or increase in Child-Turcotte-Pugh score to 7). Predictors included longitudinal clinical, laboratory, and histologic data. Models were constructed using logistic regression and two machine learning methods (random forest and boosting) to predict an outcome in the next 12 months. The control arm was used as the training data set (n=349 clinical, n=184 fibrosis) and the interferon arm, for internal validation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for longitudinal models of fibrosis progression was 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.83) using logistic regression, 0.79 (95% CI 0.77-0.81) using random forest, and 0.79 (95% CI 0.77-0.82) using boosting. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for longitudinal models of clinical progression was 0.79 (95% CI 0.77-0.82) using logistic regression, 0.86 (95% CI 0.85-0.87) using random forest, and 0.84 (95% CI 0.82-0.86) using boosting. Longitudinal models outperformed baseline models for both outcomes (P<0.0001). Longitudinal machine learning models had negative predictive values of 94% for both outcomes. Conclusions: Prediction models that incorporate longitudinal data can capture nonlinear disease progression in chronic hepatitis C and thus outperform baseline models. Machine learning methods can capture complex relationships between predictors and outcomes, yielding more accurate predictions; our models can help target costly therapies to patients with the most urgent need, guide the intensity of clinical monitoring required, and provide prognostic information to patients.

It is based on pattern recognition and machine learning techniques. In particular, a strategy based on the Bag-of-Words (BoW) technique is used to characterize short Football video clips that are used to explain the team's performance and to train advanced classifiers in automatic recognition of team activities. In addition to the neural network-based classifier, three more classifier families are tested: the k-Nearest Neighbor, the Support Vector Machine and the Random Forest. The results obtained show that the proposed methodology is able to explain the most common movements of a team and to perform the team activity recognition task with high accuracy when classifying three Football actions: Ball Possession, Quick Attack and Set Piece. Random Forest is the classifier Obtaining the best classification results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Adaptive synthesis dictionaries have been shown to be useful in applications such as signal denoising, and medical image reconstruction. More recently, the learning of sparsifying transforms for data has received interest. The sparsifying transform model allows for cheap and exact computations. In this paper, we develop a methodology for online learning of square sparsifying transforms. Such online learning can be particularly useful when dealing with big data, and for signal processing applications such as real-time sparse representation and denoising. The proposed transform learning algorithms are shown to have a much lower computational cost than online synthesis dictionary learning. In practice, the sequential learning of a sparsifying transform typically converges faster than batch mode transform learning. Preliminary experiments show the usefulness of the proposed schemes for sparse representation, and denoising.

Recently, the learning of sparsifying transforms for data has received interest. The advantage of the transform model is that it enables cheap and exact computations. In Part I of this work, efficient methods for online learning of square sparsifying transforms were introduced and investigated (by numerical experiments). The online schemes process signals sequentially, and can be especially useful when dealing with big data, and for real-time, or limited latency signal processing applications. In this paper, we prove that although the associated optimization problems are non-convex, the online transform learning algorithms are guaranteed to converge to the set of stationary points of the learning problem. The guarantee relies on a few simple assumptions. In practice, the algorithms work well, as demonstrated by examples of applications to representing and denoising signals.

While the idealized task would be to optimize the expected quality of the factors over the underlying distribution of training vectors, it is achieved in practice by minimizing an empirical average over the considered collection. The focus of this paper is to provide sample complexity estimates to uniformly control how much the empirical average deviates from the expected cost function. Standard arguments imply that the performance of the empirical predictor also exhibit such guarantees. The level of genericity of the approach encompasses several possible constraints on the factors (tensor product structure, shift-invariance, sparsity.), thus providing a unified perspective on the sample complexity of several widely used matrix factorization schemes. The derived generalization bounds behave proportional to (log(n)/n)(1/2) with respect to the number of samples n for the considered matrix factorization techniques.

Most of them rely on inference components heavily for detecting interesting activities or contexts. Existing work implements inference components using traditional models designed for balanced data sets, where the sizes of interesting (positive) and non-interesting (negative) data are comparable. Practically, however, the positive and negative sensing data are highly imbalanced. For example, a single daily activity such as bicycling or driving usually occupies a small portion of time, resulting in rare positive instances. Under this circumstance, the trained models based on imbalanced data tend to mislabel positive ones as negative. In this paper, we propose a new inference framework SLIM based on several machine learning techniques in order to accommodate the imbalanced nature of sensing data. Especially, guided under-sampling is employed to obtain balanced labelled subsets, followed by a similarity-based sampling that draws massive unlabelled data to enhance training. To the best of our knowledge, SLIM is the first model that considers data imbalance in mobile sensing. We prototype two sensing apps and the experimental results show that SLIM achieves higher recall (activity recognition rate) while maintaining the precision compared with five classical models. In terms of the overall recall and precision, SLIM is around 12 percent better than the compared solutions on average.

The approach constructs a database that associates ambient radio signals with physical locations in training phase, and then estimates the location by finding the most similar signal pattern within the database. To achieve robust and accurate location estimation, the training phase should be conducted across the entire target space. In practice, however, a user may only access limited or authorized places in a building, that causes degradation in accuracy. In this paper, we present a smartphone-based autonomous indoor war-walking scheme, which automatically constructs the location fingerprint database, even covering unvisited locations. While a smartphone user explores the target area, the proposed system tracks the user's trajectory and simultaneously trains the location fingerprint database. Furthermore, our scheme interpolates radio signals in the database with an appropriate radio propagation model, and supplements fingerprints for unvisited places. As a result, although a user may sparsely explore the target site, the scheme returns the complete database. We implemented our solution and demonstrated the feasibility of the solution.

How to cluster high-dimensional data is still a challenging problem due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we try to address this problem using joint dimensionality reduction and clustering. Different from traditional approaches that conduct dimensionality reduction and clustering in sequence, we propose a novel framework referred to as discriminative embedded clustering which alternates them iteratively. Within this framework, we are able not only to view several traditional approaches and reveal their intrinsic relationships, but also to be stimulated to develop a new method. We also propose an effective approach for solving the formulated nonconvex optimization problem. Comprehensive analyses, including convergence behavior, parameter determination, and computational complexity, together with the relationship to other related approaches, are also presented. Plenty of experimental results on benchmark data sets illustrate that the proposed method outperforms related state-of-the-art clustering approaches and existing joint dimensionality reduction and clustering methods.

However, for numerous urban areas in earthquake prone regions this information is mostly outdated, unavailable, or simply not existent. To this purpose, we present an effective approach to estimate SBSTs by combining scarce in situ observations, multi-sensor remote sensing data and machine learning techniques. In particular, an approach is introduced, which deploys a sequential procedure comprising five main steps, namely calculation of features from remote sensing data, feature selection, outlier detection, generation of synthetic samples, and supervised classification under consideration of both Support Vector Machines and Random Forests. Experimental results obtained for a representative study area, including large parts of the city of Padang (Indonesia), assess the capabilities of the presented approach and confirm its great potential for a reliable area-wide estimation of SBSTs and an effective earthquake loss modeling based on remote sensing, which should be further explored in future research activities.

J	Zhang, CY				Zhang, Caiyun			Applying data fusion techniques for benthic habitat mapping and monitoring in a coral reef ecosystem	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Data fusion; Machine learning; Benthic habitat mapping; Hyperspectral imagery; Object-based image analysis; Coral reef ecosystem	HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGERY; MARINE ENVIRONMENTS; MULTISPECTRAL DATA; RANDOM FOREST; CLASSIFICATION; ACCURACY; IKONOS; RESOLUTION; ENSEMBLE; SEAGRASS	Accurate mapping and effective monitoring of benthic habitat in the Florida Keys are critical in developing management strategies for this valuable coral reef ecosystem. For this study, a framework was designed for automated benthic habitat mapping by combining multiple data sources (hyperspectral, aerial photography, and bathymetry data) and four contemporary imagery processing techniques (data fusion, Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA), machine learning, and ensemble analysis). In the framework, 1-m digital aerial photograph was first merged with 17-m hyperspectral imagery and 10-m bathymetiy data using a pixel/feature-level fusion strategy. The fused dataset was then preclassified by three machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and k-Nearest Neighbor). Final object-based habitat maps were produced through ensemble analysis of outcomes from three classifiers. The framework was tested for classifying a group-level (3-class) and code-level (9-class) habitats in a portion of the Florida Keys. Informative and accurate habitat maps were achieved with an overall accuracy of 88.5% and 83.5% for the group-level and code-level classifications, respectively.

Optimization of reproductive management programs using lift chart analysis and cost-sensitive evaluation of classification errors	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						machine learning; reproductive management; lift chart analysis; cost-sensitive evaluation; dairy cattle	TIMED ARTIFICIAL-INSEMINATION; MARKOV-CHAIN MODEL; DAIRY-CATTLE; 1ST INSEMINATION; PREGNANCY; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; ECONOMICS; SELECTION; ESTRUS	The common practice on most commercial dairy farms is to inseminate all cows that are eligible for breeding, while ignoring (or absorbing) the costs associated with semen and labor directed toward low-fertility cows that are unlikely to conceive. Modern analytical methods, such as machine learning algorithms, can be applied to cow-specific explanatory variables for the purpose of computing probabilities of success or failure associated with upcoming insemination events. Lift chart analysis can identify subsets of high fertility cows that are likely to conceive and are therefore appropriate targets for insemination (e.g., with conventional artificial insemination semen or expensive sex-enhanced semen), as well as subsets of low-fertility cows that are unlikely to conceive and should therefore be passed over at that point in time. Although such a strategy might be economically viable, the management, environmental, and financial conditions on one farm might differ widely from conditions on the next, and hence the reproductive management recommendations derived from such a tool may be suboptimal for specific farms. When coupled with cost-sensitive evaluation of misclassified and correctly classified insemination events, the strategy can be a potentially powerful tool for optimizing the reproductive management of individual farms. In the present study, lift chart analysis and cost-sensitive evaluation were applied to a data set consisting of 54,806 insemination events of primiparous Holstein cows on 26 Wisconsin farms, as well as a data set with 17,197 insemination events of primiparous Holstein cows on 3 Wisconsin farms, where the latter had more detailed information regarding health events of individual cows. In the first data set, the gains in profit associated with limiting inseminations to subsets of 79 to 97% of the most fertile eligible cows ranged from $0.44 to $2.18 per eligible cow in a monthly breeding period, depending on days in milk at breeding and milk yield relative to contemporaries. In the second data set, the strategy of inseminating only a subset consisting of 59% of the most fertile cows conferred a gain in profit of $5.21 per eligible cow in a monthly breeding period. These results suggest that, when used with a powerful classification algorithm, lift chart analysis and cost-sensitive evaluation of correctly classified and misclassified insemination events can enhance the performance and profitability of reproductive management programs on commercial dairy farms.

Materials and MethodsIn all, 58 normal volunteers and 16 subjects with CSM were recruited for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) acquisition. The eigenvalues were extracted as the selected features from DTI images. Three classifiers, naive Bayesian, support vector machine, and support tensor machine, and fractional anisotropy (FA) were employed to identify myelopathic levels. The results were compared with clinical level diagnosis results and accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to evaluate the performance of the developed classifiers. ResultsThe accuracy by support tensor machine was the highest (93.62%) among the three classifiers. The support tensor machine also showed excellent capacity to identify true positives (sensitivity: 84.62%) and true negatives (specificity: 97.06%). The accuracy by FA value was the lowest (76%) in all the methods. ConclusionThe classifiers-based method using eigenvalues had a better performance in identifying the levels of CSM than the diagnosis using FA values. The support tensor machine was the best among three classifiers. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2015;41:1682-1688. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	[Wang, Shu-Qiang; Li, Xiang; Cui, Jiao-Long; Luk, Keith D.

Materials and MethodsInterictal resting state fMRI and high-resolution MRI were performed on 14 left and 10 right TLE patients. Functional topology measures were calculated from fMRI using graph theory, and used to lateralize the epileptogenic hemisphere using quadratic discriminant analysis. Leave-one-out cross-validation prediction accuracy of CADFIG was compared to performance based on expert manual analysis (MA) of MRI, using video EEG as the "gold standard" for focus lateralization. ResultsCADFIG correctly lateralized 95.8% (23/24) of cases, compared to 66.7% (16/24) with expert MA of MRI. Combining MA with CADFIG allowed all cases (24/24) to be correctly lateralized. CADFIG correctly identified the affected hemisphere for all patients (8/8) where MRI failed to lateralize. ConclusionCADFIG based on fMRI lateralized the affected hemisphere in TLE with superior performance compared to expert MA of MRI. These results demonstrate that functional patterns in fMRI can be used with automated machine learning for diagnostic lateralization in TLE. Addition of fMRI-based tests to existing protocols for identifying the affected hemisphere in presurgical assessment can improve diagnostic accuracy and surgical outcome in TLE.J. Magn. Reson.

The author presents basic mapping paradigms and the place of the EMG in multimodal interaction and describes initial trials in machine learning. It is proposed that nonlinearities in musical instrument response cannot be modelled only by parameter interpolation and require strategies of extrapolation. The author introduces the concepts of intention, effort, and restraint as such strategies, to exploit, as well as confront limitations of, the use of muscle signals in musical performance.

They have been used in applications for many years, and their popularity continues to grow because of their usefulness in data analysis, machine learning, and other areas of current interest. This paper describes the fundamentals of the coordinate descent approach, together with variants and extensions and their convergence properties, mostly with reference to convex objectives. We pay particular attention to a certain problem structure that arises frequently in machine learning applications, showing that efficient implementations of accelerated coordinate descent algorithms are possible for problems of this type. We also present some parallel variants and discuss their convergence properties under several models of parallel execution.

Our approach is based on reformulating a cardinality-constrained problem exactly as a Boolean program, to which standard convex relaxations such as the Lasserre and Sherali-Adams hierarchies can be applied. We analyze the first-order relaxation in detail, deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for exactness in a unified manner. In the special case of least-squares regression, we show that these conditions are satisfied with high probability for random ensembles satisfying suitable incoherence conditions, similar to results on -relaxations. In contrast to known methods, our relaxations yield lower bounds on the objective, and it can be verified whether or not the relaxation is exact. If it is not, we show that randomization based on the relaxed solution offers a principled way to generate provably good feasible solutions. This property enables us to obtain high quality estimates even if incoherence conditions are not met, as might be expected in real datasets. We numerically illustrate the performance of the relaxation-randomization strategy in both synthetic and real high-dimensional datasets, revealing substantial improvements relative to -based methods and greedy selection heuristics.

A globally convergent incremental Newton method	MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING			English	Article						Incremental methods; Convex optimization; Newton method; Gauss-Newton method; Strong convexity; EKF algorithm	ADAPTIVE STEPSIZE RULE; SUBGRADIENT METHODS; GRADIENT METHODS; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHMS	Motivated by machine learning problems over large data sets and distributed optimization over networks, we develop and analyze a new method called incremental Newton method for minimizing the sum of a large number of strongly convex functions. We show that our method is globally convergent for a variable stepsize rule. We further show that under a gradient growth condition, convergence rate is linear for both variable and constant stepsize rules. By means of an example, we show that without the gradient growth condition, incremental Newton method cannot achieve linear convergence. Our analysis can be extended to study other incremental methods: in particular, we obtain a linear convergence rate result for the incremental Gauss-Newton algorithm under a variable stepsize rule.

Arfan			An adaptive training based on classification system for patterns in facial expressions using SURF descriptor templates	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Facial expressions recognition; Incremental learning; SURF; Template matching; Machine learning	RECOGNITION	Most facial expression recognition (FER) systems used facial expression data created during a short period of time and this data is used for learning/training of FER systems. There are many facial expression patterns (i.e. a particular expression can be represented in many different patterns) which cannot be generated and used as learning/training data in a short time. Therefore, in order to maintain its high accuracy and robustness for a long time of a facial expression recognition system, the classifier should be evolved adaptively over time and space. We proposed a facial expression recognition system that has the aptitude of incrementally learning and thus can learn all possible patterns of expressions that may be generated in feature. After extraction of region of interest (face), the system extracts Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF). A novel SURF descriptor template based nearest neighbor classifier is proposed for classification. This classifier is used as base/weak classifier for incremental learning algorithm Learn++. A vast range of experimentation is performed on five different databases that demonstrate the incremental learning capability of the proposed system. The experiments using the incrementally learning classification demonstrate promising results.	[Zia, M. Sultan; Jaffar, M. Arfan] NU FAST, Natl Univ Comp & Emerging Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Zia, M.

J	Taheri, S; Mammadov, M				Taheri, Sona; Mammadov, Musa			Structure learning of Bayesian Networks using global optimization with applications in data classification	OPTIMIZATION LETTERS			English	Article						Data classification; Bayesian Networks; Global optimization	STATISTICAL-DATA	Bayesian Networks are increasingly popular methods of modeling uncertainty in artificial intelligence and machine learning. A Bayesian Network consists of a directed acyclic graph in which each node represents a variable and each arc represents probabilistic dependency between two variables. Constructing a Bayesian Network from data is a learning process that consists of two steps: learning structure and learning parameter. Learning a network structure from data is the most difficult task in this process. This paper presents a new algorithm for constructing an optimal structure for Bayesian Networks based on optimization. The algorithm has two major parts. First, we define an optimization model to find the better network graphs. Then, we apply an optimization approach for removing possible cycles from the directed graphs obtained in the first part which is the first of its kind in the literature. The main advantage of the proposed method is that the maximal number of parents for variables is not fixed a priory and it is defined during the optimization procedure. It also considers all networks including cyclic ones and then choose a best structure by applying a global optimization method. To show the efficiency of the algorithm, several closely related algorithms including unrestricted dependency Bayesian Network algorithm, as well as, benchmarks algorithms SVM and C4.5 are employed for comparison. We apply these algorithms on data classification; data sets are taken from the UCI machine learning repository and the LIBSVM.

In most prevalent machine-learning-based identification methods; however, either some features are inefficiently represented, or the redundancy between features is not effectively removed. Both problems may weaken the performance of a classifier system and raise its computational complexity. Here, we addressed the above problems and developed a better classifier (RBRIdent) to identify the RNA-binding residues. In an independent benchmark test, RBRIdent achieved an accuracy of 76.79%, Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.3819 and F-measure of 75.58%, remarkably outperforming all prevalent methods. These results suggest the necessity of proper feature description and the essential role of feature selection in this project. All source data and codes are freely available at .

In the first phase of our experiments, all models were applied and evaluated using cross-validation on a popular, public domain dataset. In the second phase, the performance improvement offered by boosting was studied. In order to determine the most efficient parameter combinations we performed a series of Monte Carlo simulations for each method and for a wide range of parameters. Our results demonstrate clear superiority of the boosted versions of the models against the plain (non-boosted) versions.

Main attention is paid to Bayesian classifier that can be used to realize the processing procedures based on parallel machine-learning algorithms and high-productive computers. We consider the maximum of the posterior probability principle and the formalism of Markov random fields for the neighborhood description of the pixels for the related classes of objects with the emphasis on forests of different species and ages. The energy category of the selected classes serves to account for the likelihood measure between the registered radiances and the theoretical distribution functions approximating remotely sensed data. Optimization procedures are undertaken to solve the pattern recognition problem of the texture description for the forest classes together with finding thin nuances of their spectral distribution in the feature space. As a result, possible redundancy of the channels for imaging spectrometer due to their correlations is removed. Difficulties are revealed due to different sampling data while separating pixels, which characterize the sunlit tops, shaded space and intermediate cases of the Sun illumination conditions on the hyperspectral images. Such separation of pixels for the forest classes is maintained to enhance the recognition accuracy, but learning ensembles of data need to be agreed for these categories of pixels. We present some results of the Bayesian classifier applicability for recognizing airborne hyperspectral images using the relevant improvements in separating such pixels for the forest classes on a test area of the 4 x 10 km size encompassed by 13 airborne tracks, each forming the images by 500 pixels across the track and from 10,000 to 14,000 pixels along the track. The spatial resolution of each image is near to 1 m from the altitude near to 2 km above the ground level. The results of the hyperspectral imagery processing have shown that for the ensembles of data corresponding to the prevailing pine species and sunlit tree's tops the young forests (13-26 years old) and mature forests (106-136 years old) on the test area are recognized with high accuracy, but difficulties are essential for intermediate ages (36-96 years old) though some of these ages (for example, 47 and 76 years old) are also recognized with high accuracy. This is due to insufficient sampling of the pixels relating to the sunlit tops for the intermediate ages using the classifier employed. A conclusion is made that a fusion of the passive imaging spectrometer and the active lidar (laser scanner) on the same gyro-stabilized airborne platform is needed to overcome these difficulties.

The PUF studied in this paper utilizes the variation sensitivity of static random access memory (SRAM) data retention voltage (DRV), the minimum voltage at which each cell can retain state. Prior work shows that DRV can uniquely identify circuit instances with 28% greater success than SRAM power-up states that are used in PUFs [1]. However, DRV is highly sensitive to temperature, and until now this makes it unreliable and unsuitable for use in a PUF. In this paper, we enable DRV PUFs by proposing a DRV-based hash function that is insensitive to temperature. The new hash function, denoted DRV-based hashing (DH), is reliable across temperatures because it utilizes the temperature-insensitive ordering of DRVs across cells, instead of using the DRVs in absolute terms. To evaluate the security and performance of the DRV PUF, we use DRV measurements from commercially available SRAM chips, and use data from a novel DRV prediction algorithm. The prediction algorithm uses machine learning for fast and accurate simulation-free estimation of any cell's DRV, and the prediction error in comparison to circuit simulation has a standard deviation of 0.35 mV. We demonstrate the DRV PUF using two applications-secret key generation and identification. In secret key generation, we introduce a new circuit-level reliability knob as an alternative to error correcting codes. In the identification application, our approach is compared to prior work and shown to result in a smaller false-positive identification rate for any desired true-positive identification rate.

However, such diagnosis method requires a rich set of test items (syndromes) and a sizable database of faulty boards to learn from. An insufficient number of failed boards, ambiguous root-cause identification, and redundant or irrelevant syndromes can render reasoning-based diagnosis ineffective. Periodic evaluation and analysis can help locate weaknesses in a diagnosis system and thereby provide guidelines for redesigning the tests, which facilitates better diagnosis. We propose an information-theoretic framework for evaluating the effectiveness of and providing guidance to a reasoning-based functional-fault diagnosis system. Syndrome analysis based on feature selection methods provides a representative set of syndromes and suggests irrelevant syndromes in diagnosis. Root-cause analysis measures the discriminative ability of differentiating a given root cause from others. Results are presented for four types of diagnosis systems for three complex boards that are in volume production.

J	Chung, J; Kim, J				Chung, Jaeyong; Kim, Jibum			Segment Delay Learning From Quantized Path Delay Measurements	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Defect diagnosis; machine learning; post-silicon debug; post-silicon validation		Our understanding on a silicon chip is limited due to low measurement resolution or model-silicon miscorrelation including variations. This paper shows that chips are better understood by combining noisy measurement results and model information through a mathematical algorithm. Our proposed method learns segment delays in logic circuits from quantized path delay measurements using ridge regression. During the learning process, we take advantage of both nominal segment delays and the delay sensitivity with respect to variations. We also interpret the ridge regression in Bayesian context and in doing so, propose an analytic formula to set the regularization parameter of the ridge regression. For the silicon measurement environments where low measurement resolution is the dominant source of measurement noise, this formula allows us to predict post-silicon results more accurately and speed up the algorithm eliminating inefficient and inaccurate cross-validation. We also demonstrate our method in enhancing the resolution of already measured path delays. We learn segment delays from quantized path delay measurements and predict the path delays prior to the quantization. Our simulation results show that the predicted path delays are much closer to actual values than the measured values and the nominal values.

For the semisupervised tensor classification, the existing transductive support tensor machine (TSTM) needs to resort to iterative technique, which is very time-consuming. In order to overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, we extend the concave-convex procedure-based transductive support vector machine (CCCP-TSVM) to the tensor patterns and propose a low-rank approximation-based TSTM, in which the tensor rank-one decomposition is used to compute the inner product of the tensors. Theoretically, concave-convex procedure-based TSTM (CCCP-TSTM) is an extension of the linear CCCP-TSVM to tensor patterns. When the input patterns are vectors, CCCP-TSTM degenerates into the linear CCCP-TSVM. A set of experiments is conducted on 23 semisupervised classification tasks, which are generated from seven second-order face data sets, three third-order gait data sets, and two third-order image data sets, to illustrate the performance of the CCCP-TSTM. The results show that compared with CCCP-TSVM and TSTM, CCCP-TSTM provides significant performance gain in terms of test accuracy and training speed.

Target identification is solely based on information from mp-MRI, which is subsequently transferred to the subject coordinates through an image registration approach. mp-MRI has shown to be highly sensitive to detect higher-grade prostate cancer, but suffers from a high rate of false positives for lower-grade cancer, leading to unnecessary biopsies. This paper utilizes a machine-learning framework to further improve the sensitivity of targeted biopsy through analyzing temporal ultrasound data backscattered from the prostate tissue. Temporal ultrasound data were acquired during targeted fusion prostate biopsy from suspicious cancer foci identified in mp-MRI. Several spectral features, representing the signature of backscattered signal from the tissue, were extracted from the temporal ultrasound data. A supervised support vector machine classification model was trained to relate the features to the result of histopathology analysis of biopsy cores obtained from cancer foci. The model was used to predict the label of biopsy cores for mp-MRI-identified targets in an independent group of subjects. Training of the classier was performed on data obtained from 35 biopsy cores. A fivefold cross-validation strategy was utilized to examine the consistency of the selected features from temporal ultrasound data, where we achieved the classification accuracy and area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 94 % and 0.98, respectively. Subsequently, an independent group of 25 biopsy cores was used for validation of the model, in which mp-MRI had identified suspicious cancer foci. Using the trained model, we predicted the tissue pathology using temporal ultrasound data: 16 out of 17 benign cores, as well as all three higher-grade cancer cores, were correctly identified. The results show that temporal analysis of ultrasound data is potentially an effective approach to complement mp-MRI-TRUS-guided prostate cancer biopsy, specially to reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and to reliably identify higher-grade cancers.

Real-time ultrasound image classification for spine anesthesia using local directional Hadamard features	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY			English	Article						Epidural; Facet joint injection; Hadamard transform; Classification; Ultrasound	LOW-BACK-PAIN; RISK-FACTORS; TRACKED ULTRASOUND; EPIDURAL SPACE; INSERTION; ACCESS; BLOCK	Injection therapy is a commonly used solution for back pain management. This procedure typically involves percutaneous insertion of a needle between or around the vertebrae, to deliver anesthetics near nerve bundles. Most frequently, spinal injections are performed either blindly using palpation or under the guidance of fluoroscopy or computed tomography. Recently, due to the drawbacks of the ionizing radiation of such imaging modalities, there has been a growing interest in using ultrasound imaging as an alternative. However, the complex spinal anatomy with different wave-like structures, affected by speckle noise, makes the accurate identification of the appropriate injection plane difficult. The aim of this study was to propose an automated system that can identify the optimal plane for epidural steroid injections and facet joint injections. A multi-scale and multi-directional feature extraction system to provide automated identification of the appropriate plane is proposed. Local Hadamard coefficients are obtained using the sequency-ordered Hadamard transform at multiple scales. Directional features are extracted from local coefficients which correspond to different regions in the ultrasound images. An artificial neural network is trained based on the local directional Hadamard features for classification. The proposed method yields distinctive features for classification which successfully classified 1032 images out of 1090 for epidural steroid injection and 990 images out of 1052 for facet joint injection. In order to validate the proposed method, a leave-one-out cross-validation was performed. The average classification accuracy for leave-one-out validation was 94 % for epidural and 90 % for facet joint targets. Also, the feature extraction time for the proposed method was 20 ms for a native 2D ultrasound image. A real-time machine learning system based on the local directional Hadamard features extracted by the sequency-ordered Hadamard transform for detecting the laminae and facet joints in ultrasound images has been proposed. The system has the potential to assist the anesthesiologists in quickly finding the target plane for epidural steroid injections and facet joint injections.

Artificial Neuron-Glia Networks Learning Approach Based on Cooperative Coevolution	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Artificial neuron-glia networks; artificial neural networks; artificial astrocytes; glial cells; evolutionary algorithms; cooperative coevolutionary genetic algorithm; genetic algorithms; parameter optimization; classification	CA1 PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; SYNAPTIC ACTIVITY; ASTROCYTES; SYNAPSES; BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; TRANSMISSION; HIPPOCAMPUS	Artificial Neuron-Glia Networks (ANGNs) are a novel bio-inspired machine learning approach. They extend classical Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by incorporating recent findings and suppositions about the way information is processed by neural and astrocytic networks in the most evolved living organisms. Although ANGNs are not a consolidated method, their performance against the traditional approach, i.e. without artificial astrocytes, was already demonstrated on classification problems. However, the corresponding learning algorithms developed so far strongly depends on a set of glial parameters which are manually tuned for each specific problem. As a consequence, previous experimental tests have to be done in order to determine an adequate set of values, making such manual parameter configuration time-consuming, error-prone, biased and problem dependent. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel learning approach for ANGNs that fully automates the learning process, and gives the possibility of testing any kind of reasonable parameter configuration for each specific problem. This new learning algorithm, based on coevolutionary genetic algorithms, is able to properly learn all the ANGNs parameters. Its performance is tested on five classification problems achieving significantly better results than ANGN and competitive results with ANN approaches.

In vivo cell-cycle profiling in xenograft tumors by quantitative intravital microscopy	NATURE METHODS			English	Article							ANTIMITOTIC DRUGS; CANCER-CELLS; SINGLE-CELL; SEGMENTATION; NUCLEI; TARGET; CLASSIFICATION; RECONSTRUCTION; MICROTUBULES; PACLITAXEL	Quantification of cell-cycle state at a single-cell level is essential to understand fundamental three-dimensional (3D) biological processes such as tissue development and cancer. Analysis of 3D in vivo images, however, is very challenging. Today's best practice, manual annotation of select image events, generates arbitrarily sampled data distributions, which are unsuitable for reliable mechanistic inferences. Here, we present an integrated workflow for quantitative in vivo cell-cycle profiling. It combines image analysis and machine learning methods for automated 3D segmentation and cell-cycle state identification of individual cell-nuclei with widely varying morphologies embedded in complex tumor environments. We applied our workflow to quantify cell-cycle effects of three antimitotic cancer drugs over 8 d in HT-1080 fibrosarcoma xenografts in living mice using a data set of 38,000 cells and compared the induced phenotypes. In contrast to results with 2D culture, observed mitotic arrest was relatively low, suggesting involvement of additional mechanisms in their antitumor effect in vivo.

J	Vallmuur, K				Vallmuur, Kirsten			Machine learning approaches to analysing textual injury surveillance data: A systematic review	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Review						Text data; Injury surveillance; Injury epidemiology; Text mining; Machine learning	FOREIGN-BODY INJURIES; OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENTS; BAYESIAN NETWORK; NARRATIVES; CHILDREN; EXPLORE	Objective: To synthesise recent research on the use of machine learning approaches to mining textual injury surveillance data. Design: Systematic review. Data sources: The electronic databases which were searched included PubMed, Cinahl, Medline, Google Scholar, and Proquest. The bibliography of all relevant articles was examined and associated articles were identified using a snowballing technique. Selection criteria: For inclusion, articles were required to meet the following criteria: (a) used a health-related database, (b) focused on injury-related cases, AND used machine learning approaches to analyse textual data. Methods: The papers identified through the search were screened resulting in 16 papers selected for review. Articles were reviewed to describe the databases and methodology used, the strength and limitations of different techniques, and quality assurance approaches used. Due to heterogeneity between studies meta-analysis was not performed. Results: Occupational injuries were the focus of half of the machine learning studies and the most common methods described were Bayesian probability or Bayesian network based methods to either predict injury categories or extract common injury scenarios. Models were evaluated through either comparison with gold standard data or content expert evaluation or statistical measures of quality. Machine learning was found to provide high precision and accuracy when predicting a small number of categories, was valuable for visualisation of injury patterns and prediction of future outcomes. However, difficulties related to generalizability, source data quality, complexity of models and integration of content and technical knowledge were discussed. Conclusions: The use of narrative text for injury surveillance has grown in popularity, complexity and quality over recent years. With advances in data mining techniques, increased capacity for analysis of large databases, and involvement of computer scientists in the injury prevention field, along with more comprehensive use and description of quality assurance methods in text mining approaches, it is likely that we will see a continued growth and advancement in knowledge of text mining in the injury field.

CLBCI is based on minimum distance classification with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and allows for shorter training times compared to classical BCIs, as well as faster learning in users and a good performance progression. We further propose a new scheme for real-time two-dimensional visualization of classification outcomes using Wachspress coordinate interpolation. It allows us to represent classification outcomes for n classes in simple regular polygons. Our objective is to devise a BCI system that constitutes a practical interaction modality that can be deployed rapidly and used on a regular basis. We apply our system to an event-based control task in the form of a simple shooter game in which we evaluate the learning effect induced by our architecture compared to a classical approach. We also evaluate how much user feedback and our visualization method contribute to the performance of the system.

Systems analyses, or omics approaches, have become an important tool in characterizing this process. Although RNA and protein profiling made their entry into this field a couple of decades ago, metabolite profiling is a more recent addition. The metabolome represents a Large part or all metabolites in a tissue, and gives a snapshot of its physiology. By using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, we analyzed the metabolic profile of brain regions of the mouse, and found that each region is characterized by its own metabolic signature. We then analyzed the metabolic profile of the mouse brain after excitotoxic injury, a mechanism of neurodegeneration implicated in numerous neurological diseases. More important, we validated our findings by measuring, histologically and molecularly, actual neurodegeneration and ghat response. We found that a specific global metabolic signature, best revealed by machine Learning algorithms, rather than individual metabolites, was the most robust correlate of neuronal injury and the accompanying gliosis, and this signature could serve as a global biomarker for neurodegeneration. We also observed that brain lesioning induced several metabolites with neuroprotective properties. Our results deepen the understanding of metabolic changes accompanying neurodegeneration in disease models, and could help rapidly evaluate these changes in preclinical drug studies.

While existing theories such as the Dempster-Shafer theory and the possibility theory have been used for several years now, they do not provide guarantees of error calibration in information fusion settings. The Conformal Predictions (CP) framework is a new game-theoretic approach to reliable machine learning, which provides a methodology to obtain error calibration under classification and regression settings. In this work, we present a methodology to extend the Conformal Predictions framework to both classification and regression-based information fusion settings. This methodology is based on applying the CP framework to each data source as an independent hypothesis test, and subsequently using p-value combination methods as a test statistic for the combined hypothesis after fusion. The proposed methodology was studied in classification and regression settings within two real-world application contexts: person recognition using multiple modalities (classification), and head pose estimation using multiple image features (regression). Our experimental results showed that quantile methods of combining p-values (such as the Standard Normal Function and the Non-conformity Aggregation methods) provided the most statistically valid calibration results, and can be considered to extend the CP framework for information fusion settings.

QSAR is in widespread use within the pharmaceutical industry to prioritize compounds for experimental testing or to alert for potential toxicity during the drug discovery process. However, the confidence or reliability of predictions from a QSAR model are difficult to accurately assess. We frame the application of QSAR to preclinical drug development in an off-line inductive conformal prediction framework and apply it prospectively to historical data collected from four different assays within AstraZeneca over a time course of about five years. The results indicate weakened validity of the conformal predictor due to violations of the randomness assumption. The validity can be strengthen by adopting semi-off-line conformal prediction. The non-randomness of the data prevents exactly valid predictions but comparisons to the results of a traditional QSAR procedure applied to the same data indicate that conformal predictions are highly useful in the drug discovery process.

JET-EFDA Contributors	Preliminary numerical investigations of conformal predictors based on fuzzy logic classifiers	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Conformal predictors; Fuzzy logic; Membership function; Non conformity score	CONFIDENCE MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; RECOGNITION	A new family of techniques, called conformal predictors, have very recently been developed to hedge the estimates of machine learning methods, by providing two parameters, credibility and confidence, which can assess the level of trust that can be attributed to their outputs. In this paper, the main steps required to extend this approach to fuzzy logic classifiers are reported. The more delicate aspect is the definition of an appropriate nonconformity score, which has to be based on the fuzzy membership function to preserve the specificities of Fuzzy Logic. Various examples of increasing complexity are introduced, to describe the main properties of fuzzy logic based conformal predictors and to compare their performance with alternative approaches. The obtained results are quite promising, since conformal predictors based on fuzzy classifiers outperform solutions based on the nearest neighbour in terms of ambiguity, robustness and interpretability.

An important drawback of Venn Predictors is their computational inefficiency, especially in the case of large datasets. In this work, we investigate and propose Inductive Venn Predictors (IVPs), which can overcome the computational inefficiency problem of the original Transductive Venn Prediction framework. We develop an IVP algorithm and perform a detailed comparison of its time efficiency, accuracy, and quality of probabilistic outputs with those of the original Transductive Venn Predictor (TVP). The results demonstrate that our method provides well calibrated results while maintaining high accuracy. The IVP outperforms the original TVP method in terms of time efficiency, while also providing well-calibrated probabilistic estimates. Another observation is that the probability intervals of the IVP are tighter than those of the TVP.

The methodology is based on a newly developed machine learning framework called Venn machines. Is allows to output a valid probability interval. The methodology is designed for mass spectrometry data. For demonstrative purposes, we applied this methodology to MALDI-TOF data sets in order to predict the diagnosis of heart disease and early diagnoses of ovarian cancer and breast cancer. The experiments showed that probability intervals are narrow, that is, the output of the multiprobability predictor is similar to a single probability distribution. In addition, probability intervals produced for heart disease and ovarian cancer data were more accurate than the output of corresponding probability predictor. When Venn machines were forced to make point predictions, the accuracy of such predictions is for the most data better than the accuracy of the underlying algorithm that outputs single probability distribution of a label. Application of this methodology to MALDI-TOF data sets empirically demonstrates the validity. The accuracy of the proposed method on ovarian cancer data rises from 66.7 % 11 months in advance of the moment of diagnosis to up to 90.2 % at the moment of diagnosis. The same approach has been applied to heart disease data without time dependency, although the achieved accuracy was not as high (up to 69.9 %). The methodology allowed us to confirm mass spectrometry peaks previously identified as carrying statistically significant information for discrimination between controls and cases.

The brain was found to follow a remarkably consistent developmental trajectory in a sample of 621 subjects of ages 8-22 participating in the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, reflected by a cross-validated correlation coefficient between chronologic age and the BDI of r = 0.89. Critically, deviations from this trajectory related to cognitive performance. Specifically, subjects whose BDI was higher than their chronological age displayed significantly superior cognitive processing speed compared with subjects whose BDI was lower than their actual age. These results indicate that the multiparametric imaging patterns summarized by the BDI can accurately delineate trajectories of brain development and identify individuals with cognitive precocity or delay.

We present GotCloud, a pipeline for efficiently detecting and genotyping high-quality variants from large-scale sequencing data. GotCloud automates sequence alignment, sample-level quality control, variant calling, filtering of likely artifacts using machine-learning techniques, and genotype refinement using haplotype information. The pipeline can process thousands of samples in parallel and requires less computational resources than current alternatives. Experiments with whole-genome and exome-targeted sequence data generated by the 1000 Genomes Project show that the pipeline provides effective filtering against false positive variants and high power to detect true variants. Our pipeline has already contributed to variant detection and genotyping in several large-scale sequencing projects, including the 1000 Genomes Project and the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. We hope it will now prove useful to many medical sequencing studies.

Toward high-content screening of mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential in living cells	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY & CELL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Mitochondrial pathophysiology; TMRM; Data mining; Machine learning; Multivariate analysis	OXIDATIVE-PHOSPHORYLATION; FUSION; DYNAMICS; QUANTIFICATION; BIOENERGETICS; DEGRADATION; DYSFUNCTION; DEFICIENCY; MUTATIONS; AUTOPHAGY	Mitochondria are double membrane organelles involved in various key cellular processes. Governed by dedicated protein machinery, mitochondria move and continuously fuse and divide. These "mitochondrial dynamics" are bi-directionally linked to mitochondrial and cell functional state in space and time. Due to the action of the electron transport chain (ETC), the mitochondrial inner membrane displays a inside-negative membrane potential (Delta psi). The latter is considered a functional readout of mitochondrial "health" and required to sustain normal mitochondrial ATP production and mitochondrial fusion. During the last decade, live-cell microscopy strategies were developed for simultaneous quantification of Delta psi and mitochondrial morphology. This revealed that ETC dysfunction, changes in Delta psi and aberrations in mitochondrial structure often occur in parallel, suggesting they are linked potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Here we discuss how combining high-content and high-throughput strategies can be used for analysis of genetic and/or drug-induced effects at the level of individual organelles, cells and cell populations.

J	Hamilton, Z; Neuilly, MA; Lee, S; Barnoski, R				Hamilton, Zachary; Neuilly, Melanie-Angela; Lee, Stephen; Barnoski, Robert			Isolating modeling effects in offender risk assessment	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CRIMINOLOGY			English	Article						Random forest; Neural network; Recidivism; Risk assessment	CLASSIFICATION TREE ANALYSIS; ASSESSING VIOLENCE RISK; PREDICTING RECIDIVISM; CRIMINAL RECIDIVISM; REGRESSION TREE; NEED ASSESSMENT; METAANALYSIS	Recent evolutions in actuarial research have revealed the potential increased utility of machine learning and data-mining strategies to develop statistical models such as classification/decision-tree analysis and neural networks, which are said to mimic the decision-making of practitioners. The current article compares such actuarial modeling methods with a traditional logistic regression risk-assessment development approach. Utilizing a large purposive sample of Washington State offenders (N = 297,600), the current study examines and compares the predictive validity of the currently used Washington State Static Risk Assessment (SRA) instrument to classification tree analysis/random forest and neural network models. Overall findings varied, being dependent on the outcome of interest, with the best model for each method resulting in AUCs ranging from 0.732 to 0.762. Findings reveal some predictive performance improvements with advanced machine-learning methodologies, yet the logistic regression models demonstrate comparable predictive performance. The study concluded that while data-mining techniques hold potential for improvements over traditional methods, regression-based models demonstrate comparable, and often improved, prediction performance with noted parsimony and greater interpretability.

To overcome these limitations, we here compare, to our best knowledge for the first time, different classification methods of first-episode psychosis (FEP) using multi-modal imaging data exploited on several cortical and subcortical structures and white matter fiber bundles. 23 FEP patients and 23 age-, gender-, and race-matched healthy participants were included in the study. An innovative multivariate approach based on multiple kernel learning (MKL) methods was implemented on structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging. MKL provides the best classification performances in comparison with the more widely used support vector machine, enabling the definition of a reliable automatic decisional system based on the integration of multi-modal imaging information. Our results show a discrimination accuracy greater than 90 % between healthy subjects and patients with FEP. Regions with an accuracy greater than 70 % on different imaging sources and measures were middle and superior frontal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, uncinate fascicles, and cingulum. This study shows that multivariate machine learning approaches integrating multi-modal and multisource imaging data can classify FEP patients with high accuracy. Interestingly, specific grey matter structures and white matter bundles reach high classification reliability when using different imaging modalities and indices, potentially outlining a prefronto-limbic network impaired in FEP with particular regard to the right hemisphere.

The drug alters speech production and fluency, and may influence speech content. Here, we investigated the effect of MDMA on speech content, which may reveal how this drug affects social interactions. Method: Thirty-five healthy volunteers with prior MDMA experience completed this two-session, within-subjects, double-blind study during which they received 1.5 mg/kg oral MDMA and placebo. Participants completed a five-minute standardized talking task during which they discussed a close personal relationship (e.g. a friend or family member) with a research assistant. The conversations were analyzed for selected content categories (e.g. words pertaining to affect, social interaction, and cognition), using both a standard dictionary method (Pennebaker's Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count: LIWC) and a machine learning method using random forest classifiers. Results: Both analytic methods revealed that MDMA altered speech content relative to placebo. Using LIWC scores, the drug increased use of social and sexual words, consistent with reports that MDMA increases willingness to disclose. Using the machine learning algorithm, we found that MDMA increased use of social words and words relating to both positive and negative emotions. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with reports that MDMA acutely alters speech content, specifically increasing emotional and social content during a brief semistructured dyadic interaction. Studying effects of psychoactive drugs on speech content may offer new insights into drug effects on mental states, and on emotional and psychosocial interaction.

Classification of usual interstitial pneumonia in patients with interstitial lung disease: assessment of a machine learning approach using high-dimensional transcriptional data	LANCET RESPIRATORY MEDICINE			English	Article							IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY-FIBROSIS; HYPERSENSITIVITY PNEUMONITIS; EXPRESSION; DIAGNOSIS; SARCOIDOSIS; POLYMORPHISMS; PATHOGENESIS; MANAGEMENT; INHIBITOR; SURVIVAL	Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive fibrotic lung disease that distorts pulmonary architecture, leading to hypoxia, respiratory failure, and death. Diagnosis is difficult because other interstitial lung diseases have similar radiological and histopathological characteristics. A usual interstitial pneumonia pattern is a hallmark of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and is essential for its diagnosis. We aimed to develop a molecular test that distinguishes usual interstitial pneumonia from other interstitial lung diseases in surgical lung biopsy samples. The eventual goal of this research is to develop a method to diagnose idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis without the patient having to undergo surgery. Methods We collected surgical lung biopsy samples from patients with various interstitial lung diseases at 11 hospitals in North America. Pathology diagnoses were confirmed by an expert panel. We measured RNA expression levels for 33 297 transcripts on microarrays in all samples. A classifier algorithm was trained on one set of samples and tested in a second set. We subjected a subset of samples to next-generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq) generating expression levels on 55 097 transcripts, and assessed a classifier trained on RNAseq data by cross-validation. Findings We took 125 surgical lung biopsies from 86 patients. 58 samples were identified by the expert panel as usual interstitial pneumonia, 23 as non-specific interstitial pneumonia, 16 as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, four as sarcoidosis, four as respiratory bronchiolitis, two as organising pneumonia, and 18 as subtypes other than usual interstitial pneumonia. The microarray classifier was trained on 77 samples and was assessed in a test set of 48 samples, for which it had a specificity of 92% (95% CI 81-100) and a sensitivity of 82% (64-95). Based on a subset of 36 samples, the RNAseq classifier had a specificity of 95% (84-100) and a sensitivity of 59% (35-82). Interpretation Our results show that the development of a genomic signature that predicts usual interstitial pneumonia is feasible. These findings are an important first step towards the development of a molecular test that could be applied to bronchoscopy samples, thus avoiding surgery in the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Prognostic biomarkers of IFNb therapy in multiple sclerosis patients	MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS JOURNAL			English	Article						Biomarker; interferon beta; multiple sclerosis; bioinformatics; prognostic; RNA	SUBCUTANEOUS INTERFERON BETA-1A; NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; PROTEIN EXPRESSION; DOUBLE-BLIND; BAFF LEVELS; MXA; INDUCTION; CELLS; MECHANISMS; PROFILES	Background: Interferon beta (IFNb) reduces relapse frequency and disability progression in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Objectives: Early identification of prognostic biomarkers of IFNb-treated patients will allow more effective management of MS. Methods: The IMPROVE study evaluated subcutaneous IFNb versus placebo in 180 patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Magnetic resonance imaging scans, clinical assessments, and blood samples were obtained at baseline and every 4 weeks from every participant. Thirty-nine biomarkers (32 transcripts; seven proteins) were studied in 155 patients from IMPROVE. Therapeutic response was defined by absence of new combined unique lesions, relapses, and sustained increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale over 1 year. A machine learning approach was used to examine the association between biomarker expression and treatment response. Results: While baseline levels of individual genes were relatively poor predictors, combinations of three genes were able to identify subjects with sub-optimal therapeutic responses. The triplet CASP2/IRF4/IRF6, previously identified in an independent dataset, was tested among other combinations. This triplet showed acceptable predictive accuracy (0.68) and specificity (0.88), but had relatively low sensitivity (0.22) resulting in an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.63. Other combinations of biomarkers resulted in AUC of up to 0.80 (e.g. CASP2/IL10/IL12Rb1). Conclusions: Baseline expression, or induction ratios, of specific gene combinations correlate with future therapeutic response to IFNb, and have the potential to be prognostically useful.

The study of first episode psychosis is of particular interest because the confounding role of chronicity and medication can be excluded. The aim of this work is to automatically discriminate first episode psychosis patients and normal controls on the basis of brain perfusion employing a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. 35 normal controls and 35 first episode psychosis underwent dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebral blood flow and volume, along with mean transit time were obtained. We investigated their behavior in the whole brain and in selected regions of interest, in particular the left and right frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes, insula, caudate and cerebellum. The distribution of values of perfusion indexeswere used as features in a support vector machine classifier. Mean values of blood flow and volume were slightly lower in patients, and the difference reached statistical significance in the right caudate, left and right frontal lobes, and in left cerebellum. Linear SVM reached an accuracy of 83% in the classification of patients and normal controls, with the highest accuracy associated with the right frontal lobe and left parietal lobe. In conclusion, we found evidence that brain perfusion could be used as a potential marker to classify patients with psychosis, who show reduced blood flow and volume in respect to normal controls.

Such systems typically weight the sentiment conveyed by text segments in accordance with these segments' roles in the structure of a text, as identified by deep linguistic processing. Conversely, state-of-the-art machine learning polarity classifiers typically aim to exploit patterns in vector representations of texts, mostly covering the occurrence of words or word groups in these texts. However, since structural aspects of content have been shown to contain valuable information as well, we propose to use structure-based features in vector representations of text. We evaluate the usefulness of our novel features on collections of English reviews in various domains. Our experimental results suggest that, even though word-based features are indispensable to good polarity classifiers, structure-based sentiment information provides valuable additional guidance that can help significantly improve the polarity classification performance of machine learning classifiers. The most informative features capture the sentiment conveyed by specific rhetorical,elements that constitute a text's core or provide crucial contextual information. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Although prior research has shown that diagnostic and treatment recommendations might be altered based on the severity of comorbidities, chronic diseases are still being investigated in isolation from one another in most cases. To illustrate the significance of concurrent chronic diseases in the course of treatment, this study uses SEER's cancer data to create two comorbid data sets: one for breast and female genital cancers and another for prostate and urinal cancers. Several popular machine learning techniques are then applied to the resultant data sets to build predictive models. Comparison of the results shows that having more information about comorbid conditions of patients can improve models' predictive power, which in turn, can help practitioners make better diagnostic and treatment decisions. Therefore, proper identification, recording, and use of patients' comorbidity status can potentially lower treatment costs and ease the healthcare related economic challenges. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The purchase trends of personal computers have started decreasing whereas the shipment of mobile devices is increasing. In addition, the increasing power of mobile devices along with portability characteristics has attracted the attention of users. Not only are such devices popular among users, but they are favorite targets of attackers. The number of mobile malware is rapidly on the rise with malicious activities, such as stealing users data, sending premium messages and making phone call to premium numbers that users have no knowledge. Numerous studies have developed methods to thwart such attacks. In order to develop an effective detection system, we have to select a subset of features from hundreds of available features. In this paper, we studied 100 research works published between 2010 and 2014 with the perspective of feature selection in mobile malware detection. We categorize available features into four groups, namely, static features, dynamic features, hybrid features and applications metadata. Additionally, we discuss datasets used in the recent research studies as well as analyzing evaluation measures utilized. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Though an intrusion detection system (IDS) detects attacks efficiently, it also generates a large number of false alerts, which makes it difficult for a system administrator to identify attacks. This paper proposes automatic fuzzy rule generation combined with a Wiener filter to identify attacks. Further, to optimize the results, simplified swarm optimization is used. After training a large dataset, various fuzzy rules are generated automatically for testing, and a Wiener filter is used to filter out attacks that act as noisy data, which improves the accuracy of the detection. By combining automatic fuzzy rule generation with a Wiener filter, an IDS can handle intrusion detection more efficiently. Experimental results, which are based on collected live network data, are discussed and show that the proposed method provides a competitively high detection rate and a reduced false alarm rate in comparison with other existing machine learning techniques.

When this variable is nominal, we have a problem of class imbalance that was thoroughly studied within machine learning. For regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous, few works exist addressing this type of problem. Still, important applications involve forecasting rare extreme values of a continuous target variable. This paper describes a contribution to this type of tasks. Namely, we propose to address such tasks by resampling approaches that change the distribution of the given data set to decrease the problem of imbalance between the rare target cases and the most frequent ones. We present two modifications of well-known resampling strategies for classification tasks: the under-sampling and the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) methods. These modifications allow the use of these strategies on regression tasks where the goal is to forecast rare extreme values of the target variable. In an extensive set of experiments, we provide empirical evidence for the superiority of our proposals for these particular regression tasks. The proposed resampling methods can be used with any existing regression algorithm, which means that they are general tools for addressing problems of forecasting rare extreme values of a continuous target variable.

Quantitative measures of protein dynamics in vivo are therefore highly useful for elucidating specific regulatory pathways. Using a combinatorial approach of yeast synthetic genetic array technology, high-content screening, and machine learning classifiers, we developed an automated platform to characterize protein localization and abundance patterns from images of log phase cells from the open-reading frame-green fluorescent protein collection in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For each protein, we produced quantitative profiles of localization scores for 16 subcellular compartments at single-cell resolution to trace proteome-wide relocalization in conditions over time. We generated a collection of similar to 300,000 micrographs, comprising more than 20 million cells and similar to 9 billion quantitative measurements. The images depict the localization and abundance dynamics of more than 4000 proteins under two chemical treatments and in a selected mutant background. Here, we describe CYCLoPs (Collection of Yeast Cells Localization Patterns), a web database resource that provides a central platform for housing and analyzing our yeast proteome dynamics datasets at the single cell level. CYCLoPs version 1.0 is available at http://cyclops.ccbr.utoronto.ca.

The attentional landscape is a more general, dynamic and a more complex concept of an arrangement of spatial attention than the popular "attentional spotlight" or "zoom-lens" models of attention. Motor-priming of attention is a mechanism for prioritizing visual processing to motor-relevant parts of the visual field, in contrast to other, motor-irrelevant, parts. In particular, we present two techniques for constructing a visual "attentional landscape". The first, more general, technique, is to devote visual attention to the reachable space of a robot (peripersonal space-primed attention). The second, more specialized, technique is to allocate visual attention with respect to motor plans of the robot (motor plans-primed attention). Hence, in our model, visual attention is not exclusively defined in terms of visual saliency in color, texture or intensity cues, it is rather modulated by motor information. This computational model is inspired by recent findings in visual neuroscience and psychology. In addition to two approaches to constructing the attentional landscape, we present two methods for using the attentional landscape for driving visual processing. We show that motor-priming of visual attention can be used to very efficiently distribute limited computational resources devoted to the visual processing. The proposed model is validated in a series of experiments conducted with the iCub robot, both using the simulator and the real robot.

To eliminate the dependence on the instantaneous channel state information, a lower bound on the average SLNR is derived by assuming zero-forcing (ZF) inner beamforming, and an outer beamformer design method that maximizes the lower bound on the average SLNR is proposed. It is shown that the proposed SLNR-based outer beamformer design problem reduces to a trace quotient problem (TQP), which is often encountered in the field of machine learning. An iterative algorithm is presented to obtain an optimal solution to the proposed TQP. The proposed method has the capability of optimally controlling the weighting factor between the signal power to the desired user and the interference leakage power to undesired users according to different channel statistics. Numerical results show that the proposed outer beamformer design method yields significant performance gain over existing methods.

Random Forests is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that has been successfully applied to large-scale data analysis across vast biomedical disciplines, though rarely in psychiatric research or for application to longitudinal data. When provided with 795 raw and composite scores primarily from baseline measures, Random Forest regression prediction explained 50.8% (5000-run average, 95% bootstrap confidence interval [CI]: 50.3-51.3%) of the variance in proportion of time spent remitted. Machine performance improved when only the most predictive 24 items were used in a reduced analysis. Consistently high-ranked predictors of longitudinal remission included Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) items, NEO items and subscale scores, Y-BOCS symptom checklist cleaning/washing compulsion score, and several self-report items from social adjustment scales. Random Forest classification was able to distinguish participants according to binary remission outcomes with an error rate of 24.6% (95% bootstrap CI: 22.9-26.2%). Our results suggest that clinically-useful prediction of remission may not require an extensive battery of measures. Rather, a small set of assessment items may efficiently distinguish high- and lower-risk patients and inform clinical decision-making. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

(2) How different? (3) How do we measure that difference? (4) If we want to combine algorithms, what algorithms and combinators should be tried? This research proposes COD (Classifier Output Difference) distance as a diversity metric. COD separates difference from accuracy, COD goes beyond accuracy to consider differences in output behavior as the basis for comparison. The paper extends earlier on COD by giving a basic comparison to other diversity metrics, and by giving an example of using COD data as a predictive model from which to select algorithms to include in an ensemble. COD may fill a niche in metalearning as a predictive aid to selecting algorithms for ensembles and hybrid systems by providing a simple, straightforward, computationally reasonable alternative to other approaches.

Designed to enhance the political competence of citizens, VAAs have become increasingly popular and institutionally embedded in a growing number of European countries. While the traditional VAA relied on the stated position or academically coded position of parties/candidates, a recent innovation has been to introduce a social vote recommendation borrowing the basic principles of collaborative filtering. The latter takes advantage of the community of VAA users to provide a vote recommendation. This paper provides an overview of the social vote recommendation scheme and tackles three problems related to its optimal implementation in a real-world setting: (1) the number of samples required to train party models; (2) whether this number is affected by differences in characteristics between early users versus late users; and (3) whether generalizations can be derived across VAA applications in different countries. For our experiments we use three real VAA datasets based on elections in Greece 2012, Cyprus 2013 and Germany 2013. The corresponding datasets are made freely available to other researchers working in the areas of VAA and web based recommender systems.

Motivated by continuity preservation, the SDPP is a linear projection method where the proximity relations between points in the low-dimensional subspace mimic the proximity relations between points in the response space. Such a projection facilitates the design of efficient regression models and it may also uncover useful information for visualisation. An experimental evaluation is conducted to show the performance of the SDPP and compare it with a number of state-of-the-art approaches for unsupervised and supervised dimensionality reduction. The regression step after projection is performed using computationally light models with low maintenance cost like Multiple Linear Regression and Locally Linear Regression with k-NN neighbourhoods. For the evaluation, a benchmark and a full-scale calibration problem are discussed. The case studies pertain the estimation of a number of chemico-physical properties in diesel fuels and in light cycle oils, starting from near-infrared spectra.

In the presented method, fault signals (e.g. currents, voltages, etc.) are collected from accessible nodes of circuits, and then signal processing techniques (e.g. Fourier analysis, wavelet transform, etc.) are adopted to extract feature samples, which are subsequently used to perform offline machine learning. Finally, the SVDD classifier is used to implement fault classification task. However, in some cases, the conventional SVDD cannot achieve good classification performance, because this classifier may generate some so-called refusal areas (RAs), and in our design these RAs are resolved with the one-against-one support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The obtained experiment results from simulated and actual circuits demonstrate that the improved SVDD has a classification performance close to the conventional one-against-one SVM, and can be applied to fault classification of PECs in practice.

J	Lotte, F				Lotte, Fabien			Signal Processing Approaches to Minimize or Suppress Calibration Time in Oscillatory Activity-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE			English	Article						Brain-computer interfaces (BCI); calibration; electroencephalography (EEG); machine learning; signal processing; small sample settings	COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERN; MOTOR IMAGERY; EEG CLASSIFICATION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; SUBJECT TRANSFER; BCI; PERFORMANCE; ALGORITHMS; FRAMEWORK; IMPROVE	One of the major limitations of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) is their long calibration time, which limits their use in practice, both by patients and healthy users alike. Such long calibration times are due to the large between-user variability and thus to the need to collect numerous training electroencephalography (EEG) trials for the machine learning algorithms used in BCI design. In this paper, we first survey existing approaches to reduce or suppress calibration time, these approaches being notably based on regularization, user-to-user transfer, semi-supervised learning and a priori physiological information. We then propose new tools to reduce BCI calibration time. In particular, we propose to generate artificial EEG trials from the few EEG trials initially available, in order to augment the training set size. These artificial EEG trials are obtained by relevant combinations and distortions of the original trials available. We propose three different methods to do so. We also propose a new, fast and simple approach to perform user-to-user transfer for BCI. Finally, we study and compare offline different approaches, both old and new ones, on the data of 50 users from three different BCI data sets. This enables us to identify guidelines about how to reduce or suppress calibration time for BCI.

At the same time, a small set of machine-learning algorithms (especially Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks, i.e., CNNs and DNNs) are proving to be state-of-the-art across many applications. As architectures evolve toward heterogeneous multicores composed of a mix of cores and accelerators, a machine-learning accelerator can achieve the rare combination of efficiency (due to the small number of target algorithms) and broad application scope. Until now, most machine-learning accelerator designs have been focusing on efficiently implementing the computational part of the algorithms. However, recent state-of-the-art CNNs and DNNs are characterized by their large size. In this study, we design an accelerator for large-scale CNNs and DNNs, with a special emphasis on the impact of memory on accelerator design, performance, and energy. We show that it is possible to design an accelerator with a high throughput, capable of performing 452 GOP/s (key NN operations such as synaptic weight multiplications and neurons outputs additions) in a small footprint of 3.02 mm(2) and 485mW; compared to a 128-bit 2GHz SIMD processor, the accelerator is 117.87x faster, and it can reduce the total energy by 21.08x. The accelerator characteristics are obtained after layout at 65nm. Such a high throughput in a small footprint can open up the usage of state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms in a broad set of systems and for a broad set of applications.

J	Lee, S				Lee, Sihyung			Detection of Political Manipulation in Online Communities through Measures of Effort and Collaboration	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON THE WEB			English	Article						Online social media; opinion manipulation; political manipulation; machine learning		Online social media allow users to interact with one another by sharing opinions, and these opinions have a critical impact on the way readers think and behave. Accordingly, an increasing number of manipulators deliberately spread messages to influence the public, often in an organized manner. In particular, political manipulation-manipulation of opponents to win political advantage-can result in serious consequences: antigovernment riots can break out, leading to candidates' defeat in an election. A few approaches have been proposed to detect such manipulation based on the level of social interaction (i.e., manipulators actively post opinions but infrequently befriend and reply to other users). However, several studies have shown that the interactions can be forged at a low cost and thus may not be effective measures of manipulation. To go one step further, we collect a dataset for real, large-scale political manipulation, which consists of opinions found on Internet forums. These opinions are divided into manipulators and nonmanipulators. Using this collection, we demonstrate that manipulators inevitably work hard, in teams, to quickly influence a large audience. With this in mind, it could be said that a high level of collaborative efforts strongly indicates manipulation. For example, a group of manipulators may jointly post numerous opinions with a consistent theme and selectively recommend the same, well-organized opinion to promote its rank. We show that the effort measures, when combined with a supervised learning algorithm, successfully identify greater than 95% of the manipulators. We believe that the proposed method will help system administrators to accurately detect manipulators in disguise, significantly decreasing the intensity of manipulation.

Effect of training characteristics on object classification: An application using Boosted Decision Trees	ASTRONOMY AND COMPUTING			English	Article						Techniques: photometric; Catalogs; Supervised learning by classification	STAR-GALAXY CLASSIFICATION; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFT PDFS; PARTICLE IDENTIFICATION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; CATALOG; INFORMATION; SEPARATION; MACHINE; IMAGES	We present an application of a particular machine-learning method (Boosted Decision Trees, BDTs using AdaBoost) to separate stars and galaxies in photometric images using their catalog characteristics. BDTs are a well established machine learning technique used for classification purposes. They have been widely used specially in the field of particle and astroparticle physics, and we use them here In an optical astronomy application. This algorithm is able to improve from simple thresholding cuts on standard separation variables that may be affected by local effects such as blending, badly calculated background levels or which do not include information in other bands. The improvements are shown using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 9, with respect to the type photometric classifier. We obtain an improvement in the impurity of the galaxy sample of a factor 2-4 for this particular dataset, adjusting for the same efficiency of the selection. Another main goal of this study is to verify the effects that different input vectors and training sets have on the classification performance, the results being of wider use to other machine learning techniques.

J	Fisher, CK; Mehta, P				Fisher, Charles K.; Mehta, Pankaj			Bayesian feature selection for high-dimensional linear regression via the Ising approximation with applications to genomics	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							VARIABLE SELECTION; WIDE ASSOCIATION; COMPLEX TRAITS; ALGORITHMS; CHALLENGES; SPACE; LASSO	Motivation: Feature selection, identifying a subset of variables that are relevant for predicting a response, is an important and challenging component of many methods in statistics and machine learning. Feature selection is especially difficult and computationally intensive when the number of variables approaches or exceeds the number of samples, as is often the case for many genomic datasets. Results: Here, we introduce a new approach-the Bayesian Ising Approximation (BIA)-to rapidly calculate posterior probabilities for feature relevance in L2 penalized linear regression. In the regime where the regression problem is strongly regularized by the prior, we show that computing the marginal posterior probabilities for features is equivalent to computing the magnetizations of an Ising model with weak couplings. Using a mean field approximation, we show it is possible to rapidly compute the feature selection path described by the posterior probabilities as a function of the L2 penalty. We present simulations and analytical results illustrating the accuracy of the BIA on some simple regression problems. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the BIA to high-dimensional regression by analyzing a gene expression dataset with nearly 30 000 features. These results also highlight the impact of correlations between features on Bayesian feature selection.

New combinations of compounds need to be predicted in order to design HAART cocktails. On the one hand, there are the biomolecular factors related to the drugs in the cocktail (experimental measure, chemical structure, drug target, assay organisms, etc.); on the other hand, there are the socioeconomic factors of the specific population (income inequalities, employment levels, fiscal pressure, education, migration, population structure, etc.) to study the relationship between the socioeconomic status and the disease. In this context, machine learning algorithms, able to seek models for problems with multi-source data, have to be used. In this work, the first artificial neural network (ANN) model is proposed for the prediction of HAART cocktails, to halt AIDS on epidemic networks of U.S. counties using information indices that codify both biomolecular and several socioeconomic factors. The data was obtained from at least three major sources. The first dataset included assays of anti-HIV chemical compounds released to ChEMBL. The second dataset is the AIDSVu database of Emory University. AIDSVu compiled AIDS prevalence for >2300 U.S. counties. The third data set included socioeconomic data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Three scales or levels were employed to group the counties according to the location or population structure codes: state, rural urban continuum code (RUCC) and urban influence code (UIC). An analysis of >130,000 pairs (network links) was performed, corresponding to AIDS prevalence in 2310 counties in U.S. vs. drug cocktails made up of combinations of ChEMBL results for 21,582 unique drugs, 9 viral or human protein targets, 4856 protocols, and 10 possible experimental measures. The best model found with the original data was a linear neural network (LNN) with AUROC > 0.80 and accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity approximate to 77% in training and external validation series. The change of the spatial and population structure scale (State, UIC, or RUCC codes) does not affect the quality of the model. Unbalance was detected in all the models found comparing positive/negative cases and linear/non-linear model accuracy ratios. Using synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE), data pre-processing and machine-learning algorithms implemented into the WEKA software, more balanced models were found. In particular, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with AUROCC 97.4% and precision, recall, and F-measure >90% was found. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Allele frequency calibration for SNP based genotyping of DNA pools: A regression based local-global error fusion method	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Allele frequency calibration; DNA pooling; SNP genotyping; Microarray; Machine learning		Background: The costs associated with developing high density microarray technologies are prohibitive for genotyping animals when there is low economic value associated with a single animal (e.g. prawns). DNA pooling is an attempt to address this issue by combining multiple DNA samples prior to genotyping. Instead of genotyping the DNA samples of the individuals, a mixture of DNA samples (i.e. the pool) from the individuals is genotyped only once. This greatly reduces the cost of genotyping. Pooled samples are subject to greater genotyping inaccuracies than individual samples. Wrong genotyping will lead to wrong biological conclusions. It is thus required to calibrate the resulting genotypes (allele frequencies). Methods: We present a regression based approach to translate raw array output to allele frequency. During training, few pools and the individuals that constitute the pools are genotyped. Given the genotypes of individuals that constitute the pool, we compute the true allele frequency. We then train a regression algorithm to produce a mapping between the raw array outputs to the true allele frequency. We test the algorithm using pool samples withheld from the training set. During prediction, we use this map to genotype pools with no prior knowledge of the individuals constituting the pools. Results and discussion: After data quality control we have available a dataset comprised of 912 pools. We estimate allele frequency using three approaches: the raw data, a commonly used piecewise linear transformation, and the proposed local-global learner fusion method. The resulting RMS errors for the three approaches are 0.135, 0.120, and 0.080 respectively. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A new machine learning approach for predicting the response to anemia treatment in a large cohort of End Stage Renal Disease patients undergoing dialysis	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Prediction; Hemoglobin; Chronic Kidney Disease; Anemia; Machine learning	CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE; GLOBAL OUTCOMES KDIGO; HEMODIALYSIS-PATIENTS; POSITION STATEMENT; CELL SURVIVAL; ERYTHROPOIETIN; MANAGEMENT; RED; INDIVIDUALIZATION; OPTIMIZATION	Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) anemia is one of the main common comorbidities in patients undergoing End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Iron supplement and especially Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA) have become the treatment of choice for that anemia. However, it is very complicated to find an adequate treatment for every patient in each particular situation since dosage guidelines are based on average behaviors, and thus, they do not take into account the particular response to those drugs by different patients, although that response may vary enormously from one patient to another and even for the same patient in different stages of the anemia. This work proposes an advance with respect to previous works that have faced this problem using different methodologies (Machine Learning (ML), among others), since the diversity of the CKD population has been explicitly taken into account in order to produce a general and reliable model for the prediction of ESA/Iron therapy response. Furthermore, the ML model makes use of both human physiology and drug pharmacology to produce a model that outperforms previous approaches, yielding Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) of the Hemoglobin (Hb) prediction around or lower than 0.6 g/dl in the three countries analyzed in the study, namely, Spain, Italy and Portugal.

Previous hybrid analog CMOS-memristor approaches required extensive CMOS circuitry for training, and thus eliminated most of the density advantages gained by the adoption of memristor synapses. Further, they used different waveforms for pre and post-synaptic spikes that added undesirable circuit overhead. Here we describe a hardware architecture that can feature a large number of memristor synapses to learn real-world patterns. We present a versatile CMOS neuron that combines integrate-and-fire behavior, drives passive memristors and implements competitive learning in a compact circuit module, and enables in situ plasticity in the memristor synapses. We demonstrate handwritten-digits recognition using the proposed architecture using transistor-level circuit simulations. As the described neuromorphic architecture is homogeneous, it realizes a fundamental building block for large-scale energy-efficient brain-inspired silicon chips that could lead to next-generation cognitive computing.

PolyNet: A Polynomial-Based Learning Machine for Universal Approximation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Artificial neural networks (ANNs); group method of data handling (GMDH); industrial electronics (IE); machine learning (ML); multivariate regression; polynomial networks	FUNCTION NEURAL-NETWORK; FUZZY; SYSTEMS; SUPPORT; VECTOR; AWARENESS	Currently, there is a need in all disciplines for efficient and powerful machine learning (ML) algorithms for handling offline and real-time nonlinear data. Industrial applications abound from real-time control systems to modeling and simulation of complex systems and processes. Certain ML methods have become popular with researchers and engineers. Such techniques include fuzzy systems (FSs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), radial basis function (RBF) networks, and support vector regression (SVR) machines. Historically, polynomial-based learning machines (PLMs) based on the group method of data handling (GMDH) model have enjoyed usage similar to that of these other methods. However, unwieldy kernel functions in the form of large high-order polynomials, and relatively limited computer speed and capacity, have limited the use of PLMs to comparatively small problems with low dimensionality and simple functional relationships. Thus, true polynomial-based ML solutions have drifted out of vogue for at least two decades. This work attempts to reinvigorate the interest in PLMs by introducing a novel practical implementation called PolyNet. It will be shown that once certain algorithms are applied to the generation, training, and functional operation of PLMs, they can compete on par with or better than methods currently in use.

PdM is a prominent strategy for dealing with maintenance issues given the increasing need to minimize downtime and associated costs. One of the challenges with PdM is generating the so-called "health factors," or quantitative indicators, of the status of a system associated with a given maintenance issue, and determining their relationship to operating costs and failure risk. The proposed PdM methodology allows dynamical decision rules to be adopted for maintenance management, and can be used with high-dimensional and censored data problems. This is achieved by training multiple classification modules with different prediction horizons to provide different performance tradeoffs in terms of frequency of unexpected breaks and unexploited lifetime, and then employing this information in an operating cost-based maintenance decision system to minimize expected costs. The effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated using a simulated example and a benchmark semiconductor manufacturing maintenance problem.

Positron emission tomography (PET) systems that require regular calibrations by qualified scanner operators are good candidates for such continuous improvements. Furthermore, for scanners employing one-to-one coupling of crystals to photodetectors to achieve enhanced spatial resolution and contrast, the calibration task is even more daunting because of the large number of independent channels involved. To cope with the additional complexity of the calibration and quality control procedures of these scanners, an intelligent system (IS) was designed to perform fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) of malfunctioning channels. The IS can be broken down into four hierarchical modules: parameter extraction, diagnosis, channel fault detection and fault prioritization. Of these modules, parameter extraction and fault detection have previously been reported and this paper focuses on diagnosis, improved fault detection and fault prioritization. The status diagnosis module will diagnose all channels and propose an explanation of the reasons that lead to the diagnosis. The purpose of the fault prioritization module is to help the operator to zero in on the faults that need immediate attention. The FDD system was implemented on a LabPET avalanche photodiode (APD)-based digital PET scanner. Experiments demonstrated a FDD Sensitivity of 99.9% (with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [99.6, 100.0]) for major faults. Globally, the balanced accuracy of the diagnosis for varying fault severities is 91%. This suggests the IS can greatly benefit the operators in their maintenance task.

However, the burden of choosing the appropriate kernel function and its parameters is left to the user. This paper presents an effective general Gaussian kernel parameter selection method for multiclass pattern classification. Unlike the standard single scale Gaussian kernel, the general Gaussian kernel adopts some linear transformations of the input space such that not only the scaling but also the rotation is adapted. We propose to optimize the general Gaussian kernel parameters by maximizing a newly presented kernel evaluation criterion named multiclass kernel polarization (MKP), and this problem is solved through a gradient-based optimization technique. MKP makes full use of all the training samples available and can assess the quality of a kernel in the multiclass classification scenario. The experiments with several UCI data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, the load of food waste to the conventional waste treatment process might lead to the high concentration of total nitrogen (T-N) impact on the effluent water quality. The objective of this study is to establish two machine learning models-artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), in order to predict 1-day interval T-N concentration of effluent from a wastewater treatment plant in Ulsan, Korea. Daily water quality data and meteorological data were used and the performance of both models was evaluated in terms of the coefficient of determination (R-2), Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE), relative efficiency criteria (d(rel)). Additionally, Latin-Hypercube one-factor-at-a-time (LH-OAT) and a pattern search algorithm were applied to sensitivity analysis and model parameter optimization, respectively. Results showed that both models could be effectively applied to the 1-day interval prediction of T-N concentration of effluent. SVM model showed a higher prediction accuracy in the training stage and similar result in the validation stage. However, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the ANN model was a superior model for 1-day interval T-N concentration prediction in terms of the cause-and-effect relationship between T-N concentration and modeling input values to integrated food waste and waste water treatment. This study suggested the efficient and robust nonlinear time-series modeling method for an early prediction of the water quality of integrated food waste and waste water treatment process.

Many algorithms in machine learning have been proposed for automatic recognition of cardiac arrhythmias. Theoretical and empirical studies have demonstrated that an ensemble of classifiers is typically more accurate than a single classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel classifier set selection by introducing a search algorithm applied to the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia. The optimal classifier set is selected according to the performance of each classifier during the learning phase. The selection is also made according to diversity among classifiers based on the computation of their statistical dependence, especially the Q-Statistic measurement. The proposed search algorithm is tested through several classifiers. A set Of independent classifiers is combined by fixed rules such as product, mean, and majority voting among others. These tests are applied on the UCI Cardiac Arrhythmia data set. The feature dimension is reduced using CFS (Correlation based Feature Selection) algorithm with heuristic search strategies Best-First. The results of experiments demonstrate the efficiency of classifiers ensemble using our method compared to the literature.	[Boublenza, Amina; Chikh, M.

Machine based malarial parasite analysis and recognition has opened a new area for early malaria detection that showed potential to overcome the drawbacks of manual strategies. The aim of this paper is to review, analyze, categorize and address the recent developments of machine assisted malarial parasite recognition using machine learning approach based on microscopic images of peripheral blood smears. Materials and Methods: Although, malaria cell segmentation and morphological analysis is a challenging problem due to both the complex cell nature uncertainty in microscopic videos. To improve the performance of malaria parasite segmentation and classification, many researchers have presented camera based approach. We intend to bring the current state of art, future directions and summarize the open problems. Results and Discussion: The literature is reviewed in an explicit segmentation and machine learning framework, the components of which are preprocessing, feature extraction and selection, classification, and evaluation. Conclusion: The accuracy can be improved by using hyperspectral imaging and adding the expert knowledge through neuro-fuzzy.

Cancer develops progressively from an alteration in a cell's genetic structure. This change results in cells with uncontrolled growth patterns. Cancer classification is made according to the site of origin of the malignant cells. This classification describes the type of tissue in which the cancer cells begin to develop. Here we used three common examples of site of origin classification: Lymphoma, Leukemia and SRBCT. The objective of this paper is to develop an effective machine learning approaches for cancer classification, which could provide reliable cancer classification with better accuracy. The work comprises of two steps. In the first step, using Analysis of VAriance (ANOVA) ranking scheme to choose the important genes. The second step involves the classification task using an efficient classifier. In this paper we use the three efficient machine learning classifiers such as Fast Support Vector Machine Learning (FSVML), Fast Extreme Learning Machine Learning (FELML) and Relevance Vector Machine Learning (RVMMLML). The investigational values are computed using three site of origin classification namely Lymphoma, Leukemia and SRBCT. The results are interpreted in terms of Testing Accuracy and Training Time. From the investigational results, it is concluded that the proposed RVMMLML machine learning approach gives better testing accuracy results for all the datasets considered.

This paper investigates the possibility of forecasting spikes in social tension - defined by the UK police service as "any incident that would tend to show that the normal relationship between individuals or groups has seriously deteriorated" - through social media. A number of different computational methods were trialed to detect spikes in tension using a human coded sample of data collected from Twitter, relating to an accusation of racial abuse during a Premier League football match. Conversation analysis combined with syntactic and lexicon-based text mining rules; sentiment analysis; and machine learning methods was tested as a possible approach. Results indicate that a combination of conversation analysis methods and text mining outperforms a number of machine learning approaches and a sentiment analysis tool at classifying tension levels in individual tweets.

However, a well-known conundrum of SVMs (and other supervised learning methods) is the black box character of their predictions, which makes it difficult to understand why models succeed or fail. Herein we introduce an approach to rationalize the performance of SVM models based upon the Tanimoto kernel compared with the linear kernel. Model comparison and interpretation are facilitated by a visualization technique, making it possible to identify descriptor features that determine compound activity predictions.

Application to ADME/Tox and Drug Discovery Datasets	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							THROUGHPUT SCREENING DATA; BRAIN-BARRIER PERMEABILITY; CHEMISTRY DEVELOPMENT KIT; GENE POTASSIUM CHANNEL; IN-SILICO PHARMACOLOGY; X-RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; QSAR MODELS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; LIPOPHILICITY DETERMINATION; APPLICABILITY DOMAIN	On the order of hundreds of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/Tox) models have been described in the literature in the past decade which are more often than not inaccessible to anyone but their authors. Public accessibility is also an issue with computational models for bioactivity, and the ability to share such models still remains a major challenge limiting drug discovery. We describe the creation of a reference implementation of a Bayesian model-building software module, which we have released as an open source component that is now included in the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) project, as well as implemented in the CDD Vault and in several mobile apps. We use this implementation to build an array of Bayesian models for ADME/Tox, in vitro and in vivo bioactivity, and other physicochemical properties. We show that these models possess cross-validation receiver operator curve values comparable to those generated previously in prior publications using alternative tools. We have now described how the implementation of Bayesian models with FCFP6 descriptors generated in the CDD Vault enables the rapid production of robust machine learning models from public data or the user's own datasets. The current study sets the stage for generating models in proprietary software (such as CDD) and exporting these models in a format that could be run in open source software using CDK components. This work also demonstrates that we can enable biocomputation across distributed private or public datasets to enhance drug discovery.

J	Boyer, C; Dolamic, L				Boyer, Celia; Dolamic, Ljiljana			Automated Detection of HONcode Website Conformity Compared to Manual Detection: An Evaluation	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						HONcode; classification; artificial intelligence; natural language processing; quality standards	HEALTH INFORMATION; INTERNET; QUALITY; RETRIEVAL	Background: To earn HONcode certification, a website must conform to the 8 principles of the HONcode of Conduct In the current manual process of certification, a HONcode expert assesses the candidate website using precise guidelines for each principle. In the scope of the European project KHRESMOI, the Health on the Net (HON) Foundation has developed an automated system to assist in detecting a website's HONcode conformity. Automated assistance in conducting HONcode reviews can expedite the current time-consuming tasks of HONcode certification and ongoing surveillance. Additionally, an automated tool used as a plugin to a general search engine might help to detect health websites that respect HONcode principles but have not yet been certified. Objective: The goal of this study was to determine whether the automated system is capable of performing as good as human experts for the task of identifying HONcode principles on health websites. Methods: Using manual evaluation by HONcode senior experts as a baseline, this study compared the capability of the automated HONcode detection system to that of the HONcode senior experts. A set of 27 health-related websites were manually assessed for compliance to each of the 8 HONcode principles by senior HONcode experts. The same set of websites were processed by the automated system for HONcode compliance detection based on supervised machine learning. The results obtained by these two methods were then compared. Results: For the privacy criterion, the automated system obtained the same results as the human expert for 17 of 27 sites (14 true positives and 3 true negatives) without noise (0 false positives). The remaining 10 false negative instances for the privacy criterion represented tolerable behavior because it is important that all automatically detected principle conformities are accurate (ie, specificity [100%] is preferred over sensitivity [58%] for the privacy criterion). In addition, the automated system had precision of at least 75%, with a recall of more than 50% for contact details (100% precision, 69% recall), authority (85% precision, 52% recall), and reference (75% precision, 56% recall). The results also revealed issues for some criteria such as date. Changing the "document" definition (ie, using the sentence instead of whole document as a unit of classification) within the automated system resolved some but not all of them. Conclusions: Study results indicate concordance between automated and expert manual compliance detection for authority, privacy, reference, and contact details. Results also indicate that using the same general parameters for automated detection of each criterion produces suboptimal results. Future work to configure optimal system parameters for each HONcode principle would improve results. The potential utility of integrating automated detection of HONcode conformity into future search engines is also discussed.

Objective: We sought to measure whether exposure to negative opinions about human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines in Twitter communities is associated with the subsequent expression of negative opinions by explicitly measuring potential information exposure over the social structure of Twitter communities. Methods: We hypothesized that prior exposure to opinions rejecting the safety or value of HPV vaccines would be associated with an increased risk of posting similar opinions and tested this hypothesis by analyzing temporal sequences of messages posted on Twitter (tweets). The study design was a retrospective analysis of tweets related to HPV vaccines and the social connections between users. Between October 2013 and April 2014, we collected 83,551 English-language tweets that included terms related to HPV vaccines and the 957,865 social connections among 30,621 users posting or reposting the tweets. Tweets were classified as expressing negative or neutral/positive opinions using a machine learning classifier previously trained on a manually labeled sample. Results: During the 6-month period, 25.13% (20,994/83,551) of tweets were classified as negative; among the 30,621 users that tweeted about HPV vaccines, 9046 (29.54%) were exposed to a majority of negative tweets. The likelihood of a user posting a negative tweet after exposure to a majority of negative opinions was 37.78% (2780/7361) compared to 10.92% (1234/11,296) for users who were exposed to a majority of positive and neutral tweets corresponding to a relative risk of 3.46 (95% CI 3.25-3.67, P<.001). Conclusions: The heterogeneous community structure on Twitter appears to skew the information to which users are exposed in relation to HPV vaccines. We found that among users that tweeted about HPV vaccines, those who were more often exposed to negative opinions were more likely to subsequently post negative opinions. Although this research may be useful for identifying individuals and groups currently at risk of disproportionate exposure to misinformation about HPV vaccines, there is a clear need for studies capable of determining the factors that affect the formation and adoption of beliefs about public health interventions.

J	Kendra, RL; Karki, S; Eickholt, JL; Gandy, L				Kendra, Rachel Lynn; Karki, Suman; Eickholt, Jesse Lee; Gandy, Lisa			Characterizing the Discussion of Antibiotics in the Twittersphere: What is the Bigger Picture?	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						Twitter messaging; social media; Internet; Web mining; semi-supervised learning; neural network	HEALTH INFORMATION; NETWORKS; RESISTANCE; PRODUCTS	Background: User content posted through Twitter has been used for biosurveillance, to characterize public perception of health-related topics, and as a means of distributing information to the general public. Most of the existing work surrounding Twitter and health care has shown Twitter to be an effective medium for these problems but more could be done to provide finer and more efficient access to all pertinent data. Given the diversity of user-generated content, small samples or summary presentations of the data arguably omit a large part of the virtual discussion taking place in the Twittersphere. Still, managing, processing, and querying large amounts of Twitter data is not a trivial task. This work describes tools and techniques capable of handling larger sets of Twitter data and demonstrates their use with the issue of antibiotics. Objective: This work has two principle objectives: (1) to provide an open-source means to efficiently explore all collected tweets and query health-related topics on Twitter, specifically, questions such as what users are saying and how messages are spread, and (2) to characterize the larger discourse taking place on Twitter with respect to antibiotics. Methods: Open-source software suites Hadoop, Flume, and Hive were used to collect and query a large number of Twitter posts. To classify tweets by topic, a deep network classifier was trained using a limited number of manually classified tweets. The particular machine learning approach used also allowed the use of a large number of unclassified tweets to increase performance. Results: Query-based analysis of the collected tweets revealed that a large number of users contributed to the online discussion and that a frequent topic mentioned was resistance. A number of prominent events related to antibiotics led to a number of spikes in activity but these were short in duration. The category-based classifier developed was able to correctly classify 70% of manually labeled tweets (using a 10-fold cross validation procedure and 9 classes). The classifier also performed well when evaluated on a per category basis. Conclusions: Using existing tools such as Hive, Flume, Hadoop, and machine learning techniques, it is possible to construct tools and workflows to collect and query large amounts of Twitter data to characterize the larger discussion taking place on Twitter with respect to a particular health-related topic. Furthermore, using newer machine learning techniques and a limited number of manually labeled tweets, an entire body of collected tweets can be classified to indicate what topics are driving the virtual, online discussion. The resulting classifier can also be used to efficiently explore collected tweets by category and search for messages of interest or exemplary content.

Trent; Malin, Bradley			A Scalable Framework to Detect Personal Health Mentions on Twitter	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						consumer health; information retrieval; machine learning; social media; twitter; infodemiology	SOCIAL MEDIA; RECORDS	Background: Biomedical research has traditionally been conducted via surveys and the analysis of medical records. However, these resources are limited in their content, such that non-traditional domains (eg, online forums and social media) have an opportunity to supplement the view of an individual's health. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a scalable framework to detect personal health status mentions on Twitter and assess the extent to which such information is disclosed. Methods: We collected more than 250 million tweets via the Twitter streaming API over a 2-month period in 2014. The corpus was filtered down to approximately 250,000 tweets, stratified across 34 high-impact health issues, based on guidance from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We created a labeled corpus of several thousand tweets via a survey, administered over Amazon Mechanical Turk, that documents when terms correspond to mentions of personal health issues or an alternative (eg, a metaphor). We engineered a scalable classifier for personal health mentions via feature selection and assessed its potential over the health issues. We further investigated the utility of the tweets by determining the extent to which Twitter users disclose personal health status. Results: Our investigation yielded several notable findings. First, we find that tweets from a small subset of the health issues can train a scalable classifier to detect health mentions. Specifically, training on 2000 tweets from four health issues (cancer, depression, hypertension, and leukemia) yielded a classifier with precision of 0.77 on all 34 health issues. Second, Twitter users disclosed personal health status for all health issues. Notably, personal health status was disclosed over 50% of the time for 11 out of 34 (33%) investigated health issues. Third, the disclosure rate was dependent on the health issue in a statistically significant manner (P<.001). For instance, more than 80% of the tweets about migraines (83/100) and allergies (85/100) communicated personal health status, while only around 10% of the tweets about obesity (13/100) and heart attack (12/100) did so. Fourth, the likelihood that people disclose their own versus other people's health status was dependent on health issue in a statistically significant manner as well (P<.001). For example, 69% (69/100) of the insomnia tweets disclosed the author's status, while only 1%(1/100) disclosed another person's status. By contrast, 1% (1/100) of the Down syndrome tweets disclosed the author's status, while 21% (21/100) disclosed another person's status. Conclusions: It is possible to automatically detect personal health status mentions on Twitter in a scalable manner. These mentions correspond to the health issues of the Twitter users themselves, but also other individuals. Though this study did not investigate the veracity of such statements, we anticipate such information may be useful in supplementing traditional health-related sources for research purposes.

Aging- and Variation-Aware Delay Monitoring Using Representative Critical Path Selection	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS			English	Article						Reliability; Performance; Design; Reliability; performance; variations; transistor aging; monitoring	DIGITAL CIRCUITS; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; DESIGN; NBTI; DEGRADATION	Process together with runtime variations in temperature and voltage, as well as transistor aging, degrade path delay and may eventually induce circuit failure due to timing variations. Therefore, in-field tracking of path delays is essential, and to respond to this need, several delay sensor designs have been proposed in the literature. However, due to the significant overhead of these sensors and the large number of critical paths in today's IC, it is infeasible to monitor the delay of every critical path in silicon. We present an aging-and variationaware representative path selection technique based on machine learning that allows to measure the delay of a small set of paths and infer the delay of a larger pool of paths that are likely to fail due to delay variations. Simulation results for benchmark circuits highlight the accuracy of the proposed approach for predicting critical-path delay based on the selected representative paths.

This is surprisingly difficult for AI as it requires similar capabilities to what humans need for successfully interacting with the physical world, one of the grand challenges of AI. As such the competition offers a simplified and controlled environment for developing and testing the necessary AI technologies, a seamless integration of computer vision, machine learning, knowledge representation and reasoning, reasoning under uncertainty, planning, and heuristic search, among others. Over the past three years there have been significant improvements, but we are still a long way from reaching the ultimate aim, and thus, there are great opportunities for participants in this competition.

Primarily due to the plethora of electronically available data from the medical literature, the manual appraisal of the quality of evidence is a time-consuming process. We present a fully automatic approach for predicting the quality of medical evidence in order to aid practitioners at point-of-care. Methods: Our approach extracts relevant information from medical article abstracts and utilises data from a specialised corpus to apply supervised machine learning for the prediction of the quality grades. Following an in-depth analysis of the usefulness of features (e.g., publication types of articles), they are extracted from the text via rule-based approaches and from the meta-data associated with the articles, and then applied in the supervised classification model. We propose the use of a highly scalable and portable approach using a sequence of high precision classifiers, and introduce a simple evaluation metric called average error distance (AED) that simplifies the comparison of systems. We also perform elaborate human evaluations to compare the performance of our system against human judgments. Results: We test and evaluate our approaches on a publicly available, specialised, annotated corpus containing 1132 evidence-based recommendations. Our rule-based approach performs exceptionally well at the automatic extraction of publication types of articles, with F-scores of up to 0.99 for high-quality publication types. For evidence quality classification, our approach obtains an accuracy of 63.84% and an AED of 0.271. The human evaluations show that the performance of our system, in terms of AED and accuracy, is comparable to the performance of humans on the same data. Conclusions: The experiments suggest that our structured text classification framework achieves evaluation results comparable to those of human performance. Our overall classification approach and evaluation technique are also highly portable and can be used for various evidence grading scales. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

GTM-Based QSAR Models and Their Applicability Domains	MOLECULAR INFORMATICS			English	Article						Generative topographic mapping; QSAR; Dimensionality reduction; Activity landscape; GTM descriptors	AQUEOUS SOLUBILITY; ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; CLASSIFICATION MODELS; PREDICTION	In this paper we demonstrate that Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM), a machine learning method traditionally used for data visualisation, can be efficiently applied to QSAR modelling using probability distribution functions (PDF) computed in the latent 2-dimensional space. Several different scenarios of the activity assessment were considered: (i) the "activity landscape" approach based on direct use of PDF, (ii) QSAR models involving GTM-generated on descriptors derived from PDF, and, (iii) the k-Nearest Neighbours approach in 2D latent space. Benchmarking calculations were performed on five different datasets: stability constants of metal cations Ca2+, Gd3+ and Lu3+ complexes with organic ligands in water, aqueous solubility and activity of thrombin inhibitors. It has been shown that the performance of GTM-based regression models is similar to that obtained with some popular machine-learning methods (random forest, k-NN, M5P regression tree and PLS) and ISIDA fragment descriptors. By comparing GTM activity landscapes built both on predicted and experimental activities, we may visually assess the model's performance and identify the areas in the chemical space corresponding to reliable predictions. The applicability domain used in this work is based on data likelihood. Its application has significantly improved the model performances for 4 out of 5 datasets.	[Gaspar, H. A.; Baskin, I.

In particular, cells entirely made of metal oxides (MOs) have the potential to provide clean and affordable energy if their power conversion efficiencies are improved. Such improvements require the development of new MOs which could benefit from combining combinatorial material sciences for producing solar cells libraries with data mining tools to direct synthesis efforts. In this work we developed a data mining work-flow and applied it to the analysis of two recently reported solar cell libraries based on Titanium and Copper oxides. Our results demonstrate that QSAR models with good prediction statistics for multiple solar cells properties could be developed and that these models highlight important factors affecting these properties in accord with experimental findings. The resulting models are therefore suitable for designing better solar cells.

A Sensitive and Specific Neural Signature for Picture-Induced Negative Affect	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VENTRAL TEMPORAL CORTEX; SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN MEDIATORS; CARDIOVASCULAR-RESPONSES; PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; DISCRETE EMOTIONS; NEUROIMAGING DATA	Neuroimaging has identified many correlates of emotion but has not yet yielded brain representations predictive of the intensity of emotional experiences in individuals. We used machine learning to identify a sensitive and specific signature of emotional responses to aversive images. This signature predicted the intensity of negative emotion in individual participants in cross validation (n = 121) and test (n = 61) samples (high-low emotion = 93.5% accuracy). It was unresponsive to physical pain (emotion-pain = 92% discriminative accuracy), demonstrating that it is not a representation of generalized arousal or salience. The signature was comprised of mesoscale patterns spanning multiple cortical and subcortical systems, with no single system necessary or sufficient for predicting experience. Furthermore, it was not reducible to activity in traditional "emotion-related" regions (e.g., amygdala, insula) or resting-state networks (e.g., "salience," "default mode"). Overall, this work identifies differentiable neural components of negative emotion and pain, providing a basis for new, brain-based taxonomies of affective processes.

Most traditional readability formulae are based on generalized linear models (GLMs; e.g., discriminant analysis and multiple regression), but these models have to comply with certain statistical assumptions about data properties and include all of the data in formulae construction without pruning the outliers in advance. The use of such readability formulae tends to produce a low text classification accuracy, while using a support vector machine (SVM) in machine learning can enhance the classification outcome. The present study constructed readability models by integrating multilevel linguistic features with SVM, which is more appropriate for text classification. Taking the Chinese language as an example, this study developed 31 linguistic features as the predicting variables at the word, semantic, syntax, and cohesion levels, with grade levels of texts as the criterion variable. The study compared four types of readability models by integrating unilevel and multilevel linguistic features with GLMs and an SVM. The results indicate that adopting a multilevel approach in readability analysis provides a better representation of the complexities of both texts and the reading comprehension process.

It models the point distances to cluster centroids in the transformed Hilbert space associated with the inner product induced by the kernel. The distances are readily computed using the kernel trick. Nested within this kernel-based Gamma mixture model (KMM) are two special cases corresponding to the kernel-based mixture of exponentials and the kernel-based mixture of spherical Gaussians. The Akaike information criterion is used to select an appropriate parsimonious type-of-mixture model for the data at hand. A powerful classification rule based on the knowledge of all point distances to every class centroid is developed based on this model. The flexibility in the choice of the kernel and the probabilistic nature of a mixture distribution makes KMM appealing for modeling and inference. A comparison with other popular classification methods shows that this model is very efficient when handling high dimensional data.

Measures to preserve this species are urgent. Honeybees inhabit several different environments, from swamps to deserts, from high mountains to the African savannah. They are classified into several different subspecies, each one adapted to a particular set of environmental characteristics. The identification of subspecies is based on morphometric features from the entire bee body, but in the last years features from the fore wings have proven to be very efficient for classification. Several methods have been developed to perform the automatic classification through images of bee wings, and geometric morphometrics has been reported to achieve good results in terms of consumed time and reliability of the results. However, there has been no study evaluating the impact of feature selection and new classification methods on the identification performance. We here evaluate seven combinations of feature selectors and classifiers by their hit ratio with real bee wing images. Feature selection proved to be beneficial to all the evaluated combinations and the Naive Bayes classifier combined with a correlation-based feature selector achieved the best results. These conclusions can benefit researches that rely on classification by geometric morphometrics features, both for bees and for other animal species. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a control strategy is considered for dynamically managing power flows in portable HPSSs employing batteries and supercapacitors. Our dynamic power management strategy utilizes the concept of approximate dynamic programming (ADP). ADP methods are important tools in the fields of stochastic control and machine learning, and the utilization of these tools for practical engineering problems is now an active and promising research field. We propose an ADP-based procedure based on optimization under constraints including the iterated Bellman inequalities, which can be solved by convex optimization carried out offline, to find the optimal power management rules for portable HPSSs. The effectiveness of the proposed procedure is tested through dynamic simulations for smartphone workload scenarios, and simulation results show that the proposed strategy can successfully cope with uncertain workload demands.

To increase the effectiveness of treating open-angle glaucoma (OAG), we tried to find a screening method of differentiating OAG from glaucoma suspect (GS) without a visual field (VF) test. METHODS. Data were collected from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) conducted in 2010. Of 8958 participants, 386 suspected OAG subjects underwent a VF test. For the training dataset, five OAG risk prediction models were created using multivariate logistic regression and an artificial neural network (ANN) with various clinical variables. Informative variables were selected by an algorithm of consistency subset evaluation, and cross validation was used to optimize performance. The test dataset was used subsequently to assess OAG-prediction performance using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic. RESULTS. Among five OAG risk prediction models, an ANN model with nine noncategorized factors had the greatest AUC (0.890). It predicted OAG with an accuracy of 84.0%, sensitivity of 78.3%, and specificity of 85.9%. It included four nonophthalmologic factors (sex, age, menopause, and duration of hypertension) and five ophthalmologic factors (IOP, spherical equivalent refractive errors, vertical cup-to-disc ratio, presence of superotemporal retinal nerve fiber layer [RNFL] defect, and presence of inferotemporal RNFL defect). CONCLUSIONS. Though VF tests are considered the most important examination to distinguish OAG from GS, they sometimes are impractical to conduct for small private eye clinics and during large scale medical check-ups. The ANN approach may be a cost-effective screening tool for differentiating OAG patients from GS subjects.

New Statistical Learning Methods for Estimating Optimal Dynamic Treatment Regimes	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Classification; Personalized medicine; Q-learning; Reinforcement learning; Risk bound; Support vector machine	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT RULES; ADAPTIVE TREATMENT STRATEGIES; CLINICAL-TRIALS; INFERENCE; DESIGN; RANDOMIZATION; CLASSIFIERS; PERFORMANCE; SUBJECT	Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) are sequential decision rules for individual patients that can adapt over time to an evolving illness. The goal is to accommodate heterogeneity among patients and find the DTR which will produce the best long-term outcome if implemented. We introduce two new statistical learning methods for estimating the optimal DTR, termed backward outcome weighted learning (BOWL), and simultaneous outcome weighted learning (SOWL). These approaches convert individualized treatment selection into an either sequential or simultaneous classification problem, and can thus be applied by modifying existing machine learning techniques. The proposed methods are based on directly maximizing over all DTRs a nonparametric estimator of the expected long-term outcome; this is fundamentally different than regression-based methods, for example, Q-learning, which indirectly attempt such maximization and rely heavily on the correctness of postulated regression models. We prove that the resulting rules are consistent, and provide finite sample bounds for the errors using the estimated rules. Simulation results suggest the proposed methods produce superior DTRs compared with Q-learning especially in small samples. We illustrate the methods using data from a clinical trial for smoking cessation. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

It directly handles the original data from sensors and determines the condition of the rolling bearing. With proper application of the new technique of shift invariant sparse coding (SISC), it is much easier to recognize the fault. Yet, this SISC, though being a powerful machine learning algorithm to train and test the original signals, is quite demanding computationally. Therefore, this paper proposes a highly efficient SISC which has been proved by experiments to be capable of representing signals better and making converges faster. For better performance, the AdaBoost algorithm is also combined with SISC classifier. Validated by the fault diagnosis of bearings and compared with other methods, this algorithm has higher accuracy rate and is more robust to load as well as to certain variation of speed.

The current clinical and preclinical pipeline for T. cruzi is extremely sparse and lacks drug target diversity. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study we developed a computational approach that utilized data from several public whole- cell, phenotypic high throughput screens that have been completed for T. cruzi by the Broad Institute, including a single screen of over 300,000 molecules in the search for chemical probes as part of the NIH Molecular Libraries program. We have also compiled and curated relevant biological and chemical compound screening data including (i) compounds and biological activity data from the literature, (ii) high throughput screening datasets, and (iii) predicted metabolites of T. cruzi metabolic pathways. This information was used to help us identify compounds and their potential targets. We have constructed a Pathway Genome Data Base for T. cruzi. In addition, we have developed Bayesian machine learning models that were used to virtually screen libraries of compounds. Ninety-seven compounds were selected for in vitro testing, and 11 of these were found to have EC50 < 10 mu M. We progressed five compounds to an in vivo mouse efficacy model of Chagas disease and validated that the machine learning model could identify in vitro active compounds not in the training set, as well as known positive controls. The antimalarial pyronaridine possessed 85.2% efficacy in the acute Chagas mouse model. We have also proposed potential targets (for future verification) for this compound based on structural similarity to known compounds with targets in T. cruzi.

Disconnection of network hubs and cognitive impairment after traumatic brain injury	BRAIN			English	Article						traumatic brain injury; diffusion tensor imaging; betweenness centrality; network hubs; graph theory	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY; CORTEX; COMMUNICATION; REGISTRATION; TRACTOGRAPHY; ARCHITECTURE; DYSFUNCTION; SELECTION; ANATOMY	Traumatic brain injury affects brain connectivity by producing traumatic axonal injury. This disrupts the function of large-scale networks that support cognition. The best way to describe this relationship is unclear, but one elegant approach is to view networks as graphs. Brain regions become nodes in the graph, and white matter tracts the connections. The overall effect of an injury can then be estimated by calculating graph metrics of network structure and function. Here we test which graph metrics best predict the presence of traumatic axonal injury, as well as which are most highly associated with cognitive impairment. A comprehensive range of graph metrics was calculated from structural connectivity measures for 52 patients with traumatic brain injury, 21 of whom had microbleed evidence of traumatic axonal injury, and 25 age-matched controls. White matter connections between 165 grey matter brain regions were defined using tractography, and structural connectivity matrices calculated from skeletonized diffusion tensor imaging data. This technique estimates injury at the centre of tract, but is insensitive to damage at tract edges. Graph metrics were calculated from the resulting connectivity matrices and machine-learning techniques used to select the metrics that best predicted the presence of traumatic brain injury. In addition, we used regularization and variable selection via the elastic net to predict patient behaviour on tests of information processing speed, executive function and associative memory. Support vector machines trained with graph metrics of white matter connectivity matrices from the microbleed group were able to identify patients with a history of traumatic brain injury with 93.4% accuracy, a result robust to different ways of sampling the data. Graph metrics were significantly associated with cognitive performance: information processing speed (R-2 = 0.64), executive function (R-2 = 0.56) and associative memory (R-2 = 0.25). These results were then replicated in a separate group of patients without microbleeds. The most influential graph metrics were betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality, which provide measures of the extent to which a given brain region connects other regions in the network. Reductions in betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality were particularly evident within hub regions including the cingulate cortex and caudate. Our results demonstrate that betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality are reduced within network hubs, due to the impact of traumatic axonal injury on network connections. The dominance of betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality suggests that cognitive impairment after traumatic brain injury results from the disconnection of network hubs by traumatic axonal injury.

For efficient and adaptive learning, this paper introduces online semi-supervised support vector regression (OSS-SVR). The first advantage of the proposed algorithm is that, based on semi-supervised learning framework, it can reduce the requirement on the amount of the labeled training data, maintaining accurate estimation. Second, with an extension to online learning, the proposed OSS-SVR automatically tracks changes of the system to be learned, such as varied noise characteristics. We compare the proposed algorithm with semi-supervised manifold learning, an online Gaussian process and online semi-supervised colocalization. The algorithms are evaluated for estimating the unknown location of a mobile robot in a WSN. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more accurate under the smaller amount of labeled training data and is robust to varying noise. Moreover, the suggested algorithm performs fast computation, maintaining the best localization performance in comparison with the other methods.	[Yoo, Jaehyun; Kim, H.

One of the key requirements for smart city networks is mobility and this is the reason stable, reliable and high-quality wireless communications are needed in order to connect people and devices. Most research efforts so far, have used different kinds of wireless and sensor networks, making interoperability rather difficult to accomplish in smart cities. One common solution proposed in the recent literature is the use of software defined networks (SDNs), in order to enhance interoperability among the various heterogeneous wireless networks. In addition, SDNs can take advantage of the data retrieved from available sensors and use them as part of the intelligent decision making process contacted during the resource allocation procedure. In this paper, we propose an architecture combining heterogeneous wireless networks with social networks using SDNs. Specifically, we exploit the information retrieved from location based social networks regarding users' locations and we attempt to predict areas that will be crowded by using specially-designed machine learning techniques. By recognizing possible crowded areas, we can provide mobile operators with recommendations about areas requiring datacell activation or deactivation.

Nowadays, technological advances have significantly improved our traffic data collection capabilities. Conventional car following models rely on mathematical formulas and are derived from traffic flow theory; a property that often makes them more restrictive. On the other hand, data-driven approaches are more flexible and allow the incorporation of additional information to the model; however, they may not provide as much insight into traffic flow theory as the traditional models. In this research, an innovative methodological framework based on a data-driven approach is proposed for the estimation of car-following models, suitable for incorporation into microscopic traffic simulation models. An existing technique, i.e. locally weighted regression (loess), is defined through an optimization problem and is employed in a novel way. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using data collected from a sequence of instrumented vehicles in Naples, Italy. Gipps' model, one of the most extensively used car-following models, is calibrated against the same data and used as a reference benchmark. Optimization issues are raised in both cases. The obtained results suggest that data-driven car-following models could be a promising research direction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although k-dependence Bayesian (KDB) classifier can construct at arbitrary points (values of k) along the attribute dependence spectrum, it cannot identify the changes of interdependencies when attributes take different values. Local KDB, which learns in the framework of KDB, is proposed in this study to describe the local dependencies implicated in each test instance. Based on the analysis of functional dependencies, substitution-elimination resolution, a new type of semi-naive Bayesian operation, is proposed to substitute or eliminate generalization to achieve accurate estimation of conditional probability distribution while reducing computational complexity. The final classifier, averaged k-dependence Bayesian (AKDB) classifiers, will average the output of KDB and local KDB. Experimental results on the repository of machine learning databases from the University of California Irvine (UCI) showed that AKDB has significant advantages in zero-one loss and bias relative to naive Bayes (NB), tree augmented naive Bayes (TAN), Averaged one-dependence estimators (AODE), and KDB. Moreover, KDB and local KDB show mutually complementary characteristics with respect to variance.

Evaluation of random forest regression for prediction of breeding value from genomewide SNPs	JOURNAL OF GENETICS			English	Article						genomewide SNPs; penalized regression; prediction of breeding value; machine learning methods	GENOMIC SELECTION; REGULARIZATION; MARKERS; MODELS	Genomic prediction is meant for estimating the breeding value using molecular marker data which has turned out to be a powerful tool for efficient utilization of germplasm resources and rapid improvement of cultivars. Model-based techniques have been widely used for prediction of breeding values of genotypes from genomewide association studies. However, application of the random forest (RF), a model-free ensemble learning method, is not widely used for prediction. In this study, the optimum values of tuning parameters of RF have been identified and applied to predict the breeding value of genotypes based on genomewide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), where the number of SNPs (P variables) is much higher than the number of genotypes (n observations) (P >> n). Further, a comparison was made with the model-based genomic prediction methods, namely, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), ridge regression (RR) and elastic net (EN) under P >> n. It was found that the correlations between the predicted and observed trait response were 0.591, 0.539, 0.431 and 0.587 for RF, LASSO, RR and EN, respectively, which implies superiority of the RF over the model-based techniques in genomic prediction. Hence, we suggest that the RF methodology can be used as an alternative to the model-based techniques for the prediction of breeding value at genome level with higher accuracy.

It is widely believed that training a scoring function with low-quality data is detrimental for its predictive performance. Nevertheless, there is a surprising lack of systematic validation experiments in support of this hypothesis. In this study, we investigated to which extent training a scoring function with data containing low-quality structural and binding data is detrimental for predictive performance. We actually found that low-quality data is not only non-detrimental, but beneficial for the predictive performance of machine-learning scoring functions, though the improvement is less important than that coming from high-quality data. Furthermore, we observed that classical scoring functions are not able to effectively exploit data beyond an early threshold, regardless of its quality. This demonstrates that exploiting a larger data volume is more important for the performance of machine-learning scoring functions than restricting to a smaller set of higher data quality.

Significant progress could be achieved by transferring techniques and approaches that have been successfully developed and employed in such fields as terrestrial land cover mapping. One such promising approach is the multiple classifier system, which aims at improving classification performance by combining the outputs of several classifiers. Here we present results of a multi-model ensemble applied to multibeam acoustic data covering more than 5000 km(2) of seabed in the North Sea with the aim to derive accurate spatial predictions of seabed substrate. A suite of six machine learning classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine, Classification Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network and Naive Bayes) was trained with ground-truth sample data classified into seabed substrate classes and their prediction accuracy was assessed with an independent set of samples. The three and five best performing models were combined to classifier ensembles. Both ensembles led to increased prediction accuracy as compared to the best performing single classifier. The improvements were however not statistically significant at the 5% level. Although the three-model ensemble did not perform significantly better than its individual component models, we noticed that the five-model ensemble did perform significantly better than three of the five component models. A classifier ensemble might therefore be an effective strategy to improve classification performance. Another advantage is the fact that the agreement in predicted substrate class between the individual models of the ensemble could be used as a measure of confidence. We propose a simple and spatially explicit measure of confidence that is based on model agreement and prediction accuracy. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This article presents a multi-agent architecture for smart control of space heating and cooling processes, in an attempt to enable flexible ways of monitoring and adjusting energy supply and demand. In this proposed system, control agents are implemented in order to perform temperature set-point delegation for heating and cooling systems in a building, offering a means to observe and learn from both the environment and the occupant. Operation of the proposed algorithms is compared with traditional algorithms utilized for room heating, using a simulated model of a residential building and real data about user behaviour. The results show (i) the performance of machine learning for the occupancy forecasting problem and for the problem of calculating the time to heat or cool a room; and (ii) the performance of the control algorithms, with respect to energy consumption and occupant comfort. The proposed control agents make it possible to significantly improve an occupant comfort with a relatively small increase in energy consumption, compared with simple control strategies that always maintain predefined temperatures. The findings enable the smart grid to anticipate the energy needs of the building.

Artificial Adaptive Systems to predict the magnitude of earthquakes	BOLLETTINO DI GEOFISICA TEORICA ED APPLICATA			English	Article						earthquake prediction; Artificial Adaptive Systems	PATTERN-RECOGNITION; CLASSIFIERS; ALGORITHM	Currently, in the geological studies it is clear that the generation process and the dynamics of development of an earthquake belong to the highly nonlinear and non-stationary phenomena. For this reason, in recent years the authors, experts in the development of mathematical models based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), decided to apply these mathematical models to forecast earthquakes. The aim of this experimental study was to test the capability of advanced ANNs and machine learning to estimate the magnitude of the events recorded daily. Features that describe each event are: origin time (UTC), latitude, longitude, depth, and magnitude. With seismic event means an event between 0.1 and 5.9 magnitude, in the database. We have tested the ANN technology on different data sets: a) USGS data from 1976 to 2002; b) USGS and ISIDe data together from 2005 to 2011; c) ISIDe data from 2005 to 2013. This paper aims at demonstrating as the ANNs are a promising technique for earthquake prediction and as an ANN training on the global data on earthquakes is also much more effective for a local earthquake prediction, than an ANN training on local data. In fact, the results show that the ANNs have very good performances both in functional approximation, than in pattern recognition when the training set represents a sample of worldwide earthquakes: 10% of absolute error of magnitude estimation and about 90% of correct classification (1 of 3 classes) in pattern recognition task. The results using only the Italian ISIDe data set are also promising, although the few information available, but less precise than the previous ones: about 99% of correct predictions for events with M <= 2.0, around 75% for moderate events (2.0<M<3.0), and a rate of correct classification between 30% and 40% with events where M >= 3.0. This last result is not surprising, due to the small number of events with this magnitude available in the Italian data set (ISIDe). These results can also be the starting point for the development of a system based on ANNs to provide the daily estimation of possible future seismic events.	[Buscema, P.

With the advent of cloud-based services, an example use case is that of delivering virtual PCs to users in WAN environments. In this paper, we aim to detect and analyze common user behavior when accessing RDC services, and use this as input for making Quality of Experience (QoE) estimations and subsequently providing input for effective QoE management mechanisms. We first identify different behavioral categories, and conduct traffic analysis to determine a feature set to be used for classification purposes. We propose a machine learning approach to be used for classifying behavior, and use this approach to classify a large number of real-world RDCs. We further conduct QoE evaluation studies to determine the relationship between different network conditions and subjective end user QoE for all identified behavioral categories. Results show an exponential relationship between QoE and delay and loss degradations, and a logarithmic relationship between QoE and bandwidth limitations. Obtained results may be applied in the context of network resource planning, as well as in making QoE-driven resource allocation decisions.
